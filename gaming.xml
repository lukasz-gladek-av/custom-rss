            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Niantic Spatial is the geospatial AI tech company that spun off from Niantic after it <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantic-games-gets-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/">sold its games business and portfolio of titles</a>, including Pokémon GO, Monster Hunter Now, and Pikmin Bloom, to Scopley. Niantic Spatial seemed to be out of the videogames industry, until last night, during the Kojima Productions Beyond the Strand anniversary presentation, Niantic Spatial chief executive officer and Niantic founder John Hanke joined Hideo Kojima on stage to announce a partnership between the two entities to create what seems to be a Pokémon GO-like AR Death Stranding game.</p>



<p>The Beyond the Strand presentation <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">featured several major announcements</a> from Hideo Kojima and Kojima Productions, like a teaser trailer for OD, which we now know is fully titled 'OD: Knock.' We got an update on PHYSINT with a look at the game's key art and heard from some of the actors included in the project. We heard a bit more from the team working on A24's Death Stranding film, and we got to see a trailer for Death Stranding Mosquito, the animated film based on the series, also in the works.</p>



<p>None of those were the things that closed out the show. This partnership with Niantic Spatial closed out the over two-hour presentation, as it seemed to embody the theme of the whole show, which was to look ahead into the future of entertainment and storytelling from Kojima Productions.</p>



<p>Essentially, Kojima Productions will leverage Niantic Spatial's geospatial AI tech to create an AR experience that works with your phone, and also, it seems, your <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-is-developing-dual-display-smart-glasses-to-put-messages-maps-and-more-right-in-front-of-your-eyes/">smart glasses</a>, to enable an entertainment experience wherever you go.</p>



<p>"<em>The collaboration marks a significant moment for both companies and a shared vision to push the boundaries of what's possible in interactive storytelling,</em>" a press release for the announcement reads. "<em>For Kojima Productions, it's a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Niantic Spatial boss John Hanke added, "<em>At Niantic Spatial, we're building a living model of the world that people and machines can talk to, creating a new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction. We are delighted to be working with Kojima Productions to explore what our combined creativity and innovation can accomplish for new and existing fans</em>."</p>



<p>Overall it seems like an interesting idea for sure, and definitely not out of bounds for the kind of thing Hideo Kojima could envision and conceptualize. Whether it'll actually work as a game or as a software product that people will use and spend money on is a different matter, since we've currently no idea on how this experience is meant to come together.</p>



<p>"<em>To give just a wild example, it's like the real Death Stranding in the real world</em>," Hideo Kojima said on stage via a translator. "<em>And you could connect with people, or you could connect with the actual environment there in your city. Previously, it was like, virtual reality, but this time I'm thinking more about connecting with the real environment.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-franchise-rewards-program</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonys-new-franchise-rewards-program-isnt-quite-what-it-sounds-like.1305300/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a brand new rewards program by the name of Franchise Rewards, and while it pledges to reward you for your in-game achievements with real goodies, things are a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>The new program was revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/ghost-of-tsushima-players-can-now-unlock-special-ghost-rewards-merchandise-for-purchase/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, in which director Katie Lennox describes it as "a new merchandise program that celebrates your in-game achievements with special collectibles". Franchise Rewards kicks off with the&nbsp;<em>Ghost&nbsp;</em>games, starting with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>To qualify for the program, you'll need to have earned one or both of two trophies: the Gold trophy Mono no Aware and the Platinum trophy Living Legend. Having these trophies gets you "access to a selection of limited-edition merchandise".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-t-shirt.jpg?itok=XyNHrTBY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-t-shirt.jpg?itok=1aXcua6i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How would you like the opportunity to buy exclusive Sony merchandise?</figcaption></figure><p>A quiet alarm bell might be ringing in your head as you read those words, and you're right to heed it: this program only allows you the right to buy certain new merchandise, not to get it for free if you earn these trophies.</p>

<p>Obtaining the Mono no Aware trophy, which you can get just for completing&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>'s main story, will get you "access" to the corresponding Mono no Aware T-shirt, for which you'll have to cough up an additional $30, plus shipping.</p>

<p>Achieving the Living Legend trophy, meanwhile, which requires you to have obtained all other&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>trophies (and that's no mean feat), will allow you to buy a special commemorative pin for $25. Again, that's without shipping factored in.</p>

<p>Of course, if you have both trophies, then Sony will gracefully allow you to give the company more of your money for both pieces of merchandise. Hey, don't say Sony never does anything nice for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-pin.jpg?itok=CWk1Gi2X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-tsushima-franchise-rewards-pin.jpg?itok=17V4Oyqs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to earn the right to buy this pin? You'll have to spend a heck of a lot of time with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you do want to grab either of these items, you'll need to earn their corresponding trophies by December 31st this year. If you're playing on PC, you'll need to have linked your PlayStation account for Sony to recognize your achievements.</p>

<p>Sony says that these&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>goodies are "just the start", which sounds vaguely threatening. The Franchise Rewards program will continue with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">October's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>, for which more "unique merchandise" will apparently be released.</p>

<p>The announcement of Sony's Franchise Rewards initiative comes after the company announced it would shut down the PlayStation Stars loyalty program <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-playstation-stars" rel="nofollow">back in May</a>, although I'm not sure too many people will see this as a worthy replacement. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p><span>One of the many consequences of the incredibly dystopian descent into fascism America is experiencing right now is that these motherfuckers have access to the internet and think their heinous acts of terrorism are memeable capital-C Content. Someone particularly evil over at the Department of Homeland Security posted a pretty vile video showing ICE, cops, border patrol officers, and military agents arresting dozens of people…and they set it to the original </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>theme song from the ‘90s.</span></p> <p><span>The video was posted to the Department of Homeland Security’s social media channels on September 22 and shows multiple arrests and searches, including clips of armed squads using explosives to get into closed buildings and groups of people being rounded up, all while either blurring or obscuring the faces of both the people being arrested and the officers themselves. If that wasn’t weird enough, the footage includes interstitial cuts of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>protagonist </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> throwing Poke Balls, with the “joke” being that he’s “catching” these various criminals. To really lay it on thick, the video concludes with mock-ups of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> trading cards featuring several of the people arrested, which include mugshots, descriptions of their alleged crimes, a flag from their respective home countries in the background, and a description of where and when ICE arrested them. Oh, and they’re all “weak” to ice-type attacks.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gotta Catch ‘Em All. <a href="https://t.co/qCvflkJGmB">pic.twitter.com/qCvflkJGmB</a></p> <p>— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) <a href="https://twitter.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>A lot of these people are being accused of some pretty significant crimes, which is the kind of picking and choosing you do when you’re trying to obscure the fact that ICE has routinely </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/26/immigration-ice-raid-andrea-velez"><span>picked up innocent people, including legal U.S. citizens</span></a><span>. The memeification of propaganda is revolting, but people aren’t falling for it. The comments on the video are full of people tagging The Pokémon Company and Nintendo, both of which are known for their </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124"><span>litigiousness in copyright disputes</span></a><span>. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation is being added to a bunch of existing and upcoming PC games, including ANANTA, the free-to-play anime GTA-like open world game we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ananta-really-looks-like-anime-gta-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered</a> earlier today with the latest TGS 205 gameplay trailer. Naked Rain's ANANTA will launch with built-in support for DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation and ray traced reflections to augment the visual quality. NVIDIA also shared a video previewing its technologies in action in the game.</p>



<p>Taking a step back, Reikon's sci-fi first-person shooter game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/990380/METAL_EDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">METAL EDEN</a> (the new game from the makers of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ruiner-you-played-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RUINER</a>) launched earlier this month with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Now, the NVIDIA app lets you override Super Resolution to use NVIDIA DLSS 4's latest transformer model, and you can also bump Frame Generation to Multi Frame Generation (x3 or x4). </p>



<p>Last week, the cooperative survival horror game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2141730/Backrooms_Escape_Together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Backrooms: Escape Together</a> (currently in early access) was updated with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction. The game already supported  DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLAA.</p>



<p>Though the game's official launch date is set for Thursday, September 25, Silent Hill f launches today for users who pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition. The game includes NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution support. In our review, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>At 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and the settings above, the game ran at an average of 116 FPS, 59 1% Low on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) in a benchmarking session held in Ebisugaoka at the start of the game, right after the first attack of one of the Fog Monsters, which are, all around, pretty decent results, considering the performance cost Lumen generally has. With the game running as expected on my system, tweaking the settings, especially the lighting setting, the rendering resolution, and the upscaler setting (TSR and FSR are available besides DLSS) should be more than enough for most users with a relatively modern machine to run the game smoothly.</em></p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater also launched with just NVIDIA DLSS SR, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-users-add-lumen-rt-dlss-4-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was rather easy to add</a> NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, and Lumen RT. Perhaps the same will happen with Silent Hill f.</p>



<p>Next month, Frontier Development will launch Jurassic World Evolution 3, a new installment in the management and construction simulation game based on the popular movies. Jurassic World Evolution 3 will offer day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and ray traced effects.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-review-a-brilliant-return-to-form-for-legendary-jrpg-series.1305270/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All great and epic adventures begin with a magical yet compelling story that captivates audiences for years to come. This narrative is certainly applicable to Falcom's epic fantasy JRPG,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em>, which, after a 21-year-long wait, fans and new players alike can experience in this game's remake,&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>.</p>

<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> has been remade from scratch on its more advanced game engine for modern audiences and hardware, but it never loses its fantastic story with a few new additions and optimizations for a more complete experience. Suffice to say, revisiting its original game and playing the remake demo before delving into the full game made reviewing&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>&nbsp;a more rewarding and worthwhile experience long after the credits roll.</p>

<h2><em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em> Review - Starting At The Beginning Again</h2>

<p>Video game remakes and remasters have become quite prominent in recent years as they attract both returning players for yet another magical in-game experience, while welcoming new audiences to their world. While at times, most of the game's remake remains the same from its story, intriguing characters, and gameplay systems, much of its upgrades boil down to updated modern graphics, introducing new quality-of-life improvements to enhance our gaming experiences, fix mistakes that weren't possible, and implement a few new tweaks for a more complete offering.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_461_young_joshua.jpg?itok=tVa9PHuA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_461_young_joshua.jpg?itok=HWJsURqB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>As much as there's plenty of mystery surrounding future events, what do we know about Joshua and his past? (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This sentiment is quite true for developer Falcom, as they've finally brought a more polished and complete offering of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, a remake of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-to-get-into-trails-series-nihon-falcom" rel="nofollow">the Trails series</a>' first entry,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em>, 21 years after its initial release. Admittedly, not having the pleasure nor distinction of being introduced to this legendary JRPG series, the journey and moments experienced with its remake became more profound after first experiencing the original release on PC and then the remake's demo before immersing oneself in what can be viewed as one of the most faithful remakes in quite some time.</p>

<p>Granted, time was not on one's side when experiencing both&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em> and&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, but this little side adventure exploring its original release before revisiting the kingdom&nbsp;of Liberl became a good choice to make consciously. The story of&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> remains the same as its original release, albeit with a few new quality-of-life improvements, balance changes, and other new content reimagined for modern hardware.</p>

<h2>Welcome Back Home, Bracers!</h2>

<p>As with all great stories, we start at the beginning with one of our protagonists, Estelle Bright, a doting yet energetic young girl awaiting the arrival of her father, Cassius, and following his return, her father introduced her to a young, injured boy of the same age as Estelle. The game's events officially begin with its Prologue Chapter, now set five years later, and both Estelle and the&nbsp;young, injured boy named Joshua are now 16 years old and training to become bracers, a "peacekeeping guild" tasked with serving all the people across its world by assisting with various jobs, much like their father.</p>

<p>However, Cassius had some news to share with his children as he got called out to a pressing matter to attend to, departing Rolent aboard an orbal ship which mysteriously goes missing along with its passengers some time later. This stressful news prompted Estelle, Joshua, and&nbsp;Scherazard to begin and lead a separate investigation into its disappearance in a neighboring city, where the strings slowly start to unravel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_536_estelle_shocked_face.jpg?itok=WvuhBOZA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_536_estelle_shocked_face.jpg?itok=5aCAxIF9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We're thinking the exact same thing, Estelle! (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The siblings learns of a&nbsp;conspiracy that threatens the peace of this kingdom, and the discoveries Estelle and Joshua uncover could ultimately change their lives forever. Through game progression, Estelle and Joshua will have opportunities to explore the remaining regions, and as such, meet new acquaintances, accept more jobs, gain more in-field experience as bracers, acquire recommendations, and unravel mysteries surrounding their father.</p>

<p>New improvements, balance changes, and optimizations were included in&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>; however, one new improvement made was to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xseed-explains-trails-in-sky-localization-changes" rel="nofollow">the localization</a>, an issue many players had with the original game leading up to the remake's release. However, having played through the game with English voiceovers, they will be happy to learn that this isn't an issue, especially having played&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes VI: Trails in the Sky</em> before jumping into the remake and boasting a talented voice cast that provides incredible performances and yes, evoke a myriad of emotions or make you even more annoyed with them.</p>

<p>The game's mini-map also saw some notable tweaks that make it easier for players to track quest markers, pinpoint Treasure Chests, and indicate enemies within their vicinity. The world map also received much-needed changes by adding more Points of Interest, such as city locales, quest events, and side quests, which are clearly displayed in both the mini-map and world map changes, improving navigation as a whole, and not making it an annoyance to bear.</p>

<h2>Combat Is An Orbment Of Time (And Fun)</h2>

<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> offers players a more seamless approach to combat as they can opt between&nbsp;turn-based and real-time combat, and can be finetuned by choosing their preferred difficulty on how they wish to engage with the story and combat. Real-time combat&nbsp;is best utilized against single&nbsp;and common enemies, especially while traveling in the overworld, without ever entering into&nbsp;turn-based combat, and regarding the latter, this is more prevalent during the main story and side quests or against larger and imposing enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_574_orbment_setup.jpg?itok=lRCsm79W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_574_orbment_setup.jpg?itok=79Y9GXru 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Orbment system menu where players can slot Sepith and Quartz to empty slots to enhance their character's stats, passive effects and more. (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>As with most turn-based games, once entering the turn-based combat mode, a timeline will appear on-screen which gives information on the turns of each party member and enemy, which can be altered thanks to a myriad of abilities, buffs, and debuffs inflicted. For example, specific attacks that apply the Delay effect prevent enemies from attacking on their turn, which is present in tactical abilities, S-Crafts, and Quartz equipped for certain characters like Joshua and his Flicker ability, thus manipulating the timeline and giving the party an advantage over their enemies.</p>

<p>Now, one key component to the remake's combat is the Orbment system, which was introduced when playing the original game and was somewhat confusing to understand at first, despite the original game doing its best to explain Orbments. Nevertheless, an Orbment is a mechanical device that allows players to equip Sepith and later Quartz to empty slots and imbue them with orbal energy, and once activated, it grants the particular character to utilize unique orbal abilities, acquire bonus stats, and passive effects that can be useful in combat.</p>

<p>As every party member will get their base level increase through progression and gain increased stats, equipment pieces like armor and accessory items also provide this, like increased defense and arts defense. Similarly, weapons and their upgrades increase the equipped character's strength and arts strength stats to deal more physical and non-physical/magical damage, which can contribute to building their party members.</p>

<p>For example, Agate can be built to deal more physical damage and can absorb incoming enemy attacks, so building him with the best synergistic orbments to provide increased physical damage, and adding some defense to make him a tanky character. In comparison, Joshua is very agile in combat, so he'll require orbments and equipment pieces to buff his speed to inflict damage and debuffs onto enemies very quickly.</p>

<h2><em>Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_563_drunk_schera_olivier.jpg?itok=cRqVpEgd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails_in_the_sky_1st_chapter_screenshot_563_drunk_schera_olivier.jpg?itok=OmF5_IzA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Over two decades is certainly a wait for developer Falcom to finally reimagine one of their most legendary entries in the Trails series. (Picture: Falcom / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>21 years is quite certainly a wait for the first entry in the Trails series to receive a massive update, and&nbsp;during the review process, there was very little to nitpick about&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> aside from the occasional latency bugs in cutscenes, which one that occured was in Chapter 1 before speaking with General Morgan and again in another cutscene when Olivier sang his tune both at the&nbsp;at Haken Gate location. Likewise, as faithfully recreated as&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is, and adding new voicelines, gameplay improvements, and balance changes, it doesn't add new quests for returning players to explore, which is rather unfortunate.</p>

<p>But regardless of a few things to nitpick about,&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is significantly longer than the original game, according to <a href="https://www.gamer.ne.jp/news/202508090001/" rel="nofollow">a report from Japanese publication Gamer</a>. In fact, this is due to the addition of more exploration, as players will spend more time exploring areas, completing all the main story, event, and side quests, as well as paying attention to the voiceover lines, which helped eliminate some text bloating from the original game.</p>

<p>However, the time spent with both the original game and its remake was a worthwhile experience, as the remake was well-executed in being a more polished and enjoyable entry in the Trails series and a great choice to introduce new players. It's obvious just how much love went into developing&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, as there's something for everyone to enjoy, and the end product is a brilliant remake that wears its heart on its sleeve and is truly earnest in its origins in the best way possible.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-spinoff-palfarm-aims-to-provide-a-more-relaxing-and-cozy-adventure.1305264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>, a cozy spinoff of the creature-collecting survival game that promises to offer a more relaxing and cozy spin on the original game's premise.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4031890/view/539991294395549848" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>, or something very much like it, was something that "many players requested" following the initial release of <i>Palworld</i>. That game's fans told Pocketpair they wanted "a more relaxing and cozy adventure" in the&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>...erm, world.</p>

<p>Pocketpair says that after "thinking it over for a few months", the idea for&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>was born. It won't be developed by the core&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>team; instead, a new team of developers will be working on the game, although it'll still be a Pocketpair project rather than a third-party endeavor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palfarm-fishing-palworld-spinoff.jpg?itok=k4zLoqll 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palfarm-fishing-palworld-spinoff.jpg?itok=XJE01kPg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>is the cozy&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>adventure you may have been asking for since the original game's launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If you were somewhat put off by&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s violence, then&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>might be the game for you. It promises to show a "more peaceful" side of the game's world, so hopefully, no Pals will be forced into slavery or killed for meat here.</p>

<p>You'll be moving to an idyllic island populated by Pals, and alongside your new friends, you'll till fields, cook delicious recipes, and craft new items, all to "build the farm of your dreams", according to Pocketpair.</p>

<p>Pals all have unique abilities, each of which can help you on your farm in different ways; some Pals might be able to help you with crop harvesting, for instance, while others are dab hands (or flippers, or paws) at watering.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a cozy game, you can also meet up with the local residents and give them gifts to build your relationship with them, and Pocketpair says you "may discover unexpected, special stories unfolding".</p>




<p>It's not all peace and love, though; you will also be called upon to "defend your farm from some nasty Pals that come to wreak havoc", so it seems Pocketpair hasn't completely shaken its bloodlust with&nbsp;<em>Palfarm</em>.</p>

<p><em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>might not even be the only&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>spinoff currently in development; there's also&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">dating sim that might be an elaborate April Fools' joke</a>. I'm not sure if I'd rather it was or it wasn't.</p>

<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>also comes just a week or so after Pocketpair announced that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 1.0 update <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-10-2026-surprises-2025" rel="nofollow">will launch in 2026</a>, bringing lots of new goodies with it.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Palfarm&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam right here</a> if you want to. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I have too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, there are enough cables circling around by night stand that it’s beginning to look like some sort of cyberpunk bird’s nest. Of course, this is my own fault. I can just get a charging stand such as this MagSafe one from Anker which will eliminate my electronic clutter entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/"> It’s normally set at $111, but thanks to a 46% limited time discount, it’s now down to just $60. You save a whole $52 for the duration of the sale.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Apple</h2>
<p>This Anker MagSafe charging stand is built from the ground up for modern Apple products. Newer iPhones, AirPod cases, and Apple Watches all support wireless charging and this stand has three wireless chargers built in. Each are specifically made for either phone charging, watch charging, or earbud case charging.</p>
<p>Be sure to check which model iPhone and AirPods you have as earlier versions don’t support wireless charging. So long as you have an iPhone 12 or later model, you’ll be good to go on that front.</p>
<p>Charging is fast enough for what the stand is going for. It’s capable of 15W charging. You can find much faster charging options when going with something wired, even within the Anker family of products. However, this is really an end-of-the-day sort of charging stand. When you turn down for the night, and set up all your devices on it, they’ll be fully charged by morning, no problem. That said, it can still bring an Apple Watch Series 9 to nearly 50% in just 30 minutes.</p>



<p>While you have your iPhone charging on the stand, it can be set to display the charging status of the other devices you have charging as well as a clock display. Perfect for your night stand to catch the time at a glance, head still on your pillow.</p>
<p>Anker’s has a safety-first design philosophy on its products and we have the same story here on the MagSafe multi-device wireless charger. ActiveShield tech monitors temperatures over three million times per day to help ensure your phone and other devices don’t overheat.</p>
<p>There are two color options available. Choose either black or white. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. Get it now for $51 off for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4245/">That brings the price down from $111 to just $60. You can get the black for $71 at the moment.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> is rife with overpowered builds that use what developer Gearbox has described as “unintended interactions” to cause massive damage, even to the game’s toughest bosses on the hardest difficulties. The most infamous of these is 'the knife,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-its-prioritizing-the-first-round-of-buffs-over-patching-out-instakill-knife-builds-but-it-will-eventually-address-unintended-interactions">which Gearbox has said it’s aware of but won’t nerf just yet</a>. Now, there’s another new best boss melting build to add to the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NickTew" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTuber NickTew</a>, who had led the charge online with his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/abuse-it-while-you-can-borderlands-4-has-an-infinite-damage-build-so-broken-it-kills-bosses-in-seconds">knife build discovery</a>, set out to "nerf proof" their Vex in light of Gearbox’s comments about potentially stamping out knife builds. In doing so, he found a way to cause so much damage from a single clip of a gun's magazine that Borderlands 4 spat out a "total existence failure" message in the boss health bar — something I had no idea even existed in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://youtu.be/b6Ery-UaQHA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a>, NickTew had to slow down the gameplay just to be able to show this ‘total existence failure’ message in action, so quickly did the boss’ health disappear.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/23/screenshot-2025-09-23-132656-1758630426664.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">YouTuber NickTew managed to cause a Borderlands 4 boss "total existence failure!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The interaction requires you have a gun with the Torgue Licensed Sticky Magazine and the Taser alt-fire mode. A Torgue Sticky mag enables the weapon to fire sticky projectiles called "gyrojets" that attach to enemies and explode for massive damage upon reloading or switching modes. In this case, switching to Taser.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew demonstrates how you can load an enemy up with gyrojets via an SMG due to its fast rate of fire and big magazine, then right before reloading, switch to the underbarrel taser, causing the gyrojets to explode and cause much more damage than they would if reloading normally. As NickTew put it, with this build you’re able to “snap the boss out of existence.” This works on every character, and it does not involve using the knife. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only issue here is an SMG with this specific combination (Torgue Sticky and alt-fire) is a relatively rare find, so you’ll need to do a spot of farming to nab one. Or perhaps you have one anyway, sitting in your inventory just waiting to cause havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew isn’t entirely sure why this combination causes so much damage. Is it a bug, or are there calculations going on under the hood that spark this huge uptick? It certainly feels like one of Borderlands 4’s “unintended interactions,” so it’s probably not long for this world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, Gearbox indicated that in the short-term it plans to buff underperforming gear and skills rather than nerf overpowered builds. That means instakill builds like this one are safe for now. Confirmation came from Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins, who <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1970315557460398462" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to social media</u></a> to acknowledge the debate about what he called “builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife. We’re not going to act on those immediately, instead, we’re looking at our first round of buffs. Those will get addressed but we’re going to start with underperforming gear/skills first.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no timeframe for Borderlands 4’s next patch, but we know some more of what the studio is working on. PC performance improvements are a “top priority,” the studio has said. A Field of View (FOV) slider is on the way to the console versions, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 console players are also keen for a patch to address <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-tech-experts-say-resetting-the-game-every-hour-should-really-not-be-an-expected-solution-for-players-patch-cannot-come-soon-enough"><u>some glaring technical problems</u></a>. Last week, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X. As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new video published to YouTube</u></a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has acknowledged the problem on social media, promising incoming improvements. As a workaround, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-performance-gets-worse-the-longer-you-play-on-console-randy-pitchford-suggests-quitting-the-game-and-restarting-as-a-workaround"><u>Pitchford suggested console players quit Borderlands 4 and restart</u></a>.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/87dab74b79173/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 has been a huge deal since it launched, and at last night's Japan Game Awards, the console was recognised for its monumental achievements so far.</p>
<p>Nintendo's latest hardware took home the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award at the 2025 ceremony. It's a long and somewhat confusing title, but the basic gist is that it's an award given to an individual, production team, organisation or project that has notably contributed to the games industry in recent years.</p>
<p>For reference, the award was previously picked up by the likes of the PlayStation in 2024 and FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki in 2022. Nintendo has also seen its fair share of these awards in the past, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/the-famicom-just-won-an-award-at-the-tokyo-game-awards-2023">Famicom</a> collecting the prize in 2023, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a> team nabbing it in 2020, and the Switch dev team picking it up in 2018.</p>
<p>Switch 2 producers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki (who you'll recognise from the console's reveal Direct) were on hand to accept the award — not dressed in their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/random-did-you-notice-this-snazzy-switch-2-reference-in-the-devs-direct-outfits">subtle Switch 2 suits</a> this time, unfortunately.

              <p>Anti-piracy measures, as a rule, suck. But when they’re funny, they get a pass. <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>for the Nintendo 64 falls into the latter category. As revealed by chronicler of <em>Mario</em>-related oddities Supper Mario Broth (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros/if-you-play-a-pirated-super-smash-bros-exactly-69-times-on-n64-nintendos-sneaky-anti-piracy-measure-will-lull-the-illegitimate-user-into-a-false-sense-of-security-and-trap-you-as-mario-forever/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>), the game&nbsp; will eventually lock you into being able to play only a single character, but only after you’ve played the game 69 times. Dude.</p> <p>I’m so adorably naive that I didn’t even realize pirating N64 games was an option back in the day. Of course, in 1996 when dial-up internet was a newborn baby, this wasn’t a case of downloading ROMs from the internet, but rather buying knock-off N64 cartridges from that dodgy-looking stall at the flea market. As a rule, when the game’s name was written on the cartridge in Sharpie, or it featured a black-and-white version of the sticker but with the writing in German, it probably wasn’t wholly legit. And it seems that if that’s the version of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> you bought in ’99, it was trapped.</p> <p>As Supper Mario Broth puts it, the anti-piracy measure here was “delayed action,” allowing the player to boot the game an enormous 68 times before anything would happen. Then, on the 69th time of playing, you’d suddenly find yourself locked in to only being able to play as Mario.</p>    <p>Funnily enough, Nintendo’s devilish trick here gets close to one of the very few actually effective anti-piracy measures to have been used: when a game lets you play it for so long before popping up a message saying, “Hey, you pirated this! We hope you enjoyed it so far, and if you want to carry on, buy a copy here.” Treating pirates as potential customers has proven lucrative for many indie projects over the years, while draconian systems based on hardware locks, disc requirements, and game-slowing software used by AAA publishers have only ever punished legitimate purchasers, with all such restrictions inevitably removed from the pirated versions.</p> <p>And yes, it’s very unlikely Nintendo picked 69 for comedy reasons, but I still like to believe.</p>

                <p>As part of the Beyond the Strand event celebrating 10 years of Kojima Productions, the Japanese developer and the original creator of Pokemon Go announced a "new technology partnership" that aims to "redefine immersive entertainment."</p><p>Like with Kojima's Death Stranding series, much remains shrouded in mystery about this new project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKyj6CDUH64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKyj6CDUH64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"For Kojima Productions, it's a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world," reads a line from the announcement.</p><p>Niantic Spatial is the new name of the Pokemon Go creator, which is now focusing more directly on AI and geospacial technology. The Pokemon Go development team and the game itself, meanwhile, were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">sold to Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>Kojima said his games today "exist on screens" but working with Niantic will allow the studio to "unleash those experiences into real-world experiences."</p><p>"I'm excited to collaborate on creating experiences where you can climb real mountains while finding entertainment there, and connecting with real friends. I'm excited that we can create these new experiences together," Kojima said.</p><p>During Beyond the Strand, Kojima said (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-working-on-an-ar-walking-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) that this new experience will be "like the real Death Stranding, in the real world, where you can connect with people or connect with the actual environment there in your city."</p><p>Niantic boss John Hanke, meanwhile, said the company is now working on a "living model of the world that people and machines can talk to." This could allow for a "new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction," Hanke said.</p><p>To promote whatever this new experience is, Kojima Productions commissioned a live-action video called "A New Dawn" that stars actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9582703/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zane Haney</a> and was written and directed by Ei Uehara and Corey Finn.</p><p>Also during the Beyond the Strand event, Kojima Productions released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">new teasers for the Xbox-published game OD</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/physint-first-look-at-hideo-kojima-new-project-teases-stealth-and-feelings/1100-6534932/" data-ref-id="1100-6534932">Sony-published game Physint.</a> Kojima also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-announcement-is-a-credit-card/1100-6534937/" data-ref-id="1100-6534937">announced a credit card.</a></p>

<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 1 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159070/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>EA’s football series has had a turbulent time on modern Nintendo consoles, as any long-time Nintendo Life reader will doubtless already know.</p>
<p>When the Switch got its first entry in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_18">FIFA 18</a>, this very reviewer pointed out that it was essentially a port of the Legacy Edition on Xbox 360 and PS3 at the time, which is why it was missing all the modes from the current-gen versions. Still, EA had ditched Nintendo consoles since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/fifa_13">FIFA 13</a> on the Wii U, so many of us were at least happy to see it on Switch in the first place, and hoped EA would build on it in the years to follow.</p>
<p>Infuriatingly, EA would instead proceed to release basically the exact same game on Switch – new kits and rosters aside – for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_19">FIFA 19</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_20">20</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_21">21</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_22">22</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_23">23</a>, meaning no fewer than six near-identical annual games all based on that Xbox 360 Legacy Edition of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/fifa_17">FIFA 17</a>. It was already out of date in FIFA 18, so by the time it reached 23 (with Switch now on its fifth Legacy Edition of a Legacy Edition) it had gone beyond a joke, hence my somewhat contentious 2/10 review <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/fifa-23">on this very site</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 2 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159076/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, work your way through all those reviews — all written by me, as some sort of annual Nintendo Life punishment ritual — and you’ll see the spiral of a man initially happy that EA football had returned to a Nintendo system but eventually plunging into despair and anger when it became clear it was just churning out the bare minimum each year.</p>
<p>Remarkably, this changed when the FIFA series changed its name to EA Sports FC. With a new title came a new beginning, and — for the first time since the GameCube era — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">EA Sports FC 24</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">25</a> the following year) finally gave Nintendo players full feature parity with their Xbox and PlayStation counterparts. It had come too late in the console’s life to undo some damage — Ultimate Team was a ghost town after years of neglect — but it was finally ‘proper’ FIFA. Sorry, I mean proper EA FC.</p>
<p>Now it’s time for the series to make the jump to Switch 2, bringing with it the ultimate question. Has EA opted to do the same as it did on Wii U and Switch and give early adopters a bare bones experience again, or has it finally learned the lessons of the past and delivered a fully-featured football game at the first time of asking? Mercifully, it’s the latter.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 3 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159074/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>EA Sports FC 26 on Switch 2 has every mode you’ll find in the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. That means every new feature, from the two new gameplay presets — Authentic for more realistic football and Competitive for faster passing and smarter keepers — to the improved Manager Career mode with its live challenges and unlockable Icon players.</p>
<p>The latter is a brilliant new addition, because until now Manager Career has usually involved picking your favourite team and just putting them through league after league, getting stagnant after a while. The new Live option gives you a bunch of shorter scenarios to choose from — such as starting with a 20-point deduction and having to escape relegation while making $20 million in transfers before a set date — which gives you an excuse to keep coming back and trying out new situations.</p>
<p>It also means the perennially popular Ultimate Team mode gets all the new features this year too, including the return of Tournaments and the new Gauntlet mode, where you play through a series of matches but aren’t allowed to use the same player twice, meaning squad depth comes into play.</p>

<p>It’s on the pitch where the most divisive decision can be found, so let’s get it out of the way first. When EA moved from FIFA to EA Sports FC and finally updated the game on Switch, it also shifted over from that ancient Xbox 360 engine to the Frostbite engine. The result of this was the Switch version dropping from 60 frames per second to 30, to accommodate the new engine’s update in visual quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ea-sports-fc-25">Last year’s review</a> of EA Sports FC 25 on Switch hoped that by making the jump to Switch 2 this would be fixed, bringing the game up to a full 60fps on Nintendo’s new console. Alas, that hasn’t happened yet, meaning this new Switch 2 offering still only runs at 30fps.</p>
<p>I know this will be a dealbreaker for some, and if you’re one such player, then I suppose this is where your review ends. For those still with me, it’s worth pointing out that the drop from 60 to 30 for the Switch 2 version may obviously affect the visuals but doesn’t really affect the gameplay. EA FC has never really relied on twitch controls because momentum is taken into account, meaning every pass, shot, and turn has always taken place after the button is pressed anyway.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 5 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159072/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who puts hundreds of hours into the Xbox Series X version of the series every year, the game doesn’t appear any less responsive on Switch 2 than it is on Microsoft’s console. Of course it doesn’t look as smooth because it’s running at half the frame rate, but I can still play it just as well on Switch 2</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s those who regularly play the series on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, and are likely to jump between those versions and the Switch 2 version, who’ll notice the frame rate more. If you’ve been playing on 60 and you’re suddenly forced to drop to 30, the difference will be jarring. It really does only take a couple of matches to get used to, however, and the generally slower pace of a football game — as opposed to, say, a racing game — means the frame rate may be disappointing but it’s certainly not disastrous.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the frame rate drop is to keep the game stable while maintaining visual quality, which it definitely does. Put it side by side with the other consoles and you’ll obviously see they’re not like-for-like, though Switch 2 really does a good job of maintaining visual detail. Player faces are great, the kits are nice and sharp when you zoom in on them, and all the pre-match animations (including fans arriving outside the stadium and the manager giving the team talk in the dressing room) are here too.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 6 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159078/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are even some smaller details in there that EA could have been forgiven for ditching to keep things running smoothly, but still manages to include. The most obvious example is mascots, which are new to this year’s game on other formats and are present and accounted for here. It could have been easy for EA to drop this frankly unnecessary addition and claim the Switch 2 version could have done without it, but play as Celtic in Celtic Park and you will indeed see the glorious sight of Hoopy the Huddle Hound prancing around at the side of the park, getting in the way of the supporters sitting in the front row.</p>
<p>More concerning is the menu system, which is really starting to creak and strain. After years of having more and more new features dumped on it, these menus are already janky on more powerful consoles, but on Switch 2 the Ultimate Team UI is so clunky that it froze up a few times during my initial team set-up and I had to reboot the game. I’m hopeful that this will be addressed in a future patch, but until then be warned that while responsiveness isn’t an issue off the pitch, it’s certainly lacking off it.</p>
<p>Other limitations aren’t directly EA’s fault this year, though they may still be the result of the previous years of neglect Switch owners got when the series was known as FIFA. Ultimate Team, while wonderfully fully featured on Switch 2, simply doesn’t have the community it does on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 7 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159075/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is most obviously felt when trying to find a match online on Switch 2. Because the gameplay engine isn’t identical on Nintendo’s console, crossplay understandably isn’t possible, but whereas it’s easy to find a match within a split second on other consoles, I had to wait a minute or so to find another Switch 2 player. This will hopefully get better when the Standard Edition launches, but it’ll still be a vastly smaller player pool than the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC crossplay community.</p>
<p>One thing that theoretically should be possible but isn’t yet is a fully shared transfer market on Ultimate Team. PlayStation and Xbox users have a shared transfer market which means there are often tens of millions of players and cosmetic items listed for transfer. Once again this year, Nintendo players are left with their own separate transfer market, which at the time of writing only has 13,550 items for sale, meaning far less choice and — due to the lack of multiple listings meaning less need for competitive pricing — the need to spend more coins on specific players.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 8 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159079/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It would be even more of a dream to allow for cross-save, meaning you could play your Ultimate Team or Manager Career on PlayStation or Xbox at home (to take advantage of the better visuals), then load it up on Switch 2 and continue it on the go. Instead, each version of the game is its own standalone thing, meaning you have to start from scratch and have a completely different campaign running on each console.</p>
<p>Take all of this into account and the bottom line is still that EA Sports FC 26 is the new best ever Nintendo football game (don’t worry though, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/iss_64">ISS 64</a>, you’ll always be my main love). The wishlist of improvements for next year is clear: if EA can offer some sort of performance mode which allows for 60fps gameplay, and find a way to tap Switch 2 users into the same shared Ultimate Team transfer market used on other consoles, you’d be looking at a near-flawless Nintendo version of the game.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, it’s still a fantastic football game with hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found across its numerous modes, unmatched authenticity, and engaging control on the pitch. Once you’re used to the frame rate, it’s an absolute joy to play on handheld, and while the game engine isn’t 100% identical to other formats, it’s far and away the closest thing we’ve had yet to getting ‘proper’ EA FC on the move.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 9 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159071/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, there isn’t much competition on Switch 2 yet anyway — Konami’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/efootball">eFootball</a> continues to be conspicuous by its absence — so EA Sports FC 26 was always going to be the default choice regardless of its quality. It’s a relief, then, that EA didn’t take advantage of this fact by phoning in a half-hearted port like it did so many times on Switch, and has instead started as it hopefully means to go on this time with a fully-featured version from the get-go that gives Nintendo owners the respect they deserve.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>EA's Switch 2 football debut is a night-and-day difference from its half-hearted Switch one, setting a great precedent for the future of the series. EA Sports FC 26 delivers a fully-featured version of the game, and while it only runs at 30fps and has a gated-off Ultimate Team mode which doesn't tap into the series' larger crossplay community, it still plays a fantastic game of football and offers more game modes than you'll ever know what to do with.</p></section>

              <p>Hideo Kojima’s&nbsp;<em>OD</em> finally has its first trailer, and yes, of course, it’s entirely cutscene, but oh my word, what a cutscene. You’ll oscillate between “Good grief, I can’t believe this is the Unreal Engine and not real life,” and “Oh god, what the fuck is that?” throughout its three minutes.</p> <p>During Kojima Productions’ tenth-anniversary celebrations, Hideo Kojima finally revealed some moving images of his forthcoming horror game <em>OD</em>, a project he’s co-creating with horror maestro Jordan Peele. What we get is an incredibly tense scene in which the perfectly rendered hands of Sophia Lillis (<em>It</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>) attempt to light a whole mess of candles. It’s tense because of far too many sounds, from Lillis’s own terrified breathing, the ambient sounds of adjacent apartments, and that infernal knocking at the door.</p>  <p>By the end, whoever was knocking clearly ran out of patience and let themselves in. We see the sinister, shadowy figure over Lissis’s shoulder (and note the face-shaped scars all over her own face), its thudding footsteps unnervingly slow, as it whispers demonically. Then, in case you were wondering if everything was going to be OK, it grabs for her and she screams. After the titles we cut back to see vast, grey hands clutching Lissis’s face in a truly iconic image.</p>

 <p>Which is all lovely and scary! It, of course, tells us precisely nothing whatsoever about the game, other than that it’ll feature baby-shaped candles and be dreadfully frightening. There are so many horror elements taking place at once here, from the worms crawling out of a candle in writhing bundles to the awful image of the cartoonish baby-faced candle melting to reveal its wick, accompanied by the noises of a real baby screaming nearby. Oh, and the tall, awful demon-thing—I’m yet to be convinced he’s a good guy.</p> <p>At the live event, there was all sorts of empty bluster about how the game will change the very fabric of reality, perhaps requiring that humanity once again reset the yearly clock to a new&nbsp;<em>After OD</em> era, while not actually saying anything at all about what happens in the game. Microsoft’s Phil Spencer declared it “truly visionary” while Kojima, modest as ever, added “this is totally different, even as a system.” But best was Kojima’s declaration that as he travels all around the world scanning spooky locations for the photorealistic game, “I want to scan a ghost for the first time, and I want to get an award for that.” Good luck with that.</p> <p>Still, the trailer is freaking cool.</p>

<p>Arriving on Switch next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you cast your mind back to the early days of the Switch eShop, before the storefront was swamped by slop and rip-offs, you might recall <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_chef_brigade">Battle Chef Brigade</a> — a weird fusion of cooking sim and action RPG all wrapped up in a sweet anime-inspired art style. It was a lovely little game from developer Trinket Studios, and what do you know, the team is back with something that looks equally intriguing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_suit_aces">Battle Suit Aces</a> is a sci-fi RPG that mixes the bold visuals of old-school mech anime with some particularly deep-looking card combat. It boasts the same visual style as its predecessor and another interesting mash-up of gameplay styles</p>
<p>Arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th October</strong>, Battle Suit Aces will see you assemble a rag-tag team of space explorers and set out into the stars in search of 'Relic Suits' — those big mech-like guys promised by the title. There's a certain visual-novel-ness to how the story unfolds, and you can catch up with your team between missions by preparing meals or hanging in communal areas — hello? <strong>Persona</strong>? — but the missions themselves look to be the big selling point.</p>
<p>The game's card-based combat appears to be full of tactical potential, as you put together a frontline of mech pilots, each with their own abilities and goals. Cards can be moved around to target more foes or swapped out for different objectives, and you'll build up your deck with even more hunky anime action heroes as you progress through the story.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots from developer Trinket Studios:</p>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/battle-suit-aces-switch/">North American eShop</a> for <strong>$24.99</strong>. It'll be arriving at a particularly stacked time for Switch releases, but may end up being one to watch for those after a slice of something different.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">a solid Soulslike with some interesting gameplay mechanics</a>, but performance issues at launch made it difficult for many - including myself - to enjoy the game at its best. Thankfully, developer Lenzee Games has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-acknowledges-performance-issues-patch-coming/">actively addressing these issues</a>, with the latest 1.06 patch introducing major VRAM optimization and performance improvements on PC.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/500584162306031816?l=english">1.06 patch</a>, which is around 5.3 GB big, adds the Deluxe Edition Expansion Content in all versions of the game while fixing several PC-specific issues, such as an issue that caused the visuals to be extremely blurry using NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Performance mode at certain screen resolutions. In addition, the new patch further optimizes VRAM usage, improving both performance and stability. This is an extremely important improvement, as it will allow those running GPUs with low VRAM capacities to have a much better experience. Even those with more powerful GPUs with more VRAM will notice the performance improvement, which are estimated to be up to 12% better than in the launch version on a midrange system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5600x CPU and an RTX 3070 GPU in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@S2GamesBench">S2Games Bench</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers - Patch 1.6 - VRAM usage reduced and 12% fps increase over launch version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWpsfYBjSjw?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Performance issues are not unique to WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, as it is one of the many recent games powered by Unreal Engine 5 suffering from performance issues. While Borderlands 4 enjoyed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">a successful launch</a>, it is heavily impacted by poor performance, requiring players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-optimized-settings-40-performance-imrpovement/">adjust graphics settings</a> even on high-end systems for better performance before Gearbox delivers the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">promised improvements</a>. Silent Hill f, by contrast, is a rare example of a UE5 title running smoothly (albeit at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-720p-360p-ps5/">low internal resolution on PS5</a>), with only minor stutters that do not impact what <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">I consider one of the finest survival-horror games released this year.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed Palfarm, a new farming spin-off whose cheeky compound title implies the possibility of countless other Palspin-offs, from Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/train-simulator">train Simulator</a> to Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">netenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.
</p>
<p>
It appears to be a Palworld version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, with players alternating between tending crops, mining the caves, battling wildlife, and bonding with the local NPCs. As in vanilla Palworld, you can capture Pals with different abilities and set them to work on tasks like sowing and watering. Here's a trailer.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-farming-spin-off-revealed-just-11-days-after-nintendo-announced-pokemon-equivalent-pokopia">Eurogamer</a> note, all this follows swiftly after the reveal of Nintendo's new Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, which also involves farming. Nintendo are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">suing Pocket Pair for alleged patent infringement regarding the Pokémon series</a>, which makes the announcement of Palfarm a bit like playfully tweaking the genitals of an enraged Pyroar while it's trying to bite your head off.
</p><p>
You can read more about Palfarm on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It appears to be retaining Palworld's viral blend of whimsy and parodic cruelty. "On this island with its changing seasons, a relaxing farm life with Pals awaits!" chirrups the description. "Of course, eating your own Pals is absolutely out of the question!" 
</p>
<p>
Later, there is mention of killing off Pals in the wilderness, because "after all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way" and "sometimes what you reap might be red". Congratulations, Pocketpair, you have triangulated the secret callousness of the videogame concept of "farming".
</p>
<p>
There's multiplayer, and a town with a commercial area and a hidden black market. The black market appears to be run by a pipe-smoking blaggard with a very large revolver. You can play Russian roulette with him, seemingly. You can also push snowballs to make them bigger, and get married. No release date yet.

                <p>The console wars have reached a point where it's no longer uncommon for some of the biggest Xbox games to get a cross-platform release on PS5. A small handful of PlayStation 5 titles have also gone to Xbox Series X|S. But if you were hoping that meant games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> were next in line for Xbox releases then you might be disappointed.</p><p>A user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nmmvlt/horizon_zero_dawn_coming_to_xbox/?share_id=FOpL6AxDrIyGryTk06DAx&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> found a listing for Horizon Zero Dawn on the German Xbox Store. And it's not the only Sony title to appear there. Unfortunately, as pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nmmvlt/comment/nfeiai3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by other Reddit users</a>, this appears to be an indexing mistake by Google rather than Microsoft. Even some Nintendo games are listed on the Xbox Store because of that error.</p><p>Regardless, porting games from PS5 to Xbox Series X|S may not be a bad idea. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">worked wonders for Helldivers 2</a>, and dramatically driven up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">the number of players in the game</a>. In short, it made Helldivers 2 an even bigger hit. Sony also shares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-comments-on-deal-to-bring-mlb-the-show-21-to-xbox-and-game-pass/1100-6489820/" data-ref-id="1100-6489820">MLB The Show</a> with other platforms thanks to agreements made with Major League Baseball. However, Sony is under no such obligation to bring any of its top franchises to the competition.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox Studios has seemingly opened the flood gates for games that were formerly exclusive titles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> was recently released on PS5, following in the footsteps of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft hasn't put all of its AAA games on PS5 yet, but it's no longer out of the question for franchises like Halo to eventually make the leap as well.</p>

            <p>Former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has criticised Microsoft's recent price hike of Xbox consoles in the US, stating "console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues".</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">Microsoft announced the price increase</a> and blamed "changes in the macroeconomic environment", though didn't mention tariffs specifically.</p>
<p>Still, Ybarra - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-corporate-vice-president-mike-ybarra-announces-departure-from-microsoft-after-20-years">left his position as corporate vice president of Microsoft's gaming division in 2019</a> - responded to the assumption in a post on social media, adding "the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse."</p>
<p>In a later response, Ybarra added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">previous price increase in May</a> was justified due to the rise in tariffs at the time, but that's not the case with this new rise.</p>
<p>"An excuse to continue raising prices, with no new increase in tariffs, is simply a different problem," he said, "and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>This price hike only affects consumers in the US, which is why tariffs have been seen by some as the primary reason.</p>
<p>Now, an Xbox Series X costs $649.99 (or $599.99 for the digital version), while a Series S costs $399.99 for the 512MB model and $449.99 for the 1TB model.</p>
<p>Despite the "changes in the macroeconomic environment", Microsoft reported an 18 percent boost in revenue at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">latest earnings call</a>, with Xbox Game Pass making almost $5bn in annual revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-price-of-ps5-ps5-digital-and-ps5-pro-in-the-us">Sony also announced a price hike for its PS5 consoles in the US</a> back in August, with the base PS5 costing $549.99, the digital edition costing $499.99, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> costing $749.99.</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, Epic launched its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Delulu mode with proximity voice chat, but already "thousands" have been banned for toxicity and hate speech.</p>
<p>The new mode sees players starting out solo, but able to join squads by chatting with nearby players. Players will need to have voice chat set to "Everybody" and won't be able to hide their display name while playing.</p>
<p>In theory, Delulu is a fun twist on the no-build battle royale formula, but in practice it's fuelled bad behaviour that's resulted in "thousands" being banned over the weekend, according to the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908">official Fortnite Status social media account</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, Epic seems to have expected this, with the account's pinned post detailing how players can report in-game conversations.</p>
<p>The mode has resulted in some amusing and heartwarming interactions. Here's one pacifist player strumming a guitar in an attempt to make in-game friends.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nnx5py/playing_guitar_in_delulu_last_night/">Playing guitar in Delulu last night</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asymmetricalsoul/">u/asymmetricalsoul</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Yet a thread titled "My fellow ladies: How’s Delulu" details the experiences of women in the new mode (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-banned-thousands-this-weekend-as-proximity-voice-chat-mode-delulu-launches-to-big-player-numbers-but-widespread-reports-of-griefing-and-abuse">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>It includes misogyny, hateful speech, and women being purposefully targeted by men. "It's been terrible for me so far," wrote one player. "I've been playing solo and there hasn't been one game where I haven't been told horrendous things I don't wish to repeat. I just want to have fun and enjoy the game."</p>
<p>Some posts are recommending female players don't speak, which is unfair and defeats the purpose of the mode.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmom8n/my_fellow_ladies_hows_delulu/">My fellow ladies: How’s Delulu</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kilr_Queen75Xx/">u/Kilr_Queen75Xx</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Sadly, this is often the experience when women play games online with voice chat. A report from September last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-thirds-of-female-players-still-report-being-harassed-when-playing-online">claimed two-thirds of female players report being harassed when playing online</a>. And when Call of Duty added proximity chat to its online modes, reports of misogyny were rampant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/look-out-for-number-1-in-fortnite-delulu?lang=en-US">Fortnite Delulu will return</a> this weekend, from 26th September until 29th September. It's unclear if it's set to become a permanent addition to Fortnite, but is there more Epic could be doing to protect players?</p>
<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-new-daft-punk-experience-but-no-the-duo-arent-getting-back-together">Daft Punk music experience was announced for Fortnite</a>.</p>

Kojima Productions have shared a new trailer for OD, their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>. Unlike last night's melancholy breadcrumb of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/physint">Physint</a> coverage, this reveal actually has substance. It looks a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a>, Hideo Kojima's much-mourned teaser for his cancelled Silent Hills project, inasmuch as the game appears to be first-person, and the trailer is set in some kind of menacing residential building. The whole video is pervaded by the fear of something trying to get in, as expressed by the title "Knock". You can watch it below, unless you're too <em>scared</em>.

<p>
Are you too scared? I'm sorry to make light of your perfectly reasonable desire to avoid sources of tension and alarm. Here, allow me to transcribe. We see through the eyes of a young woman played by Sophia Lillis, as she enters a windowed room with rain and trees beyond. There are some institutional-looking chairs - perhaps this is another horror game sanitarium? - and a small makeshift altar by one window, with a bunch of mismatched candles and an eerie post-it of a staring eye. Some of the candles look like distressed babies. The babies recall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, though none of them are in jars. Lillis begins lighting candles using a matchbox emblazoned with the word "MISSING" and a drawing of an airplane.
</p>
<p>
The play environment also puts me in mind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a>. Sorry, I skipped over a bit in my description above: let me flashback about 60 seconds. There's an opening scene of a big red ornamental door with smaller arched portals carved into it, and a miniature sealed double doorway at the top with gold foil flourishes. Unlike the door in Silent Hill 4, this door isn't chained shut.
</p><p>
Somebody slides a red greeting card through the jamb with a nightmare drawing of a face on one side, consisting mostly of eyes. On the other side there is an instruction to "light fires" and "celebrate" something blurred out. Also, some vaguely alchemical imagery. Other, partly redacted trailer text refers to rituals, curses, a 3D scan of a building, and direful events ten years ago.
</p>
<p>
Skip forward again to Lillis lighting candles. There's a knock at the door behind her. She carries on lighting candles. The knocking intensifies. Lillis lights a candle that resembles a baby's screaming head, and it goes all crimson and icky. The unseen door opens. Lillis is seriously not keen on whatever is coming through the door, which she refuses to look at. The trespasser sounds damp and slithery. The eye on the post-it opens wide. Then, we switch to a head-on view of Lillis gurning tearfully. The Thing looming behind her grabs her head, and we fade to black. How very OD.
</p>
<p>
I do enjoy these parts of the KojiGame reveal cycle, when the marketing deals however showily in symbol and metaphor. The elusiveness was part of P.T.'s charm, and inevitably, I begin to worry about how the developers might spoil things by unredacting the backstory and reducing the eyes, the baby candles, and the door made of doors to pieces of characterisation and world-building.</p>
<p>Despite having literally just written a piece <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-comes-the-feeling-promises-kojima-in-latest-maddening-tease-for-metal-gear-like-physint">whining that Kojima Productions haven't told us much about Physint</a>, I am now going to hope that they don't share too much about OD. I know, I am a creature of both presumption and contradiction. That's <em>me</em> knocking at the door, except I can't work out whether I really want to come in.
