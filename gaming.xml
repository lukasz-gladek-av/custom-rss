<p>What's that? Huh?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>What's that, huh? Well, it's a new commercial for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> from Nintendo, and rather than the usual overenthusiastic voiceover to explain basic features, we've instead been treated to a weird, albeit quite wonderful rap song.</p>
<p>Yes, this is one of those ads things that will either go down in history as one of the best things Nintendo has ever put out, or perhaps one of the worst. We'll let you be the judge of that. At the very least, it's bringing back memories of the DK Rap from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, and that can only be a good thing in our book.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, we'd love to see this featured on primetime TV between episodes of Eastenders or Corrie. Just imagine Eastenders ending on the biggest cliffhanger ever and then <em>boom</em>, Kirby rap. Cinema.</p>
<p>It's all good fun, and we'll take it. Kirby Air Riders is launching on Switch 2 on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>, and you can once again get your hands on it this coming weekend with the Global Test Ride. This features Lessons, Air Ride, and City Trial game modes with multiple playable characters and vehicles.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-is-making-microsd-cards-the-next-game-cartridges.1353616/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck changed the way I buy and play games. Just like how the Nintendo Switch blew me away with how it let me play the latest and greatest Nintendo games on the go and on a TV, the Steam Deck has drawn me in with how it offers a vast catalog of PC games that I can play portably or on a big screen. And with the Steam Deck’s microSD card slot, I can add a lot more storage just by tossing in a tiny memory card, meaning I can bring even more games around with me on the device.</p><p>But with its new Steam Machine PC and Steam Frame VR headset, Valve is about to make any microSD cards you use with the Steam Deck even more useful. Like the Steam Deck, both of those devices also run Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS operating system, and both have microSD card slots, too. So if the microSD card you’ve plugged into your Steam Deck is formatted for SteamOS, any games you’ve stored on it will be immediately visible by the Steam Machine and Steam Frame as well.</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">Steam Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/816118/valve-steam-frame-vr-headset-streaming-arm-steamos-hands-on">Steam Frame</a> launch in early 2026, this microSD card support means you’ll be able to take the devices out of the box, slot in your microSD card from your Deck, and start playing most of your games without having to download them again. There might be differences in how well games play across the three devices because of their different specs. But many games will probably work well on all of them, meaning you’ll be able to drop your microSD card into whichever device you want to use and just start playing.</p><p>Basically, your microSD card will almost function like an old-school game cartridge, but instead of it being limited to one piece of hardware or one single game, you can easily bring as many games as can fit on the card to whatever SteamOS PC you’re using at the time.</p><p>However, Valve is only building UHS-I card readers into these devices. UHS-I is <em>slow</em> compared to state-of-the-art microSD or internal SSDs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/15/23761845/pc-games-ssd-minimum-specs-starfield-cyberpunk-2077">They may not be able to keep up</a> with every game you want to play, even if most will load fine. Meanwhile, Nintendo has already moved on to supporting the much faster microSD Express format with the Switch 2 (though has arguably also taken a step back by introducing Switch 2 cartridges that are a “key” and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">don’t actually contain games</a>).</p><p>“SD cards are notorious for having low performance, but from our testing and our experience, they actually work really well,” Valve hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat told <em>The Verge</em> while showing us the Steam Machine at Valve’s headquarters. “For most people, the option makes the most sense, in our opinion.</p><p>When we asked to clarify the spec of the microSD reader, Aldehayyat added, “What we’re trying to emphasize here again is we really want the Steam Machine to be a really easy, super convenient device” that you just plug in, sign into, and start playing games on.</p><p>It’s a key part of what makes Valve’s new hardware feel like part of a cohesive ecosystem, and it could be an important advantage as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/818622/valve-console-wars-price-sony-microsoft-nintendo-windows">enters the console wars</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/818602/valve-steam-deck-machine-frame-microsd-card-game-cartridges]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The rough beast that is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has cracked its shell and slouched towards the wincing light of day. They've released it, I mean. No verdict from us yet: our reviewer is still picking their way among the exploding motorbikes and mocking spectres of deceased Nicaraguan terrorists. But I can at least tell you with some confidence that if you're a fan of pausing games or mid-mission checkpoints, you might want to give it a miss.</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-campaign-cannot-be-paused-by-solo-players-has-no-checkpoints-and-requires-an-online-connection-at-all-times">Eurogamer</a>, neither pausing, nor mission checkpoints, nor playing the game offline are allowed in the new Blops, thanks in part to its heavy focus on four player co-op play. You cannot look away from Blops anymore: it has become the Eye of Sauron, transfixing you from across the coffee table as it zooms to flaming close-up. Your time belongs to the cod! It sleeps with the fishes. Damn, I could see a mafia-themed Call of Duty set in Mordor, actually. It doesn't sound like it would be wholly out of synch with the endgame, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-launch-day-patch-notes-are-basically-gun-speed-dating-and-its-endgame-is-a-big-fight-in-map-soup">entangles maps from Blopses gone by</a>. Collage Of Duty, they definitely aren't calling it.</p>
<p>This isn't the first Call Of Duty campaign to be always-online. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-missed-that-the-black-ops-6-campaign-is-always-online-but-fortunately-its-not-too-late-to-throw-a-wobbly">Black Ops 6 went there too</a>, and that game sold like hot yellowcake uranium, so clearly a significant proportion of you aren't fussed. Still, no mission checkpoints?</p>
<p>There are other and more pressing reasons to no-sell the new Call Of Duty. It's being published by Microsoft, who like buying studios for billions and then laying loads of people off, and who continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">do business</a> (despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-block-israels-access-to-azure-and-genai-tech-used-to-surveil-millions-of-palestinian-phone-calls-according-to-report">individual divestments</a>) with armies who have participated in what the UN has formally termed a genocide. We did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">a big report</a> on protests against the company's Israeli military connections earlier in the year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="426">Spring cleaning is too far away. You need to stay on top of it all year long. Tidying up once a week keeps things manageable, and with the right tool, it doesn’t have to feel like a chore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, Amazon has the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for a whopping 55% off, dropping the price from $600 down to just $270.</a> That’s a $340 savings — not bad for one of the best vacuums in the game.</p>
<p data-start="428" data-end="887">The Dyson V9 Motorbar is designed to make cleaning easier and actually kind of satisfying. Weighing in at just 4.6 pounds, it’s lightweight, ergonomic, and easy to maneuver around the house. Whether you’re tackling the floors, reaching up to dust the top of your curtains, or squeezing into tricky corners, this thing moves effortlessly with you. It works on just about any surface from hardwood and tile to carpet and transitions smoothly between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="889" data-end="1212">Need to clean a tight area? The Dyson V9 can quickly transform into a handheld vacuum, making it super versatile. You can take it outside to clean your car, tidy up the couch, or get crumbs out of those hard-to-reach crevices in the kitchen. It’s powerful enough for the big jobs yet compact enough for the quick ones.</p>
<p data-start="1214" data-end="1546">Since it’s cordless, you won’t have to deal with the constant unplug-replug routine as you move from room to room. The rechargeable battery gives you up to 40 minutes of run time, which is more than enough to handle most homes. Once you’re done, just dock it on the wall-mounted charger and let it power back up for next time.</p>
<p data-start="1548" data-end="1756">Emptying the bin is simple too. No need to get your hands dirty; just pull the release handle over a trash can, and the bottom pops open to drop out all the debris. It’s quick, clean, and easy.</p>


<h2>Hassle-free Hair Control</h2>
<p data-start="1758" data-end="2078">And if you’re dealing with pets (or just a lot of hair), the Dyson V9 Motorbar really shines. It includes a hair screw tool with a clever conical design that prevents long hairs from getting caught, wrapped up around the brush. That means less maintenance and more effective cleaning on pet beds, car seats, stairs, and couches.</p>
<p data-start="2080" data-end="2274" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been putting off cleaning because it feels like too much work, maybe it’s time to get a vacuum that actually makes it easy.. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, the Dyson V9 Motorbar is more than half off, sitting at just $270 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

The arrival of agents Dialyn and Banyue from the Krampus Compliance Authority introduces not only new allies to the battlefield, but perhaps new judgment agendas as well.</p><p>With the assistance of the Krampus Compliance Authority—a TOPS-affiliated enforcement organization tasked with disciplinary oversight—the Proxies successfully averted a disaster beneath Timesworn Hill and glimpsed deeper mysteries waiting within Yidhari’s dreamscape. Fleeting visions revealed the figures of Sarah and Ye Shiyuan together—an unexpected sight, given that the senior member of Yunkui Summit is not thought to be involved in the conspiracy of the Exaltists and their Creator. Meanwhile, his younger sister, Ye Shunguang, now ascended as the new master of the Qingming Sword, joins the Proxies to embark on a journey to uncover the truth. As the Miasma recedes, the old mining site buried a decade ago resurfaces, hinting at new dangers and unseen forces stirring once more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1006882"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Amid the shifting order and chaos, two agents join the fray. Dialyn, an S-Rank Physical Stun Agent from Krampus brings her experience as a cheeky customer service specialist to the battlefield. Using two unique resources, Customer Complaint and Positive Review, she excels at stunning enemies while calling up teammates to directly unleash their Ultimate abilities in combat, amplifying the team’s damage. Banyue, an S-Rank Fire Rupture agent and a revered martial arts master, has fused countless techniques into a combination style of immense power and splendor. His combat technique relies on alternating Adrenaline and Wrathful Fires to sustain his continuous actions and fluid combos, rewarding players who master his rhythm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Two new Bangboo companions also join the battlefield in Version 2.4. Birkblick from Krampus features a multifunctional sensor array that transforms into a floating cannon during combat, scanning and bombarding targets with energy blasts. Meanwhile, the cheerful Bild N. Boolok wields a massive block hammer to smash enemies.</p><p>Beyond these new arrivals, Version 2.4 also welcomes back Agents Hugo (Attack – Ice) and Ellen (Attack – Ice). The beloved Bangboo auto chess event also returns with new upgrades—now featuring PvE special stages and offering exclusive rewards, including a free Bild N. Boolok. Meanwhile, the event Lightstream Notes invites players to enjoy New Eridu alongside Ye Shunguang, discovering fleeting moments of lightheartedness amid the deepening shadows.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,793 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.3 special program below.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-videoverse-switch-miiverse-inspired-visual-novel-is-beautifully-human.1353586/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160495/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Video games are good. The internet is <em>good</em>. Sometimes, it’s hard to remember that nowadays, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> — the second visual novel from Kinmoku — is determined to remind us of the impact of online communities and the relationships we forge through playing video games. It’s also the most accurate depiction of online life in the mid-2000s I’ve ever played.</p>
<p>The year is 2003 and Emmett is a 15-year-old German kid who loves his Kinmoku Shark, a fictional games console that is essentially a desktop Nintendo DS. He’s playing Feudal Fantasy, a game recommended to him by one of his online friends. He also spends a lot of time on Videoverse, an online social platform akin to something like MySpace or ye olde message boards; think Steam, but cooler with pixel art avatars and two-tone colour schemes.</p>
<p>The majority of the game takes place in Videoverse, where Emmett chats with his friends about games and users post messages and <strong>Miiverse</strong>-like doodles. Here, you can respond to messages, ‘like’ drawings, and DM your friends.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160488/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game beautifully allows you to foster a positive environment by choosing how you respond. These responses can lead to small quests that you can follow in the background. But even when there was a chance to be a little meaner, it always felt <em>wrong</em>. I couldn’t bring myself to put down a stick-man drawing at any point. Why should I? I know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of nasty comments online.</p>
<p>But Videoverse doesn’t shy away from the sour side of the internet; after all, the Shark is an ageing console, and with an upgraded model (the Dolphin) on the horizon, the devs slowly start to pull away from Videoverse. As a result, moderation starts to slip, and hateful messages, ranging from homophobic insults to ableist comments and lewd drawings, trickle through. A space once considered safe to so many, where they could proudly proclaim their sexuality or escape from real-life troubles, suddenly becomes toxic and hostile. Tempers bubble over, anxieties flood the art pages, and relationships fray.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/4913/embed @ 1763125204 -->
<p>It’s scarily accurate, and you can see just how that side of the online world has exploded over the past two decades. But Videoverse remains emphatically positive in the face of hate: I reported every nasty message I saw, and I always tagged other players and lifted them up when they felt down. Kindness is always the right thing to do here, and the writing is beautifully accurate to the 2003 time period. I was (and still am) a liberal smiley face user back in the mid-2000s — though there was a bit more XD and ^_^; than (: — but it’s all here in Videoverse, complete with typos and abbreviations.</p>
<p>Along with the writing, the general aesthetic goes such a long way to selling the nostalgia of the era. The interface is all 1-bit with bold colours (and changeable themes you unlock by commenting and reporting), customisable avatars, and lo-fi music that clearly evokes old gaming lobbies and chill spaces. Special shoutout goes to the incredible Feudal Fantasy animated cutscenes that help frame the entire narrative, too.</p>
<p>Sadly, navigating Videoverse on Switch can be a little cumbersome. You can use buttons or touchscreen, but both have drawbacks. Moving a cursor around the screen with the analogue stick is sluggish and fiddly; sometimes it disappeared mid-conversation, while other times it was distracting. The touchscreen is better, but it's so easy to select the wrong option or accidentally skip dialogue as you click through options.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160492/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But Emmett’s central relationship with a brand new user, Vivi, who attracts his attention thanks to her fantastic art, is the central story here, and it's strong enough to pull you through any input irritations. The two form a friendship which starts off awkward and shy but blossoms into something affirming. I had a friendship just like Emmett does with Vivi, though it was with someone I knew in real life. We spoke almost exclusively through MSN Messenger (remember that?) despite living in the same town and going to different schools, but we’d write stories together, talk about life, what we were reading, listening to, playing…I miss it</p>
<p>It's for this reason that Vivi’s character and her relationship with Emmett hit me the hardest. Not knowing whether you’ve upset someone, said the wrong thing, or not knowing what's going on in someone's life that you care about is heartbreaking, and the game captures that perfectly. The writing is already excellent throughout, but it’s between these two where it truly delivers, shining yet another light on what community and video games can really do for people.</p>
<p>Do I wish some of Emmett's other relationships had that same depth? A little! MarKun666, for instance, is the Feudal Fantasy fan; Emmett and him have met in real life and are close, always encouraging each other and having fun. But it rarely goes beyond that. Zalor, meanwhile, is having trouble with his online girlfriend Tifa-Chan, and by the end it feels like that whole situation gets swept under the rug.</p>
<figure><a title="Videoverse Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160491/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But that’s a part of life, right? People move on, and sometimes you never find out what happened to those you spent hours chatting with or reading posts from. I’ve lost contact with many friends I’ve made online, and it’s a scary reminder of the ephemerality of the digital world. But those connections <em>can</em> last outside of that space, and — most importantly — their impact certainly does.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t be where I am today without those hours-long chats on Messenger. I wouldn’t have a job writing about video games if I hadn't played <strong>RuneScape</strong> online or discussed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tales_of_symphonia">Tales of Symphonia</a> with like-minded strangers on message boards. The internet may feel like a black hole of hate and AI-generated content in 2025, and the games industry is rife with layoffs and accusations of workplace abuse, but I cling to the hope and the human relationships I’ve formed in both of these spaces. Behind every avatar is a human, and Videoverse clings to that very same notion.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Videoverse is a perfect time capsule of early online communities, never shying away from difficult topics and always approaching them with a smile. Its nostalgic wrapping works wonders for Millennials who grew up with a mouse or console in hand and who have made friends online.</p>
<p>While I wish there were a few more chats with other characters, and the Switch may not be the <em>best</em> place to experience it due to input frustrations, Videoverse is a tonic for the soul that the online world needs now more than ever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on the social network BlueSky by Gematsu, the GRAC (Game Rating and Administration Committee), the South Korean game rating board, has officially rated <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?c7b8077c36ff1119491eb25bd5560ffba6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pragmata</a> and <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?f0d05826089a46822d078e3eb6681337a6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is a Dead Man</a> today.</p>



<p>The first one is CAPCOM's new science fiction intellectual property. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in June 2020, ahead of the release of the new consoles (Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox SerieS and X), Pragmata was scheduled to launch in 2022, but it received several delays. Just when fans had nearly lost hope of ever playing it, the third-person action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced this June with a gameplay trailer</a> and the promise of a 2026 launch window. We later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got to play the game</a> at Gamescom 2025, and CAPCOM later <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-isnt-secret-mega-man-game-says-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed the fan speculation</a> that it was a 'secret Mega Man game'.</p>



<p>The GRAC rated the game for ages 12 and up with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>An action adventure game about the protagonist 'Hugh' and the android 'Diana' joining forces to defeat enemies and return to Earth.</li>



<li>Mild violence (battles hostile robot/AI forces using weapons).</li>
</ul>



<p>Romeo Is a Dead Man is also a sci-fi action/adventure game, although it is developed by Grasshoppers under the luminary guidance of Goichi Suda, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/romeo-is-a-dead-man-interview-with-suda51-when-back-to-the-future-and-fbi-shows-unite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed at Gamescom 2025</a>. Those familiar with Suda51's games will know his games generally include mature themes, and indeed, the GRAC prohibited the game to minors with the following description:</p>



<ul>
<li>A sci-fi action adventure game in which the protagonist, Romeo Stargazer, becomes an FBI space-time special agent, Deadman, and chases down wanted criminals who travel across time and space due to time paradoxes.</li>



<li>Excessive violence (attacks using various weapons, frequent large amounts of blood, and various expressions of bodily harm.</li>



<li>Specific expressions of vulgar profanity and vulgar language (use of vulgar profanity and vulgar language such as “F<em>ck,” “Shit,” “F</em>ck,” “F*cker up,” and “Motherfucker”)</li>



<li>Excessive expressions that induce fear and disgust (creation of a terrifying and disgusting monster and atmosphere, expressions of blood and bodily harm that induce disgust).</li>
</ul>



<p>More than the ratings themselves, though, there's the fact that the GRAC usually rates games only when they are close to their scheduled launches. This year, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rated</a> four months in advance of its debut, for instance, and the same happened to <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-remaster-version-gets-rated-by-south-korean-game-rating-and-administration-committee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good and Evil Anniversary Edition</a> in 2024.</p>



<p>In all likelihood, then, both Pragmata and Romeo Is a Dead Man are launching in the first half of 2026, and their definitive release dates could be announced very soon, possibly at the upcoming The Game Awards event. CAPCOM is gearing up for an explosive calendar year, between <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> (out on February 27, 2026), Pragmata, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gamescom-hands-on-preview-two-heavens-as-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, which is likely coming in the latter half of 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-3rd-gen-apple-watch-se-dropped-to-as-low-as-200-ahead-of-black-friday-2000644155</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-watch-se-3-drops-far-lower-than-amazon-usually-goes-during-early-black-friday-even-though-it%E2%80%99s-newly-released.1353577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="586">If you’ve been thinking about hitting the gym more consistently or finally trying to get better sleep, there’s one simple secret to success… tracking your progress. Data doesn’t lie, and it’s one of the best ways to actually measure improvement and stay motivated. Whether you’re looking to crush your fitness goals or figure out what’s messing with your sleep, having a smartwatch that keeps tabs on your habits can make all the difference. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">Right now, Amazon’s running a deal on the Apple Watch SE (3rd Gen), making it a solid opportunity to upgrade your routine for less cash.</a></p>
<p data-start="588" data-end="925">Normally priced at $249, the 40mm Apple Watch SE is now 20% off, bringing the total down by $49 to just $200. If you prefer a slightly larger display, the 44mm model is also part of the sale. It’s usually $279, but the price has been slashed by $50, which means you can grab it for only $230 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="927" data-end="1260">For those who want to stay connected without carrying their phone everywhere, the cellular versions unfortunately not part of the discount. The 40mm cellular model is still sitting at $299, while the 44mm cellular model is hanging back at $329.</p>
<p data-start="1262" data-end="1568">The third-generation Apple Watch SE comes with an OLED Retina display that’s bright and clear, even under direct sunlight. With up to 1,000 nits of brightness, your screen stays easy to read whether you’re checking your pace when out on a run or glancing at notifications while getting a workout in at the gym.</p>


<h2>Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2068">When it comes to fitness, the SE acts like a personal trainer on your wrist. You can log workouts in the Health app, monitor your heart rate, and keep track of your daily steps. It’s genuinely satisfying to close those tri-colored activity rings each day. It’s kind of like keeping a streak alive on Duolingo or Wordle, but for your health. Plus, the watch includes safety features like Fall Detection, Crash Detection, and Emergency SOS, which could literally save your life in an accident.</p>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2068">The Apple Watch SE is also swimproof up to 50 meters, so it’s great for laps in the pool, open-water swims, or even a full-on triathlon.</p>
<p data-start="2070" data-end="2328">The Sleep app gives you detailed insights into your sleep stages, showing when you’re awake, in core sleep, or in REM. That data can help you tweak your nighttime routine and actually wake up feeling refreshed instead of groggy.</p>
<p data-start="2474" data-end="2733" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">You can snag the 3rd-gen Apple Watch SE in midnight black or starlight white, starting at just $200</a>. Whether you’re trying to push your workouts further or finally take control of your sleep, this deal is a pretty great reason to make the upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It might be a sign of the times, or just a strange decision on Activision and Treyarch’s part, but the campaign aspect of Black Ops 7 cannot be paused, meaning you have to keep playing and progressing until the mission is over, or you reach a checkpoint.</p>



<p>Yes, this marks the first time ever that you can’t pause a Call of Duty campaign. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a>‘s campaign utilizes an always-online aspect, meaning the game is live at all times. This has several huge implications for your game and means progress and progression can be interrupted at all times.</p>







<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-can-t-be-paused">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Can’t Be Paused</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s pause for a minute, oh wait. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Black Ops 7’s campaign has attracted a lot of discourse because of the nature of its content. One thing that can’t be overlooked is the campaign being always online. In previous games, when you pause the game, the action stops. End of story.</p>



<p>That’s not the case here, and the action carries on—think of it like a FromSoftware game where you bring up a menu, but the world is still active. You can die, lose your progress, and go back to the start of the checkpoint. This isn’t ideal when you’re playing on Veteran difficulty, for example.</p>







<p>ModernWarzone also shared a clip of someone’s campaign journey, and while the user is trying to watch a cutscene, Black Ops 7 suddenly decides in that moment to drop the Daily Update.</p>



<p>This instantly derails any campaign momentum and throws you out to the main menu.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since Black Ops 7 is an always online campaign without the ability to pause, even if playing solo, when there is an update pushed it will interrupt your campaign regardless of where you are and what's happening. </p><p>Glad I didn't lose any progress at least. <a href="https://t.co/ofOXPLSvQD">pic.twitter.com/ofOXPLSvQD</a></p></div>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1989121314154770702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Treyarch might enable some kind of offline workaround later on, but this is unlikely due to the game’s online integration and the addition of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-worlds-collide-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Collide</a>.</p>



<p>Is this a bad move from Treyarch? Does this put you off playing the campaign altogether? Head to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> and let us know what you think of this decision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a new Escape from Tarkov 1.0 trailer, celebrating the imminent launch of the game after ten years in development. It comes just one day before the update (or release) is set to drop, bringing an end to ten years of testing. The highly anticipated release will come hand-in-hand with the exciting feature to <strong>finally </strong>escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Plenty is showcased in the trailer, which, in true Battlestate Games fashion, has the characters dying over, and over, and over again. It’s true to the game, at least.</p>







<h2 id="h-tarkov-1-0-trailer-is-here">Tarkov 1.0 Trailer is Here</h2>



<p>All week, Battlestate Games has been writhing in nostalgia, sharing old trailers and tidbits from Escape from Tarkov’s ten-year development lifecycle. In an epic milestone, the team is finally pushing the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-release-date-start-time/">into a 1.0 state</a>, and it’ll be released worldwide <strong>tomorrow</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the 1.0 trailer for your enjoyment:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Escape from Tarkov 1.0 Release Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKh9HaTEUfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s an exciting time for fans of the extraction genre. From the launch of Escape from Tarkov to the skyrocketing success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-arc-raiders-map-open-breaking-new-ground/">ARC Raiders</a>, and from the superstar performance of the satirical <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-duckov-sells-1-million-copies/">Escape from Duckov</a> to the recent leaks concerning the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/">Far Cry extraction shooter</a>, there’s plenty to be enthused about.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released tomorrow on Steam, which marks the first time that the extraction shooter has appeared on a platform outside of Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher. It’ll hopefully attract an entirely new audience to the game.</p>







<p>Also, there’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-twitch-drops-campaign-confirmed/">Twitch Drops campaign</a> set to run from this weekend into early December that’ll reward users for watching their favorite streamers play the new update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Here are the full patch notes</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Shortly after launch back in September, Marvelous revealed the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">2025 roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, and today, we've arrived at another stop on the journey.</p>
<p>The mech action/adventure has today landed its 'Into the Abyss' paid DLC, a story expansion that sees you sent out to explore an all-new map area, Survey Zone: Locus Initi. You can expect to find new enemies, new gear, and a whole new Axiom base to get your head around.</p>
<p>The 'Into the Abyss' DLC is now available to all those with the Digital Deluxe or Super Deluxe versions of the game. Alternatively, you can purchase the expansion separately on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/DLC/Daemon-X-Machina-Titanic-Scion-Into-the-Abyss-2860504.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>£13.49 / $14.99</strong>. Do note that you'll need to have made it past Chapter 18 'Investigate the Facility's Depths' in the base game to see any of this bonus content.</p>

<p>But it's not just paid news for Titanic Scion today, since the game has also landed a free update to bump things up to ver. 1.2. There are a bunch of pesky bugs targeted by this one, as outlined in the full patch below (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1342490/Daemon_X_Machina_Titanic_Scion/">Steam</a>).</p>
<h2>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Ver. 1.2</h2>

・Weapons that were only available through shops can now be obtained in the field after a certain point.<br>
・Fixed an issue where the number of foes grabbed was not counted when armed with certain weapons.<br>

<p>We had a perfectly fine time with Titanic Scion when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, but felt that it was let down by its performance issues, which made for a "janky experience in places, with mushy controls and limp feedback". Let's hope that this patch can help move things in the right direction.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.moddb.com/downloads/maxpayne2remixmod-by-darko913">A new Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod</a> introduces path tracing to a few early locations, offering stunning visuals. However, even on high-end GPUs like the RTX 5080, this lighting technology proves to be a true performance killer without proper optimization.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows the modded version with path tracing and the vanilla version of the second entry in the series running side by side at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS, highlighting how some locations look stunning with path tracing. </p>



<p>At the same time, the comparison video clearly shows how path tracing is extremely taxing on current gaming hardware: with performance dropping from 1,255 FPS in the vanilla game to just 38 FPS in the mod in some instances, an RTX 5080 with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode takes a hit of over 1,200 FPS, representing an astonishing 97% performance drop overall. It's only with Frame Generation that the modded game reaches playable framerates above 60 FPS.</p>

<iframe title="Max Payne 2 Path Tracing with RTX Remix - One of the Most Impressive RTX Remix Mods | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLerlkr2nVE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-path-tracing-requires-optimization-to-be-viable">Path Tracing Requires Optimization to Be Viable</h2>



<p>The massive performance hit seen in the Max Payne 2 RTX Remix mod is far from being an uncommon occurrence, as almost every classic game that has received a path tracing overhaul sees similar performance drops. Among them is the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-rtx-remix-annihaltes-performance-4080/">original Max Payne</a>, which also sees performance drops in the 1000 FPS range on high-end GPUs, the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">Half-Life remake Black Mesa</a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-path-tracing-rtx-5080-obliterates-performance/">Left 4 Dead 2</a>. </p>



<p>This makes it even clearer how the demanding tech requires optimization work in conjunction with upscaling (and sometimes Frame Generation) to deliver acceptable performance, as demonstrated by some of the best implementations of the tech in recent years, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-continues-impressive-showcase/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-rtx-remix-remasters-may-continue-to-be-the-best-option-to-update-classic-games-in-the-future">RTX Remix Remasters May Continue to Be The Best Option to Update Classic Games in the Future</h2>



<p>Although the current RTX Remix mods generally require very powerful hardware to run at playable framerates, these overhauls are likely to continue offering the best remaster option for games that won't receive official updates implementing the latest graphics tech. <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Among these is&nbsp;<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-4-path-tracing-remaster/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 4,</a>&nbsp;whose eventual remaster is unlikely to receive path tracing support,</span> based on<a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"> the remasters released so far by Rockstar Games</a><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">.</span></p>



<p>Hopefully, gaming hardware will eventually catch up to make these unofficial remasters playable by the majority of players, even those without access to top-end hardware.</p>

            <p>Remember Brendan from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>? If the answer's no, I don't blame you. He's a talking vending machine you can run into and end up going off on a short series of side quests about, but I totally missed him in my fist couple of playthroughs. Anyway, <strong>spoiler alert</strong>, but that quest arc in the base game ends pretty tragically, something a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">modder</a>'s now changed via the addition of an extra bit which lets you pay to have the semi-sentient snack box installed in V's flat.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prolific Cyberpunk modder Deceptious is behind this short extra mission, which they've dubbed '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/25629?tab=description">Brendan's Death Song</a>' in honour of a Red Hot Chili Peppers song I can't admit often makes it into my playlists. I'm more of a basic Californicationy kinda bloke, what can I say?</p>
<p>With this work installed, after running into Brendan the vending machine outside of Megabuilding H8 in Japantown and running through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/I_Can_See_Clearly_Now">trio of quests</a> involving him, things usually end with him telling a final gag before undergoing a programming change that'll get rid of his chatty quirkiness. Think the ending of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a>, except Roy Batty's spent his life giving out more free snacks than he should have.</p>
<p>But, what if Harrison Ford could have paid some dudes to pick up Roy Batty, bring him back to life, and install him in the wall of Deckard's flat? Sounds pretty horrifying to be honest, but it's probably a lot less horrifying when this mod does it as a way of letting you keep a bit of Brendan in your cyber-life. Once the machine's been added to the default Megabuilding H10 apartment via a quest heavy on text messages, he'll be available for some brief conversation and occasionally dish out a free drink.</p>
<p>"He goes silent during partner dates in H10, but does have a small change of appearance when the partner is there," Deceptious teases, in case you were worried about being virtually cockblocked by a coin-operated flatmate.</p>
<p>To get the mod up and running, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7831">Deceptious' Quest Core</a>, plus standard Cyberpunk advanced tweak enablers <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4198">ArchiveXL</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/2380">RED4ext</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/4197">TweakXL</a>. Oh, and a tolerance for groan-worthy gags. Let's face it though, if you saw the headline of this article with my name in the byline and have read this far, you've almost certainly got that. Or you just like hearing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-can-now-serve-daily-word-puzzles-thanks-to-a-mod-called-gonkle-and-the-answers-probably-choom">intriguing Cyberpunk mods</a>.</p>

You'll also be booted from your game if you're idle for too long. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As detailed in IGN's just-published <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> (which rates the offering as a 6/10), the story experience — traditionally offered as a solo affair — is really more geared to being played via online co-op, which it supports for up to four people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The downsides of that, however, are that the game offers no AI companions to fill in if you have missing spots on your four-person squad, no checkpoints, no difficulty options, and the need to repeat tasks clearly designed for completion by multiple players if you are playing solo. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Playing solo is borderline tedious due to having to repeat multiple objectives, such as placing C4 on a building yourself four times rather than splitting them up as is intended," our review notes as one example of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 2035, Black Ops 7's campaign features a starry cast that includes Gilmore Girls and This is Us star Milo Ventimiglia as the returning David Mason, alongside Guardians of the Galaxy hero Michael Rooker and Sabrina the Teenage Witch actress Kiernan Shipka. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Long-term Call of Duty fans may raise their eyebrows at some of the more fantastical sequences presented in the mode, with trippy visuals and towering bosses more often seen in something like Activision's former stablemate Destiny. But it's here that the offering also provides some variety. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Weapons in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Dodging giant falling machetes like you’ve stumbled into a Looney Tunes cartoon is a one-off joy, as is taking control of a lavish luxury boat and ramming into the side of a building," our review continues. "Moments like this feel pinched right out of Christopher Nolan's back pocket and sit perfectly in the Call of Duty mold."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 arrives just 12 months on from last year's Black Ops 6 — the first time that the veteran shooter franchise has gone back to the same well of one of its sub-brands for a second year running. The tight turnaround comes just as EA's rival Battlefield franchise makes its own big return, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-vs-battlefield-6-which-one-is-best-for-you">amping up the pressure on Activision's new shooter installment</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer review so far</a> is still in-progress though, initially at least, sounds more positive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Despite being one of PlayStation's most prolific single-player series, developer Guerrilla Games has "always thought about" its Horizon franchise "as a multiplayer game".</p>
<p>That's coming from Guerrilla Games' studio head, <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek">Jan-Bart van Beek</a>, who was resharing yesterday's announcement post about Horizon's spin-off MMO, Steel Frontiers. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," van Beek shared on social media.</p>

<p>The studio exec added that last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, which told a brickified version of Aloy's initial outing in Zero Dawn, was the studio's "first small step" into Horizon's multiplayer offerings.</p>
<p>"With Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one," the Guerrilla developer furthered, before adding there is "much more to come".</p>
<p>Following Steel Frontiers' announcement yesterday, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier stated NCSoft's Horizon game is different from Guerrilla's own multiplayer release, which is currently said to be in development at the studio. "That one is Guerrilla's next big project," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v">Schreier said</a>.</p>
<p>As for Horizon Steel Frontiers, it's coming from NCSoft, though Guerrilla has collaborated with the studio. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrilla-affirms-its-working-on-new-games-in-the-horizon-franchise-as-ncsoft-mmo-skips-ps5">Steel Frontiers is described as a "fierce survival adventure"</a>, in which players take on the role of machine hunters in a region known as Deathlands. The team promises "large-scale raids" and an "advanced combat system". The upcoming MMO is poised for PC and mobile, with no mention of a PlayStation release.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/guerrillas-horizon-franchise-has-sold-over-38m-copies-worldwide">PlayStation and Guerrilla's Horizon franchise had surpassed 38m copies sold</a>. The news came as part of Sony's filed legal complaint against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">company accused the Chinese technology conglomerate of ripping off its Horizon video game franchise with Light of Motiram</a>.</p>

<p>Europa Universalis 5 carries on Paradox Interactive’s good work in the strategy genre. In contrast, many fans flock to other well-known franchises for their world-conquering needs. Europa Universalis 5 offers all of this and more, and its console commands and cheats are a lot of fun if you feel like messing about with the world.</p>



<p>It’s not easy for Europa Universalis 5 to compete with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anno-117-pax-romana-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> and Civilization 7s of the world. Yet, here we are with another mainline addition to the long-running franchise. It has all the usual mechanics to consider: Ruling through dynasties, shaping your nation, dictating its fate for hundreds of years.</p>







<p>If you want a little helping hand, the Europa Universalis 5 console commands on PC might be a good little companion.</p>

            <p>Following the latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> console update, Nintendo appears to have blocked third-party Switch 2 docks.</p>
<p>Update 21.0.0 was released earlier this week and, finally, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-update-for-switch-consoles-finally-indicates-if-your-games-are-digital-or-physical">adds symbols to indicate if software is physical or digital</a>, among other changes.</p>
<p>However, some Switch 2 owners are reporting their third-party docks no longer work following the update (thanks <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081">Kotaku</a>).</p>

<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrBCQTmb9SU&amp;t=1s">Austin John Plays</a> tested out some third-party dongles and confirmed, after the update, a video signal was no longer transmitted. Shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1ouoalk/some_third_party_switch_2_docks_stopped_working/">reddit</a>, a number of players shared similar stories.</p>
<p>"Can confirm my 2nd (3rd party) dock in our living room just stopped working as well right after today's update," wrote one reddit user. "A full power cycle did not fix it for me. Quite a bummer as we've been enjoying it issue free for months."</p>
<p>"I finally got around to ordering a dock cable for travel, it arrived today," wrote another user. "Plugged it in, happy it worked right out of the box. Launched a game, update alert, update, cable's borked."</p>
<p>Of course, the console comes with a dock in the box. But some users like to have an extra dock available to play in separate rooms or for travelling. An official dock on the Nintendo store costs £92.99, however, so many users have turned to third-party options.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for clarification on this change.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Nintendo Direct dedicated to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">forthcoming The Super Mario Galaxy Movie revealed its first trailer</a> - here's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-breakdown-of-the-super-mario-galaxy-movies-first-trailer-with-the-easter-eggs-weve-spotted">all the Easter Eggs we've spotted</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 runs the risk of being too much game, as Treyarch’s penchant for taking Easter eggs and modes from yesteryear and building them out further comes to its latest form. There are, of course, the campaign and the multiplayer, which are the two main pillars of any COD, but then there’s the annual Zombies mode, there’s the return of the top-down shooter Dead Ops Arcade, and the campaign is playable in co-op and with a bespoke Endgame multiplayer mode. It’s…. it’s a lot to take in.</p>
<p>We’ve had a little headstart on the game’s launch today, dipping a toe into a bunch of the game’s modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Launch Trailer (PC Features Spotlight)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ry41LBsSuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the campaign and, somehow, Menendez has returned, a new message from him defying death and calling for more global uprisings confirmed by a military tech giant, The Guild. Something about that doesn’t sit quite right, so JSOC sends in David Mason and his team as a blunt force data extraction in the city state of Avalon. Fighting through waves of robots and human soldiers alike, they get trapped in a dead end, and then things get… weird. A hallucinogenic gas gets released, sending the team tumbling into David Mason’s nightmarish memories and scenarios, occasionally coming back up to investigate the next step of the story within Avalon.</p>
<p>On paper, it’s a fan-pleasing set up, calling back to some of the most popular games in this franchise, and there’s always a bit of a draw to being able to play in co-op, but in practice, it’s all just a bit confusing. For some reason, Black Ops 7 returns to the well of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">2023’s Modern Warfare 3</a> for inspiration, creating a big open world map for Avalon which then plays host to a number of missions through the campaign. You just go from point A to B, battle the white clad Guild goons along the way and when you get there, and maybe there’s something daft like riding on the back of a hijacked VTOL to follow a signal – hilariously the voice over tells anyone that didn’t make it onto the VTOL to try and follow on foot. And then you’re sucked into a new hallucinated level with stages made out of floating chunks of land, battling horrible creatures, and mad bosses.</p>


<p>You do get some fun abilities through this, including an augmented jump, grapple hook and wingsuit to speed up getting around Avalon and the necessary movement to get through the dreams. These carry through to the Endgame mode that follows the campaign, returning you to Avalon for more freeform extraction shooter missions – they’re just PvE, though, so all 32 players in a session can collaborate. In this mode, you can work your way up through four areas of difficulty. You’re dropped in, run around and find points of interest with some kind of objective to beat, find gun and gear caches, and then extract before time runs out. As you play, you level up, gaining power to be ready to take on more challenging zones, and build up to more significant challenges, but if you die? That operator’s specs and loadout are all lost.</p>
<p>You might be getting flashbacks to the open world Zombies mode from Modern Warfare III. It’s mostly Guild enemies in regular areas, but there are also plenty of reality-bending moments. Clouds of gas that are home to roving groups of zombies, fun little mini missions, like a portal where that zips you up into the sky to wingsuit and chase after butterflies, or a random little game of Prop Hunt with a monster. There’s fun surprises here, and there’s plans to add more higher level Endgame events and missions through the seasonal content, but I’m not sure that people would load this up instead of heading into Zombies for their co-op fix.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, while I haven’t tried the initial Zombies map and mode, the initial map promises six interconnected regions, a truck that you can drive around in to visit different locations. Despite this, it’s still a round-based Zombie mode, and a main quest will drag this Dark Aether narrative forward. Alternatively there’s Dead Ops Arcade 4, with its top-down twin-stick shooter missions, again offering more co-op.</p>
<p>Now, I’ll be honest, I’m not the greatest connoisseur of Call of Duty multiplayer. Each year brings its particular tweaks and changes, loadouts have different schemes for construction with points or slots, there’s the catalogue perks that come in and out of favour, kill streaks and all the rest. Fundamentally, after a couple hours with a mosh-pit playlist of the core modes, Black Ops 7 feels like Call of Duty to me.</p>
<p>The biggest change in the moment-to-moment gameplay is really the addition of wall jumping, which can be chained together a couple times to let you bridge a handful of deliberate gaps in the level design. On Den, the Japanese feudal castle turned Guild fortress, there’s an outer path on one side of the map that goes over some rooftops that you have to jump between, but there’s also a little wall-jump opportunity to get to a smaller inner path as well, allowing for a flanking move if this route feels locked down. Of course, this is less fundamental on a remake map like the superyacht Hijacked, but it’s a curious addition that feels like it’s a little nod back to the multi-jump, wall-running action of Black Ops 3.</p>

<p>While the 6v6 multiplayer is always going to be Call of Duty’s bread and butter, Skirmish is the latest experiment with something a bit bigger. This objective-based 20v20 mode is a madcap rush of objectives and, presenting you a large-ish map and a steady stream of capture, destroy, takeover and escort missions to race to and complete. It might sound like a riff on Battlefield or previous combined arms modes like Ground War, but since you wingsuit in when you spawn and can just zip to pretty much anywhere on the map, it’s close to being pure infantry. It is absolutely manic because of this, with no sense that any overlook or defensive position won’t just have enemies dropping in behind you, or wingsuiting straight through open windows to combat roll right into the thick of it.</p>
<p>From around 8 hours play, Black Ops 7 is a bit of a head-scratcher in places, and a Modern Warfare III style misfire at its worst. The multiplayer is a solid and dependable evolution, and I’m looking forward to jumping into Zombies properly, but the opening hours of the campaign and the co-op Endgame mode are a jumbled mess of horror shooter and open world that is missing the mark. This might be the biggest Call of Duty ever, and all of it can be played together with friends, but you’ve all got to want to for that to work.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a> developers Crystal Dynamics have announced another round of layoffs, their third round of jobs cuts this year. The studio say "just under 30 team members across various departments and projects" are losing their livelihoods, and claim this is necessary "to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<p>This year alone had already seen Crystal Dynamics lay off staff in two waves, with 17 employees being <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-lays-off-17-employees">let go in March</a> and an unspecified number of others <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-developers-crystal-dynamics-lay-off-more-staff-say-the-series-future-is-unaffected">handed their marching orders in August</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with that August round, these latest layoffs were announced via a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF">LinkedIn post</a>. "We've parted ways with just under 30 team members across various departments and projects as we restructure the company and business for our next generation," the studio wrote. "Crystal deeply thanks all of those impacted for their incredible talent, hard work, and dedication, which helped shape the studio in so many ways. We are committed to offering our fullest resources and support to you during this transition."</p>
<p>"We've made these painful choices as a way to optimize the continued development of our flagship Tomb Raider game, as well as shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future," they added.</p>
<p>So far, principal animator <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7394854027055910913-ko9W">Shamil Rasizade</a> and producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/samanthadobes_opentowork-activity-7394845983777619968-jCKp">Samantha Dobes</a> have posted to LinkedIn that they've been let go as part of these cuts. "It’s been a fun 12 years, and I will greatly miss everyone. But I suppose it’s time to join the army of unemployed game devs. You know how it goes these days. If you hear of anything, please let me know," the former wrote.</p>
<p>Solidarity and best of luck to all those affected by these layoffs.</p>

<p>Yes, the 2.1.0 patch is here, and it adds... well, a couple of things. First up, we've got a new, smaller calendar app that no longer takes up the whole ruddy home screen, so that's nice if you like that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Second is a new filter that lets you streamline the news feed according to specific characters. You better believe we'll be laser-focused on anything to do with Samus for the next few weeks!</p>
<p>So let's check out the official patch notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Added Calendar Widget Sizes</strong></p>
<p>- Added a small widget you can use to check the weekly calendar.</p>
<p><strong>News and Browsing History Filtering</strong></p>
<p>- News and browsing history can now be filtered by character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, that's yer lot.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also recently released a separate app for its storefront, featuring games, accessories, and more. With the Nintendo Music and the Nintendo Switch apps, this is now totals four. Maybe it's time to combine these together in some way, Nintendo..?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, developer NCSOFT has talked about the game as part of its wider lineup (<a href="https://wccftech.com/aion-2-launch-globally-second-half-2026-monetization-less-aggressive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aion 2</a>, Time Takers, Cinder City, Limit Zero Breakers) in a dedicated session at G-Star 2025, <a href="https://m.ruliweb.com/news/read/217907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as reported by Ruliweb</a>.</p>



<p>During development, Horizon Steel Frontiers was known as Project Skyline, and apparently, it was believed that it would employ 'AI NPCs'. When asked that question, though, NCSOFT focused instead on the fact that AI is being used 'extensively' in the game's production, and that they expect it to be used even more in future games.   </p>



<p><em>We're testing and receiving assistance internally through collaborations with basic NPCs and combat. Since we're an action RPG, we don't play with a large number of players, but rather determine the optimal number of players, and we receive assistance in various aspects. Internally, we also rely on AI for production, from coding to art. It 's being widely adopted in the field, and I think the technologies will gradually become known. The Horizon Steel Frontiers development team is also the one most eager to utilize AI. It's being used a lot, and you'll see that games coming out after Aion 2 will greatly increase their use of AI.</em></p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A published by Ruliweb, NCSOFT adds that the focus will be on PvE cooperation, although Guerrilla had mentioned some sort of competition with other tribes in the announcement video. When it comes to the release window, the Korean studio reiterated the release window <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-says-horizon-steel-frontiers-could-launch-as-early-as-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported from the NCSOFT quarterly earnings call</a>: late 2026 or early 2027, with public testing scheduled to take place at some point next year.</p>



<p>In case MMORPGs are not your cup of tea and the announcement of Horizon Steel Frontiers did nothing for you, Guerrilla Games is still making <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-online-co-op-game-nearly-confirmed-by-job-openings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its own cooperative multiplayer version of the franchise</a>, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed once again</a> by Jason Schreier.</p>

<p>Released November 14, Black Ops 7 is the latest instalment in the long-running Call of Duty franchise and has plenty to sink your teeth into, including a new endgame mode in campaign, multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone to come in future.</p>



<p>Across all modes, recognizable voices will be heard, and we can tell you exactly who the Black Ops 7 voice actors are and where you may know them from.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-major-actors-in-black-ops-7">All Major Actors in Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Activsion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has a variety of actors starring, with some providing their likeness and voices to roles, while others are voice actors.</strong></p>



<p>Big names include Michael Rooker, Milo Ventimiglia, Nolan North, and Steve Blum, who have all starred in a host of other games, films, and TV series’ respectively.</p>

<p>If there are a few names in the list above you recognize but can’t quite place your finger on where you know them from, here’s a breakdown of some of the actors and their previous roles.</p>



<h3 id="h-milo-ventimiglia">Milo Ventimiglia</h3>



<p>Milo Ventimiglia shot to fame with the role of Peter Petrelli in the mid-2000’s TV series Heroes, and starred as Jack Pearson in over 100 episodes of This Is Us from 2016-2022.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is only his second video game appearance, from what we can find, with his debut coming in 2011’s X-Men: Destiny. He’s also voiced Wolverine in a TV Mini Series, and lended his voice to Spider-Man Noir in the Ultimate Spider-Man Anime.</p>



<h3 id="h-michael-rooker">Michael Rooker</h3>



<p>Michael Rooker first appeared in the Call of Duty franchise over a decade ago in Black Ops 2, and has also starred in The Walking Dead as Merle Dixon, and as Yondu in the Marvel Cinematic Universe—a role he has reprised for some anime series.</p>



<p>In recent years, Rooker has had fleeting appearances in The Rookie, Creature Commandos, and Peacemaker, as well as providing a voice for a Superman Robot in this year’s blockbuster film.</p>



<h3 id="h-steve-blum">Steve Blum</h3>



<p>Steve Blum is a familiar name in video games, having voiced both Wolverine and Venom in Marvel Rivals, as well as appearing in titles like Date Everything! and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Other standout roles include voicing Zeb Orrelios in Star Wars: Rebels, Spike Spiegel in Cowboy Bebop: The Movie, and Starscream in Transformers Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-nolan-north">Nolan North</h3>



<p>Nolan North is another familiar voice across TV and video games, with 30 credited appearances in Rick and Morty and eight appearances in Family Guy, but it’s his video game roles where he stands out.</p>

<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it arrived on Switch 2 earlier this year, and we were particular fans of how gosh darn charming the whole thing is: "Marvelous has really taken a lot of time to perfect the gameplay loop of Grand Bazaar, and that polish has also spilled out into the characters and the visuals."

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> creators Rockstar have been called out by a member of the UK parliament for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">dismissing 31 Rockstar North employees</a> in an alleged instance of union-busting. The politician in question, Christine Jardine of Edinburgh West and the Liberal Democrats, says that she has been approached by several of the fired developers, whom Rockstar accuse of leaking confidential information during conversations with union organisers in a private Discord channel. 
</p>
<p>
Jardine has asked the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> company for more details, and wants a meeting with a government minister to discuss support for the affected workers. Intriguingly, she acknowledges that she has a conflict of interest in that one of her own employees also currently works for Rockstar.
</p>
<p>
"Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office," Jardine wrote in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cajardinemp.bsky.social/post/3m5jgfa3dis2m">a social media post</a> last night, following the House of Commons session in question. "I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again." The post includes a video in which she gives a longer account, below.
</p>
<blockquote>
I declare an interest because I have an employee who works for the company I'm about to mention, though they are not affected by the actions taken. That company is videogame company Rockstar, who's fired at least 30 employees across its UK studios, including Rockstar North in Edinburgh. Several of my constituents have been affected, and some came to see me last week to express those concerns. They claim they have been sacked because they were trying to unionise, and discussing working conditions in private. But Rockstar have accused them of distributing confidential information, and sacked them for gross misconduct. I've written to Rockstar to ask for information on the issue, but I wondered, can I can have a meeting with the relevant minister to discuss what steps can be taken to support [the fired Rockstar staff].
</blockquote>
<p>
Last week, RPS attended two pickets organised by the IWGB game workers union to protest the Rockstar North firings. At <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">a London gathering</a> outside Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive's offices, IWGB president Alex Marshall defended the right of the developers to organise and discuss their jobs in meetings attended by union members. He called Rockstar's claims about leaked material "completely disingenuous". The union are taking Rockstar to court over the firings.
</p><p>
In Edinburgh, meanwhile, freelancer Alan Wen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">spoke to several of the affected developers</a>, who claimed that union membership at Rockstar reached the legal minimum required for statutory recognition under UK law shortly before the mass firings. One protestor at the Edinburgh gathering characterised Rockstar's allegations of "gross misconduct" as a "nuclear option" to shut down the unionisation drive before it could gather too much momentum.
</p>
<p>220 Rockstar North staff have now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/220-rockstar-staff-sign-letter-to-management-calling-for-immediate-reinstatement-of-fired-workers">signed an open letter to management</a> calling for the immediate reinstatement of the fired workers. Further protests have been held in London and outside Take-Two's Paris headquarters. There's another Edinburgh rally due on 18th November outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood.</p>
<p>
Shortly after the firings, Rockstar and Take-Two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">pushed back the release of GTA 6 to November next year</a>. It doesn't strain credulity that company leadership might see a unionised workforce as a threat to their ability to impose certain working conditions, in order to ship the now repeatedly delayed game. Rockstar recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">mandated a return to the office</a>, in reports confirmed by several of the Rockstar North workers, and staff have crunched on projects in the past. It's also credible that Rockstar might be hyper-sensitive about the possibility of project secrets going walkies following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-confirm-gta-6-leaks-but-say-it-wont-have-any-long-term-effect-on-development">a massive leak of GTA 6 materials</a> back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time GTA 6 and Rockstar have been brought up in a parliamentary session this week. Far right Polish politician Witold Tumanowicz of the Confederation Liberty and Independence group broached the "disturbing matter" of the GTA 6 delay in <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1988328220757028917?s=19">footage shared on Tuesday</a>, presumably hoping to score some #based points with his online groupies.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is out today, and as such swarms of people are trying out the new campaign to see the latest development in the beloved Black Ops narrative. To their surprise, they're discovering a few quirks proving to be a tad frustrating.</p>
<p>Many of these problems stem from the solo experience. For one, the Call of Duty campaign cannot be paused, even if you're playing on your own. The narrative focuses on a squad of characters, but no AI companions come in to replace the role another player would.</p>
<p>It has no checkpoint system, meaning if you quit out of the game for any reason you'll have to start a mission over from the beginning. Also, the campaign requires an online connection at all times, meaning if you suddenly go offline for whatever reason (including game updates which can appear daily and without warning) you'll lose progress.</p>

<p>It is made especially clear the campaign is intended to be a group experience. Even if you intend to play on your own, you have to engage with the game's matchmaking and lobby-making process to start playing the campaign. That being said, it has still come to a shock for many the solo campaign experience seems to have been released with these apparent issues.</p><p>Eurogamer is still in the process of writing up its review for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, including its campaign, but in the meantime why not check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-guns-tier-list">Black Ops 7 guns tier list</a> as well as a breakdown on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-endgame-pve-mode-skills-abilities">how the endgame PvE mode works</a>. That is, if you want to finish the campaign at all.</p>
