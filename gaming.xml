<p>After first <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1852776037240947027">acknowledging the issue</a>, the developer has now revealed the event will now be extended until 5th November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-teardown/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first PlayStation 5 Pro teardown video was shared online today, providing a better look at the new console launching in a few days worldwide.</p>
<p>The video, which was shared on YouTube by Brazilian channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TAG22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TAG</a>, provides a good look at the console's internal components, cooling solution and more, and it is a very interesting watch even for those who don't speak Portuguese and want to see how much the console differs from the base model.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 PRO POR DENTRO 👊😃 | PS5 PRO teardown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1VSPgqY7Yw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As confirmed in the teardown video above, the PlayStation 5 Pro features a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-improvement-repairability/">major repairability improvement</a> that grants easy access to the system's CMOS battery, allowing users to easily swap it out and ensure the console will continue to function normally in case the original battery runs out or becomes defective over time.</p>
<p>While the PlayStation 5 Pro specs were widely known already thanks to the many rumors that circulated online in the past few months, we have learned today that the system features an additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-specs-leak-unveils-2-extra-gb-of-ddr5-ram/">2 GB of DDR 5 RAM</a>, which is likely reserved for the OS. As such, developers should be able to utilize 16 GB for games, something that is not possible on the base model because some RAM has to be reserved for the OS.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

			<p>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/ps5-pro-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sonys-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro</a> isn't officially out until November 7, some people have started getting their hands on Sony's revised PlayStation 5 console. An unboxing video was posted a couple of days ago and quickly taken down; now, Brazilian content creator Brunno Fast has also managed to secure a console and subsequently <a href="https://x.com/brunno_fast/status/1852829727234379871" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full spec sheet document included in the box.</p>
<p>By far the biggest surprise is that Sony added 2GB of DDR 5 RAM. These are likely to be reserved for the OS so that game developers can fully utilize the 16 GB of GDDR6 for the actual games. Beyond that, it's largely what we already knew.</p>

According to the developers of The First Descendant, it can stand up to the quality of any upscalers, even NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the PS5 Pro officially launches next Thursday in stores globally. It will be priced at $699/£699/€799.</p>

				<main>

					

					<!--<div class="ads-container banner-ad floated p-0">
						<div data-pg-ad-spot='div-gpt-ad-wccftechcom38564' style="min-height: 280px;"></div>
					</div>-->
					
										<div><header>Product Info</header><div>
						<h5>Razer Kraken V4 Pro</h5><p><span>September 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>At RazerCon 2024, Razer announced a new entry in its popular Kraken headset series—the Kraken V4 Pro. The pro model joins the new Kraken V4 and V4 X, which were both released back in August of this year. Whereas the V4 X headset is a wired model, the V4 and V4 Pro are wireless offerings offering THX Spatial Audio and Razer Chroma RGB lighting.</p>
<p>The major difference between the two wireless models? The Pro model comes with Razer’s Sensa HD haptics and an OLED control HUB. Another difference is the price tag: the regular V4 sells for $179.99, whereas the Pro model goes for a whopping $399.99. Is this difference justified? Let’s find out.</p>
<figure><figcaption>The Kraken V4 Pro comes with a carry pouch</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Features and Design</strong></p>
<p>Selling for $399.99, Razer's latest outing doesn't come cheap. It's almost double the price of the regular V4 model and $70 more expensive than one of its main rivals, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</a>.</p>
<p>Razer's premium headset comes with 40mm dynamic bio-cellulose drivers for a natural high-end sound (the regular V4 comes with 40mm Titanium drivers). Like the V4, the Pro model packs Razer's HyperClear Super Wideband microphone and the brand's HyperSpeed Wireless 2.4Ghz tech. In addition, the headset offers support for Bluetooth 5.3 with simultaneous audio. Although the V4 Pro will likely be used wirelessly, the headset can also connect wired via USB Type-A and a 3.5mm jack (on the supplied control HUB).</p>
<figure><figcaption>The OLED hub that comes with Razer's Pro offering</figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-5x-wireless-first-class/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arctis Nova 5&nbsp; Wireless</a> from SteelSeries, the sides of the earcups can be distinguished easily through an "L" and "R" print on the fabric inside the earcups, which I prefer over the often tiny and dark-colored letters on the hinges.</p>
<p>The V4 Pro comes with a simple carry pouch, but being Razer's top-line headpiece,&nbsp; I would have expected a more premium carry case (like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/razer-barracuda-pro-missed-opportunity/#:~:text=Boom%20mics%20that%20come%20with,audio%20experience%20in%20most%20circumstances." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer's Barracuda Pro model</a>).</p>
<p>The left earcup features the microphone mute button, a status indicator, the volume wheel, a power button, and a USB-C charging port. Both the power button and volume wheel are textured and easily discernable while wearing the headset. On the left, we also find the retractable wideband mic. The right earcup packs the headset's Sensa HD Haptics function button as well as a multifunction button, which allows users to control audio EQ, Bluetooth pairing, and the wireless mode switch button.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Chroma RGB lighting in action</figcaption></figure>
<p>The customizable Chroma RGB lighting adds a nice touch, allowing some personalization to match your gaming setup. While it may not be a game-changer, it does enhance the headset's aesthetic appeal. On the other hand, this might mainly be a feature for streamers, as the user doesn't see the lighting when wearing the headset.</p>
<p><em><span>Sensa HD Haptics</span></em></p>
<p>One of the main features of Razer's premium outing is the brand's Sensa HD Haptics, which aims to enhance the gaming experience. The haptic feedback effectively brings in-game sounds to life, allowing players to feel the rumble of explosions or the subtle vibrations of footsteps nearby. This tactile response can heighten your sense of presence in a game, making those intense moments even more engaging. While the haptics tech works with all audio content, the tech really shines when playing supported games, including Final Fantasy XVI, Silent Hill 2, Once Human, Hitman, MechWarrior 5, as well as the upcoming S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl.</p>
<p>However, while the Sensa HD Haptics is a fun feature, it may not be for everyone. Some users might find it overwhelming or distracting during extended gameplay sessions. Additionally, the overall effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the type of game being played; certain titles really shine with the haptics, while others may not utilize it as effectively.</p>
<p><span><em>OLED Hub</em></span></p>
<p>Another selling point of the Kraken V4 Pro is the supplied OLED hub, which allows for wireless connection between the headset and PC/console and provides real-time information on audio settings, battery life, and even customizable profiles. This makes it easy to monitor and adjust player preferences on the fly.</p>
<p>Through the hub, users can adjust the sound using the Audio EQ, but unfortunately, this is only available for the custom sound profile. Disappointingly, the other EQ profiles can't be modified. To fully configure settings, players will need to download Razer's new Synapse 4 software for PC. This software provides additional options for the headset, including a microphone EQ, additional audio settings, and THX Spatial Audio, which is only available on PC. As such, the Kraken V4 Pro is mainly a PC headset, although advertised as a multi-platform offering.</p>
<p>While the OLED hub is a great visual addition, its practicality might not be fully realized by all users. Some may find that the features, while visually appealing, don’t significantly enhance their gaming experience. Additionally, it requires some setup and may take a little time to get used to for those who prefer simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>Comfort and Sound Performance</strong></p>
<p>Comfort is somewhat of a mixed bag. The memory foam ear cushions provide a decent fit initially, but after a few hours, the headset can start to feel heavy and uncomfortable; after a few hours of usage, I could feel a clear strain on the top of my head. For gamers who often engage in marathon sessions, this can be a significant drawback.</p>
<p>The sound quality that the Kraken V4 Pro is good, although it appears to be focused on competitive gamers. Razer appears to have focused on the midranges in order to allow those players to pinpoint exact positions with plenty of detail. The bass, however, is somewhat modest, even after adjusting the EQ. This can result in some details in the lower sound spectrum being lost, which is unfortunate. Additionally, the lower tones seem a bit unbalanced when compared to the midrange.</p>
<p><span>Microphone</span></p>
<p>The Kraken V4 Pro's microphone offers good enough sound quality; it captures voice well enough, although some might find that it makes your voice sound tinny. Being a premium headset, however, I expected a bit more from this microphone. On the other hand, it's adequate for communication during gaming sessions and works well for casual streaming.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240927_212224046-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>
<p>Although not bad, battery life is somewhat of a letdown when using the headset's 'Pro' features. While Razer claims up to 30 hours of use, I found the reality closer to 13 to 15 hours when utilizing both the haptic feedback and RGB lighting. This can be frustrating, particularly during longer gaming sessions, where frequent charging might become a hassle. Granted, when not using RGB lighting and the haptics tech, the battery can last up to roughly 50 hours, but not using the headset's 'Pro' features to save battery shouldn't be as it was intended.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In summary, while the Razer Kraken V4 Pro offers some appealing features, its high price, subpar battery life, and moderate comfort level make it hard to recommend over more affordable alternatives. On top of that, although advertised as a multi-platform headset, the 'Pro' features are mainly reserved for use on PC.&nbsp; If you’re considering this headset, it’s worth exploring other options that deliver similar performance without breaking the bank.</p>

            <p>
It's been 12 years since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iii">Assassin's Creed 3</a> ended the story of Desmond Miles, the series' first recurring modern day protagonist and link between each game until that point. 
</p>
<p>
Now, speaking at a BAFTA event held in London on Friday evening attended by Eurogamer, Assassin's Creed franchise boss Marc-Alexis Coté has reflected on the series' struggles to tell a meaningful, connected narrative ever since - and how this will finally be rectified in future. 
</p>
<p>
"When the Assassin's Creed franchise was created, it introduced a bold and innovative narrative structure, a modern day story arc centred around Desmond that was intertwined with historical adventures," Coté recalled. "Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artefacts - Pieces of Eden - that could change the course of history. However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. 
</p>
<p>
"Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision," Coté added, "and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."

<p>
Subsequent games initially featured no specific modern day protagonist, before a replacement for Desmond was eventually introduced - Layla Hassan. But the length of time between different games and the shifting teams behind each entry meant the narrative suffered from being too sporadic, too inconsistent, and too repetitive. 
</p><p>
"The continued focus on characters hunting for Isu artefacts made the narrative more predictable," Coté continued, "and reduced the conflict between Templars and Assassins to a straightforward pursuit of control over - let's be honest - magical relics. This shift pulled focus away from what had always been at the heart of the franchise: exploring our history.
</p>
<blockquote>"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern."</blockquote>
<p>
"As this approach became repetitive, both players and critics felt the modern day storyline had become a secondary concern, more of a side-quest, rather than an integral part of the overall experience. Furthermore, the compounded complexity of 15 years of lore built in this parallel storyline created a cognitive load that made the franchise difficult to approach for newcomers."
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed games beginning with Shadows will be integrated via a single launcher/hub Ubisoft originally announced as a project titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>. It's here that ongoing, modern day narrative will be hosted, Ubisoft has said. But why should players simply tuning in for the latest historical adventure care?
</p><p>
"As we move forward, our goal is to put history back at the centre of the players' experience," Coté said. "The modern day narrative will serve to enhance, rather than overshadow, the historical journey. By drawing meaningful contrast between past and present, we aim to restore the balance that was once the hallmark of the franchise. 
</p>
<p>
"The modern day storyline will explore deeper themes of memory, identity and autonomy, how the past shapes who we are, and how controlling this past can impact our future. These themes will allow us to reflect on contemporary issues: freedom versus control, the power of knowledge and the tension between individuality and conformity, all through the lens of history. 
</p>
<p>
"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come."
</p>
<p>
It's intriguing to hear Coté talk about this secondary narrative as "modern day" here after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-looks-like-a-cut-assassins-creed-mirage-post-credits-scene-points-to-a-huge-shift-in-the-series-story">mysterious story stinger tucked away in the files of 2023's Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> suggested the series would shift to focus on looking back through history from the far-flung future. Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-developers-acknowledge-its-mysterious-lore-bending-cut-post-credits-scene">still to fully address what this seemingly-cut ending teaser</a> was due to represent.
</p>

            <p>BioWare currently has no plans for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> expansions, according to reports. Instead the studio will support the fantasy RPG with smaller updates and otherwise turn their full attention towards Mass Effect 5.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">report</a> that there are no plans for DLC, in favour of focusing on the next Mass Effect, in a piece speaking with Bioware creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>Although Rolling Stone confirm no specific details, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">report</a> that they understand BioWare intend to release quality-of-life and smaller content updates for The Veilguard, but nothing more.
</p>
<p>BioWare have traditionally supported their games with substantial story DLC. The previous game in the series, Inquisition, received several, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-dlc">Jaws Of Hakkon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-dlc">The Descent</a>, and an epilogue, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Trespasser</a>.
</p>
<p>That said, video games are harder than ever to make and The Veilguard already took Nic 50 hours to complete for his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ages-inquisition-trespasser-dlc">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. I am personally fine with story-based games being complete at launch, and not getting a bunch of extraneous bottle episodes and post-credits really-real endings post-release.</p>
<p>(Except for Cyberpunk 2077 which I wish had ten more in-development expansions about Idris Elba looking at me sadly.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-legends">The Elder Scrolls: Legends</a>, the free-to-play card game set in Bethesda's fantasy world, has been removed from sale on Steam. Its servers will shut down for good on January 30th, 2025, after which it will no longer be playable. The closure comes five years after the game was last updated.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/364470/The_Elder_Scrolls_Legends/">Steam page</a> displays a message at the top that notes it is "no longer available on the Steam store." An in-game message announces the closure.
</p>
<p>"The Elder Scrolls: Legends servers will permanently shut down on January 30, 2025," begins the message. "From now until January 30, 2025, all items in the store and entry into in-game events will be available for 1 gold each, so you can enjoy all the content Legends has to offer. On that date, servers will be shut down and the game will be inaccessible. Thank you for playing and we hope you have enjoyed your time in Legends."
</p>
<p>Brendy wrote in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-legends-review">Elder Scrolls Legends review</a> that it "improved on Heathstone in an incremental way", elevated by its rune system and held back by its Elder Scrolls setting. That was in 2017 and ongoing development on updates and expansions ceased <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-legends-development-on-hold">just two years later</a>.
</p><p>Obviously Legends never found a huge, adoring audience, but as ever I find it infuriating that live service and free-to-play games are just a slip-and-slide of unpredictable length pointing straight into a bin. No offline mode, no chance of finding an audience in future, just: bin. It's an awful way to treat your customers, and a terrible thing for video game culture in general that so much work is discarded so easily. Is any other medium so shortsighted?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not to worry; I’ve got you covered for some of the best ones.</p><p>This week’s trailers included a teaser for Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284809/squid-game-season-2-teaser-trailer">second season of <em>Squid Game</em></a><em>, </em>a new haunted house horror film from Steven Soderbergh, and a look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/1/24285689/disney-plus-star-wars-skeleton-crew-trailer-wild-ride"><em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</em></a>. Daniel Craig showed up in a trailer for a new A24 movie called <em>Queer.</em> </p><p><h3>Squid Game season 2</h3></p><p><em>Squid Game</em> is finally returning for its second season soon, and in a new teaser, Lee Jung-jae’s Gi-hun looks like he’s preparing to stage an uprising. Whatever happens, it looks like the season will be a bloody, violent return for the dystopian competition on December 26th.</p><p><h3>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew</h3></p><p>I’m very excited that Jude Law’s <em>Star Wars </em>debut, <em>Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, </em>is essentially a swashbuckling pirate adventure. The vibes it’s throwing off feel like a nice blend of <em>The Goonies</em> and <em>Star Trek: Prodigy, </em>and I’m certainly ready. The series debuts December 3rd on Disney Plus.</p><p><h3>Presence</h3></p><p>The moody trailer for Steven Soderbergh’s haunted house horror film <em>Presence </em>doesn’t show the supernatural figure that’s terrorizing Lucy Liu and her suburban family. That’s because it all takes place from the perspective of the ghost itself, which I didn’t realize until I read <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/trailers/presence-trailer-steven-soderbergh-horror-1236195815/"><em>Variety’</em>s write-up of this trailer</a>. It’s already an eerie preview, but knowing that made it much more so on my second viewing. The movie hits theaters on January 24th.</p><p><h3>Queer</h3></p><p>Luca Guadagnino’s <em>Queer, </em>based on William Burroughs’ semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, stars Daniel Craig as William Lee, an American expat who lives in 1950s Mexico City and falls for a younger man named Eugene (Drew Starkey). Having already gotten showings at the Venice Film Festival, some reviews have praised it for <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/queer-review-luca-guadagnino-daniel-craig-venice-film-festival-1236076219/">Daniel Craig’s performance</a> and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/queer-review-daniel-craig-luca-guadagninos-1235986089/">Guadagnino’s “trippy” direction</a>. <em>Queer </em>releases <a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/05a98e4d-2610-420f-ab75-503e09238d6e">on November 27th</a>.</p><p><h3>Xenoblade Chronicles X</h3></p><div><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">continued to <em>not</em> reveal</a> the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284092/nintendo-is-keeping-things-interesting">successor to the Switch</a> in a batch of announcements this week that included the surprise launch of a new music streaming app that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24284073/nintendo-music-streaming-app-switch-online-subscribers">only plays Nintendo songs</a>, the release of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em></a> as a paid app, and a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025">remaster of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>, a 2015 Monolith Soft action RPG. The game will be available on March 20th, 2025, for the Nintendo Switch.</p></div><p><h3>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</h3></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/2/24286150/yo-ho-row-ho-with-mario-luigi">new trailer</a> this week, backed by a banger of a sea shanty that’s been stuck in my head all day today. The latest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> RPG series puts the brothers on a seafaring adventure that continues to make the Switch an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162364/paper-mario-rpg-nintendo-switch">excellent Nintendo console for <em>Mario </em>RPG games</a>.

            <p>Typing Of The Dead released in arcades 25 years ago remains a masterpiece - funny, absurd, tense, and novel. I am keen on any game that aims to follow in its footsteps, and there are a few. The latest is Blood Typers, a horror game where you tippity-tap on your keyboard to fight montsters in a spooky mansion, but this isn't a rail shooter, so you'll be typing to explore and navigate, too.
</p>
<p>It's now got a release of February 2025, and there's a demo you can play now.

<p>If Typing Of The Dead was a riff on House Of The Dead - almost a mod of it, really - then Blood Typers is most obviously riffing on the original Resident Evil. You're moving around a spooky space, collecting bullets and other resources, managing your inventory, and finding keys to unlock new areas.
</p><p>Three-letter words appear on the ground that when typed cause your character to move to that spot. If there's an interactive element - an item to pick up, ladder to climb, jump to make - you can perform the action by typing a command with a preceding slash, like in text adventures of old. '/climb up' to scale a ladder, for example. You'll also need to use your left and right shift keys to rotate your character, to cast a flashlight into all the dark corners of each room.
</p>
<p>Might I prefer if this was a rail shooter, with movement not your concern? Maybe, but it's undeniably tense knowing that enemies can come from all sides. There are advantages to the more expansive framework, too: aside from different characters with their own skillsets, Blood Typers supporters co-op for up to four players, meaning you can all be clearing rooms together or exploring different parts of the procedural environments.
</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go for yourself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790330/Blood_Typers/">over on Steam</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lol-worlds-new-esports-world-record/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been confirmed by Esports Charts that the League of Legends World Championship, which wrapped in London, England tonight, has secured a new esports world record. During the final game of the last series in the tournament, a whopping 6.94 <strong>million </strong>users tuned in worldwide, smashing the records set by last year’s LoL Worlds.</p>



<p>If the power of League of Legends esports wasn’t already evident, this record has cemented it.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant-growth">Constant Growth</h2>



<p>League of Legends is, by numbers, the biggest esports title in the world. This monumental event that was capped off with a grand final in London was an eye-opener to the power of esports, even amidst the ‘esports winter’ that’s refusing to fully thaw.</p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://escharts.com/news/2024-league-legends-worlds-record" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>, it was confirmed that this final series peaked at 6.94 million viewers, which is a new world record that won’t be beaten any time soon. In the last few weeks, more than 190 million hours of game time were watched, and the average viewership throughout the month-long tournament exceeded 1.7 million.</p>



<p>There are no games out there that do it quite like League of Legends.</p>



<p>The tournament was streamed across various platforms, but it dominated on YouTube. More than half the peak viewer count was logged on the platform, with Twitch sitting in second place, which isn’t all that typical for esports. This is likely because at the start of the year, Twitch revealed it was ‘pulling out’ of South Korea.</p>



<p>This year’s League of Legends World Championship was a wonderful event from start to finish. It heralded the fifth trophy for T1 Esports – and the fifth for Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok, often considered the GOAT of the esports world.</p>

            <p>Good news, Disney fans - it looks like Disney Music Parade -Encore- is coming to Nintendo Switches outside of Asia.</p>
<p>Initially, Disney Music Parade -Encore- only had confirmed releases in Japan (21st November) and Asia (12th December), although English language support was in place for those prepared to import it.</p>
<p>However, as spotted by the eagle-eyed folks at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ghz20a/disney_music_parade_encore_rated_by_esrb/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, it has just popped up on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40237/disney-music-parade-encore/">ESRB</a> website, too… even though there are currently no confirmed plans for a US release.</p>

<p>ESRB's description says Disney Music Parade -Encore- is "a rhythm game in which players match on-screen prompts in time with music. Brief clips from Disney movies will occasionally play in the background".</p>
<p>"A handful of these clips include mild instances of violence (e.g., a character hit by a flaming arrow, a character kicking another person)", but none of this is egregious enough to deter an E for everyone rating.</p>
<p>The listing also confirms that there are no interactive elements, and seemingly no in-game purchases.</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade - Encore - is a rhythm action game in which players tap to the beat of Disney songs as they ride through famous scenes from Disney animated films, including Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beauty, Moana, and Frozen.</p>
<p>The game also features Collections consisting of 150 different Music Rides depicting well-known Disney characters in a "brilliant, vibrant art style", as well as Memory Crystals that feature famous scenes from "beloved Disney animated films".</p>
<p>Disney Music Parade -Encore- is currently exclusive to Nintendo Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There are currently no plans for Dragon Age: The Veilguard DLC.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/">Rolling Stone</a>, which reported in an interview with creative director John Epler that "full attention [of BioWare] has shifted entirely to the next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>" game.</p>

<p>Whilst Epler didn't comment directly on future content plans for the latest Dragon Age game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">IGN</a> says it believes BioWare plans to "support The Veilguard with quality-of-life improvements and a handful of smaller content updates".</p>
<p>If true, that's likely to surprise many BioWare fans familiar not just with Dragon Age, but its Mass Effect series, too. The studio has long been associated with quality DLC drops, including fan-favourite DLC expansions like Trespasser or Awakening.</p>
<p>Did you know that early on in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-an-early-mass-effect-easter-egg">Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare offers a knowing nod to Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series?</p>
<p>This week, Bertie sat down with Dragon Age's original creator David Gaider to hear about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">how BioWare knew some of the series' biggest plot points years ago, but kept its secrets hidden away</a>.</p>
<p>Awarding it a sterling five out of five stars in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> review, Bertie wrote: "It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Earlier this week, Tom told us Nintendo Alarmo couldn't yet run Doom, but did confirm it could <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-hack-cant-yet-run-doom-but-can-display-picture-of-a-cat">display a picture of a cat</a>.</p>
<p>Just three days later, however, Wii U reverse engineer GaryOderNichts has risen to the challenge and sent Alarmo rocketing into the Weird Things That Can Run Doom charts by... well, running Doom on Alarmo.</p>
<figure><div>

<p>It's a long-running joke that iconic 90s shooter Doom is playable on almost anything, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-you-can-run-doom-in-balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, a pregnancy test, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-is-now-playable-on-a-tractor">a tractor</a>, and a piece of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-piece-of-lego-can-now-play-doom">Lego</a>. It was only a matter of time for Alarmo to join the list, I guess.</p>
<p>"After my last post, it was pretty clear what everyone wanted to see on the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts quite rightly asserted.</p>
<p>"So, here it is - Doom running on the Nintendo Alarmo!"</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>As usually happens, there's a handful of caveats. Firstly, GaryOderNichts says there's currently no audio support, and to avoid the USB loader memory size restrictions, the .wad needs to be compressed and then uncompressed to external memory on boot.</p>
<p>"However, it's possible to load the shareware version of Doom entirely from USB, without modifying the Alarmo," GaryOderNichts explained.</p>
<p>And if you want to run Doom on your very own Alarmo, GaryOderNichts has <a href="https://t.co/3qBnVjIhqX">kindly shared his workings</a>. For more, including on what, exactly, is inside the Alarmo, <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html">check out the blog</a>.</p>
<p>As Tom summarised for us at the time, Nintendo's leftfield launch this month of Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock, was something of a surprise. It's currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">available only to Nintendo Switch Online members</a> via the My Nintendo Store, priced £90/$99. It's expected to go on general sale from "mid-January 2025", helping fill the gap in Nintendo's launch schedule before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The dust has settled in London and your League of Legends World Championship 2024 winner has been crowned. In a close grand final fixture at the O2 Arena that saw the monumental series go down to game five, Bilibili and T1 clashed like the titans that they are, stunning millions of viewers worldwide – but only one team could win it all.</p>



<p>T1 walks away with a $445,000 grand prize and a FIFTH world championship trophy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heavy-is-the-crown">Heavy is the Crown</h2>



<p>This League of Legends World Championship grand final will go down in the history books. The opening ceremony alone pulled in more than 4.2 million concurrent viewers, according to Esports Charts. That has effectively set an all-new record and beat the previous number reached in 2022 – 3.3 million. </p>



<p>The ceremony saw performances from Ashnikko, Mars Atlas of Forts, Tiffany Aris, and of course, Linkin Park. On social media, League of Legends fans were quick to call this the best opening ceremony in LoL Worlds history.</p>



<p>From start to finish, the final series blew the roof off the O2 Arena. As the final round unfolded, it proved to be a flip-flop of a game, with Bilibili securing the first match before T1 was able to fire back and net a win – but Bilibili netted another point and pulled ahead, sitting on match point as the fourth map approached.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Faker’s flank paid off massively here</figcaption></figure>







<p>This is where things got <strong>intense</strong>. As the match pushed on, Faker had a fire lit under him, going on more than one killing spree against BLG and making high IQ plays time and again. T1 had a massive lead on towers and in gold, and it proved to be too much for BLG, with T1 winning the game before a screaming crowd and a kill record of 14 – 9 over BLG.</p>



<p>And then it came down to the last game.</p>



<p>By the 24th minute of the map, things were relatively balanced. The scoreline sat at 3 – 2 kills and 2 – 3 towers, and both teams were almost equal on gold accrued. It was neck-and-neck with both teams busying themselves with finding openings across the Rift.</p>



<p>In the 29th minute, everything went insane in the middle of the Rift with Faker storming into the middle of a teamfight and netting a triple kill to complete an ace for T1, following which T1 went on to slam the Baron to net a huge chunk of gold.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The tide was turned</figcaption></figure>







<p>The ‘Unkillable Demon King’ that is Faker went on to pull off a second spree to take the scoreline from 6 – 12 in kills, and from there, it was all she wrote. The squad pushed into BLG’s base and scrapped everything, taking the win after an immense kill streak and securing the trophy for the <strong>fifth time</strong>.</p>

<p>In London, the League of Legends World Championship is unfolding in an epic fashion. It’s Bilibili Gaming versus T1 Esports, and there are hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. In the fourth game of the grand final, Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok made history by netting his <strong>five hundredth kill </strong>all-time in the tournament.</p>



<p>He’s been attending the League of Legends World Championship for a decade, and he’s the first person in history to hit this milestone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-records-on-records">Records on Records</h2>



<p>This is turning out to be a stunning tournament for T1’s Faker. This hyper-recognisable and incredibly talented esports pro player won his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/faker-100-matches-league-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">100th LoL Worlds match</a> on October 12, and now he’s hit the milestone for 500 all-time kills in the tournament.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, T1 had pulled back from a 2 – 1 deficit to draw even with Bilibili Gaming, the team looking to score its first win ever on the grandest stage in esports. During the fourth round of the series, Faker eliminated BLG Xun to secure the 500-kill record, and shortly after, T1 won the map and prepared to move into game five.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The fateful moment, seconds after dropping BLG Xun</figcaption></figure>







<p>Time and again, Faker proves why he’s arguably the most impactful esports competitor in history. His record of four world championship wins speaks for itself, and the man is <strong>intent </strong>on winning another one today in London, England. He’s a rockstar competitor and nobody does it quite like him.</p>

The original <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> sits at an 86, with <em>Inquisition</em>, the series’ third entry, landing close by at 84. Meanwhile, <em>Dragon Age II</em>, probably the most divisive game in the series, sits at 79. As much as I loved my time with <em>The Veilguard</em>, I knew it would elicit some pretty divergent reactions from folks. There are 10s and there are some more middling scores.

I don’t know whether I should be flattered, or get on the phone with some lawyers. - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-diversity-moses-1851685364&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-diversity-moses-1851685364">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Critical Reflex has announced that the much anticipated multiplayer update for Buckshot Roulette is now available to all players. The development team has said that there are still some issues that were already identified in the multiplayer beta, and are currently working on ways to get those fixed. Creative Reflex is also going to be monitoring player submitted reports for other issues that could crop up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Buckshot Roulette — Multiplayer Update Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fle3zPwrz5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, Critical Reflex said, <em>“Now, last time we spoke, we said, quote, “we don’t underestimate the capacity of you, High Rollers, to break games in half”. Turns out, we still sort of did. Here’s the thing: due to the peer-to-peer nature of the multiplayer, we have identified a few issues throughout the beta, so we’re already working on patches and fixes for those. Throughout the coming days we’ll be closely monitoring the community reports and react accordingly, so if you’ve got any thoughts to share — make sure to leave them at the Steam Forums or at our Discord server and we’ll certainly take them into consideration.”</em></p>
<p>Alongside multiplayer, the new Buckshot Roulette update has added brand new items to use, new music, new faces created by the fictional in game company Volta Standard Electronics. Buckshot Roulette is a dark horror card game in which players play Russian Roulette with a 12-gauge shotgun. Players enter an arena within a nightclub to go three rounds with the dealer, and only one of you will survive.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Content-Classification-Guidelines?language=en_US#7VII:PoliticsandSensitiveSocialIssues">statement</a>, Twitch said that whilst it is a place "for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them", from now on, any stream that includes discussions about war, religion, or "reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" needs to be labelled.</p>

<p>"Twitch is a place for people to express themselves and discuss the world around them," Twitch explained.</p>
<p>"We require streams to be labelled when the focus of the stream includes discussions and debates about political or sensitive social issues such as discussions about elections, civic integrity, war or military conflict, and civil rights."</p>
<p>Examples of content that require a classification label include streams featuring former or current political officials if the content includes discussions with these individuals around public policies, live coverage or commentary on elections, civic processes, or election-related disputes, and livestreams of protests, rallies, or civil unrest related to civil rights issues or government policies.</p>
<p>Also subject to further labelling are discussions about military conflicts, foreign policy decisions, or national security matters, and discussing ideological or socio-political views on topics like gender, race, sexuality, or religion.</p>
<p>"Discussing legislation related to a sensitive social issue such as reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, or immigration" is also subject to labels.</p>
<p>"Streams containing informational or educational content that aim to share knowledge in a neutral, fact-based manner, rather than engaging in any kind of advocacy for an issue or candidate" are not subject to labelling, however.</p>
<p>"For example, sharing the history of how votes in the US presidential election are counted to determine the next President, or merely encouraging individuals to vote or register to vote," Twitch explained. "Intermittent mentions of politics, politicians, or sensitive social issues are not required to have the Politics and Sensitive Social Issues label."</p>
<p>The changes come after a trying few weeks for the livestreaming giant, which has found itself fielding accusations of islamophobia and anti-semitism.</p>
<p>"There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia," CEO Dan Clancy said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/">complementary statement</a>. "As our community has grown, we’ve endeavoured to build Community Guidelines to prohibit these harms."</p><p>"Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place."</p>
<p>"Millions of streamers, with a wide variety of views and perspectives, spend time on Twitch. We recognise that some content, while allowed on our service, may be objectionable to some members of our community. The views shared by streamers on Twitch are not the views of Twitch nor are they my personal views."We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community," Clancy concluded. "Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here."</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-apologises-for-issue-preventing-account-sign-ups-in-israel-and-palestine">Twitch issued an apology for preventing new account sign-ups from Israel and Palestine due to the ongoing conflict</a>. It said sign-ups were temporarily disabled following the attacks on 7th October 2023 to "prevent uploads of graphic material related to the attack and to protect the safety of users". However, until recently, this verification had not been re-enabled.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Epic Games has announced that Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix is live now on the popular free-to-play battle royale game. Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-breaks-player-count-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking example</a> set with Fortnite Season OG, the island has been reset to the Chapter 2 map, albeit with several twists that will unroll throughout the season.</p>
<p>Starting right now, the Agency grounds are now known as The Doggpound, the new headquarters and home base for Snoop Dogg's enterprise. Players who venture there will have the opportunity to fight him and turn him into an ally, as well as obtain his Snoop's Drum Gun Mythic weapon.</p>
<p>In the second week of Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix, Eminem himself will take ownership of the Grotto cave and establish a restaurant called Mom's Spaghetti there. If you head to Mom's Spaghetti and defeat Eminem, you'll gain his support and receive the Mythic RG Minigun - a lyrical, rapid-fire weapon.</p>
<p>In the third week, hip-hop rapper Ice Spice is set to appear on Shark Island, which will temporarily be renamed Ice Island. Ice Spice is turning it into an ominous-looking shopping mall. If you defeat her, you're getting her support and the Ice Spice's Grappler weapon.</p>
<p>The Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix finale event, which will go live on November 30 at 2 PM Eastern Time, will feature a homage to Juice Wrld. All players who log in between November 30 at 1 AM Eastern Time and December 1 will receive the cel-shaded Slayer Juice WRLD Outfit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fortnite Chapter 2 Remix Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zJK2qBcSYs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The biggest news for Fortnite is arguably the imminent addition of a brand new cosmetic item called 'Kicks.' Epic Games explained:</p>
<p><em>The initial lineup of Kicks will feature Nike and Jordan brands alongside Fortnite originals. Look out for other brands to join the lineup in the future! Kicks will be compatible with over 500 of the most popular Fortnite Outfits to start, with more than 95% of Outfits compatible by Spring of next year. While there are a few Outfits that are particularly challenging to style Kicks for, we’re working hard to make sure that as many Outfits as possible can throw on a fresh pair.</em></p>
<p>The first pair of Nike Air Jordan Kicks will be available from the Shop starting on Tuesday, November 12.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-underworlds-embergard-a-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes.1026006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-new-edition-with-plenty-of-changes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Normally when you see board games move from edition to edition rules will be upgraded, but nothing truly monumental will shift. That's certainly not the case with the new edition of <em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em>. While the core idea of a team skirmish game remains intact the board and way the Warbands are set up is entirely different.</p>

<h2>What's In The<em> Warhammer Underworlds Embergard </em>Box?</h2>

<p>Along with a new way to play the packaging has also been shaped up. Opening the box you'll be met with a large box that contains the games' 36-page instruction manual, a double-sided quick start guide, Miniature sheets and their assembly instructions, tokens, a game board, and four Rivals Decks.</p>

<p>The Rivals Decks are Emberstone Sentinels, Blazing Assault, Countdown to Cataclysm, and Pillage and Plunder.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-box-contents.jpg?itok=h_1-rFAG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-box-contents.jpg?itok=dH2dWfCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is the first of one of the major changes to the game. Warband-specific mechanics have been moved off the fighter's individual cards and onto a Warband card. The individual fighter cards instead allowing for beautiful full-color card artwork for each of the miniatures and using icons to represent their attacks and abilities.</p>

<p>Realistically you still end up with the same, or more things to keep track of but I'm all for not needing to cram lots of tiny text onto cards. The Warband cards also contain some story context and how each Warband is inspired.</p>

<p>One disappointing aspect of how the game is packaged is that after putting together your Warbands there's no way to fit them in the box without it bulging out. A simple solution to this is to remove the bases off the larger minis (The Embergard) and just reassemble the next time you're wanting to pull it out to play.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-emberwatch.jpg?itok=vyYSlnGS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-emberwatch.jpg?itok=GOy8OV-- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p>With each player picking a Warband <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> is a skirmish game. Players take it in turns moving their characters according to their stats around the game board working to simultaneously complete Objectives, while also hindering their opponent from completing theirs, or just trying to kill them.</p>

<p>The game is played out over just three rounds with very limited turns meaning that every step, or misstep, has a chance to shift the momentum of the game. Each round is comprised of each player getting to take four turns, and then each of these turns is made up of an Action Step and a Power Step.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-battle-setting.jpg?itok=BP2CLoqu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-battle-setting.jpg?itok=6JxZo3iO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This means that in Round 1 you'll have Player 1 start, take their Action and Power step, and then Player 2 will take their Action and Power step, before it moves back to Player 1. This pattern will repeat until Player 2 has taken their fourth turn which will signal the end of the Battle Round with an End Phase.</p>

<p>The Action Step focuses on what's on the board in front of you, while the Power Step gives you a chance to activate cards from your hand or special abilities.</p>

<p>Gameplay, as well as the instructions, have been incredibly streamlined and it's now nowhere near as high a barrier of entry for a new player interested in getting started in the world of <em>Warhammer Underworlds.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h2>New Players Rejoice</h2>

<p>I've spoken in the past about how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4a60a44-5c6a-4787-be2e-abd18b18f684" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-starter-set-2023-review"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> can be complicated to get started</a>, but once you have it the pace speeds up. After praising the last Starter Set's ability to include an example game to teach you the mechanics this box does the same.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-instructions-and-quick-start.jpg?itok=ep8VOTUL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-instructions-and-quick-start.jpg?itok=c8mNgNUA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The two-page Quick Start document shows you an example layout, how to set it up yourself, and how the first Action and Power step would function. There's even an included video link.</p>

<h2>Warbands And The RIvals Decks In Action</h2>

<p>The major benefit of having all of the thematic mechanics now on a Warband card is that no matter what deck you play a Warband with they will still retain their core mechanics. Yes, this does mean the complete removal of Warband decks.</p>

<p>The Emberwatch is a trio of powerful Fighters that are all about launching the offensive. Each has a massive amount of health and will do all they can to mow down your opponents Warband as quickly as possible. Becoming inspired based on being in enemy territory even their abilities are about placing themselves in the middle of the action and dealing additional damage at a moments notice.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-skaven.jpg?itok=02BgApzf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-skaven.jpg?itok=iId18sRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alternatively, Zikkit's Tunnelpack is a group of five Skaven fighters who inspire if one of their Warband takes damage or is killed. Leaning into this mechanic the greater numbers are combined with more fragile units. You'll want to sacrifice some to empower the rest here.</p>

<p>It's an interesting juxtaposition to include both of these Warbands in the same box. The strength of one side channels into empowering the other. This makes this pairing a unique battle to see whether your own growth can outpace the growth that you're allowing your opponent to reach.</p>

<p>The four rival decks have their own unique gameplay mechanics that when combined with the different Warbands create for a wholly unique experience. These don't just change how you might approach combat in <em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> but also how you'll navigate the board.</p>

<p>The Emberstone Sentinels Rivals Deck is all about completing objectives related to holding Treasure Tokens across the board, these are specific territories. The Blazing Assault Warband instead promotes a Warband's offensive capability.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-rivals-decks.jpg?itok=cy6NEV0M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-underworlds-emberguard-rivals-decks.jpg?itok=rNaeQaDa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Warhammer Underworlds Embergard</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em> has always been a fun experience at my table, but whenever I've had to bring a new player in teaching the game has always been a daunting tasks. With the release of <em>Embergard</em>, even though it's not specifically a Starter Set aimed at those who have never played before, it does an incredible job setting up the players for success.</p>

<p>With new interactions between Warbands (and their constant abilities) and the different Rivals Decks changing the desired play style this also sets up this edition for success as new Warbands appear and Rival Decks are released each will be more compatible with one another.</p>
