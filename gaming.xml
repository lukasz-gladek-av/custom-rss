Microsoft has confirmed sweeping changes - including price increases - to its Xbox Game Pass subscription service in the run-up to October's release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will include the removal of day one releases for its basic tier.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-major-changes-with-a-new-tier-without-day-one-games-and-a-range-of-price-increases">Windows Central</a>, which says Microsoft has now confirmed the details, the first big Game Pass change comes with the imminent closure of the $10.99/month Xbox Game Pass for Console. While this will continue to be available to existing members until their subscription expires (notably, from 12th September, Microsoft will only allow users to stack Game Pass for Console for up to 13 months), new users looking for a basic tier package will need to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Standard, which launches in September.
</p>
<p>
This costs $14.99/month and includes Xbox Live Gold plus access to Xbox's back catalogue - but not, crucially, access to day one games. That means console players wanting to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 via Game Pass when it launches on 25th October will need to subscribe to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

<p>
Ultimate will also remain the only Game Pass subscription tier offering access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, but there's a price increase coming here too, with Ultimate set to rise from $16.99/month to $19.99/month. Things are a little bit different on PC insofar as PC Game Pass will continue to get day one games, but its price is also increasing - this time from $9.99/month to $11.99/month.
</p>
<p>
There's one additional price increase to note: Xbox Game Pass Core (formerly Xbox Live Gold) will see its annual cost rise from $59.99 to $74.99, but its monthly price remains $9.99. Recurring billing prices for all Game Pass offerings increase from 12th September, according to Windows Central.
</p>
<p>
All this follows Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">confirmation in May</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be a day one Game Pass release when it launches in October. Following reports that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/there-will-be-changes-to-xbox-game-pass-when-call-of-duty-is-added-says-industry-insider">planning "changes" to Game Pass</a> to take advantage of Black Ops 6's arrival, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-be-locked-behind-a-new-xbox-game-pass-tier">told Eurogamer</a> the game would be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members" at launch. And that still appears to be true - albeit now with an additional cost, and not if you're a new Xbox Game Pass Standard subscriber.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-concept-art-making-of<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/homeworld-3-pc-review-impressions-blackbird-steam-rts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I reviewed <em>Homeworld 3</em> recently</a>, and while I had a great time with the game, my overriding emotion as the credits rolled was that it was just nice to be back. Back in the cold depths of space with some very familiar-looking starships that, for 25 years now, have been the most distinctive and <em>coolest </em>in all of video games.</p><p><a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/02/the-art-of-homeworld-enjoy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I've posted about the older games'</a> art a <em>lot </em>over the years, and one of the most reassuring things I remember about <em>Homeworld 3</em> when it was first revealed was that, yup, it looked just as good. That shouldn't have been a <em>huge</em> surprise--many of the team at developers Blackbird didn't just work on the 2016 prequel <em>Deserts of Kharak </em>but the original games themselves--but still. When such a huge part of your series' appeal is its iconic ship design, it was great to see that the new game's vessels were very much cast from the same mould.</p><p>Given how much I love these little (and very big) ships, I thought it would be neat for<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this instalment of Platform</a> to not only showcase a bunch of art from the game, but chat with some of the artists responsible for it about the pleasantries (and challenges) of adding to the legacy of such a hallmark series.</p><hr><figure></figure><h5><strong><a href="https://www.artstation.com/kpod">KARL GRYC</a></strong></h5><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Hi Karl! What was your role on the game, and what did that involve?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Karl Gryc</strong>: I am the Art Director for <em>Homeworld 3</em>. My primary responsibility is to oversee the creation of all in-game art and ensure it is aligned with the franchise's established aesthetic and future. Initially I collaborated closely with Rob Cunningham and Aaron Kambeitz (<strong>Luke's note</strong>: both artists on the original game, and Cunningham is now Blackbird's CEO) to understand and absorb their vision for the game. From there, I worked with a talented art team to bring that vision to life. I split my time between guiding the art team and personally building many of the environment locations and lighting. Ultimately, the role requires wearing many hats and having fun while creating an incredible-looking game.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: What's your history with the series as a fan?</strong></p><p><strong>KG</strong>: This might be a familiar story. My history with <em>Homeworld </em>dates back to the start of my career. I remember playing the original <em>Homeworld </em>and being blown away by its aesthetic. At the time, it was unlike anything I had ever seen in video games, and it inspired me to take an art career seriously. Relic Entertainment was my second job out of film school, and that's where my journey with the series truly began. In those early days at Relic, I would immerse myself in the concept art created by Rob Cunningham and Aaron Kambeitz, soaking up all their experience with the series. Decades later, I was fortunate enough to work with them directly, literally in Rob’s garage, crafting a small project that eventually evolved into <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: <em>Deserts of Kharak</em> itself is now somehow eight years old. How much of your work there influenced what you came up with for <em>Homeworld 3</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>KG</strong>: It's wild to think that it's been eight years. It's incredible how vividly I remember those early days on <em>Deserts of Kharak</em>. It doesn't feel that long ago, and the work we did on those vehicles is still very dear to my heart. We put a lot of effort into ensuring everything felt true to scale while also being aesthetically pleasing. The shape language we developed—how shapes feel and how lines flow—had a significant influence on <em>Homeworld 3</em>. It was less about adhering to tropes and more about bringing life and character to mechanical designs. This approach to visual design continues to shape my work to this day.</p><figure></figure><hr><figure></figure><h5><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/brennanpierre/?hl=en">BRENNAN MASSICOTTE</a></strong></h5><p><strong>LP: Hey Brennan. What was your role on the game?</strong></p><p><strong>BM</strong>: As a concept designer, it's usually the case at Blackbird that I hop in with Aaron Kambeitz to work on the art for the pitch and pre-production inspiration for our IPs. We had some big ideas to sell in <em>Homeworld 3's</em> pitch, like the flat flying wing mothership, the new stealthy ship language and space terrain. From there I mostly generated ship ideas and helped develop the fleets as they evolved over time.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: What's your favourite piece of work you did on Homeworld 3?</strong></p><p><strong>BM</strong>: The Hiigaran Destroyers turned out really nice and mean looking. The basic hull has quite an aggressive stance which makes it feel authentically military to me. I've always been a huge fan of Aaron's older resourcer units so getting to put my spin on the new ones was a dream come true.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>LP: What was it like trying to balance the legacy of the series' art style with the need to create new units and settings for <em>Homeworld 3</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>BM</strong>: With the ships in particular it was important to preserve enough of the overall roles and stances players expect, but bring the designs forward a few decades. To do that we tried to take the older ideas and make them sleeker and more aggressive feeling. The Mothership is a great example because it retains so much of the core idea, but feels like a flying knife chiseled out of stealth angles. Aaron has been developing and refining the style of the <em>Homeworld </em>ships for decades and I think we had confidence that the direction was awesome enough people wouldn’t mind some creative divergence.</p><figure></figure><hr><figure></figure><h5><strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/paulchadeisson/?hl=en">PAUL CHADEISSON</a></strong></h5><p><strong>LP: Hello Paul! When did you first come onto the project, and what kind of work did you do once onboard?</strong></p><p><strong>PC</strong>: I first came in the project during pre-production. My initial task was to examine what some of the different missions of the game might look like. Most of <em>Homeworld 3</em>'s levels already had some illustrations and designs done for them, but they also needed a slightly different look. It was awesome to be able to play with all of Blackbird's material, tons of concepts and designs had already been made so I just had to bounce off their existing ideas and experiment of combine with new stuff!</p><p><strong>LP: Were you a Homeworld fan when you were younger? If so, what was it like getting the chance to work on the game now?</strong></p><p><strong>PC</strong>: I knew about the game when I was in college, from people in my class, they just kept talking about this "Homeworld" game, but I had no idea what it actually looked like since I had no computer at the time! Years later, when I was working on my own video game <em>Strike Vector</em>, my friend and programmer Cédric Lecacheur started showing me some <em>Homeworld </em>games, and my memories connected when I heard the title, then finally got to discover all the games! To me, <em>Homeworld</em> has some of the most original visuals and design; it was amazing as an artist to join such a team, and learn with the best!</p><p><strong>LP:</strong><a href="https://aftermath.site/paul-chadeisson-solstice-5-short" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong> Like we've talked about previously</strong></a><strong>, you're a big fan of stuff that's BIG. What was it like working on <em>Homeworld</em>, where there's so much big stuff, but that scale can sometimes be hard to portray in space?PC</strong>: </p><p><strong>PC</strong>: Blackbird had already done a lot of visual research before I joined the project, and had found a very good balance on how to represent those megastructures in space. It was very refreshing, and opened a lot of creative gates in my own ideas for art direction. The ideas behind what you're trying to represent go on to influence everything else--the shapes, the scale, the texture--and you need to make sure everything makes sense. Focusing on just doing something at a big scale is not an easy thing to do; rather, you need to find the appropriate shape and scale to a specific design, try to have something that makes sense.</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-hands-on-adols-next-adventure-is-filled-with-action-vikings-and-boats<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Same ship, different day.</h2></div><section><p>Per the series’ longstanding tradition, Ys X: Nordics, the latest chapter in the long-running action-RPG saga starring Adol Christin, has left fans in the West waiting quite a long time before they can get in on the fun. Thankfully, that wait is about to end, and after an hour hopping between various sections of the game to check out its dual-combatant action, get a taste of its all-important story, and even try my hands at the new naval battle system, I’m inclined to think this seafaring tale might end up being worth the customary localization delay. By swapping out the usual larger party seen in recent Ys games for just two characters, Nordics benefits from a more focused experience, whether that be its action-packed combat or its seemingly more concentrated story. Those changes proved more than enough to reignite my interest in this longrunning odyssey.</p><p>If you’ve somehow managed to avoid Ys (pronounced like “ease”) for the past 37 years, this series follows the dramatic adventures of a young adventurer named Adol, most of which involve a whole lot of swashbuckling sword fights and larger-than-life stories. Ys X: Nordics brings him to the viking-inspired Obelia Gulf to fight against undead creatures called the Griegr, and make a new warrior princess friend named Karja. If you’ve missed some entries in the series though, fear not, as each adventure is mostly self-contained, and as this one takes place after Ys II from way back in 1988, you won’t be expected to learn too much anyway. I was basically caught up on everything I needed to know after a quick cutscene introducing a couple returning characters and ready to beat up a giant, evil salamander in typical Ys fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ys X: Nordics Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Each Ys game brings its own particular style, and Nordics is no exception. The biggest change is the decision to move away from the typical party system found in more recent entries, opting instead to focus on just two characters: Adol and Karja. This impacts everything from the combat, which has been tuned around these two mighty warriors, and the story, which even early on already felt like it would be much more focused than some previous Ys entries.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest change is the decision to move away from the typical party system found in more recent entries, opting instead to focus on just two characters: Adol and Karja.</p></div><p>Combat was smooth, quick, and even a little challenging, as I was expected to swap between Karja, whose nordic strength made it a breeze to peel off enemy armor, and good ol’ Adol, who I used to deal finishing blows once my opponents had been stripped of their defenses. There were far too many menus and upgrade options for me to get a good grip of things during my brief demo, but it was clear to me there’s quite a bit to master, like learning the joint attacks I was able to unleash after building up enough mana.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That focus on the story’s two protagonist has an impact on the plot too, as Falcom president Toshihiro Kondo told me, “By limiting it to only two characters that you do more with, it actually allowed [the development team] to do more with that because they knew that they could focus everything on [Karja].” As someone who can get exhausted by convoluted stories with too many characters to follow, that was music to my ears.</p><p>There’s a more practical reason too: the smaller scope. As Kondo-san told me, “We wanted to put this one on the [Nintendo] Switch, and when you have that many party members, there’s kind of a limitation on the console itself.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an Ys game without some new mechanic to shake things up, and in Nordics, that mechanic – true to the viking vibes it's got going for it – is naval combat. In the short bit of it I played, I fought off waves of enemies with cannonfire, while targeting shield generators to power down a force field protecting an island. This goofy section definitely was amusing, with cannonballs cartoonishly homing in on their targets, but also a bit overly simplistic, feeling more like a minigame than something substantial, and I can’t really see myself enjoying too much more of it over the lengthy campaign. That said, it’s hard to say how much this will evolve over the 20+ hour runtime, and it’s quite possible it will build up into something with more meat on it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Xbox maker has started emailing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers warning of a price increase to $19.99 a month that starts on September 12th, a $3 increase over the current $16.99 a month pricing.</p><p>PC Game Pass subscribers will also see a price hike in September, with the service moving from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and maintaining access to day-one titles. If you’re outside the US and wondering how the price increases affect your own subscription, Microsoft has a full list of all the <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf">worldwide price changes here</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">price increases</a> come just before Microsoft plans to add <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and other big first-party Xbox games to its Game Pass service later this year. The price increases will largely affect Ultimate subscribers who make up the vast majority of Game Pass subscribers and come just over a year after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/21/23768400/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xbox-game-pass-price-increase">last Game Pass price hikes</a> raised rates by $1–$2 per month.</p><p>Alongside the Ultimate and PC Game Pass price hikes, Microsoft will also offer a new option of an Xbox Game Pass Standard subscription without day-one titles that will be priced at $14.99 per month for new users to the service. The existing Xbox Game Pass for console subscription will continue for existing subscribers, but new Game Pass subscribers won’t be able to select the console option starting July 10th until the new Game Pass Standard subscription is available. Microsoft says Xbox Game Pass Standard “will be available in the coming months.”</p><p>The new standard option also include online console multiplayer access, which is something that Xbox Game Pass for Console lacked previously. Existing Xbox Game Pass for Console subscribers will only be able to stack for up to 13 months from September 18th, but this won’t impact existing stacks.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans">I revealed in May</a> that Microsoft was considering raising Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pricing again, amid a debate around adding <em>Call of Duty </em>to the service. A price increase to the top tier will help offset Microsoft adding Activision’s <em>Call of Duty</em> series to Game Pass, and it has been largely expected since Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">made the <em>CoD </em>addition official</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As is now pretty much tradition, Sony's latest batch of PlayStation Plus catalogue additions for Extra and Premium subscribers have been leaked ahead of an official reveal, with Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion, Remnant 2, and more all reportedly on the way.
</p>
<p>
That's according to ever-reliable leaker billbil-kun who, writing for <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/playstation-plus-extra-premium-juillet-2024-voici-un-apercu-des-nouveaux-titres-qui-vont-bientot-rejoindre-le-catalogue-de-jeux-54974">Dealabs</a>, says Sony will refresh its PlayStation Plus Extra catalogue on 17th July, adding the following titles:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 Reunion</li>
<li>Remnant 2</li>
<li>Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord</li>
<li>No More Heroes 3</li>
<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes Complete Edition</li>
<li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous – Enhanced Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>
Billbil-kun adds that Remnant: From the Ashes, the first game in developer Gunfire Games' Remnant series (unless you count Chronos), is also likely to be part of July's Extra catalogue additions, but says they're currently unable to confirm that with 100 percent certainty.

<p>
Additional July titles for Extra subscribers and this month's selection of Classic games for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers - which Billbil-kun has not yet been able to identify - should reportedly be announced by Sony this Wednesday, 10th July.
</p>
<p>
But while we're still waiting for official confirmation on this month's Extra and Premium catalogue additions, Sony <em>has</em> announced the titles it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-headlines-playstation-plus-games-for-july">making available as part of its basic PlayStation Plus Essential tier</a> in July. Borderlands 3, Among Us, and NHL 24 are all on that list and are available to download right now, until Tuesday, 6th August.

						<h5>QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox</h5></div></div>
					<p>When they started emerging on the market, leverless controllers were considered a niche option. However, they quickly gained a lot of popularity in the fighting game community thanks to some of the clear advantages they provide compared to traditional gamepads and arcade sticks, advantages that are balanced by the time required to become proficient with such an unconventional setup.</p>
<p>Following the release of multiple gamepads, including the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/qrd-spark-n5-controller-an-affordable-solid-choice/">QRD Spark N5</a>, Chinese manufacturer QRD has now launched its first leverless controller, the <a href="https://qrdgame.com/products/qrd-maestro-s3-all-in-one-wireless-arcade-stick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox</a>. Like the other controls it has released so far, this controller is a solid proposition thanks to its price and unique features.</p>
<p>At first glance, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox leaves an excellent first impression. The build quality is extremely solid, possibly even more than similar controllers in the same price range ($169.99). Coming only in an elegant black color, the controller features the standard 12 buttons seen in most hitbox-style controllers, six additional smaller buttons (share, turbo, options, q, which is used to switch between some of the controller's unique features, L3 and R3), a front USB Type-C port, and a side headphone jack, which, alongside wireless support, makes the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox rather unique, as these are niche features found in very few leverless controllers, and definitely not in this price range. With an 800g weight and an L300*W200*H31mm size, the controller feels very comfortable to use, whether placed on a hard surface or on the legs. The nine single-color LED lights are a nice touch, and they don't impact battery life too much, which lasts around 8 hours. Charging the battery to the fullest takes around 3 hours, which is in line with pretty much every wireless controller on the market. While having a wireless option is great, however, it is currently limited as Xinput is only supported via a wired connection, but this is unlikely to be an issue for most competitive players, as, while the wireless connection works quite well, a wired connection is always preferred to reduce input delay as much as possible.</p>
<p>What is definitely an issue for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players is the lack of support for these formats, as a converter is required to use the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox with current generation consoles. This is definitely the controller's biggest issue as, while PC is becoming the platform for fighting games, in-person tournaments still use the PlayStation 5 as the platform of choice, so those who purchase the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox will have to purchase an adapter to be able to use the controller in these situations.</p>

<p>It is a shame the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox doesn't support PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S out of the box because it is, honestly, a pretty great controller. Both wired and wireless setup was painless on PC and Nintendo Switch, and even on an Android device. The controller is actually a pretty viable option for mobile gaming, thanks to the included mobile attachment accessory, although I can't think of a case where someone might want to play with a hitbox-style controller on mobile, with the exception of some retro gaming. The hot-swappable mechanical switch buttons are extremely accurate and much more silent than, say, the standard Sanwa buttons, which is a definite plus for late-night players such as myself. Despite being more used to arcade sticks and pads, it did not take long for the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox to click, and I expect the controller to become my controller of choice for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> once I feel more confident with it. The controller worked great in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">Tekken 8</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/guilty-gear-strive-smells-underbaked/">Guilty Grear Strive</a> as well, with no noticeable input delay with both wireless and wired connections or any other sort of issue.</p>
<p>Much like other leverless controllers, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox comes with multiple SOCD cleaning modes. The first one, which is also the mode the controller has enabled by default, returns a neutral input when holding down left and right simultaneously and an up input when holding up and down. The second mode returns a neutral input with both opposite directions held down, which is the SOCD cleaning mode required to participate in any Capcom Cup event, so, primarily playing Street Fighter 6, it is the mode I am using and the one I suggest ever Street Fighter 6 player to use. The QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox also comes with unique latency settings - Automatic, Low Latency for older arcade games, Medium Latency for more recent arcade games and emulated games, and High Latency and Highest Latency for modern and future games. To give these latency modes a proper try, I have used the Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection as well, and I felt that Automatic worked well enough and just as well as low latency, so it seems a solid option to start with before proceeding to switch between other modes in case there are issues. I haven't encountered any across all of the games included in the collection, and the aforementioned Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, and Guilty Gear Strive using Automatic mode, so I'll definitely stick with it for longer.</p>
<p>The QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox also comes with one more unique feature, EZ-Mode, which should clean up inputs for better execution. Despite having limited experience with leverless controllers, I noticed no real difference with Z-Mode, as I had no trouble doing consistent DPs and quarter-circle motions using any SOCD mode. This could possibly be helpful for players new to the genre as a whole, but for a somewhat experienced player, it did not make much of a difference, if at all.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox is an excellent leverless controller that is more than worth its price tag, thanks to its solid build quality, silent buttons, wireless support, and additional features like latency features. Sadly, the lack of support for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S is a major issue that will prevent the controller from becoming a more popular choice, but if you primarily play on PC and want to try out a solid leverless controller without breaking the bank, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox is undoubtedly the controller to get.</p>

<p>With its ease of use, silent and accurate buttons, and unique features such as multiple SOCD cleaning modes, Latency Modes, wireless support, and a headphone jack, the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox offers more than similar leverless controllers in the same price range. Unfortunately, the lack of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S compatibility prevents the QRD Maestro S3 Wireless Hitbox from being a universal choice for fighting game players, as an additional purchase of a converter is required to use the controller with current-generation consoles</p>

It is the second of four seasons planned as post-launch content for the game following its release in late January.</p><p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's second season receiving a delay comes as the game has struggled with player retention following its release earlier this year. At launch, the game was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">panned by critics and players</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> spoke to multiple sources who revealed that the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">a troubled development cycle</a>. The report alleges that Warner Bros. executives told staff at Rocksteady Studios that they expected Suicide Squad to become a billion-dollar franchise; after the game flopped, many members of the development team are reported to have shifted to development work on a director's cut of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>. </p><p>Despite many of the staff at Rocksteady apparently moving onto another project, a WB spokesperson told IGN last month that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-will-complete-its-currently-announced-roadmap-but-warner-bros-quiet-on-what-happens-after">it plans to complete</a> its already announced post-launch roadmap.

                <p>Pale Ale is an artisan good that you can make in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> by processing a specific crop. Not only is it a lucrative item to sell, but it's also a quest item that Pam requests during the first summer of your game. In addition to that quest, it is a favorite gift of Pam and a liked gift of many other villagers.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to make Pale Ale</h2><p dir="ltr">To make a Pale Ale you will need two things: <strong>Hops and a Keg</strong>. Hops can be grown in summer by purchasing and planting a Hops Starter from Pierre. It takes 11 days for the starter to fully grow, and it will repeatedly produce Hops after that point. Hops grow on a trellis, meaning that you cannot walk through the plants, so you will need to set up your crops in a way that you can access all of the plants.</p>

Kegs can be crafted once you reach Level 8 Farming using 30 Wood, 1 Copper Bar, Iron Bar 1, and 1 Oak Resin.

The Joy-Con controllers retail for about that much on their own, and the game is usually around $40 to $50 when it’s on sale, so the game is effectively free.</p><div><p>You can essentially get<em> Super Mario Party</em> for free when you buy a pair of Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch. The game remains one of the most attractive and expansive <em>Mario Party</em> titles to date, with four boards and a staggering collection of 80 minigames.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17931854/super-mario-party-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Party</em></a> for Switch (the 11th in its long history, though there’s a newer title in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"><em>Mario Party Superstars</em></a>) offers four-player fun with 80 different minigames, from racing and sports to puzzlers and gladiator-style rumbles. There’s a mix of new and classic boards and games to enjoy, all of which are completely playable with just a single Joy-Con per player (including a sizable amount that use the controllers’ motion capabilities). You can play with up to four people in free-for-all or team-based formats, whether you’re online or hosting a couch co-op night.</p><p><em>Super Mario Party</em> has a fun mix of Nintendo characters to play with. You have iconic mainstays like Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Princess Peach, of course, but you’ll also find characters from popular series like <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Splatoon</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. You can earn several unique dice blocks for each with special abilities or improved odds to roll the numbers you need. </p><p>To win, you’ll need to acquire more stars than your opponents before the turn or time limit expires. As you move across the board, you’ll claim bonuses and powerups that may help you land on lucrative squares that can earn you more stars. You might also land on squares that aren’t so helpful to your plight.</p><p>Between the skill-based minigames, boosts and busts you can encounter on the board from random dice rolls, and last-minute swings that can completely turn the tide, no two games of <em>Super Mario Party</em> ever feel quite the same. Be careful playing with loved ones — there’s a good chance your friendly rivalries can turn a little bitter as you continually settle the score.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Overwatch 2 is getting a new collaboration where you can see your favorite heroes as Transformers. Only a few skins are being brought into the game. If those skins aren't interesting to you, there will also be specific Transformers collectibles that are limited-time items you can access</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuIzTKzyuog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official trailer</a> for the collaborative event has been released. In it, you can see some of the skins and items in action. If you are excited to see your favorite heroes take on a new look, you can get stuck into the Transformers event as of July 9.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what skins you can get your hands on, here are the details below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optimus Prime x Reinhardt</li>
<li>Bumblebee x Bastion</li>
<li>Arcee x Illari</li>
<li>Megatron x Ramattra</li>
</ul>
<p>Bastion's Bumblebee skin is adorable, and you can see him turn from a vibrant yellow robot to a tiny car. It's perfect for any Transformers fan who wants to give their main a new flair, while Illari looks adorable as Arcee in pink and white.</p>
<p>It's very fitting to see Reinhardt as Optimus Prime and the skin makes perfect sense for the justice seeker. If these skins seem like something you want, you can snap up an Overwatch x Transformers Mega Bundle by collecting all of the collectibles and the skins.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to see more of these heroes as your favorite Transformers. In that case, Blizzard has <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/media/stories/transmission/">uploaded a comic</a> where you can see how the alliance between <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/">Overwatch heroes</a> and Transformer Autobots came into play and how Ramattra managed to get contacted by the Decepticons as they discovered the alternate universe of Overwatch.</p>
<p>Ramattra was then offered as much Cybertronian technology as he needed and more. Of course, the Autobots learned about the Decepticons' plans to wreak havoc and teamed up for the first time with the Overwatch heroes to stop the world from being destroyed. Whether there will be further Transformer collaborations adding more of them to the game remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up the Transformer x Overwatch bundle?</p>

These episodes are supposed to differ from seasons—which delivered weekly narrative beats via a mixture of cutscenes and repeatable activities— in a number of ways, such as the ability to tell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230">more exciting standalone stories</a></span> and mix up the cadence in which they are delivered. However, when the first act of the ongoing episode launched shortly after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-impressions-1851521089&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-impressions-1851521089"><em>The Final Shape</em></a></span>, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s climactic expansion, players were disappointed to find that very little actually changed. Bungie is now trying to make amends by changing the formula, as promised.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Instead of drip-feeding stories for weeks like it has always done, Bungie will be releasing all of the story content for the acts at once. Thismeans that when the next episode, titled Heresy, arrives in a few months, all of the content for its first act will drop at once.</p><p>This cadence will continue through the rest of the episode. Now, rather than get three weeks of story content slowly meted out, and then another three weeks to work through it before the next act, players will be able to go all out at launch. I’m torn on whether or not this is a great call. As someone who struggles to keep up with the weekly grinds, and hates coming back for pieces of a narrative, the move kind of resonates with me. Being able to bang it all out in a weekend sounds like a dream come true, and allows me to carve out more time for other pursuits rather than treat every login like an appointment.</p><p>However, I know that there’s a subset of folks who enjoy having a reason to come back regularly. When that’s not there, it’s easy to get your fill, fuck off, and claim that the game is dead when it doesn’t get new content for more than a month at a time. Moreover, releasing all of the content at once feels like a recipe for disaster to the developers, who will very likely need to put up with fans of the game harassing them over a perceived drought every six weeks.</p><p>Yes, it is true that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-seasons-upset-echoes-1851564928">Echoes’ first act was a bit of a letdown</a></span>. When it landed, players expected something—literally anything different—and instead they were treated to what was essentially a reskinned season. Echoes’ first act appeared like a dull retread of the past rather than the sweeping evolution of the seasonal model that players were promised. But I’m not entirely sure that releasing all of the story content at once will liven things up. Folks want the game to feel fresher, rather than repeat the same cycle of experiences they’ve played for years now, and changing how often story beats are delivered doesn’t <em>really </em>respond to that critique.</p><p>For now, Echoes will continue the weekly drip of stories throughout its remaining acts, and who knows, we may even learn to love it by the time the next episode rolls around. Bungie’s proved it’s pretty fluid in responding to its fanbase, and usually winds up in a good place after some iteration, so there’s no way to say for sure whether or not these changes stick around. We’ll just have to wait and see how well-received it is once it’s actually implemented in a few months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, I played several normal, casual matches of <em>Team Fortress 2</em> on public servers. This would not be unusual, but the game has been rendered <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely unplayable</a> in public for several years now. This has changed in the last week or so. “Are the bots gone?” I saw one player ask, to which several players immediately replied back, independently of each other, “For now.”</p><p>In June, the <em>Team Fortress 2</em> community made a second, gargantuan push to publicly embarrass Valve, negatively reviewing the game and pushing them to “#SaveTF2.” As of last week, it seems like all that negative press finally sunk in. Valve not only instituted a <a href="https://x.com/DidTF2GetUpdate/status/1806580927075901828" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive ban wave </a>for the game, but also introduced <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/37C7-829B-5DE3-CC3B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new FAQ page tailor-made specifically for <em>TF2</em> bans</a>. At the top of the page, in big red letters, they state “<em>Team Fortress 2</em> game bans are permanent, non-negotiable, and are not removed by Steam Support.” If you mess up here, you’re gone for good.</p><figure><figcaption>Valve to bots: Drop Dead. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>This is largely the language and tone I would expect to hear given the embarrassing scale of the problem. The gloves are off now, Valve does not seem to be messing around, and the results show. I spent several rounds playing good old-fashioned games of <em>TF2</em>. There were assholes, sure, but just the regular analog type. Every game was playable. I did not run into cheaters. I had a good time playing video games.</p><figure><figcaption>For now, the good outweighs the bad. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>As a result, there is now a <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/440#All" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive uptick in active players</a>, very clearly organic ones too. The reviews have gone from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1dxmpcz/after_the_ban_waves_tf2s_reviews_have_gone_from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“overwhelmingly negative” to simply “mostly negative.</a>” Reactions to the news from long term fans are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1dw108o/thoughts_on_this/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly positive, but cautious</a>. And for good reason! Valve has done ban waves in the past (see 2022), and simply banning cheaters and bots is not a permanent solution. Years of neglect cannot be healed in a week, and the type of problem they seek to address takes time and years of diligence, which Valve does not always have a spotless track record of. This is a community that has been burned before, and the official website of the movement, <a href="http://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">save.tf</a>, has recommended players proceed with caution. As one player put it, “let see if it sticks first.”</p><figure><figcaption>save.tf remain cautious. Credit:<a href="http://save.tf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> save.tf</a></figcaption></figure><p>For now, <em>TF2</em> is still the goofy, fun, low-stakes experience it always was. I went in and played engineer (my main), a little badly. I wasn’t the only one; a lot of the other players who hadn’t been hunkering in private servers were clearly trying to find their sea legs again. For now, the game is playable, and I truly hope it remains that way. I hope that Valve realizes how many people love this game and actively want more. Because I don’t think my heart could take it to see the game rot away one more time, and I think a lot of people feel the same way.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was in the heat of the moment that I responded the way I did and of course that is no excuse, so again my deepest apology for my unrespectful behavior.”<br></p><p>Of course, because this is the internet in 2024, people began picking sides. Many sided with the Reddit user and review-bombed the game or left negative comments. But some others sided with the developer, claiming that the response wasn’t that bad and praising the small dev for pushing back against a negative review. </p><p>As for Koentjuh, the Reddit user who posted the review in the first place, they told me that they have yet to hear back from Valve after filing a report against the developer and the comment on July 6. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<article role="article" about="/tabletop/news/kp-upadhyayula-launches-project-dastan-indian-focused-actual-play-on-backerkit">
<div>
<div><p>Today, performer and cultural consultant KP Upadhyayula launched a crowdfunding campaign for Project Dastan. It is an ambitious project designed to uplift diverse voices within nerd culture. Furthermore, it is one of the first projects under a new creative-owned platform, Moonbeam.</p>
<h2>The Project Dastan Backerkit Campaign</h2>
<p>According to its campaign page, the goal of <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/kp11-studios/project-dastan?ref=bk-discover-search">Project Dastan</a> is to produce the first TTRPG actual play show in India. The show will feature local talented artists, writers, technicians, and producers, including professionals from Bollywood and Tollywood. The show's campaign will be in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2e</em></a>, and draw inspiration from the culture and history of India and South East Asia.</p>

These include Project Director Upadhyayula, whose work includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/eldritch-automata-cosmic-horror-mecha-ttrpg-blows-up-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Eldritch Automata</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/crooked-moon-gets-over-10000-funded-on-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Crooked Moon</em></a>, and Creative Director Amaan, co-host of <em>The Infinite Tavern</em> podcast.</p>
<p>The campaign also has support from larger companies within the tabletop community. These include Paizo Inc, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll20</a>, DriveThruRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/we-talk-about-digital-ttrpg-tools-candela-obscuras-and-demiplanes-future-with-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Demiplane</a>, and Foam Brain Games.</p>
<p>Besides producing an actual play, Project Dastan wants to promote the creative and storytelling prowess of people from around the world. To directly quote the campaign:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a time when creators are endangered due to AI, corporate layoffs, exploitive streaming platforms, etc, we hope that we can be a place for mutual growth for our creators, not just through visibility but also through monetary support.</p>
<p>On top of that, we hope to use this momentum to help create the very first, high-production value Indian TTRPG actual play, using studios IN India, as well as local talents and crew. We want to tell an authentic story, while also showing the world that there is so much that the non-western world has to offer!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This creative community-driven ethos pairs with the fact that Project Dastan is being cross-promoted alongside Backerkit campaign: <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/collections/the-moonbeam-collection">Moonbeam</a>. Moonbeam is a new creative-owned, tabletop focused live streaming platform. One dedicated to creator and community empowerment and fair monetization.</p>

            <p>
Vampire Survivors, the minimalist survival RPG from developer Poncle, is joining Apple Arcade in August, along with Temple: Run Legends and  Vision Pro update for Castle Crumble.
</p>
<p>
Vampire Survivors has, of course, been available on iOS as a free-to-play release for some time, but its Apple Arcade version (Apple Arcade being Apple's £6.99/month game subscription service for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV) will be ad-free and include some paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/vampire-survivors/id6478975337">Vampire Survivors+</a> (the '+' being Apple's way of denoting a game has previously been available on its App Store, usually with in-app purchases) will bundle in its Legacy of the Moonspell and Tides of the Foscari paid expansions. Whether the game's Emergency Meeting and Operation Guns DLC, both currently available for Vampire Survivors non-Apple Arcade release, will show up for subscribers at a later date isn't yet clear.
</p>

<p>
Vampire Survivors+ joins Apple Arcade on 1st August, and it'll be accompanied by <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/temple-run-legends/id1670483159">Temple Run: Legends</a>. This new version of the popular endless runner is the first game in the series to introduce levels, and will feature 500 of the things in story mode, alongside 10 different playable characters, leaderboards and achievements support, plus special events. Oh, and there's an endless mode if you start to feel nostalgic.
</p>
<p>
And finally for August's Apple Arcade additions, albeit arriving later on 29th August, there's that <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/castle-crumble/id1616814625">Castle Crumble</a> update for Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-unveils-3499-augmented-reality-vision-pro-headset">Vision Pro mixed reality headset</a>. The core game is a physics-based puzzler in which players attempt to destroy castles across different eras - including Ancient, Medieval, and Aztec - by flinging spells and explosives at them. The Vision Pro version is that but in "spatial" form, enabling players to "tear down fantastical castles with every swish and flick of their fingers, and in any physical space they desire."
</p>
<p>
So yes, Apple Arcade subscribers can expect the above to join the service's approximately 200-strong games catalogue this August.
