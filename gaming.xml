            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-frostpunk-2-its-not-the-cold-thats-your-enemy-but-human-nature">Frostpunk 2</a> is being delayed so its developers have time to address player feedback gathered during the beta earlier this year. The survival citybuilder was originally due to begin shovelling orphans into the furnace in July, but those dear children now have a reprieve until September 20th.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Based on the surveys we received from you after playing, the average rating you gave the Beta was 8 out of 10," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4203628368742496775">the announcement of the delay</a>. "We’re super grateful for that! At the same time, the Beta was only a small slice of a work-in-progress, still growing game. While our backlog is plentiful, the Beta was an opportunity for us to listen to what you enjoyed, and what didn’t quite land yet. This allowed us to prioritize things better, and bring to the front the features and modifications we were already working on (we hope!) you’ll enjoy the most."
</p>
<p>To deliver those newly prioritised features and "guarantee the best possible experience at launch," 11bit say they need more time.
</p>
<p>The full announcement goes into some detail about the changes that are being introduced since the beta, and they don't sound small. Temperature and heat-based systems, a core part of the Frostpunk experience, are being revised. A new resource is being introduced to make city-building "more strategic". Players will be able to modify city districts after they're first constructed. Faction behaviour will more closely align to their lore. The UI is being revamped to make the world more readable. 
</p>
<p>11bit are also adding a new feature they call "Zoom Stories", which will let you snap closer to your city in order to "watch the day-to-day life of your citizens." The aim is to make players feel more attached to those orphans as in the short spell before you shovel them into the furnace.
</p>
<p>Matt Cox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2-reveals-a-wasteland-thats-more-about-wheelin-and-dealin-than-mere-survivin">enjoyed his time with the Frostpunk 2 beta</a> back in April, finding it "quite promising" after playing a relatively "small sliver" of the full game. We'll now need to wait longer before we find out whether that promise has been fulfilled.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-do-better-justice-to-its-settings-americana-thanks-to-the-new-boston-studio-says-cdpr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHBpEDCZMvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new episode of the AnsweRED podcast</a> mainly focuses on a chat with the developers leading the work on Project Orion, the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, and what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly built Boston studio</a> can bring to the game.&nbsp;Acting Executive Producer Dan Hernberg explained:</p>
<p><em>I think Cyberpunk is obviously a uniquely American story. It's got a lot of like punk energy, and it was written by an American, so it just seems right to do it in America.</em></p>
<p>Associate Game Director Paweł Sasko also shared a specific example: Cyberpunk 2077, which was made in Poland, had the wrong manhole covers for a US-based city.</p>
<p><em>There's this interesting story after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 that blew up on Reddit at some point, and it's the manhole debacle. Like, the manholes that are covering the roads, right? There was this post with the guy saying that there is this immersive breaking bug in Cyberpunk, and the bug was about the fact that the covers for manholes for a sewer were the manholes that you use normally in Europe, in Germany, for a pavement. Those are not manholes that you normally cover in America on the streets.</em></p>
<p><em>This is basically showing you the differences, right? When you go to America, there's things like hydrants, where they are placed and how they look like. The street lights, the positions of that, the trash bins, right? They're in the front of the house, right by the street. In Poland, in Europe, you don't see it almost anywhere. There's so much nuance. Dan, when we talk about it, he calls it the Americana.</em></p>
<p>Dan Hernberg then said:</p>
<p><em>Our curbs are different, our color is different on all of our signs. Everything's just slightly different.&nbsp; It doesn't break immersion, but it's just that little thing where you're like, "Well, maybe this wasn't made by people who live here or people who fully understand all of American culture."</em></p>
<p><em>I also think that being in America, it allows us to have those cultural touchpoints with the larger American, you know, kind of influence with Hollywood. Obviously, Cyberpunk 2077 took place in LA, and so there's just kind of all these cultural touchpoints and things that we can kind of interact with, whether that's from music or story or just different parts of America that are interesting to explore.</em></p>
<p>One of the perks of the Boston studio is that CD Projekt RED will be able to tap into the North American talent pool, including graduates from high-profile universities like Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Moreover, they are collaborating with the existing Vancouver studio on Project Orion, with Hernberg teasing that the Canadian team is working on some 'really cool stuff' for the sequel.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is undoubtedly going to take a while to materialize. That said, CD Projekt RED obviously built the new studio specifically to build the game in parallel with the new The Witcher saga. Indeed, the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-aims-to-increase-the-cadence-of-game-launches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aims to speed up the cadence of its game releases</a>, so you can hold on to that hope of playing Orion within this decade.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s beloved driving MMO, The Crew, was taken offline on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 31, 2024</a>. But the game’s community hasn’t given up; some are yet pushing hard to revive the game. In a heartwarming display of dedication, a group of passionate modders, Whammy 4, have announced their commitment to resurrect the title. </p>



<p>Their upcoming project, The Crew Offline+Online Server Emulator, showcases their unwavering love for the game. Through this project, they aim not only to restore the game to its former glory but also to add new features that the developers never did, giving the community a renewed sense of hope.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-business">Back in Business</h2>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ubisoft-shut-down-the-crews-servers-this-group-of-modders-began-work-to-bring-them-back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> interviewed a member of the Whammy4 team, and they spoke more about the project. The member stated that the team had begun work on their project as soon as Ubisoft announced The Crew’s closure in December 2023. </p>



<p>The member said that their project retains the same game everyone knows and loves, but instead of using Ubisoft’s servers, the community will have to use Whammy4’s servers to access the game. Whammy4 recently released a new video on YouTube: The Crew – First Roadtrip After The Shutdown.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Crew - First Roadtrip After The Shutdown" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIo4l-BpK8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The Whammy4 member then speaks about game preservation, stating that if things keep on going the way they are now, then pretty soon, most video games that players love will become dead video games. Hence, game preservation should be the utmost priority “before the situation spins out of control.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Returning to The Crew, Whammy4 talks about how this is the only title where players get to cruise around a scaled-down and open-world version of the United States of America, and “to give up on such a remarkable game would be a crime.” Whammy4 believes they should be able to get the project up and running for the franchise’s 10th Anniversary, which arrives in December 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft revealed The Crew Motorfest’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-motorfest-year-2-plans-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Year 2 plans</a> earlier this month. Are you excited about The Crew being revived? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/27/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>As BioWare prepared to show me the character creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in its Edmonton, Canada, offices, I expected something robust – it's 2024, character creators have come a long way, and Bioware has a rich history of good customization. Despite my expectations, I was not prepared for how robust it actually is in Veilguard. Robust enough, even, that BioWare used it to create most of the NPCs in the game, save for mainline characters like companions. Setting hyperbole aside, it is a staggeringly rich creation system, and I look forward to seeing player-created near-replicas of celebrities and monstrous creations that'd be more at home in a horror game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I'm also looking forward to the community's reaction to the Dragon Age series' best character creator yet. At the heart of it is inclusivity, Veilguard game director Corinne Busche tells me before letting me guide her through creating my own character.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="25af3836-ce01-4d19-ba05-b9c3fa20f533" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>As is usual, there are four races to choose from: Elves, Qunari, Humans, and Dwarves. After selecting Qunari, Busche pages through various presets, explaining the game allows for more detailed looks at each and the ability to choose pronouns with she/her, he/him, and they/them separately from gender, select different body types, and more. You can view your character, referred to as Rook in-game, in four different lighting scenes at any time, including The Veilguard's keynote purple hue, a bright and sunny tropical day, and a gothic night.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I joke with the team that after spending upwards of an hour creating my Dragon Age: Inquisition character in 2014, I immediately restarted the game after seeing him in the first cutscene; the in-game lighting made my hair color look terrible amongst other issues I had with my Inquisitor. Veilguard creative director John Epler says the team is aware of countless stories like that with Inquisition and its green-hued character creator, adding BioWare worked hard to squash that concern in Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Head and body presets can be selected individually and customized to your liking with 40 different complexions that include smooth, rugged, youthful, and freckled skin tones, skin hues ranging from cool to neutral to warm, undertones to those skin tones, and even a melanin slider. Busche tells me BioWare relied on consultation to represent all people authentically. There's a Vitiligo slider (where you can adjust the intensity and amount of it) and sliders for your forehead, brow, cheeks, jaw, chin, larynx, and scalp. You can select your undergarments, with nudity as well because "this is a mature RPG," Busche adds, and use the "Body Morpher" to select three presets for each corner of a triangle and then move a cursor within it to morph your body or head into a mix of these presets. It's an impressive technology I'd like to see adopted in other games.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>I can keep going: You can adjust height, shoulder width, chest size, glute and bulge size, hip width, how bloodshot your eyes are, how visible cataracts are, the sclera color, how crooked your nose is, how big its bridge is, the size of nostrils and the nose tip, and there are as many sliders, if not more, for things like Rook's mouth and ears. On ears alone, I see you can adjust asymmetry, depth, rotation, earlobe size, and even add cauliflower ear to your Rook. Busche says makeup blends modern stylings with the fantasy of Dragon Age with more than 30 options, including eyeliner intensity, color, glitter, eye shadow, lips, and blush.</p>

<p>Tattoos are just as customizable alongside options for scars and paint. Tattoos, scars, and paint are very culturally relevant to some lineages, BioWare tells me, with unique tattoos for elves, for example. You can add tattoos to Rook's face, body, arms, and legs, and you can adjust things like intensity, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im most impressed, however, by the hair options on display; there are a ton, and as someone with long hair, I'm especially excited about the fun selections I can make. You can finally dye your hair with non-traditional colors, and it's gorgeous. EA's Frostbite engine uses the Strand system to render each style fully with physics. "The technology has finally caught up to our ambition," Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes says.</p>

<p>After customizing all of that and selecting our Qunari's horn type and material (of which there are more than 40 options to choose from), it's time to pick a class out of the Rogue, Mage, and Warrior – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/25/breaking-down-dragon-age-the-veilguards-classes-and-factions">read more about Veilguard's classes here</a>. Since we built a Qunari, we went with Warrior. For the penultimate step of the character creator, at least during the demo BioWare shows me, we select a faction. Out of the six options, we select the pirate-themed Lords of Fortune.&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="a6dade5c-c48d-4b2d-ac89-eae180556205" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>"Rook ascends because of competency, not because of a magical McGuffin," BioWare core lead and Mass Effect executive producer Michael Gamble tells me in contrast to Inquisition's destiny-has-chosen-you-characterization.</p>

<p>"Rook is here because they choose to be and that speaks to the kind of character that we've built," Busche adds. "Someone needs to stop this, and Rook says, 'I guess that’s me.'"</p>

<p>Ready to begin our Rook's journey, we select a first and last name and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine options. There's a pitch shifter for each voice, too, allowing you to tweak it to your liking further.</p>

<p>Don't stress too much about locking in your character creations before beginning the game – the Mirror of Transformation, which is found in Veilguard's main hub, The Lighthouse, allows you to change your physical appearance at any time.&nbsp;However, class, lineage, and identity are locked in and cannot be changed after you select them in the game's character creator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From here, we're off to Minrathous, and you can read more about that famed city in our cover story, which is available <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2024/06/18/the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-digital-issue-is-now-live">here</a>.</p>

  <p id="DvX0dH"><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em> isn’t so much a spinoff and prequel of John Krasinski’s 2018 horror movie as it is a riveting drama that plays in the series’ sandbox. You can spot the odd bit of new world-building here or there, about just how and why there are so many damn echolocating aliens, but these tidbits are just background noise (<em>shh, not so loud!</em>) to a much more interesting human story. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/9/17216604/a-quiet-place-parenting"><em>A Quiet Place</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22459067/a-quiet-place-part-ii-review"><em>A Quiet Place Part II</em></a> are rural sci-fi horror, but <em>Day One</em> — from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/7/26/22594110/new-movies-watch-pig-nic-cage-netflix-blood-red-sky"><em>Pig</em></a> director Michael Sarnoski — moves the setting to New York City and crafts its story in the vein of large-scale disaster cinema. It’s likely the best Manhattan mayhem film since <em>Cloverfield</em>, and it’s also a downright excellent Hollywood blockbuster, if an entirely unexpected one.</p>
<p id="UdjTtO">A first-time indie filmmaker being subsumed by the studio system can be cause for concern — it’s usually a sign they’ve been hired to execute a board room’s vision — but <em>A</em> <em>Quiet Place: Day One</em> has Sarnoski written all over it, as a genre filmmaker who finds emotional resonance where most might not think to look. <em>Pig</em>, which initially seemed like “<em>John Wick</em>, but with a chef and his beloved sow,” proved surprisingly thoughtful in its unraveling of grief, a sleight-of-hand gambit that applies to Sarnoski’s horror threequel, too. <em>Day One</em> is as much about confronting oblivion as it is about confronting aliens, for reasons the movie’s seemingly omnipresent trailers have avoided revealing.</p>

<p id="K2OUdu">When <em>Day One</em> opens, its lead character, the former poet Sam (Lupita Nyong’o), is wasting away in a hospice facility, frustrated by her terminal cancer diagnosis, and searching for any reason to lash out. She has just weeks to live, if that, which makes her an especially intriguing centerpiece in a film like this one. Whether she survives the movie is barely relevant, compared to how the experience of living through the end of the world as we know it will change her. The plot’s possibilities are finite, but the film’s emotional possibilities are endless, even within the series’ sci-fi confines.</p>
<p id="tnjHbX">The beats of the previous Quiet Place movies are present, but simplified: giant, insect-like monsters viciously kill anyone who makes noise. Everyone who doesn’t die in the first wave figures this out quickly, without burdening the audience with a guessing game where we already know the answers. But the movie is set so far in the series’ past — several years before the <em>Quiet Place</em> characters find the aliens’ weakness — that there’s practically no hope for a solution, or for humanity to fight back. At no point are these extraterrestrials framed like slasher-movie serial killers, with creeping one-on-one encounters the humans might possibly win. They function more like a force of nature, an inevitable doom sweeping through the streets of Manhattan, akin to an unrelenting hurricane attracted to noise. </p>
<p id="AjBp3j">Not only is New York the worst possible place to be when this specific apocalypse hits — the movie’s opening text claims the city’s average noise pollution is 90 decibels, the same as a human scream — but it’s a particularly thorny place to set a disaster movie in general. Like<em> Cloverfield</em>, though, <em>A Quiet Place:</em> <em>Day One </em>doesn’t shy away from the specter of 9/11, and the indelible news footage that came out of it. When the city becomes ground zero for the invasion, Sarnoski immediately envelops the characters in a disorienting cloud of dust.</p>

<p id="zkYDsH">The film, it turns out, is as much about New York as it is about the characters and the series’ central gimmick. Sarnoski treats the city’s neighborhoods and architecture as a distinct terrain. (Though he takes liberties when it comes to subway station design — New Yorkers will have a lot to say about those.) By the end, the film isn’t just about New York’s history; in subtle ways, it’s about people’s personal relationship to a changing urban landscape and the memories it holds. Some spaces, in <em>Day One</em>, are just spaces; they’re dull and functional. But some, which hold specific meaning, are presented with an ethereal glow. </p>
<p id="doiUTz">The spectacle of vehicles being tossed helter-skelter and familiar landmarks being damaged beyond repair is a key part of any disaster film’s allure. Sarnoski imbues these traditional visual cues with immense emotional weight, though, by focusing on how people would realistically react to experiencing them. This trajectory seems strangely idiosyncratic at first. When Sam visits the city with her cat, Frodo (a cute reference — they’re an inseparable pair), on a bus full of fellow patients chaperoned by kindly nurse Reuben (Alex Wolff), she’s intent on eating her favorite slice of New York pizza. This also remains her objective even when everything goes to hell.</p>
<p id="RXxKHr">That may seem like a joke about New Yorkers’ claims of culinary superiority, but the film is on Sam’s wavelength. Her arduous journey from downtown Manhattan to a specific Harlem pizza place is quickly established as an emotionally rooted fixation, a response to the immense trauma she’s facing. If she’s going to die, she wants to do it on her own terms, even if that means charging headfirst toward certain death for a small but familiar comfort.</p>

<p id="8AS1uY">On her way uptown, she runs into an English law student, Eric (Joseph Quinn), who, rather than evacuating, decides to follow her for a reason that seems equally ridiculous. He winds up as the film’s emotional backbone. Sam’s diagnosis had already turned her world upside down: The alien invasion reads like an external manifestation of her spiritual chaos. Eric’s life, by contrast, was on a straightforward path, but the experience of nearly dying on day one shakes him to his core.</p>
<p id="fbvw9m">Survival instinct as a broad concept is a decent enough character motive for a disaster movie, but Sarnoski anchors this idea in simple but powerfully relatable stimuli. In Sam’s case, it’s the specificity of memory. (The pizza place has a deeper significance than is immediately apparent.) For Eric, it’s the simple act of connecting not with Sam, but with Frodo. Under the circumstances, either of these motives is reason enough to push forward, in spite of the emerging complications.</p>
<p id="N6mSGh">As usual for Quiet Place movies, the action is built around moments where the characters want to escape, which clashes with the need to stay absolutely silent. Few theatrical experiences beat the tense realization of<em> </em>Quiet Place sequences where someone inadvertently makes a noise. But the way <em>Day One </em>frames the human voice is a powerful masterstroke. Between Sam’s intense pain as she runs out of medication and Eric’s intense trauma from recent events, the characters don’t just have to avoid making sounds while moving. They instead have to suppress their natures, their primal need to scream as their lives crumble around them. </p>

<p id="MCu1CK">The movie’s tension remains razor-sharp for lengthy periods, but this is also broken up by sweet moments of release as the characters find isolated ways to interact. Quinn, with his limited dialogue and numerous silent scenes, exudes a sweet, sympathetic vulnerability that takes him to difficult places as a performer. Nyong’o, though she punctuates Sam with moments of abject terror, maintains a stern resolve, which comes with some deeply moving layers.</p>
<p id="mqqKEu">While there’s no hint of traditional Hollywood romance between Eric and Sam, <em>A Quiet Place:</em> <em>Day One</em> is deeply romantic in its depiction of two frightened souls caring for each other, with emotional and physical intimacy born from sheer instinct, as the world tips past a precipice we know it won’t return from. In the process, Sarnoski and his leads turn what could have easily been facile personal pursuits into the most important thing either character will ever do. </p>
<p id="oyOuqP"><small><em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em></small><small> is in theaters now.</small></p>

This game, and <em>Final Fantasy</em> as a series, is often incredibly self-serious— it’s always about saving a world from a cosmic evil, which is pretty intense. <em>Dawntrail</em> seems determined to ignore all of that and give us a chance to vibe out with a drink and a fluffy alpaca on the beach. I deserve that. I mean my Warrior of Light deserves that. I can’t wait.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another franchise is heading for the remake machine as Ubisoft has confirmed that Assassin’s Creed remakes are on the way. </p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the studio’s website</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemont says that the Assassin’s Creed series would see a number of games in the future, including remakes.</p>



<p>“Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we’ve created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin’s Creed games that are still extremely rich,” he said.</p>



<p>“Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin’s Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin’s Creed Hexe, which we’ve announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </p>



<p>“We’re going to surprise people, I think.”</p>



<p>He didn’t confirm what remakes are coming, but Insider Gaming has reported on the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag remake in development. That game is under the codename Obsidian. On top of that, Insider Gaming has seen brief footage of Edward Kenway in the remake under the condition that it not be shared.</p>



<p>As far as the engine being used for the Assassin’s Creed remakes, it will be using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-exclusive-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Anvil Pipeline” engine</a> that Insider Gaming first reported on back in March. This isn’t a completely new engine, but is a major evolution in what Ubisoft studios are able to do when developing the game and required substantial changes to the in-game animations, parkour, and more.</p>

Hardware-wise, this is the exact same SSD as the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bP0ve" target="_blank">2TB SK Hynix P41 Platinum</a> (Solidigm and SK Hynix are the same company) which means it is <strong>one of the fastest PCI-E 4.0 SSDs on the market</strong>. This is an outstanding candidate for either your PlayStation 5 console or your gaming PC rig.</p><h2>Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB M.2 SSD for $119.99</h2><p><em><strong>PS5 compatible</strong></em></p><div id="179680" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Solidigm P44 Pro 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD (up to 7000Mbps)</h3></p></div><p>Solidigm is the US-based subsidiary of SK Hynix. SK Hynix might not be as recognizable as Samsung or Western Digital, but make no mistake that they are a major player in the flash memory market. SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's third-largest semiconductor company. They supply components for brands like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Solidigm P44 Pro is based off the SK Hynix P41 Platinum, which is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read and write speeds of 7,000MB/sand 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read and write speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, this SSD has been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. Solidigm backs it all up with a 5 year warranty. Unlike most other SSDs, both the chips and the controller are manufactured in-house. The P44 Pro uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips. </p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs. Other top-tier SSDs include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z446D" target="_blank">Samsung 990 Pro</a> and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/X641Y" target="_blank">WD Black SN850X</a>. It really just comes down to which one you can get the cheapest. At its current price point, the P44 Pro isn't just one of the fastest drives on the market, it's also cheaper than any competitor that can come close to its performance.</p><h3>A great PS5 SSD, but you'll need to get a heatsink</h3><p>The Solidigm P44 Pro does not come equipped with a heatsink. That's because this SSD is catered to PC gamers looking to add storage to their desktop computer. Many motherboards come equipped with built-in SSD coolers and will only accept bare SSDs. It's generally harder to remove a heatsink than to apply a new one. If you plan to use this for your PS5, we recommend you install your own heatsink for peace of mind. You can easily get a <a href="https://zdcs.link/OGrjj" target="_blank">PS5 heatsink for under $10</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 27, 2024 5:35 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valentine's Day may have already passed, but love is still in the air in EA's latest expansion pack for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>. Titled Lovestruck, the new game expansion features a number of new ways for Sims to romance each other (and, of course, new items and clothing pieces to help set the mood).</p><p dir="ltr">Launching on July 25, Lovestruck introduces a new locale to The Sims 4: Ciudad Enamorada, a romantic in-game world with three distinct neighborhoods where Sims can buy (or build) homes, visit romantic bars and hotels, and experience the world's unique collection of special festivals and events. There's even a new lot trait called Singles Hangout that will attract Sims who haven't yet found their better half.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326023" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326023"></a><figcaption>The Lovestruck expansion pack includes a romantic new world called Ciudad Enamorada.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326023-ls1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4326015,1300-4326016,1300-4326017,1300-4326018,1300-4326019,1300-4326020,1300-4326021,1300-4326022" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326015-lovestruck.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326016-ls1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326017-ls2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326018-ls3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326019-ls4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326020-ls5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326021-ls6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4326022-ls7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Lovestruck adds a new app to each Sim's phone: Cupid's Corner, The Sims 4's version of Tinder. Sims can create their own Cupid's Corner profile and browse other Sims' profiles. Some Sims are looking for love, while others may not be so quick to commit.</p><p dir="ltr">A new "Create A Date" function will also be included in the Lovestruck expansion pack, allowing players to customize dates, decide which in-game goals they want to complete on said dates, and create the perfect night out (or in) for their love-seeking Sims. Lovestruck also deepens the complexity of Sims' relationships with a new system called Relationship Dynamics. Relationship Dynamics mean Sim romances can now be labeled as Wholesome, Steamy, Strained, or Unpredictable, which will naturally have some interesting in-game consequences.</p><p>The Sims 4 Lovestruck expansion pack will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2815270/The_Sims_4_Lovestruck_Expansion_Pack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for $40 USD</a> when it launches on July 25.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alpha-protocol">Alpha Protocol</a> disappeared from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidian-spy-rpg-alpha-protocol-de-listed-from-steam">digital store shelves back in 2019 due to expiring music licenses</a>. Back in March, some four years later, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/obsidians-espionage-rpg-alpha-protocol-returns-to-store-shelves-after-four-years-in-license-hell">returned via GOG</a>. Now it's once again also available via Steam.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You'll find the spy RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/34010/Alpha_Protocol/">over on Steam</a> at a 20% discount for the duration of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-2024-summer-sale-is-now-live">just-launched Steam summer sale</a>.
</p>
<p>I have to assume this Steam re-appearance is the same version that's also available on GOG, which included not only the return of the licensed music that prompted its disappearance in the first place, but also controller support, cloud saves and achievements. 
</p>
<p>Alpha Protocol was developed by Obsidian, who these days are owned by Microsoft, but Alpha Protocol itself is still home at original publisher Sega. Whether the 2010 action RPG is actually any good is a matter of some debate: Alice0 called it her favourite Obsidian game, but I've seen as many people argue that it's janky trash as that it's one of <em>those</em> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-average-action-games-on-pc">seven out of tens</a>. 
</p>
<p>I have no opinion of my own, having not played it, but I know it's a favourite of enough of you commenters that its appearance on Valve's storefront seemed worth acknowledging. Please start a vibrant but polite argument about its relative merits in the comments.</p>

            <p>You can tell when a major Steam sale goes live, because the Steam store stop loading. If you can make it past the "something went wrong" message you'll find that the Steam summer sale is now underway.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This year's event includes a page of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/special_deals">"featured deep discounts"</a>, which highlights "especially great deals on some of the all-time greats." 
</p>
<p>They're not wrong. Many of the games on the page are 90% or even 95% reduced, and it includes Celeste for £1.67, Civ VI for £2.49, Total War: Shogun 2 for £2.49, The Witcher 3 for £2.49, and Bloons TD6 £1.17. I suppose the catch is that these games are so great that there's a good chance you already own them, but if not you can map out the rest of your gaming year with change from a £10 left over for a bag of crisps.

<p>There are more discounts than I can highlight here, so we'll put together a more robust roundup tomorrow. I will say that there are a lot of recent games on my Wishlist that are 20% reduced, including nunventure Indika and ballwhacker TopSpin 2k25, while train 'em up Sweet Transit is 50% down, Pacific Drive is 40% off, and Surmount is 33% discounted. Cor. 
</p>
<p>Don't be fooled: I'm not going to buy any of these games, because I didn't have time to play them before, and I don't suddenly have time now that they're cheaper. They'll also be even cheaper at some point in the future, so I'm not going to fall for the FOMO. You shouldn't either; just look at all the games already in your Steam library that you haven't played yet. 
</p>
<p>The sale runs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">over on Steam</a> until July 11th. Be strong, you can do it, I believe in you.</p>

While that mode included respawns, others didn’t, with rounds ending if a team was wiped out. According to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a></span>, that includes Cargo Run, where players compete over a package, and Clash Point where they fight over control for a specific area.</p><h2 id="h16077"><a id=""></a>I hope you like double (and triple) jumps</h2><p>Each of the 16 Freegunners (heroes) will have a unique kit of stats and abilities, and there are even light deck-building mechanics for customizing your bench of heroes before each match. One thing most of the Freegunners have are double jumps. According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, some even have triple jumps. They also have dodges that momentarily pull the camera out into a third-person view.</p><h2 id="h16078"><a id=""></a>There are no ultimates or supers</h2><p>Unlike <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Valorant</em>,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> reports there are no ultimates in<em> Concord </em>(or supers if you’re <em>Destiny</em>-pilled like me). Each Freegunner has two unique abilities, like the giant robot  1-Off that can suck up trash, as well as one passive. But there’s no meter charging up over the course of the match to let you wreck havoc on the opposing team.</p><h2 id="h16079"><a id=""></a>Players can deploy structures to help them that stick around</h2><p>What <em>Concord</em> does have, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/27/concord-feels-like-destiny-meets-overwatch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/27/concord-feels-like-destiny-meets-overwatch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game Informer</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/concord-game-preview/#systems-yet-unseen-concord-39-s-quot-deckbuilding-quot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/concord-game-preview/#systems-yet-unseen-concord-39-s-quot-deckbuilding-quot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Screen Rant</em></a></span>, are abilities that deploy equipment that lasts between rounds unless it’s destroyed by your enemies. This light build mechanic where players can try to control certain areas of the map with persistent shields, healing pads, and other advantageous structures is definitely something that could add a novel layer of tactics to arena fights.</p><h2 id="h16080"><a id=""></a>What makes<em> Concord </em>unique?</h2><p>To the degree that Sony’s hero shooter has a standout gimmick, it seems to be the way character switching works during matches. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/concord-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> reports that players expand their roster by “rescuing” different characters, and can only take six of them into any given battle. However, when they swap between them during rounds or respawns, they get to add the previous dead character’s class bonus to their current one, providing over 100 different combinations of bonuses to play with at any given time.</p><h2 id="h16081"><a id=""></a>Post-launch updates will be free</h2><p>Firewalk Studios has already talked about how it plans to release a new cinematic teaser for its in-game characters and universe every week. Now the studio has also confirmed that future content updates will be free. Here’s the exact language from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/27/concord-beta-dates-announced-beta-early-access-launching-july-12/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a></span>: “experience just some of the content that will be available when the game launches on August 23 and will grow over time through post-launch updates at no additional cost.”</p><h2 id="h16082"><a id=""></a>Microtransactions will only be cosmetic</h2><p>Priced at $40 just like <em>Helldivers 2</em>,<em> Concord</em> is somewhere between the current freemium model of <em>Overwatch 2</em> and the old full-priced loot box mode of the original <em>Overwatch</em>. Firewalk Studios assured <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span> that the only paid microtransactions in the game will be cosmetic. “There are purely cosmetic pieces that you can choose to further customize the look of your character, that you can choose to purchase,” the studio told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>. “Those do not affect gameplay. We believe so strongly that the full experience should be available to all of our players.” It sounds like new maps, characters, and modes will be free and available to everyone who owns the game.</p><h2 id="h16083"><a id=""></a>Beta Early Access weekends are in July</h2><p>Players will be able to try <em>Concord</em> for themselves next month. The closed Early Access beta takes place on July 12 – 14 and requires pre-ordering the game to get into (one pre-order gets you five keys so only one person in your friend group needs to take the hit). The Open Beta that’s free to everyone takes place on July 18 – 21. During these betas, which are basically just demos, players will have access to all 16 Freegunners, four maps, and three modes. There’s also a $60 “deluxe” version of the game that gives players early access to the full game three days before launch on August 20. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mavix-m9-gaming-chair-provides-high-end-comfort-versatility.913650/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mavix-m9-gaming-chair/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A lot of gaming chairs today don’t have the kind of features and functionality as the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair. And with these features comes plenty of flexibility that allows for the kind of versatility that is hard to find in most gaming chairs within today’s expansive market.</p>



<p>Coming in at a price point at $999 for the base model and $1128 for the ELEMAX model, the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair comes in a wide range of color options, and wheel color options .This gives the the user plenty of options for maximum customization. The ELEMAX model is the Ferrari of the two which we had the pleasure of testing out features such as massaging as well as heating and cooling. As you can imagine, these high-end features provide for an array of comfort options.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A true S-tier experience. Our M9 gaming chair delivers overclocked performance and engineering, giving you the power to play on an entirely different level. The extra wide, ultra-comfortable seat and temperature-regulating fabrics let you game for hours without overheating while extended recline technology and action-inspired wheels keep you moving all session long.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-the-ferrari-of-gaming-chairs">The Ferrari Of Gaming Chairs</h2>



<p>When it comes to gaming chairs, the number one thing that people look for is ergonomics and comfortability. And after using the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair over the past few weeks, and even without using the Ferrari features the ELEMAX edition offers such as massaging and cooling/heating, I can happily report that this chair is extremely comfortable.</p>



<p>It provides extremely sufficient lumbar support thanks to Mavix’s Dynamic Variable Lumbar (DVL). With the DVL, it adjusts and contours to your body intuitively each and every time you move within the chair.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And when it comes to reclining, the Mavix M9 has you covered with a 127 degree arc angle in the fully extended recline. And the headrest, while somewhat difficult to adjust provides maximum comfort if you’re looking to relax or potentially even take a nap.</p>



<p>What makes this chair stand out though, is the cooling, heat, &amp; massage features known as ELEMAX. ELEMAX provides even more lumbar support to your chair enhancing it into The Final Boss of Gaming Chairs.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our innovative lumbar support technology cools you, warms you, loosens you and more — all with the push of a button.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dual internal fans circulate air, keeping body temps down and comfort up.</li>



<li>Fast-warming tech adds heat when the situation calls for it (up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>



<li>Two massage modes remove tension using a steady pulse and rhythmic vibrations.</li>



<li>Two massage levels let you dial up or down the degree of intensity.</li>



<li>Compatible with all Mavix gaming chair models.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>



<p>To use these features, the internal battery must be charged up with a USB charger. It comes with a USB charging card along with a wall charger to keep you focused on your gaming without the stress of the battery being depleted.</p>



<p>With all of these features, there are some shortcomings though and while the Mavix M9 gaming chair is very comfortable, I did find the wheels locking quite often when initially trying to roll on carpet. The wheels seem designed to move more freely on hardwood or tile flooring. The initial push or pull encounters some resistance, but after a second effort, the chair rolls where I need it to go, though it remains a slight annoyance when it comes to movement.</p>



<p>Overall, the Mavix M9 Gaming Chair is a very comfortable gaming chair and if you’re looking for a high end chair with the kind of features you would find in a high end luxury vehicle, this is absolutely the chair for you if you can handle the price point.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: Mavix provided an Mavix M9 Gaming Chair with ELEMAX for the purpose of review/impressions.</em></p>

It’s finally <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-ge800/">available starting today</a> for $599.99, although those excited to upgrade immediately can save $100 as part of a “limited-time launch promotion.”</p><p>Designed to take full advantage of the broader 6GHz wireless spectrum that Wi-Fi 6E first had access to, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23902812/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7 further increases speeds</a> by doubling the maximum channel bandwidth from 160MHz to 320MHz, allowing more data to be transmitted.</p><p>The Wi-Fi 7 spec also allows connections to span multiple bands with a feature called Multi-Link Operation (MLO). For example, a file can be downloaded on the 6Ghz band at 1Gbps and on the 5GHz band at 500Mbps, resulting in combined download speeds of 1.5Gbps. TP-Link boasts the new tri-band Archer GE800 can achieve wireless speeds up to 19Gbps by spreading data across the 6, 5, and 2.4GHz bands simultaneously.</p><p>Just keep in mind that you’ll need a Wi-Fi 7-compatible device like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23912370/google-pixel-8-pro-review-camera-assistant-magic-editor-best-take-audio-eraser">Google Pixel 8</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24053907/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-ai-screen-camera-battery">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, or recently announced laptops like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24025680/razer-blade-14-16-18-cpu-ai-display-updates-usb-c-dock">Razer Blade 16</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030533/lenovo-ces-laptops-legion-thinkpad-thinkbook">Lenovo Legion 7i</a> to take full advantage of those speeds. None of the current crop of gaming consoles support Wi-Fi 7.</p><p>The Archer GE800 also features a pair of 10Gbps ethernet ports and four 2.5Gbps ports, with one serving as a dedicated gaming port that prioritizes network traffic from a connected console, although the Xbox Series X / S and PS5 only include gigabit ports. And because every piece of gaming hardware needs to put on an elaborate light show, the GE800 features multicolor lighting that can be controlled from a desktop app panel that also provides insights on router performance and the status of the network.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-3">Payday 3</a> launched last year to dismal reviews, due to bugs and features from Payday 2 that were absent in the sequel. One such piece of missing functionality was the ability to play alone or offline, but an update coming today makes some progress towards fixing that with the addition of "Solo Mode".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Solo mode lets people play any of Payday 3's heists alone by hosting the match on their own computer. Y'know, like all games used to let you do. The downside is that Payday 3's solo mode still requires an initial internet connection to access, so it's not a completely offline solution. Not yet, anyway - Starbreeze describe the mode as a "beta".
</p>
<p>Payday 3's servers are offline for around eight hours in order to implement the feature, which is just one part of a larger set of changes in what's called the Boys In Blue update. It also includes bug fixes, art improvements, and both free and paid items including weapons and cosmetics.
</p>
<p>The 'always online' nature of Payday 3 was an issue right from launch, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3s-launch-is-another-great-advert-for-not-making-your-game-always-online">players faced long waits to connect to servers</a>. Starbreeze immediately made changes to make it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-to-go-offline-temporarily-as-starbreeze-work-to-make-it-less-dependent-on-online">less dependent on those overburdened servers</a>. Unfortunately players didn't much like what they played of the game when they did connect, from its enemy AI, gun feel, level design, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starbreeze-will-rework-payday-3s-progression-and-xp-system-after-player-backlash">and especially its progression system</a>. Starbreeze formed a strike force to begin working through those issues, as part of a series of updates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3s-first-operation-medic-bag-patch-includes-300-fixes-and-an-unready-button">they've been calling Operation Medic Bag</a>. Alas, sales have been lower than expected, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-have-switched-ceo-six-months-after-disastrous-launch">the CEO of the studio has been replaced</a>, and its Steam reviews remain mostly negative.

So naturally, I wasn’t all too thrilled when it suddenly kept crashing before it even reached the main menu and nothing seemed to fix it. Verifying the game’s file integrity, reinstalling it, restarting Windows, casting spells and rituals in the forest. Nothing! Turns out, the problem for me and many other players was that we were using Nvidia driver 555.99.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,195840,196163" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Released on June 4, 2024, Nvidia Game Ready and Studio Driver 555.99 caused quite a bit of havoc for many fans of <em>Halo Infinite</em> as it rendered the game unplayable for most who had an Nvidia card and were timely with their driver updates. The workaround, of course, was to roll back to driver version 555.85. <em>Halo </em>developer 343 Industries acknowledged the issue early on. It released a statement via the official <em>Halo</em> Support X account stating that it was working with Nvidia to be sure the issue wouldn’t persist into the next driver update. Thankfully, driver version 556.12 was released on June 27 and lets <em>Halo Infinite</em> launch and run without issue. </p><h2 id="h13545"><a id=""></a>How to update your Nvidia driver to play <em>Halo Infinite</em></h2><p>Odds are if you found your way to Nvidia driver 555.99, you probably know how to update your system to the latest version to get back into some <em>Halo</em>. If not, you can download the driver via Nvidia’s GeForce Experience app (which is how I prefer to manage my drivers), or by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">downloading the driver directly from Nvidia’s website</a></span>. The latter is a handy way to locate past drivers should you run into any other issues. </p><hr><p><br>While rolling back to the previous driver was the solution to playing <em>Halo Infinite</em> on a PC with an Nvidia card, it’s usually preferable to keep your machine’s drivers as up-to-date as possible. But now that 556.12 fixed the <em>Halo</em> issue, I have a can of Monster energy, an aggressively frantic metal playlist, and endless rounds of Husky Raid with my name on them.   </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We didn’t know what it was until May’s State of Play, where the sci-fi shooter opened the show and took up a large portion of the event. The game’s first big story trailer flopped online, with many unfavorably comparing it to <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-firewalk-release-date-trailer-1851510445&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-firewalk-release-date-trailer-1851510445">Some gameplay shown during the event</a></span> also didn’t go over well, with people online unsure if the world needs yet another 5v5 class-based hero shooter.

And according to the developer, all of that couldn’t be included in a short debut trailer. </p><p>“You’ll start to fall in love with the depth of the characters,” said Kreines. “That’s something that you learn week to week. Their personalities will unfold, their relationships will unfold for you, their backstories. None of that is something you can get in a tiny little slice.”</p><p>Still, she was excited that people watched the trailer and that there was a reaction to it, adding: “ I can’t wait for them to see more. To see everything that is there.”</p><p> Jon Weisnewski, lead character designer on <em>Concord</em>, seemed less interested in the initial reaction to the trailer and thinks players will be won over by the combat and gameplay. </p><p>“We have a team that is uniquely skilled at building very immersive and fluid gameplay that just feels tremendous in the player’s hands,” said Weisnewksi. </p><p>“The second they pick up the controller the game just comes to life. Like every action is responsive. And I’ve been a player of these games my whole life, these games are what I love to play, and I know that it’s all about how does it play, right. I want players to come into the beta, if they don’t like it after the beta that’s fine, but I think, yeah the the initial reaction is all about like, how does it actually play in your hands.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-price-leak-astro-bot-60-40-hero-shooter-f2p-ps5-1851522161&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-price-leak-astro-bot-60-40-hero-shooter-f2p-ps5-1851522161"><em>Concord</em> launches on August 23 for PS5 and PC with crossplay</a></span>.
