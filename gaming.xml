Australians have been asking for this for years — and Valve promised to make it happen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit">way back in November 2021</a>.</p><p>It’ll arrive <em>this</em> November in the same primary configurations Valve sells elsewhere: a 256GB configuration of the original LCD model, or 512GB and 1TB versions of the newer OLED model that also come with longer battery life, a better screen, and more. They’ll cost AUD $649, $899, and $1,049 respectively. </p><p>(While the OLED model does cost $250 AUD more than the original, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">it has so many important changes</a> that I’d personally recommend it over the LCD version to anyone who can afford it.)</p><p>While even the OLED model will be an entire year old by the time it arrives in Australia, there’s no current indication that Valve will release a faster, better version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">anytime soon</a> — and no handheld running Windows can currently match it for portable ease-of-use, even though some have an edge in performance and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> can also beat it in AAA gaming battery life.</p><p>That said, Valve may also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">bring its SteamOS to rival handhelds</a> like the Asus ROG Ally X before too many more months go by, and I’ve been very impressed when running Bazzite’s version of the SteamOS interface on my Ally X review unit (though it has its wrinkles).</p><p>If you’re at PAX Australia in Melbourne, you can try the Steam Deck at Valve’s booth today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a post on <a href="https://x.com/MAlbsimi/status/1844310455432642698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a>, he said that Microsoft had already made retailers aware that it would soon stop selling Xbox devices in Saudi Arabia.

You can see the statement in full below.</p><p>“Xbox devices are available in all current Xbox hardware supported countries, including Saudi Arabia,” Silverman’s said. “Console availability may vary by country but Xbox games can be played on consoles, PCs, and on phones, tablets or TVs where Xbox Cloud Gaming is available. Players can visit <a href="https://xbox.com/regions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>xbox.com/regions</u></a> to learn more about how to play with Xbox.”</p><p>While the statement suggests no new plans are in place, Microsoft’s gaming endeavors have seen a number of major shakeups in the last year alone. This includes widespread layoffs, which affected <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>1,900 staff in January</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff"><u>another 650 staff just last month</u></a>.

While the foundation of Xbox moves underneath its feet, Microsoft has pushed for other major changes to its gaming strategy, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5"><u>bringing some exclusive titles to other platforms like PlayStation 5</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>New Xbox Series X and S Models - First Look Images</h3></div></output><p>Still, Microsoft seems uninterested in pulling Xbox consoles out of Saudi Arabia for now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/football-manager-gets-delayed-to-hell-and-back-and-i-couldn%E2%80%99t-be-happier.1006842/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-sports-game-delay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It was <em>yesterday </em>that I was writing</a> about the stasis that major sports games find themselves in, with annual updates so minimal it's getting increasingly tough to see what's changed year to year. One sports game--<em>Football Manager</em>--had been looking to buck that trend in 2024, but sadly it has now suffered two major mishaps in quick succession.</p><p>The first came on September 4,<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when developers Sports Interactive announced</a> that the game's international management mode--where players can not just manage a club side, but a national team as well--was being canned so that they could get the main game out on time.</p><p>Now, today,<a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> they've said that <em>Football Manager 25</em> itself, which should have been out very soon, won't be out until March 2025</a>. That's not a huge delay for a normal video game, but for a sports game, where so much of the appeal is based on featuring the latest rosters and teams, it's a <em>colossal</em> blow.</p><p>The reason for both moves is pretty major: for the first time in a long time, <em>Football Manager 25</em> was rebuilding itself from the ground up. New engine, new menus, new layout, the works. It was a bold decision to make, but also a necessary one; like the sports games<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about yesterday</a>, <em>Football Manager</em> was starting to feel a bit stale, its sluggish menus and dated presentation making it look increasingly tired.</p><p>This delay will be a <em>huge </em>deal for the game and for its sales, because March is nearing the end of the European football season, which normally wraps up in May. Traditionally, like other football games, <em>Football Manager</em> would release towards the end of the calendar year, which was early enough to still play out most of the current season (which starts in Aug-Sep), while also allowing the game to be on shelves (physical or otherwise) in time for the holidays.</p><p>Nevertheless, I think this is <em>great</em>. Unlike other major sports games, Sports Interactive recognised their game's advancing age, made a bold decision to get with the times and stuck to it. It hasn't entirely panned out, sure, but a move like this isn't made for just one year, it's made for years and even decades to come, and so even if <em>Football Manager 25</em> doesn't really come together--and let's be real, given this delay there's a chance it may not come out at all--everyone involved in this decision still deserves an enormous amount of respect.</p><p>Especially when you consider how frank the team are in the announcement post, writing:</p><blockquote><div><p>In the previous blog we explained that it has been a difficult development cycle for the studio. Many things have been moving slower than we had predicted – despite everyone in the team working at an incredible pace to try and get everything done.&nbsp;</p><p>Timelines were already tight and, as rightly pointed out by many of your recent comments, we were simply rushing too much and in danger of compromising our usual standards. This has put an enormous amount of pressure on everyone working across the studio, who are all passionately committed to delivering the best game possible.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p>FM25 is the biggest technical and visual advancement in the series for a generation. We simply cannot compromise the delivery of this crucial juncture in Football Manager’s history by rushing to release it in November.</p><p>Of course, this is not where any of us expected to be seven weeks out from our release but, in the spirit of our studio values, we always consider the bigger picture – and the bigger picture here is that we need this additional time to deliver a game that we can all be proud of.</p></div><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Whatever happens to <em>Football Manager 25</em>, I'm a lot more optimistic about <em>Football Manager 26</em> and <em>27</em> than I am about any other big sports game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2024/10/7/24243316/epic-google-permanent-injunction-ruling-third-party-stores">US court ruling earlier this week</a> that forces Google to stop requiring Google Play Billing for apps in the Play Store on November 1st, Microsoft is ready to take advantage of the changes.</p><p>“The court’s ruling to open up Google’s mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility,” says Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255">in a post on X</a>. “Our mission is to allow more players to play on more devices so we are thrilled to share that starting in November, players will be able to play and purchase Xbox games directly from the Xbox App on Android.”</p><p>Google’s Android app store is an illegal monopoly, and the search giant has been ordered to open up the Play Store to competition for three years. This means no longer forcing developers to use its own Google Play Billing after a jury found that Google had illegally tied its payment system to its app store. Google will also have to distribute rival third-party app stores<em>&nbsp;</em>within<em>&nbsp;</em>Google Play.</p><p>Xbox store purchase support directly in the mobile Android app will allow Microsoft to sell Xbox games freely on Android devices, and integrated Xbox Cloud Gaming features mean people will be able to immediately stream games to their handsets after purchasing them. </p><p>It’s not immediately clear why Microsoft can’t already provide Xbox game purchases inside its Android mobile app, though. You can buy games from Steam or the PlayStation Store on mobile devices, so Microsoft has long been the exception here. I asked Microsoft for more details on the store changes, but the company says Bond’s statement is all it has to share right now.</p><p>Separately, Microsoft is also working on a browser-based Xbox mobile store that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/9/24153245/microsoft-xbox-mobile-gaming-store-july-launch">originally planning to launch in July</a>. The store will eventually focus on first-party mobile games from Microsoft’s various studios, but initially it will feature deals and in-game items. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24211805/where-is-the-xbox-mobile-store">Microsoft said in August</a> that testing had begun on the web-based mobile store and “work is progressing well and we will have more to share in the future.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, October 11th</strong>: Article updated to note Microsoft isn’t sharing any more details on its Xbox mobile changes on Android.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Splinter Cell Remake was officially announced in December 2021, with Ubisoft announcing that they were doing a remake of the 2002 title Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell. They announced that they were developing the game using the Snowdrop engine. This engine was also used to develop Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Star Wars Outlaws, both of which didn't perform particularly well for Ubisoft. After rumors swirling around for a significant period of time suggesting that the Splinter Cell Remake had been canceled, new rumors have reported that the Splinter Cell Remake is <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-toronto-managing-director-says-splinter-cell-remake-remains-in-stealth-mode/">continuing to progress</a> over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto is the one leading the remake development, and it announced the game with an interview on the Ubisoft website, alongside a video. However, that was over two years ago and there has been nothing posted by the company since the initial announcement.&nbsp; As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, it's rumored that the game is still being developed under the codename North. As stated previously, they are using the Snowdrop Engine to develop the game, whereas the previous Splinter Cell games in the franchise were developed using Unreal Engine 2 and Unreal Engine 2.5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splinter Cell Remake: Stepping Out of the Shadows | Ubisoft [NA]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When the game was first announced, it was said that the game was in the "very earliest stages of development." Compared to most games coming out these days that are remastering old games, Ubisoft has gone the route that Square Enix took with Final Fantasy 7 and has decided to do a full-on remake. As they have stated, they are building the game from the ground up, including creating new visuals, which means that the game is going to take an extensive period of time. Looking back to the example of Final Fantasy 7's remake, there are significant gaps between each release. The remake was first released in 2020, with Rebirth being released in 2024.</p>
<p>Because of how drastic the changes are and how they have stated that they are taking their time to make sure the visuals are linear to the original, it's possible that those excited for a high-fidelity remake of teenage nostalgia will take a bit longer. Some sources suggest that the Splinter Cell Remake will be released sometime in 2026, but there's no guarantee that there will be any news by that point, depending on what other projects Ubisoft is focusing on in the meantime.</p>
<p>In addition to the general development process, it's possible that the team developing the Splinter Cell Remake will be impacted by Ubisoft's financial insecurity right now, as well as the possibility of the company going private and receiving a change in CEO as well as potential layoffs. At the moment, it's anyone's guess as to what is happening with the Splinter Cell Remake, but we have to trust that the statement is correct and that the game is still in active development.</p>

That means it’s once again time to learn all about how Goku became the worst father of all-time. Wait, no.

<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is an interestingly placed Dragon Ball game. The last few games based off this long-running anime series have been an intensely competitive fighting game in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and a time-travelling constant What-If? scenario complete with co-op and custom characters in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/02/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review/">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a>. Those two games were inherently aimed at very different audiences in terms of raw gameplay, but ultimately, as a huge Dragon Ball fan, I’ve played a lot of both – as have a lot of people, I’d imagine. Also, there was a card game and a lot of mobile gacha games as well, but we’re not here for those.</p>


<p>Sparking! Zero sits more on the Xenoverse end of things than the FighterZ end, but really, it’s about throwing us back to the PlayStation 2-era Budokai Tenkaichi games. That means you get to transform in battle, you get to clash your beams against each other, and you get just so very many characters to mess around with. Sure, there are a lot of people who look like Goku here (or actually just are Goku), but to be fair to the game, that’s true to the source material.</p>


<p>The story is largely stuff we’ve all seen before, although the alternate takes on things are fun, especially as you get to make the conversational decisions yourself, and you’ll get to see a lot of What-If? stuff throughout the game, which is great. The key thing here though, is the combat. You’ll be mixing in melee strikes, ki blasts at range, and special skills as well. It’s standard Dragon Ball fighting stuff, but it’s the more granular things that help this feel like you’re playing an episode of the anime.</p>
<p>As long as you manage your resources well, you can teleport behind enemies as you get hit or deflect incoming energy blasts with a well-timed block. You can also switch in and out of different characters and even transform between different forms. Different characters have their own unique quirks to learn as well, so you’ll need to practice to be truly great, but if you master the basics, you’ll be able to make most characters look good in battle.</p>

<p>It’s all a lot of fun, but it does take time to get to that level, because the learning curve here can feel pretty steep, especially if you’re not familiar with the previous games in the vast Dragon Ball lineage. It’s worth pushing through though, because the result is one of the most joyful interpretations of Dragon Ball we’ve had in a long while, and while I don’t think it’s reinventing anything, it looks good, sounds good, and feels good to play.</p>

<p>The 2025 VCT season is right around the corner, and teams are beginning to assemble their rosters. With Valorant competitive already at an all-time high, many organizations are looking to sign the best players in the world. Popular esports organization, NRG, announces its official 2025 VCT roster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-official-nrg-2025-vct-roster-revealed">Official NRG 2025 VCT Roster Revealed</h2>



<p>It is a big day for Valorant fans, as NRG has officially announced its 2025 VCT roster, with some of the best names in Valorant revealed to be on it. </p>



<p>Five players; one team; NRG is looking to be one of the top competitors next season. Here is the team’s entire 2025 roster:</p>



<ul>
<li>s0m</li>



<li>FNS</li>



<li>Verno</li>



<li>Ethan</li>



<li>Mada</li>
</ul>



<p>With NRG not making it to the 2024 VCT Champions, the team seems to be preparing for a much more successful season in 2025. </p>



<p>Jumping from $40,000 in earnings in 2022 to almost $200,000 in 2023, the team saw barely any competition in 2024. 2025, however, looks to be a much better year for the popular esports organization.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-valorant-spotlight-series-emea-2024-schedule-and-format">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-spotlight-series-emea-2024-schedule-and-format/">Valorant Spotlight Series EMEA 2024 Schedule and Format</a></h6>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nrg-new-roster-has-some-of-the-best-valorant-players-in-the-league">NRG New Roster Has Some of the Best Valorant Players in the League</h2>



<p>NRG did not hold back when putting together its new Valorant roster. In fact, Ethan had competed back in 2023 for Evil Geniuses when they won the Valorant Champions. </p>



<p>Two of the team’s newest signings, Mada and Verno, were both signed today (October 10, 2024). While the two players have been competing within the league for a while now, neither have competed on the main stage for Valorant Champions.</p>



<p>It seems, though, like these two new prospects could be incredibly beneficial for the team. It will be interesting to see how the team performs together during next season and whether or not the chemistry will be there.</p>

<p>If you are a fan of MMORPG, you probably have your sights set on the numerous upcoming releases. Not long ago, fans were treated to Throne and Liberty, which was pretty entertaining. But now, we have New World Aeternum around the corner, and it’s shaping up to be the total overhaul that fans want. So, when can you play New World Aeternum?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-new-world-aeternum-release">When Does New World Aeternum Release?</h2>



<p>New World Aeternum completely overhauls much of the core experience from the original MMORPG by Amazon Games. It’s a relaunch that essentially introduces an archetype class system, streamlined mechanics, and a more effortless new player experience for fans to dive straight into the supernatural universe the studio crafted. Most importantly, you can play it yourself on October 15 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>More specifically, you can log in and start a character at 12 AM Pacific / 7 AM UTC in Europe and Southeastern Asia-Pacific regions or 4 AM Pacific / 11 AM UTC in North and South America.</p>



<p>Furthermore, depending on your region, you can preload the game on October 13 at 12 AM US Pacific (SIEE) or 6 AM US Pacific (SIEA).</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-the-difference-between-new-world-and-new-world-aeternum">What’s the Difference Between New World and New World Aeternum?</h2>



<p>For the most part, New World Aeternum is New World. It’s a soft relaunch of the MMORPG, retaining its core elements—namely, the action combat system and crafting/gathering mechanics that initially made so many fall in love with the game.</p>



<p>That said, Aeternum does vary somewhat. It includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>10-player raid</li>



<li>Soul Trials</li>



<li>Swimming</li>



<li>Engine optimization</li>



<li>Server shards</li>



<li>Improved storytelling and cinematics</li>



<li>PvP-specific zone</li>



<li>Gear score increase up to 725</li>



<li>Cross-platform play between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li>Fresh start worlds for new players</li>



<li>Crossworld Arena</li>
</ul>



<p>Be honest, do you care about a New World revamp? Let us know in the comments below, or start a thread about the MMORPG on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>!</p>

<p>The Verge's Chris Welch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">examined</a> the new device at Nintendo's New York City store shortly after its announcement, noting that setting up Alarmo involves a lengthy process of configuring its motion-detection features. The setup cannot be skipped and might prove challenging for younger users. The clock prompts users to input the date, time, and bed-related information to calibrate its sensors properly. Even so, Welch described "small, thoughtful Nintendo touches throughout the experience."</p>
<h2>Themes and sounds</h2>
<p>Beyond motion tracking, the clock has a few other tricks up its sleeve. Its screen brightness adjusts automatically based on ambient light levels, and users can control Alarmo through buttons on top, including a large dial for navigation and selection.</p>
<p>The device's full-color rectangular display shows the time and 35 different scenes that feature animated Nintendo characters from games like the aforementioned <em>Super Mario Odyssey, </em><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and <em>Splatoon 3</em>, as well as <em>Pikmin 4 </em>and <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em>.</p>

<p>Alarmo also offers sleep sounds to help users doze off. Nintendo plans to release additional downloadable sounds and themes for the device in the future using its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities, which are accessible after linking a Nintendo account. The Nintendo website mentions upcoming themes for <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> in particular.</p>
<p>As of today, Nintendo Online members can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/">order an Alarmo online</a>, and as mentioned above, Nintendo says the clock will be available through other retailers in January 2025.</p>

			<p>The God of War Greek Saga is rumored to be in the works after a <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise/status/1844400692120912202?t=h5qjwTNAaBqgLTBtJvZbZg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user on X</a> says that says that all of the games that were created in the Greek Saga will be developed and remastered by Santa Monica Studios in collaboration with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nixxes-is-working-more-and-more-on-remasters-claims-dev/">Nixxes Software</a>. However, it's advised to take this statement with a huge pinch of salt, as there are no cited sources, and there haven't been any rumblings about these games being remastered previously. Of course, it is entirely possible that they are correct, but without posting any sort of source, it's hard to know for sure.</p>
<p>According to the post on X, it's alleged that the development of all of the games in the God of War Greek Saga is already finished, and they are just waiting to announce the remaster's release date. It's reported that these remastered titles (if they exist) will be released in 2025, with an announcement about the games coming from any time in December through to March.&nbsp; When most people think of the Greek Saga of God of War, most people think of God of War I through to III, but it's reported that the remastered Greek Saga will include all of the PSP games as well as God of War: Ascension.</p>
<p>One of the only God of War games that wasn't mentioned to be remastered was God of War: Betrayal. The comments on the post are mixed, with some saying that it would be a day one purchase for them, with others being disappointed that it's potentially a remaster and not a remake of the games instead.</p>
<p>Santa Monica Studios is known for making the God of War franchise, with them helping externally in other games such as Journey and Twisted Metal. They also helped to develop God of War III Remastered, which provides more context as to why they may be working on developing a remaster or remake of the God of War Greek Saga.</p>
<p>As stated before, this is just a rumor from someone who has had trustworthy leaks before, but it could be a complete falsehood. There are no sources to verify this claim, and there have been no other reports of the games being in development by Santa Monica Studios or Nixxes Software.</p>

For weeks, ever since Nintendo skipped its traditional September showcase, there has been background chatter suggesting that official news would finally be coming about the Switch 2 any day now. Instead, the company rolled out Alarmo without batting an eye. Pre-orders went live and have already sold out. Naturally, some people are trying to sell Alarmo, which doesn’t ship until 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l65vlfyhtp2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l65vlfyhtp2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for close to double its standard price on eBay</a></span>.</p><p>But the funniest part about Alarmo is that it doesn’t work well for couples.

That means a lot of the characters and lore from the mobile title carry over to <em>Relink </em>to continue their stories. That connection needn’t be a deal-breaker for those who have no experience with the mobile game, however, as in all honesty <em>Relink</em>’s story is hardly its best quality. There are some compelling tales you can uncover in side quests, but<em> Relink</em>’s best aspects are its fantastic combat and the environments you’ll explore.</p><p>Most of <em>Relink </em>consists of missions in which your hero and three other adventurers battle their way through hordes of enemies until you reach a boss. Like in its predecessor, you have a lot of potential party members to choose from, and team composition is both the most important part of the game, and also the most fun. That’s because you can mix and match to your heart’s content, finding the perfect play style and party that works best for you. Combat is real-time and can play out quite differently depending on your characters’ attributes. There are magic wielders, good old-fashioned guys with swords, and more, and combat requires you to use their assortment of abilities to chain together attacks while also timing blocks and dodges to avoid damage. Battles can get pretty exciting as you use everything in your arsenal and have to really think about what you’re doing. Your party members will act on their own, but you’ll be shocked by how well they’ll support you, which is one of <em>Relink</em>’s greatest accomplishments. </p><p>To add a cherry on top, long-time <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-game-music-1851286825&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-game-music-1851286825">Nobuo Uemetsu</a></span> did a lot of music for the original gacha game and those tracks constantly appear in <em>Relink</em>. If you’re a longtime fan of his work at Square Enix, you’ll immediately recognize the distinctive flair of his tracks when you hear them in <em>Relink</em>, and they really help make the game feel like the charming RPG it is. If somehow you have the time in your life for another massive RPG, you shouldn’t miss the opportunity to grab <em>Relink </em>for $35.99 on PC and PlayStation while the deal lasts.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Corsair and Activision have unveiled a stunning collaboration that’s set to deliver Call of Duty fans everywhere a cutting-edge line-up of high-performance gaming peripherals. This multi-year, cross-brand partnership will see everything from keyboards and headsets to Scuf controllers and entire gaming PCs produced with Call of Duty branding slapped front and centre.</p>



<p>This news comes mere days away from the launch of Black Ops 6, one of the most highly anticipated games in the Call of Duty series for years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-a-gamer-could-want">Everything a Gamer Could Want</h2>



<p>The partnership, which has been dubbed ‘a powerful new integration’, sees Activision and Corsair join forces, uniting to produce, market, and deliver a phenomenal range of gaming peripherals, all of which are on theme for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>This line-up includes: </p>



<ul>
<li>HS80 RGB Wireless Headset</li>



<li>M75 Wireless Mouse</li>



<li>Vengeance Series Gaming PC</li>



<li>Reflex Scuf Controller</li>



<li>Envision Scuf Controller</li>



<li>Elgato Stream Deck MK.2</li>



<li>Artisan Keycaps</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s a mere taste of what’s on offer as part of this incredible partnership.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Corsair is leaning full bore into its full range of subsidiaries with this collaboration effort. From the Elgato streaming equipment to competition-grade Scuf controller favoured by Call of Duty League pro players, you will soon be able to craft an entire setup themed on Black Ops 6, right down to controller carry cases and desk mats.</p>



<p>Thi La, the President and COO at Corsair, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are thrilled to be teaming up with Activision and have our world-class brands come together as CORSAIR is set to deliver premium performance for Call of Duty players across all platforms whether it’s playing Black Ops 6, capturing amazing content or streaming with friends.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I’ve been in the Call of Duty scene for a <strong>very </strong>long time, and this is by far the most ambitious collaboration I’ve seen with a tech manufacturer ahead of the launch of a new Call of Duty title. It’s difficult to stress just how deep this partnership runs, and the product line that has been created to pay tribute to Black Ops 6 is <strong>insane</strong>.</p>



<p>Are you going to invest in any of the new Black Ops 6 peripherals from Corsair? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Splinter Cell Remake is making progress at Ubisoft despite rumors that the game has been quietly canceled. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the game is being developed under the codename North. In addition to the codename, sources have confirmed that the game is being built in the Snowdrop Engine. Previous Splinter Cell games used Unreal Engine 2 and 2.5.</p>



<p>Snowdrop has been used to develop games like Tom Clancy’s The Division 2, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and Star Wars Outlaws.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>First announced in December 2021, the Splinter Cell Remake is  is being led by Ubisoft Toronto. The studio seemed to tease information on the game coming soon. However, that has yet to happen. </p>



<p>When it was first revealed, the game’s produce Matt West said that it was in the “very earliest stages of development”. He added that the game was being built from the ground up with updates to the game’s visuals while saying that the game would remain linear.</p>



<p>“As we’re building it from the ground up, we’re going to update it visually, as well as some of the design elements to match player comfort and expectations, and we are going to keep it linear like the original games, not make it open world,” West said at the time. “The gameplay experience we are targeting is directly tied to what we want players to feel, to capture the essence back when we were all playing the original games.”</p>







<p>Sources have suggested that a release date could come in 2026, but didn’t want to be held to that time frame.</p>

That challenge is going to be more intense than usual for the first weekend of Vesper's Host, because for the first time, Bungie is running a world's first completion race similar to those it puts on for its raids. As players compete to be the first in the world to finish Vesper's Host, they'll have to deal with "contest mode," which amps up the difficulty of the activity to level the playing field.</p><p>There's a lot going on with Vesper's Host, from its race to its new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-revenant-every-new-exotic/2900-5854/" data-ref-id="2900-5854">Exotic weapon</a>, Ice Breaker, a returning favorite from the original Destiny.

It also seems to tease the return of Atraks, a boss from the Deep Stone Crypt raid. More on that when we talk about story below.</p><h2 id="When_does_Vesper_s_Host_launch_">When does Vesper's Host launch?</h2><p>Vesper's Host becomes available in Destiny 2 starting at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Friday, October 11. At that point, you'll be able to jump into the dungeon in a fireteam of three, as long as everyone has the Final Shape Dungeon Key. You will also need to stop by Spider in the Last City hub area (formerly the HELM) and pick up the "Rogue Network" quest to get access to the dungeon.</p><h2 id="How_does_contest_mode_work_">How does contest mode work?</h2><p>As with raids, Vesper's Host will include a contest mode that last through the first 48 hours of its launch, which means the mode will stay in effect until 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Sunday, October 13.</p><p>Contest mode works by capping player levels at a certain point beneath the recommended level for an activity's encounters, essentially normalizing the challenge so that a team can't gain an advantage by scrambling to level up their characters in the days before the activity's launch. In the case of Vesper's Host, players need to be at Power level of 1985 to meet the cap for all activities.</p><p>Completing contest mode is the best way to get Ice Breaker, the Exotic sniper rifle available within the dungeon. As in other dungeons, it seems like Ice Breaker will be a random drop for completing the dungeon, meaning it won't be guaranteed--but if other dungeons are any indication, it's likely that you'll be able to increase the chance of receiving the gun by completing Triumphs within it. You can skip that whole rigmarole, however, by finishing the dungeon in contest mode.</p><p>You'll also get the exclusive emblem, Orbital Tournament, if you complete contest mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382733-orbitaltournamentemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382733-orbitaltournamentemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382733"></a><figcaption>Orbital Tournament</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382733-orbitaltournamentemblem.jpg"></figure><p>If you want to play Vesper's Host in the opening weekend but <em>don't</em> want the increased challenge of contest mode, don't worry--you're not forced into it. Normal mode will become available as soon as the first three teams clear it, and with a dungeon, that should be within the first few hours of its release. For the rest of the weekend, you'll be free to choose between the two modes.</p><h2 id="What_weapons_and_armor_are_disabled_in_contest_mode_">What weapons and armor are disabled in contest mode?</h2><p>Bungie has noted that it'll be disabling some gear during Vesper's Host's contest mode, something that often happens during raid races, as well. We don't know exactly what Bungie is disabling, but the developer announced it'll release the list at approximately 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday on its <a href="https://x.com/BungieHelp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@BungieHelp</a> Twitter/X account.</p><h2 id="How_to_watch_the_dungeon_Race">How to watch the dungeon Race</h2><p>Even if you're not playing, you can take part in the Vesper's Host race by watching teams take it on on Twitch on the <a href="https://schedule.twitchrivals.com/events/destiny-2-vesper-s-host-dungeon-race-on-twitch-rivals-P9qyE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch Rivals channel</a>. Coverage starts at 9:30 PT / 12:30 ET on Friday. Watching the dungeon coverage can also get you two emblems through Twitch Drops.</p><p>Watching two hours of any Destiny 2 streamer with Twitch Drops enabled gets you the Effortless Flow emblem.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382734-effortless_flow_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382734" data-ratio="0.31496062992126" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382734-effortless_flow_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382734"></a><figcaption>Effortless Flow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382734-effortless_flow_emblem-social.jpg"></figure><p>If you subscribe to a Destiny 2 streamer who has Twitch Drops enabled, you get the Broadcasting from the Dark emblem.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382735-broadcasting_from_the_dark_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382735" data-ratio="0.31496062992126" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382735-broadcasting_from_the_dark_emblem-social.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382735"></a><figcaption>Broadcasting from the Dark</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382735-broadcasting_from_the_dark_emblem-social.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Vesper_s_Host_Exotic_weapon__Ice_Breaker">Vesper's Host Exotic weapon: Ice Breaker</h2><p>Ice Breaker is going to be a pretty good reason to head into Vesper's Host, especially in contest mode. The Solar sniper rifle was originally released in Destiny 1, where it was a bit broken--you couldn't reload it, but it would automatically regenerate its own ammo, meaning it was almost always ready to put some big damage on bosses.</p><p>The Destiny 2 version of Ice Breaker, a Special ammo sniper, has been tweaked a bit so it's not quite so game-breaking, but it's still pretty powerful. It has a chance to regenerate ammo whenever you get kills with your other weapons, and kills on tougher combatants offer the chance to generate multiple rounds. Like the original, kills with Ice Breaker cause enemies to explode. Precision kills and shattering a frozen enemy get added benefits, causing a Solar Ignition, which spread Scorch around the explosion to do burning damage to nearby targets.</p><h2 id="What_s_Vesper_s_Host_s_story_">What s Vesper's Host's story?</h2><p>We're a little thin on details about what exactly is happening in Vesper's Host, but with the trailer and some other hints, we're starting to form a picture of what's going on. (We'll also update this section with more details once the dungeon is released and we know more.)</p><p>The kick off for Vesper's Host is investigating a strange signal coming from a seemingly defunct Braytech facility. The trailer suggests there's a connection between this facility and the Deep Stone Crypt, the location of the raid from the Beyond Light expansion. In that facility, Clovis Bray, the leader of the company that bore his name, worked on the Exo program, where he created robots into which human brains could be downloaded--but he did that through a bunch of horrific experiments on humans, using Vex technology, and with the help of one of the Darkness statues utilized by The Witness. So generally, it was all pretty bad news.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382854-vespershostatraks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382854" data-ratio="0.45756746186938" data-width="2557" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382854-vespershostatraks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4382854"></a><figcaption>Deep Stone Crypt raid boss Atraks is apparently waiting in the dungeon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4382854-vespershostatraks.jpg"></figure><p>One major element of the Deep Stone Crypt was that Clovis used instructions from the Darkness statue to create a big portal to a strange Vex world, where he was able to capture Vex constructs to experiment on. You see that portal in the Glassway Strike--it's the means by which the Vex invaded Europa in the past, and continue to do so on occasion now. It's not exactly clear, but it seems like the Braytech facility we're dealing with could be related to that initiative to steal Vex, and possibly is even a staging area Clovis created near the Vex world to study it. That big ring floating in space feels related to this whole idea.</p><p>The connections with the Deep Stone Crypt are intentional, in any event. Guardians in the trailer are wearing Deep Stone Crypt raid armor, for one thing, and Exos and Vex can be seen throughout the environment. The trailer teases the return of a DSC raid boss: Atraks, the first Eliksni Exo. Players defeated Atraks in the orbital station above the Crypt during that raid, but with Exos being robots, it seems as though another copy of Atraks might exist. What she's up to is not particularly clear, nor do we know if she's working with the Fanatic, Fikrul, the major villain of Revenant.</p>

Zero is just still in early access, launching in full tomorrow (October 11), but that hasn't stopped fans from pushing it to massive early numbers on Steam.</p><p>In fact, Sparking! Zero has sped past the peak player counts of every other Dragon Ball game — and it's not even close. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> currently reports a peak player count of 91,005, which was achieved two days ago. As of the writing of this story, the game still has a sizeable amount of players (55,732 currently, with a 24-hour peak of 70,558), sustaining inarguably healthy momentum leading up to its proper release.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/dragon-1728585567350.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero already has a peak player count of 91,005. Credit: <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1790600/charts/">SteamDB</a></figcaption></figure></output><p>That's already impressive when you consider that's just players who shelled out $100 or more for Sparking! Zero's Deluxe or Ultimate Editions, which allow for access to the game three days early. But that number also doubles the Dragon Ball fighting game with the next-highest peak player count, Dragon Ball FighterZ, which topped out at 44,303 per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/678950/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> charts. </p><p>It's pretty major when you compare it to other major fighting game franchises, too. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1364780/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street Fighter 6</a> had a peak player count of 70,573 16 months ago, while <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1971870/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mortal Kombat 1</a> peaked with 38,129 players on Steam 13 months ago. </p><p>That player count will only rise when those who purchased the standard edition of Sparking! Zero get their hands on it tomorrow, so it's worth keeping an eye on. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-review">our review in progress</a>, where we said playing the latest mainline entry in the Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series "feels just as much like a labor of love as the effort to resurrect the series in the first place."</p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p dir="ltr">Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has hinted at launching a Twitch channel focused on the strategy video game Civilization. During the Meta Connect 2024 conference, he spoke with <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pubity/video/7422388239169785120?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc" rel="nofollow ">Pubity</a><span>, revealing his </span><span>deep passion for the game: "In terms of strategy games, the one that I'm more likely to want to be the best in the world at is Civilization." </span>Zuckerberg didn't specify which version of Civilization he plays, leaving it unclear whether he means the original or a more recent entry in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Zuckerberg offered insight into his gaming routine, joking about his wife's reaction to his playtime logged. "Priscilla looked at my Steam account the other day and she's like: 'What? You've played this for more than a thousand hours?'" He went on to say, "I think at some point, I should do like a Twitch stream of me playing with someone. Because I'm pretty convinced that I'm close to grandmaster status. I'd be surprised if anyone in the world could beat me at that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_JrrP9m2U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Sid Meier's Civilization franchise, developed by Firaxis Games, has sold over 50 million copies globally, according to publisher 2K Games. Zuckerberg has previously mentioned his fondness for the game, even recalling during his <a href="https://youtu.be/BmYv8XGl-YU?t=133" rel="nofollow ">2017 Harvard commencement speech</a> how he received his college acceptance letter while playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">The timing of Zuckerberg's comments appears to coincide with efforts to reshape his public persona. During the interview, he sported a black T-shirt reading "Zuck or nothing" in Latin, a departure from his usual minimalist wardrobe of gray shirts.</p><p dir="ltr">Following his remarks, popular Civilization streamer Potato McWhiskey <a href="https://youtu.be/fbo5qiXi1f0" rel="nofollow ">issued a challenge</a>, stating, "I challenge you, Mark Zuckerberg, to a 1v1 duel in Civilization," on his YouTube channel. The official Civilization account also chimed in, responding, "See you in the arena, Zuckerberg."</p><p dir="ltr">Civilization fans have been eagerly awaiting the next installment, which arrives on PC and consoles in February 2025. Early access for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/">Civilization 7</a> begins February 6 for select editions, while the standard release is set for February 11.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The rhythm of playing a gigantic, choice-based game in the modern era is one of quiet tedium. You reach a branching path or a place where there’s a risk of missing out on Optimal Content, and like clockwork, you grab your phone and pull up a guide for that specific moment. Big video game sites, once devoted mainly to news and reviews, are now optimized for this. And while there’s no shame in seeking out the odd tip or trick, it’s hard to fully lose yourself in an experience when you’re constantly abandoning Big Screen for Small, Horrible Screen. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em> proposes a better way.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em>, basically a new <em>Persona </em>in fantasy pajamas, is the kind of game I’d normally be checking guides for every several seconds. Like its high school-centric siblings, it operates on a calendar system that sees you split your time each in-game day between various activities like dungeon delving, hanging out with friends/followers, and boosting various “virtues” (which aid you in unlocking new characters and activities). Major events and quests often come with attached time limits as the game’s world continues to move around you. Just as there are optimal paths through each <em>Persona </em>game – which allow you to maximize bonds with party members and other characters, seeing their stories play out in full – I’m sure there’s a “correct” way to play <em>Metaphor</em>. Conversely, I imagine there are cool things I can miss, a thought that terrifies me.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I’m determined to avoid spending half my time with <em>Metaphor </em>consulting Polygon or whoever (no offense, y’all), and on top of that, I’m currently playing a review copy ahead of the game’s official release, so I literally can’t. Typically this limitation would fill me with dread, but <em>Metaphor </em>has proven shockingly accommodating. It’s clear that Studio Zero recognized how many people play its games and built in-game systems accordingly. </p><p>While Gallica, your fairy companion, can be helpful on this front by gently nudging you in the direction of specific side activities if you ask her to, the real game changer for me is “Travellers’ Voices,” an online feature that shows you what other players have done each new day that you reach. You need only press a button, and boom, you have the sum totality of other players’ lived experiences at your fingertips (which in my case means other people with review copies for now).&nbsp;</p><p>Smartly, <em>Metaphor </em>doesn’t collate this data into a prescriptive set of instructions. Instead, the game divides other players’ journeys up into four basic categories – “spent time with supporters,” “spent time in town,” spent time in a labyrinth,” and one I still haven’t unlocked yet – each accompanied by the percentage of players who performed that activity on a given day. Details beyond that are often vague; for example, “took in the scenery” or “talked with an activist” if you’re in town. </p><p>In other words, you’ve still got to do the legwork. You don’t know <em>exactly </em>what you’re in for, unlike with a guide. This system even extends to battle. If you want, you can view a selection of the class/character/level builds players used to tackle various challenges and switch your party accordingly.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate how organic it all feels. <a href="https://aftermath.site/yellow-paint-video-game-ledge-climbing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yellow paint</a> this ain’t. Instead, you’re stumbling through a dark cave by following the echoes of those who came before, of entities who are at least somewhat acknowledged by the game’s fiction. And they could be wrong! 30-50 percent of people are often wrong about a lot of things! But FOMO is a social phenomenon just as much as it’s born of what you’re actually missing out on. There is comfort, however slight, in knowing that other people also went to the awkward housewarming instead of the wild rager. </p><p>More importantly, it dispels the illusion that there’s a “right” and “wrong” way to play a game like <em>Metaphor</em>. There are just many different ways, and not everyone is optimizing and having a “better” experience than you. That’s to say nothing of the fact that regret is a powerful and interesting emotion, one games rarely encourage us to sit with in favor of fulfilling our fantasies at every turn. Greater awareness that people aren’t all playing the same way hopefully means more <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussion of those regrets</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar systems, I gather, were present in <em>Persona 5 Royal</em> and <em>Persona 3 Reloaded</em>, which makes me substantially more interested in playing those games as well. The last <em>Persona </em>I played was the base version of <em>Persona 5</em>, and I fell off it precisely because I started to feel less like I was exploring a mysterious occult world and more like I was trying to organize my convoluted IRL social calendar (which I keep in the Notes app on my phone, because I’m a freak). Already, there’s less of a nagging weight on my shoulders when I’m playing <em>Metaphor</em>. Maybe that will change as I become more invested in the world and characters – and websites start to publish guides – but for now I’m just… playing the game. It’s freeing. What’s the point of FOMO, after all, if it takes away your ability to be present in a moment? You were so worried about getting there that you forgot to enjoy it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
