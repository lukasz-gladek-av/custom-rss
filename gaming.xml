            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-nintendo-switch-2-no-60-fps-mode-unreal-engine-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to feature a 60 FPS mode, despite indications found in recent footage.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest episode of their weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a good look at the new game footage that was featured in a recent Creator's Voice video, comparing it to footage captured on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, highlighting the differences between the two versions of the game. Despite a blurrier image, heavier dithering on hair, and shallower depth of field, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game holds up quite well.</p>
<p>What Final Fantasy VII Remake is unlikely to offer on Nintendo Switch 2, as opposed to PlayStation 5, is a 60 FPS mode. In the Creator's Voice video, the iconic scene with Cloud jumping off the train right before beginning the mission to destroy Reactor No.1 runs at 60 FPS, which suggested the Nintendo Switch 2 version would offer a 60 FPS option, but in their analysis, Digital Foundry highlighted how the quality of Cloud's hair in the shot is even higher than in the same sequence on PlayStation 5 in Performance Mode, so the footage was not taken from the Switch 2 version, but likely from the PC version.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned Creator's Voice video, Final Fantasy VII Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">hinted</a> that the entire remake trilogy could be coming to Nintendo Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, this intention could suggest that the yet-to-be-announced third part of the trilogy may not make the jump to <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-sequel-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> as, while the engine could solve some of the visual issues we have seen in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, we currently have no indication that the engine can run well on the system, or that visuals could be cut down significantly to make the game run on the system and still look reasonably good.&nbsp; With the developer's desire to have part 3 out as soon as possible, which would be difficult to accomplish with an engine change, this statement could have provided an indication of the next game's technical direction.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-update-brings-new-enemies-weapon-customization-and-more.1187883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing new Illuminate for you and your squad to take on, plus new weapon customization systems and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can expect "larger, more powerful enemies" joining the Illuminate armies, including the Stingray jetfighter, which targets your squad to line up "devastating strafing runs".</p>

<p>These airborne menaces are joined by the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover", and the Fleshmob, a "terrifying" new enemy that serves as a "brute battlefield force" constructed of Voteless parts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=zoDiYmz7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=q5IoabLj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>now lets you customize your weapons.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead also says there are "sightings of other, even larger ships", although it doesn't go into detail regarding what those ships are or what they can do. Suffice it to say you'd better watch out for more than just what's been revealed in this update briefing.</p>

<p>As well as new Illuminate enemies, the latest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update also brings with it a new weapon customization system, which allows you to unlock new weapon attachments and patterns to make your armaments truly your own.</p>

<p>You can complete missions in order to level up "most" primary weapons, and doing so will allow you to spend Requisition on new attachments. It sounds like a good way to spend a resource that has a tendency to pile up once you've bought all the good stratagems.</p>

<p>Other additions include new patterns for the FRV based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond" rel="nofollow">several</a> of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond" rel="nofollow">existing</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, which will unlock at the same time the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a> is made available (that's May 15th).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, a board game adaptation based on the popular shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">recently fully crowdfunded in just 12 minutes</a>, demonstrating there's still a clear appetite for bringing managed democracy to Super Earth's enemies.</p>

<p>Despite that, the game's creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">revealed back in January</a>&nbsp;that he's taking an extended break from working on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, and that when he returns, he'll be devoting his attention to Arrowhead's next game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-release-seemingly-leaked-for-june.1187880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like that mooted&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC release is about to be announced, if a recent trailer uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alekstra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/stellar-blade-for-pc-launches-june-11-alongside-complete-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), a trailer was uploaded, then hastily deleted, to the official YouTube channel for PlayStation. The trailer confirms that&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is set to hit PC on June 11th.</p>

<p>According to said trailer, when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>does arrive on PC, it'll bring a lot of the features you'd expect from a release on the platform, including support for DLSS 4 and FSR 3 (but not FSR 4, unfortunately), an unlocked frame rate, and ultrawide display support.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=oOLEr5F6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=rWycVjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cheer up, Eve. It looks like you'll be coming to PC soon after all.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as new technical features, the PC version will also add an extra boss fight against Sentinel leader Mann, plus 25 new outfits to try on. Hey, at least Shift Up knows its audience, I suppose.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be compatible with the DualSense controller on PC, and the PC version will support haptic feedback and trigger effects too. You won't have to use a DualSense, though.</p>

<p>There's no word on whether these extra features will be added to the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as well, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be, so you should be able to enjoy the new outfits and boss fight even if you're still on PS5.</p>

<p>Technically, this hasn't been announced officially yet, but given that the trailer was uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel before being removed, it's fairly safe to assume the June 11th release date is legit.</p>




<p>A PC version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has been talked about for some time now. Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">in June last year</a>, developer Shift Up said it was actively considering releasing the game on PC, and it made comments to the same effect in its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q3 2024 financial report</a> as well.</p>

<p>It's likely the&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC port will be officially revealed soon. For now, though, you can check the game out on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>

However, during that trip, she encounters a murder incident and is subsequently arrested as a suspect. While being transported in a police vehicle, it suddenly overturns in an accident, freeing Mika along with six other criminals and they all become fugitives.</p><p><a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious attackers appear, targeting the unique “power” that Mika possesses, and the group finds themselves pursued by both the police and the attackers. The secret hidden within Mika’s power, the identity of the attackers, and the truth behind the murder incident that started it all…</p><p>Can they unravel these mysteries and reclaim a normal life?</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Choices</strong> – During your escape, you will be forced to make various choices. Your choices will affect the “likability” of the other character and the protagonist’s own “criminality,” which will affect the development of the story and the ending.</li><li><strong>Sidecar Part</strong> – During the escape, you can choose who will drive the motorcycle on which the main character rides in the sidecar. By choosing your partner, you can discover an unexpected side of them and deepen your bond.</li><li><strong>Mission Mode</strong> – During the story, you may encounter mission modes that require cooperation from all your allies, such as stealing important items or escaping from a building. In mission mode, you will watch footage from six separate security cameras and give appropriate instructions to your allies according to the situation to lead the mission to success.</li></ul><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ash Meyer</strong> (voiced by Ryota Suzuki) – A young man who abandoned his hometown, and is always on the move from place to place. He prefers to be alone, and does his best to avoid speaking to others. The quiet lone wolf. Due to his surly appearance, he’s constantly getting involved in fights, leading a life of never ending violence. He likes to drive vehicles, and has a particularly strong attachment to motorcycles. He has amazing driving technique, but with how wild his driving is, it’s a miracle he hasn’t been in an accident.</li><li><strong>Hamiel Luis</strong> (voiced by Kazuki Kato) – A con man with the air of a playboy. Although he’s good with people, and excels at manipulating people’s minds with his eloquent words, his sarcasm and sharp words often bleed into his speech. Due to his strong self assertion, he often gets himself into trouble with other people. He also excels at disguising himself, and cheating when gambling.</li><li><strong>Gib Baltzer</strong> (voiced by Ryota Takeuchi) – A former police officer who’s on the run as a suspect for the murder of a colleague. As a member of the special force in his time as a police officer, he was a sniper who excels at handling firearms. Always calm and collected, he fills the role of leader of the group. He can make decisions from an objective point of view, but due to his serious personality, he often can’t relate to younger people. He was married once, but is now a widower.</li><li><strong>Ramie Carriere</strong> (voiced by Yuto Uemura) – The self proclaimed, “Ramie, the Great Phantom Thief of the Century,” he’s a thief who mainly targets the wealthy. Excels at both picking pockets and picking locks with his dexterous fingers. He also makes great use of his acrobatic skills, using his cat-like agility to get over walls. He’s friendly, always looking to brighten up the mood, but hates being touched by other people.</li><li><strong>Camu Einhard</strong> (voiced by Shinnosuke Tachibana) – Calling himself “The Earth Warrior of Love,” he’s a revolutionist who fights for the preservation of the environment. An engineering student who loves Japanese comics, he has a strong interest in Japanese culture and anime. In addition to always being immersed in his own world, due to his social anxiety, he doesn’t have any friends his age. He is pure of heart, and he generally doesn’t like arguments.</li><li><strong><a title="Games > Sally [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sally">Sally</a> Del Testa</strong> (voiced by Kanae Ito) – A genius hacker who loves Japan’s Harajuku fashion. Gaining illegal access to information through the net, she has committed numerous cyber crimes, but having no sense of the wrongness of her <a title="Genres > Action [2,722 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, she doesn’t like to be called a cracker. Because of an incident in her past, she avoids elevators.</li><li><strong>Mika Amamine</strong> (default name) (voiced by Mika Okamoto) – <em>Despera Drop</em>‘s protagonist. She’s a Japanese student studying abroad at an Italian University. She gets involved in a murder incident in Rome, and is framed as the murderer and arrested. A good person at heart, who doesn’t forgive bad deeds, she is reluctant to live on the run as a fugitive. Having the power to read people’s strong emotions and memories when she touches them with her hands from birth, she always wears gloves to avoid reading people’s hearts inadvertently.</li></ul><p><em>*Only the name of the main character can be changed. (If you use the default name, the character will call you by your name with a voice.)</em><br><em>*Character voicing is in Japanese only.</em></p><p><strong>Steam Version Contents</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Supports Switching Between Japanese and English</strong> – You can switch between Japanese and English at any time from the settings screen. The language will only change in the scenario, user interface, and on-screen effects; the audio will remain in Japanese.</li><li><strong>Postscript Episodes Included as Extra Content</strong> – The Nintendo Switch version (Japanese version) includes seven additional episodes that were previously sold as downloadable content as extra content. These episodes take place after the happy endings of each character route, so please enjoy them after completing the game.</li><li><strong>Supports Keyboard, Mouse, and Controller Operation</strong> – Players can choose their preferred input devices—keyboard, mouse, or controller—to suit their playing environment (multiple combinations are also possible). Additionally, to make mouse—only operation easier, shortcut buttons corresponding to click operations can be displayed at the bottom of the screen.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A week after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair removed the ability for players to glide using Pals in response to Nintendo's ongoing lawsuit, a modder has restored the feature on PC. That's as Pocketpair confirms Palworld's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/terraria">Terraria</a> collaboration will launch this "summer".
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">confirmed it had removed Pal-based gliding from Palworld</a> earlier this month, saying it had been forced to make "yet another compromise" due to Nintendo's ongoing patent infringement claim. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched legal action against the studio last September</a>, saying it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages on the grounds that Palworld... infringes multiple patent rights".
</p>
<p>
Several patents - which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">seemingly filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents</a> <em>after</em> the release of Palworld - lie at the heart of the case, all relating to specific gameplay mechanics. These include the ability to capture digital creatures by throwing a catching item and the ability to subsequently ride on them.
</p>
<p>
First signs Pocketpair might be forced to capitulate to Nintendo arrived last December, when the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">axed the ability to catch Pals by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> in a small update. Then, the ability to glide using Pals was removed earlier this month, with the studio saying the changes - which instead added gliders as a useable inventory item - were "necessary in order to prevent further disruptions" to development.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, one modder has moved to reinstate the gliding feature on PC. As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/palworld/palworld-mod-brings-back-gliding-feature-removed-by-nintendo-lawsuit-3194320/">Dexerto</a>, Primarinabee's Glider Restoration mod is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/palworld/mods/2454?tab=description">now available via Nexus Mods</a> and specifically designed "for those of you who love flying with your pals." Primarinabee says the mod "uses sleight of hand to reverse the sleight-of-hand 'removal' of gliding pals," but notes player will still  need a glider in their inventory to make it work. "It's not <em>quite</em> perfect," they add, "but it basically reverses Patch 0.5.5 without requiring you to forego future game updates".
</p>
<p>
Despite Nintendo's lawsuit, early access development of Palworld continues, and Pocketpair has now revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-announces-major-update-terraria-crossover-despite-ongoing-legal-issues">previously announced Terraria collaboration</a> will launch for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC this "summer". Dubbed Tides of Terraria, it'll enable players to "catch, train, fight, and work" monsters from developer Re-Logic's hugely popular sandbox action-adventure "just like Pals". Pocketpair is also promising non-Terraria-themed additions in the update, including new Pals and new islands, with more to be shared "over the next few weeks".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-director-is-working-really-hard-to-make-it-great-game-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dragon Quest XII has been missing in action for a long time. Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-development-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the new installment in the revered Japanese roleplaying game series in early 2020. In May 2021, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-xii-is-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-story-is-already-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology would power it and that the story was already finished. A few months later, it was discovered that Dragon Quest XII: The Flames of Fate would be co-developed by Orca, which made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, however, there have been no further news or even leaks about this game. At Comic-Con Napoli, franchise creator Yuji Horii finally broke the silence <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yujii-horii-still-working-really-hard-on-dragon-quest-xii-series-could-be-compatible-with-switch-2-1541753/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Gamereactor</a>, revealing that he and the team are 'working really hard' to make the game great.</p>
<p><em>Yes, indeed, I can't say anything, I apologise. I am making it, putting lots of work into it. I can only say that the next work will be great too, working really hard. Please look forward to it, is the only thing I can say.</em></p>
<p>He also appeared to hint that Dragon Quest XII could be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new Nintendo console</a>.</p>
<p><em>Yes, I believe it could be compatible with Switch 2 as well.</em></p>
<p>However, we shouldn't take that as an actual announcement, not only because it would come from Square Enix, but also because Horii has already kind of fallen into a bit of a translation issue at Comic-Con Napoli where it was reported that he had practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a Chrono Trigger remake. In contrast, he had only <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed interest</a> in such a project.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the creator of Dragon Quest also expressed his thoughts on the genre as a whole, although he did not comment on the recent success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>
<p><em>The characteristic of an RPG is its story, I believe, not an open world, but you can enjoy its story. In a way, RPGs are for hardcore players. Depending on how you make the story, it makes it easy to play. While enjoying the story, you also become stronger. So I think RPGs enable you to enjoy these two elements.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/persona-5-the-phantom-x-western-release-teased-by-atlus.1187838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like free-to-play mobile game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is about to break free of its China-exclusive moorings and make its way West, if a new teaser image is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, Atlus <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1922064435763438012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a single image of artwork for&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;earlier today, together with the captions "Think you dropped this..." and "Stay tuned!".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the announcement wasn't accompanied by any kind of release window, nor do we know exactly when we can expect more news about the Western release of the game. Still, it looks like the mobile RPG is definitely making its way to Western shores, at the very least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-atlus-city.jpg?itok=mcrrblmE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-5-the-phantom-x-atlus-city.jpg?itok=2Y8zCD9U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>hasn't been released outside of China yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Many <a href="https://x.com/clevercolt64/status/1922070053752656266" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">people</a> in the replies to Atlus' post (including <a href="https://x.com/discord/status/1922081428956664148" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord</a>, perhaps semi-jokingly) are <a href="https://x.com/Soyskay96/status/1922067835708215359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">speculating</a> that the announcement could refer to&nbsp;<em>Persona 6</em>, or at least to a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>series, but the artwork in question is for&nbsp;<em>The Phantom X</em>, so you'll want to adjust your expectations accordingly.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-announced-for-mobile-platforms-in-china" rel="nofollow">free-to-play mobile-focused RPG</a> that follows a new group of characters who find themselves able to use Personas.</p>

<p>Like mainline&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games, <i>The Phantom X&nbsp;</i>is split between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-looks-too-good-to-be-confined-to-mobile-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">dungeon-crawling and social simulation gameplay</a>, but since this is a free-to-play mobile game, it uses energy-style mechanics to regulate timing for the social sim side rather than a standard calendar system.</p>

<p>It's one of a number of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>spinoffs, alongside tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Tactica</em>, dancing game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</em>, and the more action-heavy&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Strikers</em>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Becoming A Parry Master In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 In 13 Minutes</p>
      </div>
<p>After Expedition 33's investors encouraged developer Sandfall Interactive to think bigger, this led to the game being rebooted entirely. The studio had been working on Expedition 33 for six months at this point, and the new direction was inspired by a painting that game director Guillaume Broche liked and a short story with artistic themes that Svedberg-Yen had written.</p><p>The final spark for Expedition 33's new direction was Guillaume's mother, who helped provide the "catalyst" for the story. From there, all the pieces fell into place as Expedition 33's crew polished the story and recruited an all-star cast of actors to voice the game's characters. While the game does leave some room open for a potential sequel, Svedberg-Yen added that Sandfall Interactive is now focused on fine-tuning Expedition 33 and addressing any bugs. That doesn't mean that the studio isn't thinking about producing new content, but "it's probably not going to be for a while" Svedberg-Yen said.</p><p>Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-new-patch-nerfs-the-strongest-party-member/1100-6531420/">recently dropped a patch that addresses several issues in the game</a>. The patch has also drastically reduced the power of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/">popular Stendhal build</a>, but savvy players can still use it to inflict absurd amounts of damage on tough enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/">Expedition 33 has so far sold over 2 million copies since launch</a>, and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-reaches-another-impressive-achievement/1100-6531372/">official soundtrack is also doing quite well</a> on the streaming charts.</p>

            <p>Atlus has teased the next game in its Persona series due for global release, ahead of a livestream later this week.</p>
<p>"Think you dropped this," reads an official social post, with an emoji of an owl.</p>
<p>While some have jumped to the conclusion of a Persona 6 announcement, this is actually news of a full release for mobile game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, following its open beta.</p>

<p>A livestream will take place on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXGxXcR6ftg">YouTube</a> this week on 15th May at 3pm UK time (11pm JST), where the game's release date will be revealed</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-persona-5-spin-off-game-revealed">The Phantom X was revealed back in 2023</a> and comes courtesy of Chinese developer Perfect World.

<p>The game will feature familiar elements from the base game, but with gacha gameplay.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from Persona 5 - hack and slash follow-up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-strikers-review-an-impressive-sequel-that-inherits-some-of-the-originals-flaws">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-tactica-review-a-welcoming-spin-off-aimed-at-strategy-newcomers">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p>
<p>Last year saw the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a>, a remake of the genre-defining RPG from which Persona 5 grew the series' fanbase.</p>
<p>Little is known about Persona 6 yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-6-will-be-coming-to-multiple-platforms-leak-suggests">leaks suggest it will be coming to multiple platforms</a> and it's expected to have a green colour scheme.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-gets-official-list-of-known-issues-some-pc-issues-will-require-driver-fixes.1187802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-official-pc-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Some of the issues found in the PC version of DOOM: The Dark Ages will require a driver fix, and thus won't be fixed with any patch that may launch once the game releases to the public later this week.</p>
<p>Following the game's early access release for all who pre-ordered it, developer id Software shared a new FAQ, including a list of known issues on all platforms. The list of PC issues is rather substantial, and includes issues like crashing issues when playing on an RTX 50 series GPU with G-Sync or V-Sync enabled and Multi Frame Generation, game locking issues when resizing the window manually while using AMD FSR frame generation, game launching in the background if alt-tabbing on an NVIDIA GPU, OBS capturing issues and others. Some of these issues, as mentioned above, require some driver fixes and may take some more time to get fixed.</p>
<p>You can find the full list of DOOM: The Dark Ages known PC issues and their fixes or workarounds below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 50 series GPU and enable G-Sync (supported display required) or V-Sync plus Multi Frame Generation through NVIDIA Control Panel you can crash the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until a driver fix is available, the workaround for this issue is to either disable one of these options in the NVIDIA control panel or if you want both enabled, set them in-game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If you are playing on an RTX 40 or 50 series GPU and enable Multi Frame Generation or FrameGen, V-Sync still shows as enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a minor cosmetic issue – the game disables V-Sync under the hood in these cases.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA GPUs may find that Alt-Tabbing while launching the game can cause the game to launch in the background and not be accessible.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: This is a known driver issue. Until a fix is available in a driver update, to avert this issue, avoid Alt-Tabbing during game launch. If encountered, it can be resolved by restarting your PC.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users with NVIDIA 50 series GPUs may experience TDRs or system hangs when starting gameplay recording using Shadowplay with MultiFrameGen set to 3x or 4x.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, either do not use the noted MFG settings or record gameplay with a different application.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: If capturing with OBS, game visuals may freeze when Alt-tabbing from Fullscreen</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: Until there is an update from OBS, the workaround for the issue is to capture in Windowed or Borderless mode.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: The game can lock up when manually resizing the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not manually resize the game window with FSR FrameGen enabled.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Users who unplug a 2nd monitor during gameplay may notice that the game has frozen.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not unplug any monitors while playing the game.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: Players running the game with the MSI Afterburner or RivaTuner overlays enabled may experience stability issues.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: To avoid this issue, do not run the game with either application running in the background.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Issue</b>: In rare cases, players running DOOM: The Dark Ages on a supported PC spec at appropriate settings, who have the latest GPU drivers installed and also have an intel CPU model number that starts with the number 13 or 14 can run into persistent crashing.</em></li>
<li><em><b>Resolution</b>: In such cases, you may have a corrupted CPU. Please contact intel Customer Support at&nbsp;<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.intel.com%2Fcontent%2Fwww%2Fus%2Fen%2Fsupport%2Fcontact.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/contact.html</a></em></li>
</ul>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages also has some known issues on consoles as well. Some of these issues are already being investigated and will potentially be fixed in future updates. You can find the full list <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3017860/view/509579946274851061">here</a>.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S for all those who pre-ordered the game. It will become available for everyone else on May 15th.

Patch 01.003.000 is out now across PC and PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following a number of teases from developer Arrowhead, Helldivers 2 has unleashed a new invasion push from the Illuminate alien faction. This brings with it new enemies, as detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, including the Stingray (jetfighters that provide Illuminate support from the sky, targeting Helldivers and lining up devastating strafing runs), and the Crescent Overseer, which has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the Fleshmob, which is described as a “failed” Illuminate experiment: “a Frankenstein’s monster of Voteless parts turned into a brute battlefield force that the Helldivers must work hard to destroy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead teased “sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities.” So perhaps there will be more for players to discover once they jump into the game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/13/54507366342-1ca82333da-h-1747129689963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Helldivers 2 now has weapon customization and progression for the first time. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then in turn unlock new attachments obtainable through Requisition.

With the new Weapon Customization system, you can now tailor your favorite weapons to match your combat style and preferences once you’ve progressed and unlocked different attachments.

This rebalance primarily targets SMGs and sidearms, which previously had noticeably higher spread values. We've reviewed all primary, sidearm, and support weapons with the intent to significantly reduce spread overall, as it didn’t make much sense for these specific weapons to have such high inaccuracy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Drag:</strong> Drag determines how quickly a projectile loses speed over distance, affecting its damage. We've increased drag for pistol-caliber ammunition (used in SMGs and some sidearms) to better represent its shorter, wider projectile compared to rifle rounds. As a result, these weapons will be slightly less effective at longer ranges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sway:</strong> Sway refers to how much the weapon's aim shifts, influenced by factors like movement and stance. It represents the weapon's inertia and stability—so weapons with lower ergonomics will experience less sway, while those with higher ergonomics will have more. Sidearms will naturally have more sway than primaries due to the lack of support features like stocks. This balance patch specifically focuses on adjusting sway for primaries and sidearms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Stamina Cost:</strong> All melee weapons now consume less stamina when attacking, reducing the cost from 0.1 to 0.05. This change makes melee combat less punishing and allows for easier repositioning between strikes. The affected weapons include the CQC-30 Stun Baton, CQC-19 Stun Lance, CQC-5 Combat Hatchet, and the Entrenchment Tool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Shrapnel spawning:</strong> With this update, shrapnel will now always spawn in a full 360-degree spread, regardless of where the explosion occurs. This means weapons like the R-36 Eruptor will now more reliably hit the intended target with their shrapnel. In addition, we’ve adjusted shrapnel performance against armor. Shrapnel now has reduced effectiveness at poor impact angles, to reflect its lack of design for armor penetration in such situations. These shrapnel balance changes will impact the following weapons:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>R-36 Eruptor</li><li>G-6 Frag Grenade</li><li>AC-8 Autocannon</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Balance Changes:</strong> Armor Penetration decreased on shrapnel projectiles from 3-3-3-0 to 3-3-2-0</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Each of these numbers represent an angle threshold, which means we’ve reduced the AP value of 3 to 2 in the last range where a shrapnel projectile would penetrate an enemy.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Frag Grenade</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Shrapnel spawned from 30 to 35</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Autocannon Flak</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Increased Shrapnel spawned from 25 to 30</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Fire and Flamethrowers:</strong> This update aims to better balance fire damage between direct hits (like those from flamethrowers) and burn effects over time, while also introducing scaling of fire damage depending on the size of the enemy. Previously, burn damage didn’t scale well against larger enemies, making putting them on fire feel less effective in those encounters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, the larger the enemy, the more damage they take while burning. However, bigger enemies will also be slightly more resistant to ignition. Additionally, direct fire damage now scales with enemy size—so large enemies like Chargers will still take roughly the same damage as before, while smaller enemies will take slightly less.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have also increased the magazine capacity of the FLAM-66 Torcher and the FLAM-40 Flamethrower because putting stuff on fire is fun!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Damage</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Burning damage now scales with enemy size and will do more damage over time to larger enemies</li><li>Fire direct damage also scales with enemy size.

                <p>As one of the developers who worked on the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty/" data-ref-id="5000-18165">Call of Duty</a> back in the early 2000s, Chance Glasco wonders if the behemoth FPS franchise has run out of ideas. A series veteran and one of the original members of Infinity Ward, Glasco says he doesn't play much CoD anymore--though he does enjoy a bit of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p>In an interview with Tulsa, Oklahoma's <a href="https://www.news9.com/story/6821e0dcae532fd615116ad5/call-of-duty-creator-chance-glasco-tulsa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">News 9</a>, Glasco shares his experience as one of the 23 employees who left Medal of Honor developer 2015, Inc. for newly established Infinity Ward to work on Call of Duty. "We knew we could make a really good game," Glasco said. "Activision gave us the freedom to do things we couldn’t on Medal of Honor, but it was still a new franchise."</p><p>Call of Duty wasn't an instant hit when it released in 2003. Instead, it took time for word to spread. "It didn't have a big spike in sales right away," Glasco recalls. "It just climbed gradually as word got out. Multiplayer really hooked people, and over time, it became huge."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="810796308" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"It's almost like The Simpsons--it's been around so long that it feels like they've run out of ideas at times. It kind of wandered into left field, but I still enjoy playing Warzone."</p><p>"I spent more time making WWII games than America was actually in WWII, so moving to modern settings felt refreshing," Glasco added, referring to the shift in setting that started with Modern Warfare in 2007. "I wouldn’t say [Call of Duty] peaked at Modern Warfare 2, but that was probably the best game we made."</p><p>Call of Duty gets a new main-title release every year, and has followed that release pattern since 2005.

            <p>
Fancy testing FBC: Firebreak this weekend? Control developer Remedy has now opened a sign-up process for its upcoming Control multiplayer spin-off to let you do just that.
</p>
<p>
FBC: Firebreak's first closed technical test will run from this Thursday, 15th May at 2pm UK time to next Monday, 19th May at 10pm UK time. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy will be testing a pre-release version of the game across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S during this period, and you can register your interest now via the <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">developer's website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Set within Control's mysterious Federal Bureau of Control, and revisiting a number of familiar locations from that game, FBC: Firebreak is a three-player PVE shooter spin-off from Remedy set to launch on 17th June.
</p>
<p>
The past year has seen mixed results for other new shooters, with the success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> but also the failure of Concord. During a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-asks-the-question-what-happens-when-the-offices-post-it-notes-fight-back">recent Q&amp;A session attended by Eurogamer</a>, Remedy said it was confident its new offering would find a niche. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not that we are arrogant," said Remedy's Thomas Puha, "but since the inception of this game, we've very carefully thought [about] who the audience is, and that dictates everything from how we built it - such as how easy it should be to get into, how long the sessions are... we are not going to do a game that [feels like] another job."
</p>
<p>
When FBC: Firebreak does arrive, it'll be sold for the comparatively cheap price of £33/$40/€40 and also be available via both Xbox Game Pass (including PC Game Pass) and PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium.
</p>
<p>
Planning to give it a try?

            <p>
Nintendo has revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> firmware option that caps its battery charging at around 90 percent. 
</p>
<p>
The option is designed to ensure the device's battery lasts longer over time, at the expense of obviously leaving the device with slightly less juice.
</p>
<p>
The option can be found in the Switch 2's settings menu, under its System settings option. Here you can toggle on the "Stop Charging Around 90 Percent" option.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Nintendo detailed the feature today via its smartphone Nintendo Today app, and included a video (posted by others on social media, and embedded above) showing the option in action. 
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2's settings menu offers more detail on how the option works, stating that the feature "shortens the amount of time the system can be used while unplugged but can help reduce loss of battery capacity over time. 
</p>
<p>
"Even if turned on," Nintendo continues, "the system may charge to 100 percent to ensure accurate battery-level display".
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 isn't the first device to have this feature, but it is the first time a Nintendo console or handheld has provided such an option. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles during the current financial year, once the hotly-anticipated console arrives on 5th June. Speaking to investors last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">Nintendo said this total would see Switch 2 selling at a faster rate than Switch 1</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">had not been constrained by production issues or the threat of higher prices from tariffs</a>.

			<p>The successful release of Monster Hunter Wilds and the strong sales of other titles, including previous entries in the series, have driven another record year for CAPCOM.</p>
<p>In new <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/html/result/2024/full/4.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documents</a> shared today presenting the financial results of the fiscal year ending March 31st, the Japanese publisher reported 169,604 million net sales and 65,777 million yen operating income, an increase of 11.3% and 15.2% respectively, over the previous fiscal year. The Digital Contents Business, the publisher's video game business, recorded 51.87 million units sold, over 5 million units more than the last fiscal year.</p>
<p>The excellent results of CAPCOM's Digital Content Business were mostly driven by Monster Hunter Wilds, which managed to ship 10 million units in just one month of availability. Other games by the publisher have contributed to the strong sales in the fiscal year, including solid sales of past entries in the series, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-ps4-review-experienced-hunters-only/">Monster Hunter World: Iceborne</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, which have brought the total units shipped worldwide to over 100 million units.</p>
<p>Though no major release in the vein of Monster Hunter Wilds has been announced to date, CAPCOM is expecting FY2026 to be another record year with net sales expected to exceed 190,000 million yen and operating income 73,000 million yen, a 12% and 11% increase over the previous fiscal year. As this year's lineup at the time of writing only consists of remasters and ports, with only <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-will-last-20-hours-and-wont-be-open-world-says-capcom/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> being the only new game scheduled for 2026, there's a very good chance there will be some surprises launching before March 31st, 2026.</p>
<p>Though low difficulty and performance issues impact the experience, Monster Hunter Wilds' success is completely deserved, thanks to its open-world approach that makes the typical gameplay loop even more engaging. You can learn more about the game now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/if-letters-had-pants">If Letters Had Pants</a> appears to be the product of three different elevator pitches that took place in the same elevator, and somehow resolved amicably rather than eating each other alive.</p>
<p>The first pitch was for a verbal puzzler in which you combine letters into words on a randomised grid against the clock, with the twist that words vanish when scored to create blank spaces that can be bridged by other letter combinations for higher scores. The second pitch was for a bizarrely prudish roguelite that is all about ensuring that letters are properly dressed. And the third pitch was for an archaeological excavation sim in which you exhibit things like lost floppy discs, or sell them to expand your museum. The result, against the odds, is a single and cohesive video game rather than a claustrophobic clownfight. Witness the below trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Here’s how the moving parts join together. The word puzzle grid is also a patch of dirt, beneath which lurk the aforesaid archaeological relics. When you combine and remove letters, you’re also lifting away the soil to expose these priceless finds. </p>
<p>Putting pants on letters, meanwhile, gives them modifiers, for use in both the archaelogical excavation and grid puzzler sides of the game. For example, you can whack some gardening trousers on the letter “W” to plant a turnip when it's removed, which grows as you combine words and can eventually be harvested for bonus score. Similarly, you’ll unlock new modifiers as you expand your museum collection.</p>
<p>Ah, wait a minute. This is sort of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> again, isn’t it? A roguish perma-progressioner with a touch of deckbuilding. Still, the mix of influences is quite distinctive. I like the idea that I might have to choose between a high-scoring word and a low-scoring word that’ll earn me another relic.</p>

                <p>The next WoW Remix event is coming, and this time it's fan-favorite expansion Legion in the spotlight. The upcoming Legion Remix event had already been teased by Blizzard, but it was officially announced at the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2454299911?t=7h16m54s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolving Azeroth panel</a> at PAX East over the weekend.</p><p>World of Warcraft associate game director Jeremy Feasel officially announced the new Remix event, as picked up by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/legion-remix-officially-announced-at-pax-east-mythic-and-shattered-timeline-376808?utm_source=discord-webhook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, and shared some insight into the ongoing process of remixing Legion.</p><p>"Legion has a lot of content--way more content than Mists of Pandaria--and it has a huge amount of different systems," he reminded fans. "The team is currently hard at work delving deep into 'how we are going to integrate all these systems in a remixed way. Which systems are we gonna remix? Which systems are we gonna remix and add new things to?'"</p><p>The extra complexity in Legion means we don't have many details or even a release date for Legion Remix yet, but Feasel did share a few tidbits on what fans can expect. First in line to get the Remix treatment are Mythic Keystones, which were first introduced to WoW in the Legion expansion.</p><p>"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could do Mythic Keystones with the wild item scaling of Remix, and see how high you can go? We think that would be cool. We're really excited about folks getting a chance to do that and just figuring out how to completely break that game," Feasel said, adding that he fully expects players to break the game with the remixed Mythics--and have a lot of fun doing it.</p><p>The second feature of Legion Remix that Feasel announced on the panel was the addition of a new increased-difficulty world tier called the Shattered Timeline. "It's a timeline where everything went worse, and everybody is significantly more difficult," Feasel explained, adding that the addition of world tiers was heavily inspired by the Diablo team.</p><p>WoW's first Remix event was Mists of Pandaria, which dropped around this time last year. The event, which saw players power-levelling through Pandaria and picking up powerful new gear and items, was a hit with fans, leaving players speculating what other expansions would be up for the Remix treatment next.</p>

            <p>
It's been an intriguing 24 hours in the Oblivion Remastered community, after the sighting of a mysterious ghost horse captured fans' imagination and began making headlines. But now, after some scrutiny and deduction, Oblivion players reckon they've figured out what's going on.
</p>
<p>
The story began over the weekend when - wiggly line flashback - user TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">shared an eye-catching discovery on the Oblivion subreddit</a>, curious to know if it was new to the remaster or just something they'd missed before. "So I was crafting stupid spells in Frostcrag Spire [when] I noticed something suuuuuuper strange in the distance," they wrote. "I did as any of us of the right mind would do and B-lined it over there like a maniac. To my amazement [it] was this spectral horse with no name. I have played thousands of hours of the original Oblivion... yet this is the first I have ever seen this horse."
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk6y0z/uhhhh_guys_is_this_new/">Uhhhh, guys, is this new?</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TaricIsNotASupport/">u/TaricIsNotASupport</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
All this came with the assurance they were Oblivioning on PlayStation - and thus, it wasn't the result of a mod - and a video showing the aforementioned ghost horse swishing nonchalantly (and translucently) by the side of a cliff. With the community's interest piqued, TaricIsNotSupport <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kk7rmg/to_the_people_asking_if_i_can_ride_or_interact/">returned with a second post</a>, this time showing their character riding the phantom equine atop snow-covered mountains. "He fast travels and even gets stabled!", they enthusiastically added. "By all accounts it's now my steed!"
</p>
<p>
As you might expect, TaricIsNotSupport's post was greeted with a mixture of skepticism - given the original Oblivion has been pretty well stripped of secrets in the 19 years since its release - and enthusiasm for a new mystery to solve. After all, the possibility developer Virtuos might have squeaked a couple of Easter eggs into its remaster couldn't entirely be dismissed. Some set to work poring over previously accumulated Oblivion knowledge, while others posited - given <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a>' notoriously buggy releases - it was possibly a spell-based glitch.
</p>
<p>
Alas, it now appears the latter is true. After some experimentation, subredditor Famous-Escape-2491 shared the news they'd <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">managed to replicate the spectral horse effect</a> using a combination of spells. "Looks like it is due to the glitches where spell visual effects are lingering past their expiration," they wrote. "I was able to recreate the visual using 100 percent chameleon, and Command Creature." They also provided a video as proof.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kl8s6h/spectral_horse_debunk/">Spectral Horse Debunk</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Famous-Escape-2491/">u/Famous-Escape-2491</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Famous-Escape-2491 also cautioned against a witch-hunt, noting that rather than being a deliberate wind-up, there was every chance the original poster could "genuinely be unaware" how the spectral steed came to be. "Looking at his posts before that one," they added, "it looks like he plays around with spells - a lot. And considering the weird glitches I've seen, I can't rule out with 100 percent certainty that he may be truthful... I don't want to add to any negativity towards the guy, especially not knowing the specifics of how his scenario occurred."
</p>
<p>
So there you go; Oblivion Remastered's horse ghost is seemingly toast, debunked by community ingenuity and a scientific thirst for answers. If you're feeling a little deflated all this excitement was for nought, Bethesda is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-asks-the-elder-scrolls-fans-to-suggest-oblivion-remastered-improvements-with-difficulty-scaling-among-top-ideas">currently canvassing fans to suggest improvements</a> to its hugely-popular game. So maybe it'll add a real ghost horse if we ask nicely? And if it's <em>more</em> answers you want, you can always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-tips-tricks-and-guides">check out Eurogamer's Oblivion Remastered guide</a>.

I've asked Bethesda for comment on Oblivion Remastered's ghost horse mystery and will update this story if it replies with anything other than, "LOL".

            <p>I have a narcissistic recurring daydream that consists of teleporting historical celebrities into the present so that I can show them bits of 21st century technology and absolutely blow their tiny, primordial minds.</p>
<p>"This deceptively pocket-sized contraption is a trillion times more powerful than your silly adding machines," I would tell Charles Babbage, brandishing my smashed Google Pixel phone. "Did the Wright Flyer have wifi?" I would ask Wilbur and Orville, pushing their faces against the window of a 747. "Put this in your pipe and smoke it," I would tell Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, menacing him with the trailer for Silver Palace, a new open world action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> from Chinese developers Silver Studio and publishers Elementa, which is notionally set in a Victorian metropolis.</p><!--more-->
<p>Silver Palace's Victorian metropolis has red phoneboxes, elegantly appointed trams, top hats, clocktowers, detectives and ballgowns. I imagine Sir Arthur Conan Doyle could just about keep pace with all that, though he might object to the plunging necklines and the overall loudness of the colour scheme.</p>
<p>But then I would show him the angel-winged anime girls, the power-drifting panther steeds, the neck-snapping finishers, the real-time character-swapping, the demons pretending to people who must be exposed using magic profiling functionality. "Why don't your Sherlock Holmes stories have glide mechanics?" I would sternly enquire of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as he curled up sobbing into his hands.</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's one psychic defence would be to point out that his Sherlock Holmes stories don't contain any gacha mechanics, this being a curse peculiar to our so-called modern age. Fine, Doyle, I'll let you have that one. It's not clear what Silver Palace's gacha elements involve, but here's 11 minutes of gameplay overview to give you a sense of the whole.</p>

<p>Some press release blurb to finish: Silver Palace is the tale of Silvernia, a city powered by the "revolutionary element" of Silverium. You are a Detective who must delve into a shady world of corporate monopolies, underground syndicates, and hidden monsters. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, and will be free-to-play.  There's no release date as yet.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the overclocked character designs but I do like the looks of that urban backdrop. Hopefully the open world element is pronounced enough to allow for a Crackdown-style collectathon. Also please may I have some kind of Watson, Silver Studio? Is that catgirl maid the equivalent of Watson in Silver Palace, and if so, can you please make her as creepy as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-sherlock-holmes-the-awakened-2007">Creepy Watson</a> in Frogwares' games?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
