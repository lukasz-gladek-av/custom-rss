			<p>Fear is fundamentally different when you’re alone. The creeping shiver up your spine, the thump and thud of far-off noises, and the sense of loneliness and danger are all heightened if there’s no one else with you. That presents a particular problem for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/little-nightmares-3">Little Nightmares 3</a>. This is the first game in the series to introduce co-operative play, and that means the fear is shared. Crucially, though, it’s not halved, moulding the terror into a new experience that doesn’t dull the expertly crafted atmosphere that the series is known for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Nightmares III - 'Alone' Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VEXxEH8NQe0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s two new characters to choose from in Little Nightmares 3: Low, the slight, bird-skull wearing boy who carries a simple bow and arrow, and Alone, the orange-haired mechanic girl, her patched-up overalls tying perfectly with the metallic wrench slung on her back. This tiny pair are tied together, and the eagle-eyed might realise we’re joining them mid-way through their journey into The Spiral, a loose collection of different disturbing delusions. They have a map, they’ve come through a mirror, and they’re together. Little Nightmares 3 doesn’t need to give you any more narrative impetus than that.</p>


<p>Little Nightmares 3 looks incredible. The sense of desolation and decay permeates every element of the different settings, and the atmosphere remains impeccable, driven by the atonal soundtrack, the creaking, cracking, and groaning of mechanisms, and the haunting calls of crows and creatures.</p>
<p>There are two visual settings on PS5, and Beauty really does make each moment look like a living diorama, with dust motes drifting through the air, and gallons of guts shimmering sickly in the light. The frame rate does occasionally struggle in this mode, but I personally found it worth putting up with for the sake of the visuals. Performance, meanwhile, is silky smooth, but you’re getting a much-simplified lighting model in return. For a game like this, I know which I prefer.</p>


<p>One of the most interesting things about playing Little Nightmares in co-op, is the way the atmosphere permeates your experience of the game. You’ll talk in hushed tones, you’ll call out at the same time, you’ll skulk in silence together, waiting for the right moment to dash across a decaying room, or run from the suddenly-frantic monster at your tail. It definitely alters how the game feels, but the tension, the pressure and grim visual design work as well as they ever have done.</p>
<p>Despite the extremely curated pathway through the game, Supermassive Games (taking over from original series developers Tarsier Studios) manage to bring enough variation and new ideas to present some significant hurdles to your progress. It’s not hard, per se, barring a few unexpectedly cheap deaths or surprisingly harsh moments of combat, but there’s environmental puzzles to sort out, and the way forward isn’t always clear. Communication is key, and if you’re playing as a pair, working together to find the way through is suitably satisfying.</p>
<p>Playing solo is a different experience again. Like in its predecessor, whichever character you don’t pick will be controlled by the AI. Here, you become the leader, with the largely silent follower simply mimicking your actions. Overall, the AI is smart enough to prevent frustration, though occasionally you have to call them over with a hushed “Hey” to get them to engage with what you want them to. Once or twice they also proved just a spot too slow during combat, but they were still more reliable than a human counterpart.</p>

<p>The companionship of the two characters is gently touching. The way they reach for each other, or lift each other up, brings the game some much-needed humanity amidst the otherworldly decay and corruption. Their diminutive frames are unbelievably weak and small, but they have no option but to move forward. That indomitable spirit gives you strength and purpose through Little Nightmares 3, because you want to save them, you want to free them from this horrific dream.</p>
<p>As before, each chapter of Little Nightmares 3 shifts through a different area and a primary antagonist, and how effective they are as nightmare-fuel may rely on your own personal fears. The first section sees you evading a giant doll-baby, plucked scalp and baleful eyes a terrifying contrast to the chubby arms and hands reaching through the side of buildings, seeking out giant rattles, bringing the roof down or grabbing at a tolling bell.</p>

<p>The DualSense is also used to fantastic effect to heighten the imposing stature of this horrible thing, and even when the monster is stomping away in the distance, you can feel its presence through your hands. I think, as a parent, this felt like a particularly hard-hitting start, but later creations ramp up the cold creepiness and ghastly, gruesome atmosphere even further. Is it the best the series has ever been? I think it falls short of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/09/little-nightmares-2-review/">Little Nightmares 2</a>, though whether that’s also partly due to the change in atmosphere from playing in co-op, it’s hard to say.</p>
<p>The slight mechanical clunkiness of its predecessors remains in Little Nightmares 3, and that is, if anything, amplified by the inclusion of two players. It’s easy to get stuck, for one player to knock the other out of step just before a jump, or to be unable to quite find the space next to them, and it will lead to a few frustrating deaths. Each save point is normally just a doorway back though, and those light frustrations are ironed out and soon forgotten as you continue ever further into these grotesque imaginings.</p>

<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159445/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>11 (!) years ago, a bunch of ex-Rare staff formed a studio called Playtonic to make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">Yooka-Laylee</a>, a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a> that promised to skillfully carry the 3D platforming torch. Yet when the actual game launched in 2017, following an incredibly successful Kickstarter campaign, it didn’t <em>fully</em> deliver on that promise.</p>
<p>Players were met with a passionately crafted, but somewhat janky experience that some (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/yooka-laylee">like me</a>) loved and others hated, and the cool reception resulted in the titular duo having a mixed reputation. Now, Playtonic has decided to make things right with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, and I’m happy to report that the team has done an excellent job of delivering on that original promise.</p>
<p>First off, what exactly <em>is</em> Yooka-Replaylee? Though it’s debatable whether this qualifies as a full-blown remake of the original, it’s immediately apparent that this goes far beyond a mere remaster that simply improves performance and visuals.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159427/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yooka-Laylee was the epitome of a flawed gem, and Playtonic clearly took to heart the criticism the initial release received and used it to make this second pass a much stronger showing. Things like tighter controls, fast travel, a map, and loads more collectibles change up the gameplay experience in some important and very positive ways, rounding off those rougher edges that caused some players to bounce off the original.</p>
<p>The overall structure remains unchanged, as the titular duo explores the central hub and its five worlds in search of dozens of Pagies, a certain number of which is needed to unlock the next world in the progression. Once you drop into a world, there are around 50 Pagies scattered around the environment to collect, which can be picked up in whatever order you want.</p>
<p>Exploration is expedited and a lot smoother this time around because our heroes have not only had their moveset retooled to feel much smoother, but also have all their abilities unlocked from the beginning. The devs also more than doubled the Pagie count for this release, which has gone a <em>long</em> way towards making the worlds feel less empty. The environments are still pretty spacious, however, especially given that they’re now by default in their ‘expanded’ state.</p>

<p>To make them feel less daunting, Playtonic added a cute bookmark NPC named Mark who you can not only fast travel to at various points on the map, but also pay to reveal the location of Pagies you haven’t found yet. I wasn’t exactly disappointed by the design and depth of the worlds in the initial release, but the work Playtonic has done here to streamline traversal and progression through them has absolutely changed them for the better.</p>
<p>In addition to Pagies, there are also oodles of coins and quills scattered in each level. The former can be traded to Vendi in exchange for equippable Tonics that modify difficulty settings and myriad cosmetic changes, while the latter can be traded to Trowser for things like energy and Tonic slot upgrades to make the protagonists a bit more durable.</p>
<p>Overall, I was really pleased at how thoughtfully they balanced the economy here - even finding these ‘currency’ collectibles feels exciting due to the sheer variety of stuff you can purchase.</p>
<p>Taking a step back and seeing all these gameplay changes really puts into perspective how much effort Playtonic put in to polish and improve their debut release. Yooka-Laylee was never a bad game, but it had some quirks and flaws that occasionally got in the way of the fun, and just about every one of those drawbacks has been modified or addressed in some way here.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159424/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ve seen it argued that Playtonic would’ve been better served putting such effort into a true sequel, but I’d say that the changes here bring this duo’s first 3D entry up to par (in terms of quality) with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/yooka-laylee_and_the_impossible_lair">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>. A lush, real-life orchestral recording of the original soundtrack only adds to that feeling of quality.</p>
<p>As far as the visuals are concerned, Yooka-Replaylee is a clear improvement on its predecessor but a little less so with this Switch 2 port. The good news is that the environments feature much richer detail and better lighting, giving them a far more vibrant and alluring atmosphere compared to the occasionally flat presentation of the original.</p>
<p>The bad news? The frame rate is capped at a disappointing (but stable) 30fps, which can make the action look a little bit choppy at times. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/yooka-replaylee-runs-at-30fps-on-switch-2-team-investigating-performance-mode">The devs have said</a> they’re looking into a potential post-launch performance boost after "limited time" with the Switch 2 dev kits restricted their ability to design for it, but right now it's still up in the air whether that patch will ever materialise.</p>
<figure><a title="Yooka-Replaylee Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159429/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I also encountered a few bugs on my playthrough that ranged from amusing to annoying. After leaving the Switch 2 in sleep mode for a few hours, I returned to the game to find that there was no sound and after about 10 minutes of playing without it, the game simply crashed and I was booted back to the Home Screen. In another instance, whacking a treasure chest next to a wall caused my duo to clip through the level geometry and tumble into a formless black void, never to return.</p>
<p>Hiccups like this weren’t <em>too</em> common in my experience, but they also weren’t exactly uncommon, either. I'm hoping the team will address these at some point after launch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee, in most ways, feels like the game that Yooka-Laylee was always meant to be. The core experience has remained the same, but much has been added or tweaked to make for a significantly more confident and streamlined experience.</p>
<p>Though the technical issues hold it back a bit, at least on Switch 2 at launch, this is still a clear improvement over the original and a game that no fan of the 3D platforming genre should miss out on. Even if you played the original to completion, I’d say Yooka-Replaylee is still very much worth your time and money.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Supermassive has managed to create a fascinating formula with <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c664edc7-8576-46a3-bd42-ad55b04b4321" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-review-very-unpleasant-dream" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares</em></a>&nbsp;and iterate upon it in the sequel. Now in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="82b2b92a-8a97-466d-b41e-9ad000d7e88d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/little-nightmares-iii-preview-co-op-nightmares" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares III</em></a>, players are invited back into a familiar yet new unsettling territory, while being joined by a co-op companion for puzzle solving, exploration, and running away from a variety of terrifying sights.</p>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III </em>introduces two new protagonists: Low and Alone. Low is a masked boy armed with a bow and arrow, while Alone is a red-headed girl in a green jumpsuit who wields a wrench. Beginning in front of a shattered mirror, the duo is trying to make their way through the Spiral. A variety of themed hellscapes where the horrors are larger than life, and there's very little you can do to influence the world but run, jump, and hide.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-low-and-alone.jpg?itok=RI0_t5dy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-low-and-alone.jpg?itok=tH1TiiJj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On the surface, <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is about these two characters and their desire to escape. They'll make it through the world of china dolls and building blocks, spider orderlies and paperwork, and a creepy carnival where it seems everyone has lost themselves to their indulgences. It's enough to know that you want to leave… so that's what you'll do to escape.</p>

<h2>A Story About A Boy And A Girl</h2>

<p>Just as with all <em>Little Nightmares</em> games, though, there's a deeper story going on. There's a subtle narrative that weaves through the different areas that you visit, and some cutscenes tell of times outside of the event of the game, too, that help to clarify the image. By the end of the game, there are also some things that you learn outright, but there's far more to be left to the imagination of the player.</p>

<p>This is a difficult way to tell a narrative. For someone who is just here for the gameplay, they'll be able to have a good time. For a different player who likes to read between the lines, there's certainly more to uncover here. In my single playthrough of the game, I think I have some idea of the journey that I've taken… but I also wouldn't be surprised if the next person to pick up the controller gets a totally different message.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-creepy-lady.jpg?itok=HKt8uwVd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-creepy-lady.jpg?itok=lezy9x1X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That much unsorted paperwork is also my nightmare...</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay is what will be most familiar to returning players. As Low or Alone, you'll be exploring each of these worlds, trying to find your way out. There isn't a large amount of exploration, as for the most par,t you'll be trying to make your way to the right like a classic sidescroller.</p>

<p>Your characters are far too small for the scale of the world, you won't be opening doors but sliding through cracks or vents. It's the creepy humanoid denizens of the world that you'll see acting as you normally would, while you're forced to shelter like weak vermin.</p>

<h2>Traditional <em>Little Nightmares</em> Puzzles</h2>

<p>You'll run, jump, and climb as Low or Alone, making your way through untraditional puzzles to inch closer to escape. An early puzzle had you trying not to draw the ire of a giant baby doll by avoiding the light cast by its gaze, moving from shadow to shadow while it looked away. Other puzzles might have you moving crates or trolleys around to use as a ladder to reach new locations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-light.jpg?itok=q5chXagd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-light.jpg?itok=LNnK4zbP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bugs are scared of light, makes sense to me</figcaption></figure><p>My favorite puzzles were those where you had to trick or defeat the strange creatures of the world to steal a key from them to progress to the next room. While it was a short adventure, any chance you had to really stick it in the faces of those who were hunting you down was an incredibly satisfying victory.</p>

<p>For the most part, the puzzles weren't very difficult, and any time I was stuck, it would only be 5-10 minutes before I'd find the path forward. There were a number of times, especially when walking into rooms where enemies were preparing to grab me, that I did feel like the gameplay was somewhat unfair. Patterns needed to be understood, and you'd normally have to move in a specific path to not be caught. If you've never seen this pattern before, you're likely going to fail, get grabbed or killed, and then respawn at your last checkpoint.</p>

<p>These rooms didn't feel like I was 'solving' anything; it just felt like I had repeated the section enough to know the pattern.</p>

<h2>Co-Op Nightmares</h2>

<p>The major change for <em>Little Nightmares III</em> is in the co-op gameplay. For the most part, Low and Alone will stay together, but there are times when one character might need to stay behind to open a door while the other forges ahead to find another way to get their companion through.</p>

<p>The times that this gameplay worked, it was an incredible amount of fun, even in single-player. Flipping a lever as Alone and then asking Low to shoot arrows to solve a button puzzle was great, and the ventriloquism dummies that need to have their heads shot off by Low before Alone crushes them with her wrench were a blast.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-co-op-puzzle.jpg?itok=rQUY8OX3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-co-op-puzzle.jpg?itok=wWtKj07J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Reveal a diagram and then shoot your way to victory</figcaption></figure><p>As a solo player, there was also the benefit when it came to chase sequences that my AI partner would not only be ahead of me, but also follow the perfect line to escape any danger. Unlike the enemy rooms, where I felt like I needed to learn the hard way to succeed, this felt like I was being handed the answers.</p>

<p>The downside of this co-op gameplay is the number of rooms and checks that require both characters to be pulling up a grate, both holding a lever, or both pushing a door. There is probably a not-insignificant amount of time that consisted of Alone just waiting for Low to catch up so they could progress forward.</p>

<p>This dependence on the other character being present, and no way to force a reset, also caused me issues at two points in my game where the AI got left behind, and I needed to reset myself to a checkpoint to have Low respawn so that I could progress through the game.</p>

<h2>Look And Feel Just As Eerie As Ever</h2>

<p>Supermassive have absolutely outdone themselves again in the creation of the different worlds that you'll venture through, how similar and yet darkly twisted it all is, and then filling it with all kinds of creepy creatures and sounds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-baby-doll.jpg?itok=SOa1DnC8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-iii-baby-doll.jpg?itok=tiSO3Z4z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No thank you</figcaption></figure><p>From the very get-go of the game, getting hunted through buildings by a giant baby doll throws you into a state of unease. As you move through the twisted settings of what seems to be an office building of some kind, or a carnival where the disgusting and distorted humans seem to be visitors as much as they are the attraction, you just have to settle into an afternoon of unsettling sights and sounds to make it through <em>Little Nightmares III.</em></p>

<h2><em>Little Nightmares III</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Little Nightmares III </em>is an enjoyable little puzzle platforming adventure to play through alone or with a friend this October season.</p>

<p>The story is enjoyable on the surface, while leaving good food for thought as the credits roll and you ponder a bit more about the adventure you went on. For a game where so much is left up to interpretation, it also doesn't overstay its welcome. I felt that the time for rolling credits was exactly where it should have been in the narrative.</p>

<p>The co-op aspect, I think, does well to elevate and make some of the gameplay more unique without explicitly overcomplicating it, but there is some level of drawback in having to create a world that's specifically designed for two people to play in instead of one.</p>

<p>Building on the creepy aesthetics of the previous titles, Supermassive has managed to once again create a surreal and gross world to experience from start to finish, where you'll just want to get out of it as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you're up for a quick and off-putting adventure and you've got an afternoon to spend and a friend or partner to share it with, I couldn't recommend picking up <em>Little Nightmares III</em>&nbsp;enough. If what you're after is an engaging story, or you already know you're <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="17bd91ca-0fd9-4759-a16e-2ee29e6d762c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/little-nightmares-2" rel="nofollow">not a fan of the previous <em>Little Nightmares</em> titles</a>, then chances are this isn't the title for you.</p>

When it arrives, the mini-expansion will add new locations and bosses, giving players fresh targets for their increasingly broken builds.</p> <p>Sandfall hasn’t announced a release date yet for the new<em> Clair Obscur</em> content but confirmed it won’t be paid and should be available to players across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at the same time.&nbsp;Here’s everything fans can expect from the free update:</p>

In addition to the update, we already know the team is <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688">planning to work on a sequel</a>. Now all we need is confirmation that it’ll come to Switch 2 at some point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the third consecutive month since its release, the Nintendo Switch 2 led the way in sales in the United States (US) for August 2025.</p>



<p>According to the latest data from <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7exr2426">Circana</a>, released on Wednesday, the Switch 2 was the top system in both units sold and dollars for the month. The system’s strong sales were <strong>“able to able to offset double-digit percentage declines across each of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series and Switch.”</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the numbers, video game hardware sales rose by 32% year-over-year for August to $312M. In year-to-date numbers, sales have reached $2.9 billion, a 20% jump from last year’s numbers at this time. </p>



<p>Sticking with the Switch 2, Nintendo’s latest console has passed 2.4 million units sold in the US as of August 30. That puts it 5% ahead of the pace of the PlayStation 4’s 2.2 million sold in its first three months. Comparing it to the original Switch, which launched for just $299 in 2017, unit sales are currently 77% ahead of pace for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>Moving to accessories, spending there fell by 6% year-over-year to $169 million. That said, the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller was, once again, the best-selling accessory in terms of both units sold and total dollars. One area that did increase, however, was in racing accessories. Sales increased by 7% year-over-year while total year-to-date sales rose 3% to $78M.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fans of Little Nightmares 1 and 2 will love Little Nightmares 3. That tells you a lot about the nature of the game’s contents, setting, unsettling atmosphere, and flaws. Supermassive Games has taken over from Tarsier Games, but has remained faithful to the franchise to a teeth-chattering T.</p>



<p>There’s a perverse enjoyment in playing Little Nightmares games. After all, you’re basically forcing children to live out their nightmares and worst dreams come to life. But the cathartic conclusions make each journey memorable. Little Nightmares 2’s improvement over the first was incremental. I’d go as far as saying that’s the case for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-release-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a> as well.</p>



<p>While the game’s air is thick with dread, the stench lingering in the air is recognizable. We’ve inhaled this scent before. This is Supermassive Games’ first attempt to awaken a new nightmare, and there’s a lot to love.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3-review">Little Nightmares 3 Review</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sneaking is the aim of the game. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/little-nightmares/little-nightmares-iii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Little Nightmares 3</a> follows in the footsteps of its predecessors: It’s a new game, a new world, with new unfortunate characters. This time around, we’re focusing on Low and Alone. The former wears a raven mask and sports a bow, whereas Alone looks like a perfect Sid Wilson Slipknot cosplayer with a full green jumpsuit, goggles, and a mean wrench.</p>



<p>The second game in the series introduced an AI ally to help you along the way. In Little Nightmares 3, you can either go this Alone, or, Low and behold, you can now team up to tackle the terror in co-op. However, it’s <em>online co-op</em> only. This means you can’t have a person join you on the couch to immerse yourselves and absorb the action on-screen together. </p>



<p>I played Little Nightmares 3 in single-player, so I only have the experience of my reasonably competent AI partner to call upon, but while the addition of co-op is much-needed, the decision to leave out couch co-op is a headscratcher, as it’s an obvious inclusion. On the plus side, the Friends Pass system—popularized by A Way Out and Split Fiction—is used, meaning two people can play together with only one copy of the game.</p>



<p>The AI has the odd moments of madness. I controlled Alone, and Low would occasionally ignore me—stopping me from getting a collectible or interacting with the environment—they would get in the way and block my path, and randomly not move, forcing me to restart the checkpoint. Otherwise, it was a fairly coherent experience, just one I wish I could’ve had with someone sitting next to me.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 is split into four juicy chapters, with each biome proving to be as distinct as the last: From a crazy carnival to a madhouse. The goal to escape ‘The Nowhere’ took me around 7-8 hours—making it the deepest entry yet—and the signature blend of platforming and puzzles makes Little Nightmares 3 a scarily fun proposition.</p>



<h2 id="h-highs-and-lows-and-alones">Highs And Lows (And Alones)</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Light the way forward. Credit to Supermassive Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The end goal is to make it through each level’s series of treacherous traps, chase sequences, and puzzles. Admittedly, these aren’t the hardest brainteasers, and I can count on one hand how many times I genuinely had to take a second to figure out what to do next. There are plenty of fun concepts sprinkled throughout the game, from a special doll that changes the world around you and opens up new avenues to thinking outside the box to get around deaf enemies.</p>



<p>Hidden trap doors, environmental obstacles, and remembering your character’s abilities are all required to push forward. Low’s bow triggers buttons, cuts ropes, and immobilizes enemies; on the other hand, Alone’s wrench breaks glass to open new paths, bulldozes holes through walls, and also finishes off the aforementioned enemies.</p>



<p>Even though you have weapons, the rare combat skirmish you encounter is awkward. The timing of strikes and the proximity of your characters to enemies feel off. I think it also takes away from the game’s defence mechanism when you can fight back, and the franchise benefits from the fear of helplessness.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the chase sequences remain as exhilarating as ever, and the platforming never lets up. It feels tight and responsive, and even in scenarios where your perspective is horribly warped or your depth perception is challenged, the game does a great job of assisting you.</p>



<p>It does feel a bit repetitive towards the end of its runtime, and its biggest weakness is the same gameplay styling that has existed since day one: Trial and error. Sometimes you have to relive excessive passages of gameplay multiple times, which can greatly eat up time. While many can tolerate the intended nature of this loop, I found it frustrating in Little Nightmares 1, and it’s just as gratuitous and oppressive now.</p>



<h2 id="h-little-nightmares-3-review-verdict">Little Nightmares 3 Review Verdict</h2>



<p>The addition of co-op (albeit limiting) and the use of a free Friends Pass system is a win-win. If you have played a Little Nightmares game before, though, don’t expect a wildly different experience, but it’s still different enough to help Little Nightmares 3 stand on its own four feet. Supermassive Games has more than demonstrated its expertise in horror and flexed its chops here, while adding in new mechanics and madness along the way. The franchise is in safe hands, and I look forward to the next installment of Tim Burton-esque horror.</p>

                <p>EA is in the process of selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund to the tune of $55 billion. Should the sale go through, it would likely result in cutbacks, possible layoffs, and EA selling "non-essential assets," according to DFC Intelligence. There could be upsides, too, DFC Intelligence president David Cole said in a new interview.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ea-deal-predictions-sports-bioware-sims/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> that, if the deal happens and on a long-term basis, the EA sale could allow the company to "focus on more creative, risky ventures."</p><p>This is because, Cole said, EA would no longer be a public company and would not be beholden to the mission of driving up the stock price and focusing more on safer bets. However, in the short term, that's exactly what Cole predicts will happen. "Short term, we expect them to focus more on core money generators and look to get top dollar for 'secondary' IP/products," he said.</p><p>The EA sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners includes $20 billion in debt for EA, and many experts have theorized that EA will implement a cost-reduction plan to pay it off. That remains to be seen, and nothing is happening just yet anyway as the deal has not closed and is not expected to until 2026.</p><p>The $55 billion take-private deal is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">largest leveraged buyout (LBO) of all time</a>. The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.</p><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said he is staying on with EA, at least for now. He's also reportedly in the mix to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-reportedly-in-the-mix-to-be-the-next-disney-boss/1100-6527707/" data-ref-id="1100-6527707">become The Walt Disney Company's next CEO</a>, though a recent report said <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-02/disney-parks-chief-is-looking-very-much-like-the-ceo-in-waiting" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he's not one of the two finalists for the job.</a></p><p>The PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399" rel="nofollow ">widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018</a>. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow ">human rights violations</a>, as well.</p><p>Affinity Partners, meanwhile, is led by President Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall Interactive has teased a new update to the game is on the way, as a "thank you" to fans.</p>
<p>While story details remain slim, game director Guillaume Broche told Eurogamer: "You can expect a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well". His hints suggest it'll focus on adorable mount Esquie, who's become a bit of a meme within the game's community.</p>
<p>News of the update arrives as the game reaches a new sales milestone: it's now sold over 5m copies worldwide across all formats.</p>

<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," said Broche. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now. They brought us so much emotion and gave us so much love in return for the game that we want to address that and make a big thank you update with new content, new enemies, new stuff to do for every type of player."</p><p>He continued: "It's not a super big DLC extension with hours of content. It's more a thank you gift from us. You will have quite a few things to do and collect…[and] some quality of life [additions] that are very highly requested by the community."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>If it's more than two, you're in the minority</p>
</section><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fdc468f0f0474"><a title="Misc. Switch Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fdc468f0f0474/misc-switch-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gemma Smith / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you're a die-hard Nintendo fan (and, if you find yourself here, then you probably are), you've more than likely questioned whether you're buying too many games. It's a thought that's crossed all of our minds, and new <a href="https://www.circana.com/">Circana</a> data suggests that if it's any more than two a year, then you're in the minority (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-buy-more-than-two-new-games-a-year-youre-in-the-minority-new-report-reveals">Eurogamer</a>).</p>
<p>The analyst firm's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">Mat Piscatella</a> recently took to Bluesky with the findings of the Q3 2025 Future of Games survey, which shows that 33% of gamers in the US pick up a new video game less than once a year. 12% of voters stated that they buy one roughly once a year, and 18% claimed to buy about one every six months.</p>
<p>What that means is that roughly 63% of gamers in the US buy less than two new games every year, so if you tend to buy more than that, you're in the minority.</p>
<p>"Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space", Piscatella noted of the findings. Interestingly, only 4% of voters said they buy more than one new game a month, with 10% opting for the 'once a month' slot, and 22% landing in 'About once every three months'.</p>

<p>Of course, the tendency to buy fewer games is hardly surprising. Since the Switch 2 launched, we've seen first-party titles get up into the reaches of £74.99 / $79.99, and with the price of <em>everything</em> on the rise, it makes sense that monthly pick-ups would take a step back. Throw in the rise of free-to-play titles and it's not hard to see how a trend could start.</p>
<p>But it got us thinking, where do you fall in this bracket? Are you like the majority of players in the US, where new game pick-ups are a rarity, or are you one of the ""Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players" that Piscatella mentions, for whom new purchases are commonplace?</p>
<p>We'd imagine that most of us would sit closer to the latter (you've made it to the bottom of a post on <em>Nintendo</em> Life, so more than a passing interest in games seems likely), but there's only one way to find out... a poll! You can let us know your game purchasing habits below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last night on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i></a><span>, the singing voices of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>performed together for the first time. Ejae, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami’s voices have been heard by millions of people in the musical and its soundtrack, but other than a brief cameo on last weekend’s </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span>, we hadn’t heard them perform together outside of the studio. While I would have loved for it to be on a stage that wasn’t in proximity to Jimmy “We don’t know what fascism is on this show” Fallon, hearing the voices of Huntr/x absolutely nail the anthemic “Golden” on stage was delightful. What a victory lap.</span></p> <p><span>The performance was set to footage from the movie, including both of the major scenes in which the group sings “Golden” in the musical. It starts with footage from the music video premiere that debuts the song to the public, and ends with Huntr/x’s performance of the song at the Idol Awards in the film’s third act. Catch me feeling sentimental seeing this performance, as it echoes the movie itself, in which fans had to wait for quite some time to hear Huntr/x perform the song live because of all the demon-hunting drama going on behind the scenes. But also, as many fans point out in the comments, this is the first time Ejae, the voice of lead singer Rumi, has performed live in many years. She has primarily worked behind the scenes in the music industry, and now she’s finally getting to sing her #1 song to an audience of millions.</span></p>   <p><span>Elsewhere in the show, Fallon revealed to the group that the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack has gone platinum, having sold one million copies in the U.S. alone. What a special night, and hopefully there are more to come. It would be great to hear more songs from the movie down the line. I’m crossing my fingers for a performance of “What It Sounds Like” with a choir backing the girls up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO is one of those brands that pretty much anyone can enjoy. Doesn’t matter if you’re just a kid or a kid at heart in an adult-sized body. Building a LEGO set piece by piece is fun, peaceful, and rewarding all at the same time. Plus at the end, you have some sick Marvel or Star Wars toy to play with or display. The only problem is LEGO can be crazy expensive, and the rare times they do go on sale, it’s not that hefty of a discount or sells out in minutes. We’ve been greeted with a rare exception though thanks to Prime Big Deals Days. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/">Amazon has the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Ghost and Phantom II spaceships for 30% off. The set is normally priced at $160, but that discount brings it down to just $112</a>. You’ll end up saving a whole $48.</p>
<p>The Ghost is the main spaceship helmed by the heroes of the <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> animated series in the Spectres rebel cell’s long fight against the forced of the Galactic Empire. Later, when Disney announced an Ahsoka series, we all knew that would mean seeing more characters and iconography from the animated Star Wars canon. Sure enough, we got the Ghost in live action. And now, in LEGO.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2 LEGO Star Wars Ship</h2>
<p>This 1,394-piece set contains both the modified VCX-100 light freighter known as the Ghost and its auxiliary vessel the Phantom II (first one was destroyed at Reklam Station so it does not come in LEGO form).</p>
<p>The Ghost included two lever-activated spring-loaded shooters, a cockpit with a removable front which can fit two minifigure pilots, two hatches that open up, plus a turret with a hood that can fit a minifigure working the gun.</p>
<p>The Phantom II shuttle also has an opening LEGO minifigure cockpit plus a storage compartment. I can even connect to the Ghost freighter.</p>



<p>The full build measures in at over 4.5 inches high, 13.5 inches long ,and 10.5 inches wide. It’s not ginormous like some of the Death Star or Star Destroyer builds but it’s no Happy Meal toy either.</p>
<p>The build becomes easier when using the LEGO Builder app. You can view each step with a 3D digital version to see all those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet, allowing you to zoom in and rotate the model around. You can even save your progress if you need to walk away from your build partway through.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery-explorer-1500w-generator-is-now-60-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-just-before-winter.1319533/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages and off-grid adventures share a common problem: <strong>keeping your essential devices charged and running when wall outlets aren’t available</strong>. Portable power stations solve this by packing serious battery capacity and multiple charging ports into a format you can actually move around, and Jackery’s <em>Explorer 1000</em> has become the benchmark in this category.</p>
<p>The company has made aggressive pricing moves during Prime Big Deal Day to make this 1500W power station affordable: It started the event at $449, dropped to $399, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">and has now hit $349, down from the standard $799 price</a>. This Prime-exclusive offer expires tonight when the promotional event closes, giving members just hours left to secure this pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Capacities and Outputs that Fulfill Your Needs</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 is home to a 1070Wh LiFePO4 battery which means usable runtime that you can plan your adventures around. This <strong>battery will charge a laptop about 10 times, power a mini-fridge about 13 hours</strong> or keep your phone powered for weeks. LiFePO4 chemistry is notable because these batteries have substantially longer lifespan compared to the common lithium-ion battery and last about 4,000 charge cycles before the battery’s capacity falls as low as 70%.</p>
<p>The <strong>1500W AC output powers large appliances</strong> that small power stations cannot handle. You can power power tools in a work site, use a space heater when camping, or maintain a coffee maker percolating when the power goes out. Peak surge capability of 3000AW addresses the initial power surge when motors have a startup, such as the brief increase when a compressor on a refrigerator comes on.</p>



<p>Multiple output choices meet varied device charging demands all at once: The <strong>100W USB-C Power Delivery port charges laptops, tablets, and smartphones</strong> at full speed without the need for large AC adapters. Older devices work with<strong> the traditional USB-A ports, and the AC outlets</strong> take regular plugs for anything from cameras and drones to electric blankets.</p>
<p>The <strong>one-hour fast charging capability</strong> is a major improvement over earlier portable power stations that required eight hours or more to fully recharge. Using the included AC adapter, you can take the Explorer 1000 v2 from empty to full in about 60 minutes, which makes it practical to top up during lunch breaks or between activities.</p>
<p>For just $349, you’re getting professional-level portable power at half the cost. This Prime Big Deals night price goes away tonight.</p>

<p>Skate’s controversial decision to have microtransactions in early access has been exacerbated by an extortionate and terrible-looking Isaac Clarke skin from EA’s Dead Space franchise.</p>



<p>EA’s newest Skate title arrived to much chagrin and dismay. The community feels the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-to-enter-early-access-on-september-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skate early access</a> launch is a soulless cash-grab, and the decision to include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microtransactions</a> was never going to go down well. It’s hard to be objective as well when you see the state of the new Dead Space bundle in Skate that EA is charging you a <em>lot </em>of money for.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-space-amp-skate-bundle-is-made-of-cardboard-literally">Dead Space &amp; Skate Bundle Is Made Of Cardboard, Literally</h2>



<figure>
<figure><figcaption>Not cheap. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>What is that? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>
</figure>



<p>The new Isaac Clarke bundle in the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Skate</a> shop sure is something. To be fair, it does come with other accessories, including player profile cosmetics and flourishes for your board. But the main reason anyone wants this is for the Isaac Clarke skin.</p>



<p>Did you know Skate 3 had an Isaac Clarke skin that was completely free and simply required a code to unlock? Furthermore, it looked exactly like Isaac’s real suit in the game. In 2025, Skate’s early access offers a bundle that costs upwards of $40, and it looks like a last-second Halloween outfit made of painted cardboard.</p>



<p>We had to study this for ourselves. On the Skate store, you buy the San Van Bucks separately; the cheapest it costs is £30.97 (buying 2,800 SVB and two lots of 500 SVB), which equates to <strong>just over $40</strong>. </p>



<p>Or you can buy the Founder’s Deluxe Pack for $49.99, which has more than enough San Van Bucks and extra content.</p>







<p>What do you think? Is EA going too far with this? Or should it be expected? We’re very interested ot hear your thoughts in the comments below, and through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

But there's no moment that says 'she's learning.' She just kind of 180s from I'm angry at the world for my own mistakes!! to wow look at Lilith go, [some sage saying]. It would've been nice to have her have some kind of reflection during the fight reigniting the vaults with Tychon or even after. It's possible I missed a single voiceline somewhere but in general her change in demeanor is just jarring as hell.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ava got Maya killed by being there when she was told not to go,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/d6ry4o/comment/f0vhj44/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented zeal3000</a>. “Maya wanted to run and Ava believed she could take them and put Maya in a situation where she had to put herself in danger to save Ava.

The developers will have a long list of cuts and changes — some incidental, some significant — under their belts. Perhaps the decision to cut Ava was in response to a realization that fans might not have responded well to her inclusion. Or perhaps there was another reason — or multiple reasons — for making the change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that outspoken Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked his Twitter followers</a> what they thought of Ava in September 2024, just a year before Borderlands 4 came out. Most of the responses were negative, with some even pleading with Pitchford not to include her in Borderlands 4. Did this social media response have something to do with the decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Gearbox continues to update Borderlands 4 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-makes-big-balance-changes-with-all-vault-hunters-getting-buffs">performance improvements and balance changes</a>.

It’s worth noting that Black Ops 6 is already playable via Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but the trial will benefit Essential and Premium users on Xbox and of course players on PlayStation and Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the latest salvo in what has become a popcorn-worthy back-and-forth between Activision and EA, with each mega publisher’s big budget FPS vying for the hearts and minds of the gaming community this holiday season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In August, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback"><u>it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</u></a>. This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries.

            <p>Beloved 2016 Co-op platformer Pico Park: Classic Edition has accidentally been made free on Steam permanently by the developer Tecopark. This is thanks to Steam's limits to how many times developers can make games free before changing them back to premium titles.</p>
<p>Pico Park Classic Edition, which has been free on Steam for some time, recently got updated with online multiplayer support, a visual overhaul, and other quality of life features. With this update, the developer decided to charge a small fee for the game.</p>
<p>Tecopark wrote earlier this year: "I kept Classic Edition because it's Steam-exclusive and supports 10 players. Since I'm doing it anyway, I'll update it with online support. I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it's still free." This update was implemented in September, but Tecopark decided to leave it free for one last week before charging for the new and improved title.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the 5th October, and Tecopark realised they could no longer charge money for Piko Park: Classic Edition, meaning the game would remain free forever on Steam even with this substantial update. Tecopark posted on X: "I tried updating it to make it paid again, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, you can never go back to paid! Ugh If you play this free version and have fun, try the series too. It's weird that this one can be played with 10 people, huh? Ugh."</p><p>They urged fans to play the other Pico Park games -  Pico Park and Pico Park 2. Both games share Pico Park: Classic Edition's quality and quirky nature, and are great co-operative games to play with friends and family. So given this unfortunate situation, why not do exactly that?</p>

<p>Capcom has announced a new event for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, introducing a special collaboration with <strong>Banshee's Last Cry</strong>, the obscure Super Famicom visual novel from 1994.</p>
<p>Players can access the new content via the World Tour mode by selecting the 'Street Fighter's Last Cry' option from the 'One Fateful Day' menu. What's even better is that this new content will seemingly be a permanent addition, and will be available even after the collab period ends.</p>
<p>Those who do join in the fun during the official period, however, will be able to bag exclusive items relating to the collaboration. That period is <strong>15th - 30th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for the gameplay, we've got some spooky scenes with accompanying text to pay homage to the original Banshee's Last Cry, while the character models are also heavily influenced by the basic, blue design from the 1994 game.</p>
<p>It's a weird little addition, but we'll take it!</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 will also gain a new character in the form of C.Viper later this month as part of the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass. Alex and Ingrid will also join the ranks at a later date.</p>

              <p>Anyone of a certain age remembers being absolutely blown away when the first 100GB hard drives hit the market in the early 2000s. <em>So much space</em> — how could we possibly fill it? Today you would need several of those 100GB hard drives — 1,400 of them, to be precise — to equal the immense capacity of this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">Western Digital Elements 14TB external hard drive that’s selling on Amazon right now for just $170 in a killer Prime Day deal.</a></p>
<p>Care for a little more future shock? Those first 100GB external hard drives sold for around $275 when they were released in 2002. So the 14TB of storage space in this $170 Western Digital desktop drive would have cost you roughly $385,000 not <em>all</em> that long ago. Still wondering how good of a deal this one is?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge, Fast, Safe</h2>
<p>All of that vast space on this WD Elements drive would be only minimally useful if the drive was slow — imagine how many days it would take to move 14 terabytes of data on or off of a pokey drive. But this one has a USB 3.0 interface (also works with USB 2.0) for speedy data transfers. It’s plug-and-play for Windows computers, and getting it ready for a Mac requires only a quick and simple formatting.</p>
<p>The drive itself isn’t pocket-sized like so many of the external hard drives we see today — it’s <em>fourteen terabytes</em> — so expectations should be modulated. But it’s a sleek-looking black device that resembles a book when standing on your desk at a modest 6.53 inches tall, 1.89 inches wide, and 5.31 inches deep. It does require an AC power source, but beyond that, the included USB cable is all you need.</p>



<h2>Who’s This For?</h2>
<p>Better question: Who <em>isn’t</em> this for? Reliable backup storage is a critical need for anyone who has sensitive or valuable files on their laptop or desktop, and that’s basically everyone who owns a computer. It’s beyond inadvisable to not have some form of backup system in place, and the WD Elements drive is almost certainly big enough to back up every single computer in your home. It’s especially valuable if you’ve converted irreplaceable files like family photos or home movies to video format and need to have a safe place to keep them.</p>
<p>When everything else seems to skyrocket in price over time thanks to inflation, it’s good to see something as valuable as digital storage go in the opposite direction. Even so, this Amazon Prime Day deal on the 14TB Western Digital Elements USB 3.0 external hard drive is borderline ridiculous. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4579/">At 39% off, it’s just $170 for more space than you’ll probably ever need.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-launches-with-100-arcane-bundle-shocking-early-access-players-but-is-it-worth-it.1319494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>2XKO is out in early access, bringing with it seasonal content, two new characters in Teemo and Warwick, and a suite of cosmetics for players to unlock and buy. As a free-to-play game this isn't unusual, however the game's most expensive bundle has some players wincing.</p>
<p>The reason why comes down to the cost. 2XKO's Arcane-themed Ultra Starter Edition is available to buy for $99.99 / €99.99 / £84.99 / CA $139.99. Now, that's a lot of money, but for that amount you get three "Mythic" tier skins with a bunch of alternate colours, an exclusive finisher, eight champion unlock tokens, a player card, avatar cosmetic bundles, and 5,000 KO points (in-game currency). </p>
<p>It's worth noting that this is the price of the most expensive version of the bundle. The standard version of the starter bundle costs $29.99 and comes with four champion unlock tokens, a player card, and enough in-game currency to buy one legendary skin from the shop. However, if you want those Arcane skins, you'll have to fork out the full price. There is no other way to get them, you'll have to pay for the Ultra version.</p>

<p>The reaction online from fighting game players seeing this has been passionate to say the least. <a href="https://x.com/vicwingly/status/1975626557306835417">Some have expressed shock at the bundle's price</a>, others <a href="https://x.com/Spideraxe30/status/1975660887055683867">are expressing disappointment that they aren't able to buy the Arcane skins separately from the bundle itself</a>, <a href="https://x.com/TimeBombFanatic/status/1975780591242219776">while some are totally fine with spending that much money on these fancy cosmetics</a>.</p><p>It's an interesting twist on an ongoing point of discussion within the fighting game genre. Dedicated players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/jan/06/sf6-costumes-silence-displeasure/">have been begging for more consistent character skin releases to support the game</a>, rather than the onslaught of Battle Hub cosmetics that game has received since launch.</p>
<p>For many fighting game players 2XKO is their introduction to modern free-to-play microtransaction models, and as eye-watering as $99.99 is to see pop up on your screen, it's not an alien concept to Riot Games. The company has been supporting Valorant with expensive gun skins ever since that shooter's launch, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> has been experimenting with gacha and super-expensive Ahri and Jhin skins.</p>
<p>The question is, is this bundle worth it? Well, an obvious point to make first is that some people will simply not be able to afford $100 for an in-game bundle regardless of its value proposition. For those who can, a lot of the value comes down to how much you like the exclusive Arcane skins. I, for example, don't care for Vi, Jinx, or Ekko, so it's not much of a prize.</p>
<p>The in-game currency you get as part of the Ultra version of the bundle comes to about 2.5 legendary skins in the shop, or you can grab the Ultra version of the current battle pass and be left with 1,500 KO points left. These skins <em>are</em> cool, and the battle pass is full of all manner of quirky customisation options, but again you're contesting with the $100 shock factor here. Also, funnily enough, your remainging 1,500 points if you choose to buy the battle pass isn't quite enough for a legendary skin, so you'll have to buy more premium currency to use up what you've got left in your 2XKO wallet, at the expense of your real-world wallet.</p><p>Ultimately there's not too much you can do to tear away the shock of a $100 price point on any in-game bundle, but those in favour of this price point will of course argue it's not meant to be bought by everyone. It's meant to be an illustrious expense for super fans (or whales). This is true of course, but with three more bundles set to release before 2026, one has to wonder how much money people will have to spend to get everything Riot is selling here.</p>

<p>Starseekers Unite!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We've already had a very brief glimpse of System Era Softworks and Devolver Digital's rather excellent-looking <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starseeker-astroneer-expeditions">Starseeker Astroneer Expeditions</a> during the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-direct-april-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-and-trailer">Switch 2 Direct</a> six months back, and now the game has gone and got itself a great big 17-minute gameplay reveal, so we can get a proper look at exactly what it entails.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal video in full above, and following on from our initial excitement at what we gleaned from our first glance back in April (no thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/devolvers-awesome-new-games-got-lost-during-the-dodgy-switch-2-livestream">livestream hiccups</a>), this in-depth peek shows off a multiplayer space adventure that's got real promise.</p>
<p>The hook in Starseeker, you see, is all about getting together with other players, kicking off aboard the titular Starseeker ship before getting ready to drop out onto alien planets where, we assume, death dressed as many varieties of interstellar comedy awaits.</p>
<p>Of course, being a sequel to the also-very-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/astroneer">Astroneer</a>, the game keeps the series' signature graphical style, although it does seem to have a lot more detail overall in the footage on show. We're also getting some heavy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/journey_to_the_savage_planet">Savage Planet</a> vibes from the colourful and goofy look of the planets on which players bound around and zap stuff.</p>
<p>Here's some further information about all of the gameplay aspects that you can check out in the vid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recruits begin their journey on the ESS Starseeker, an experimental space station packed with tools, supplies and the questionable leadership of the famous Action Science Hero superteam, the Fronteer Force. Players can set out solo or in a Squad with up to three friends, preparing their loadouts before diving into timed missions across alien worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Step One</strong> – Gear up. Shop, craft and trade your way to the perfect loadout – or ignore all common sense and fill your pack with beach balls and fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two</strong> – Deploy. The moment your dropship lands, the clock is ticking. Time is short, planets are hostile and everything (including your teammates) can, and probably will, go sideways.</p>
<p><strong>Step Three</strong> – Survive, celebrate and swap stories back on the Starseeker. For all its “critical missions” and “serious science,” life on the station is more like a space party bus than a research facility.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>Each planet in <em>STARSEEKER: Astroneer Expeditions</em> is handcrafted, letting players return to favorite vistas, hidden caches or that one spot where Carl got eaten by a flower monster. As Squads progress, new Landing Zones unlock, opening up uncharted territory, fiercer challenges and bigger cooperative missions."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consider our phasers officially set to "very interested indeed" as we await this one's 2026 release date on Switch 2.</p>

						<h5>Razer BlackShark V3 Pro </h5><p><span>July 29, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Type</h5><p><span>Wireless gaming headset</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Razer’s expertise in delivering high-performance gaming peripherals is evident in the BlackShark V3 Pro for Xbox, <a href="https://www.razer.com/newsroom/product-news/razer-launches-blackshark-v3-pro/?srsltid=AfmBOooV7LJUHOwVyxWb28UdRB4GpiQilTb_t8U0JvNkrkufpx7c700x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced</a> back in July of this year. Priced at $269.99, it’s a premium option compared to the less expensive BlackShark V3, designed with Xbox-specific features like green-stitched earcups and seamless integration with Xbox Series X|S. Notably, this Xbox model also supports PlayStation consoles, unlike the PlayStation version, making it the ideal choice for gamers with both platforms. After extensive testing in titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Infinite</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon</a>, the headset delivers reliable, high-quality audio tailored for competitive and immersive gaming.</p>



<p><strong>Design</strong></p>



<p>The BlackShark V3 Pro features a sleek matte black design with subtle Xbox-green accents, maintaining a professional aesthetic without excessive RGB lighting. Its aviation-inspired yoke system, enhanced for durability compared to the V2 Pro, connects oval earcups with adjustable metal hinges for a comfortable, customized fit. Weighing 367 grams, it’s lightweight for extended use. Swappable magnetic faceplates allow for personalization, and the earcups swivel 45 degrees for convenient resting during breaks.</p>



<p>Two practical details stand out: the volume knob on the left earcup is smooth and precise, easily located without looking, enabling quick adjustments during gameplay. Similarly, the textured power button is distinctively ridged, ensuring it’s easy to find without confusion with other controls like the Game/Chat mix roller. Voice prompts for mode changes further enhance usability, creating a streamlined and intuitive design.</p>







<p><strong>Features</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro offers a robust feature set for Xbox and PlayStation gamers. Razer’s HyperSpeed Wireless Gen-2 provides a low 10ms latency over 2.4GHz, ensuring responsive audio for fast-paced titles like Call of Duty. Bluetooth 5.3 enables simultaneous device pairing for music or calls, with USB-C or 3.5mm wired options as a backup. A key advantage is its cross-platform compatibility: the Xbox version works on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles, while the PlayStation model is limited to Sony’s ecosystem. This makes the Xbox variant the better choice for multi-console households.</p>



<p>Windows Sonic spatial audio on Xbox and Tempest 3D AudioTech on PlayStation deliver immersive 3D soundscapes, enhancing directional awareness in games like Gears 5. The Razer Audio app (mobile) and Synapse 4 (for PC cross-play) provide a 10-band EQ with nine onboard presets, including 12 pro-tuned profiles for games like Apex Legends and Valorant. Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), powered by four microphones, reduces low-frequency noise like household appliances by 77%, though it falls slightly short of top-tier competitors. The detachable 12mm HyperClear Full Band boom mic, with 48kHz sampling and noise rejection, ensures clear voice communication.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro excels in delivering precise audio. In Halo Infinite, footsteps and weapon sounds are distinct, enabling quick reactions. In Forza Horizon, engine notes and environmental sounds are well-balanced, driven by TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers (12-28,000Hz response). These produce clear mids, detailed highs, and controlled bass, with minor EQ adjustments smoothing any treble sharpness. Latency is imperceptible, ensuring audio aligns perfectly with on-screen action on both Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>ANC effectively minimizes background noise, aiding focus, and Bluetooth multipoint switching between console and phone is seamless for communication apps. The headset adapts professional-grade audio for console gaming, offering versatility across platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Sound Quality</strong></p>



<p>The V3 Pro’s audio performance is a highlight, delivering clarity and depth that cater to both competitive and immersive gaming. The TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm drivers produce a balanced soundstage, with impactful bass that gives explosions and engine roars in Forza Horizon a satisfying weight without overpowering subtler elements. Midrange frequencies are clear and well-defined, ensuring dialogue in story-driven titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us</a> remains articulate and natural, even during chaotic action sequences. Highs are crisp, capturing delicate cues like the rustle of grass or distant gunfire in Call of Duty, which is critical for pinpointing enemy positions in competitive play.</p>



<p>The default tuning leans toward FPS precision, emphasizing directional audio for tactical advantage, but it’s versatile enough for other genres. For instance, in open-world games, the headset renders expansive environmental soundscapes with impressive detail, from the chirping of birds to the hum of distant machinery. A slight treble emphasis can occasionally feel sharp during extended sessions, but the Razer Audio app’s 10-band EQ allows fine-tuning to soften this for music or cinematic experiences. Distortion is minimal even at high volumes, ensuring long-term listening comfort. While not audiophile-grade, the V3 Pro’s audio fidelity is among the best in its class, striking a balance between competitive clarity and immersive richness.</p>



<p><strong>Comfort</strong></p>



<p>After extended sessions of playing various titles, the V3 Pro’s breathable cloth-wrapped memory foam earcups (66x45mm) and padded headband remain comfortable without excessive pressure. The swivel accommodates various head shapes, and the lightweight design reduces fatigue. A minor drawback: the yoke may feel slightly loose on smaller heads during rapid movement, though this rarely impacts focused gameplay.</p>

<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>



<p>Razer claims a 48-hour battery life, and testing with ANC, high volume, and Bluetooth use yielded 42 hours. The hot-swappable battery allows uninterrupted play with a spare, and a full USB-C charge takes under three hours, supporting extended gaming sessions.</p>
