                <p>The veil shrouding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming Midnight expansion is set to be lifted at Gamescom 2025, with Blizzard confirming news and updates at the show about the next chapter in the game's Worldsoul Saga trilogy.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced fans can expect "exclusive news and updates" about Midnight "directly from the development team, along with a few additional surprises" during the five-day show in Cologne, Germany that runs August 20-24.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It isn't much to go on, but Blizzard has in recent years used Gamescom for major announcements. Blizzard revealed the release date for the game's current The War Within expansion at Gamescom 2024 as part of an Xbox showcase, for example. While it's still unclear if Midnight will be released this year, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard gave it a definitive release date at the show.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much is currently known about Midnight. Blizzard announced an entire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-next-three-expansions-revealed-all-at-once-including-2024-the-war-within/1100-6518914/" data-ref-id="1100-6518914">trilogy of expansions back at BlizzCon 2023</a>, including Midnight, but only revealed a handful of details about what the expansions beyond The War Within would entail. In Midnight's case, it will see players revisit the homeland of the Blood Elves, Quel'thalas, as they look to stop the forces of the Void from claiming the Sunwell.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the "additional surprises" Blizzard has in store, it's hard to imagine more information about player housing, and a possible release date for the feature, aren't among them. Player housing is easily the most anticipated feature in the MMORPG's 20-year-history, and Blizzard has already teased that it will be coming ahead of Midnight proper, either as part of the expansion's pre-patch update or possibly even sooner. We came away impressed after a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">hands-on preview of WoW's player housing</a> decoration tools, stating that even the early test version we played felt loaded with endless possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There is still plenty to tide WoW players over in the meantime. Blizzard recently revealed what's coming in The War Within's major 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>. The update will introduce the largest raid boss in WoW history as well as asynchronous multiplayer features for Delves that definitely feel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">inspired by From Software's Dark Souls series</a>. Players are additionally convinced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Blizzard is teasing a new Demon Hunter specialization</a>--one that could also make for a nice Gamescom surprise.</p>

Now, Xbox Insiders can get the first look at how that might work on the dedicated handheld devices when they launch later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed in a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/23/xbox-insiders-aggregated-gaming-library-is-coming-to-the-xbox-pc-app/"><em>Xbox Wire</em> blog post</a>, Xbox Insiders enrolled in the PC Gaming Preview can get the first look at the "aggregated gaming library" in the Xbox PC app for Windows 11 computers and handheld devices starting this week. Microsoft says this new library feature will be available this holiday with the Xbox Ally devices. With this feature, users will see their Xbox library, available Game Pass titles, and "all your installed games from other PC game stores" in the aggregated library.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>That means games from Xbox, Game Pass, Battle.net, and other leading PC storefronts like Steam can be found and launched from this <span>single library within the Xbox PC app. "Whether you're on a Windows PC or a handheld device, your Xbox library, hundreds of Game Pass titles, and all your installed games from leading PC storefronts will now be at your fingertips," the blog post reads. "When a player installs a game from a supported PC storefront, it will automatically appear in 'My library' within the Xbox PC app, as well as the 'Most recent' list of titles in the sidebar – making it easier than ever to jump back into your games."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To access this aggregated library, Microsoft says, "As long as you have game titles from supported PC stores, you should see them listed in both My Library and the Most Recent section." You can also hide individual games from your various libraries if you wish.

By the end of its run, thanks largely to positive word of mouth and solid reviews, <em>Elemental </em>earned $496 million globally. That could happen with <em>Elio</em>, too. The movie is receiving rave reviews from both audiences and critics. However, <em>Elio</em> does have to compete with the live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> film, which was the number one film at the box office over the weekend for a second week in a row, so it might struggle to turn things around. We shall see. </p><h2 id="h97348"><a id=""></a>Pixar might be forced to crank out sequels</h2><p>Regardless of what happens, <em>Elio </em>and <em>Elemental’s </em>lackluster opening weekend likely isn’t good for Pixar. While the studio can still produce big box office hits, like 2024's <em>Inside Out 2</em> and 2019's <em>Toy Story 4,</em> a problematic pattern is forming.</p><p>It appears Pixar is struggling to create new, original hit films that blow up and become pop culture icons like <em>The Incredibles </em>or <em>Monsters Inc</em>. If Disney sees sequels as solid money earners and original films, like <em>Elio</em>, as risky bets that have to rely on long theatrical runs to become profitable, it could lead to the Mickey Mouse empire changing up Pixar’s output. The studio might become entirely focused on sequels, with its few original projects sent to Disney+ to appease the content gods. It would be a sad fate for a studio that once had one of the best original film track records in Hollywood. And this seems to already be happening, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Pixar_films" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with only two of Pixar’s six announced movies being original projects</a></span>.</p><p>But in 2025, it really does seem like kids want stuff they know, l<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-box-office-opening-weekend-300-million-1851775046">ike <em>Minecraft </em>and live-action remakes</a></span>, and aren’t screaming to see original animated movies. <em>Or </em>their parents don’t want to risk spending $20+ on seeing a new movie, instead bringing their kids to Hollywood’s latest reheated leftovers. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The layoff process has begun at MindsEye developer Build A Rocket Boy, according to a new report. This follows an absolutely disastrous launch for the studio's first title, which is currently the worst-reviewed game of 2025.</p><p>A source at Build a Rocket Boy <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told IGN</a> that the company has begun the 45-day consultation process required by UK law prior to layoffs. A specific number of affected developers has not been revealed, but IGN points out that the UK law in question only applies when an employer is going to make 100 or more redundancies at their company within a 90-day period. IGN estimates that Build a Rocket Boy has around 500 employees worldwide, with 300 of them in the UK. Build a Rocket Boy has not publicly commented on the layoffs yet.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, a former Rockstar Games producer and executive who left the studio between the launches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto V</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. Benzies founded Build a Rocket Boy and announced a Metaverse-like project called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everywhere-build-a-rocket-boy/" data-ref-id="5000-570874">Everywhere</a> in 2021. Ultimately, MindsEye was the first game to be released by the studio. It's a sci-fi narrative-driven third-person shooter, but was also meant to have a tail of live-service support that would allow both the developers and players to create new content for MindsEye.</p><p>When MindsEye did eventually come out, it was ravaged by customers and reviewers alike. The game currently sits at an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mindseye/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 38</a> on sister site Metacritic. Players have complained about rampant bugs, performance problems, and design issues. While Build a Rocket Boy has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">committed to fixing the game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/worst-reviewed-game-of-2025-gets-an-update-to-address-some-of-its-issues/1100-6532547/" data-ref-id="1100-6532547">released an update</a> resolving some issues last week, it looks like it might have fewer people to help do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">GameSpot gave MindsEye a 3/10</a>. "As it is, issues like broken AI and uneven car physics simply exacerbate the problems with its archaic and insipid design," reviewer Richard Wakeling explains. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> teaser comes from an old YouTube channel that longtime fans will remember from Black Ops 2's marketing campaign. The video is only a 14-second teaser, but it's already creating some speculation about Black Ops 7's storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">Twelve years ago, Treyarch and Activision used an entirely separate YouTube channel from the official Call of Duty account to help promote Black Ops 2. Using the "Cordis Die" channel, a brief seven-second clip was posted, which featured a short message from the game's main antagonist, Raul Menendez. The video was titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/__F0okDFRDQ?si=-6VwVPewWBtCeZYs" rel="nofollow ">New World</a>," and while the screen remained black, there was one line of audio. "Come my friends; it's not too late to seek a New World," Menendez said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chBF_rFHSCQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/chBF_rFHSCQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This was the only video ever shared on the Cordis Die YouTube channel until a few days ago. On June 20, a second video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/chBF_rFHSCQ?si=KPKPfK7t7lKksanT" rel="nofollow ">The Lesson</a>" was posted, and this new teaser features a man standing in front of several TV screens. While we only see the character from the back, it's presumed to be Raul Menendez with a new message. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear," Menendez says.</p><p dir="ltr">So, what does this tease mean for Black Ops 7? Fans are already left speculating if Menendez is going to be an antagonist in the flesh or if he'll be an enemy inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">In the initial <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/">Black Ops 7 reveal trailer</a>, the story seems to suggest that David Mason might be hallucinating his confrontation with Menendez or is inside of some kind of AI simulation. The new Cordis Die trailer might suggest otherwise, with Menendez watching footage of war and chaos seemingly caused after the events of Black Ops 2's ending.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 2 had two potential endings, with Menendez either living or dying based on player choice. The canonical ending is supposed to be the player killing the antagonist, so Menendez is likely still dead in Black Ops 7, making the more likely theory that the character is only inside David Mason's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision has described Black Ops 7's story as the "most mind-bending" ever, and teased that the "world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." The game's tagline is also "Embrace the madness."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we won't know the full story until the game releases. Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Activision hasn't announced a specific release date, but the game's full reveal is coming later this summer.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has passed one million sales, making it the best performing Funcom game ever.</p>
<p>Just 18 days since the early adopter launch, the game has managed to do what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> took a year to achieve. Even now, the game is pulling in roughly 175,000 concurrent player peaks.</p>
<p>In an infographic released alongside the milestone announcement it's been revealed players have been eaten by worms 816,720 times, 628,807 deaths have occurred in the game's endgame PvP Deep Desert, and 121,941 guilds have been formed among other interesting tidbits</p>

<p>The game kicked off to a mighty start and has shown little sign of losing momentum. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record">blasted past 142,000 concurrent players on 10th June following its public release</a>. There's been a little bit of controversy via the PvP Deep Desert, as many players aren't finding the fun in perilous free-for-alls. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">The director initially stood firm on the direction of the endgame</a>, but has earlier today announced plans to expand the PvE portion of this region.</p>
<p>Alongside this future change to the Deep Desert, hints at what future major content updates will look like have also been revealed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">We know every three-to-four months a Hagga-Basin-style map should be added</a>, which should do wonders for the crowd who like popping back in to play every once in a while.</p>

"Dune: Awakening is a harsh survival game, an intriguing RPG, and a fierce open world PvP game all in one," it reads.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Virtual reality superbike sim VRider SBK is coming to PSVR 2 this week on the 27th June. This is an upgraded and enhanced version of the game already available on Meta Quest and Pico standalone platforms, and is also coming to to SteamVR sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="VRider SBK - Release Date Announcement Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OASWt2XLsMQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>VRiders SBK does what it says on the tin, translating superbike racing into VR, having your twist and tilt your hands and arms while embodying a racer. This is intended to be a ‘simcade’ experience, making the most of the Superbike World Championship license.</p>
<p>The game features 14 real-world tracks, now including Cremona and Estoril, and lets you race on five bikes from Ducati, BMW, Kawasaki, Honda, and Yamaha. In addition to a solo Tournament mode and Ghost races against the clock.</p>
<p>With the PSVR 2 version of the game compared to the standalone headset game, Funny Tales has been able to improve the bike modelling, animate the skybox, feature more realistic tarmac, animated crowds, greater trackside detail and more. Additionally, there can be up to 22 AI racers on track in single-player.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart world 'bug'" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a026f2d866e19/mario-kart-world-bug.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Whilst most of us gamers will make do with cheering loudly to ourselves when we (accidentally) come first in an online race in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, or <em>maybe</em> have an extra spoon of delicious Gamer Gruel™ as a reward for getting gold in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-unlock-mirror-mode">Mirror Mode</a>, some others prefer to...well, they prefer to break things then call 'em broken. A damn fine tradition.</p>
<p>And so it is with the clip you can see below, showing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Icy-ConcentrationC/">Icy-ConcentrationC</a> managing to bug the game out in a fun way, by using the rewind feature to line up a very specific jump off the game's Mario Circuit track via safety barriers located on one of the main stadium's turns.</p>
<p>The result is fairly spectacular as these things go:</p>

<p>To break things down, jumping into Free Roam mode, they've used a mushroom to boost across the dirt trap in front of the barriers, then combined that with a jump boost from the top of the barrier with a feather jump at the apex of the boost. This sequence, it seems, breaks you free of gravity for a while (at least if you're Rosalina riding a pipe-framed kart doing exactly what the video shows) and results in a very floaty princess indeed.</p>
<p>Of course, while the poster suggests the game is broken, this is very much a case of pushing and prodding in a specific way to force a problem, rather than any sort of real or problematic bug, per see.</p>
<p>Indeed, this very writer has just spent a few moments trying this stunt in the game and, alas, isn't skilled enough to make it work, apparently. But please do let us know if you can do it as is shown above!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Build a Rocket Boy, the studio behind the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=9">worst-reviewed game of 2025 so far</a>, MindsEye, has reportedly begun the process of enacting mass layoffs, which could impact at least 100 employees.</p>
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN</a>, a source tells them that it's unclear how many employees will be let go, but the studio began a 45-day consultation period today, on June 23.</p>
<p>Build a Rocket Boy has a main studio based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights/consultation">UK law</a>, the 45-day consultation begins when a company plans "<em>100 or more redundancies.</em>" IGN adds that Build a Rocket Boy has approximately 300 employees in the UK and another 200 outside the UK. If only 100 people are let go, that's still one-fifth of the studio gone.</p>
<p>To say that MindsEye's launch has gone badly would be an understatement. There were a number of signs before the game launched that things wouldn't be great, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aob_eBUBwNU">unenthusiastic previews from content creators</a>, negative <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a> reviews from former and current staff that described a studio with deep internal turmoil, claims from one of the co-chief executive officers that there was someone paying people to <em>"<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">trash the game and the</a></em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"> <em>studio</em>,"</a> and two seemingly prescient <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">chief executives who departed the studio a week before</a> the game launched.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">physical copies of the game were out ahead of launch</a>, with retail stores breaking MindsEye's street date, and Build a Rocket Boy releasing a statement warning players that those copies were missing "<em>a major</em>" day-one patch, though it wasn't exactly convincing that the patch would fix the issues MindsEye has.</p>
<p>All of this made it no surprise that when MindsEye did eventually launch on June 10, it did so in a broken state. High-end PCs struggled to run the game at all <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-unreal-engine-5-gpu-destroyer/">due to its technical issues</a>, while players on PS5<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/"> began requesting (and getting) refunds from PlayStation</a> due to the game's poor performance and false advertising, as it was claimed ahead of launch that MindsEye would run at 60 FPS on PS5 Pro. On all consoles, MindsEye is currently capped at 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Two days after the official launch date, the studio published a statement that it was "<em>heartbroken</em>" with how the launch had gone, seeing all the issues players were<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/comments/1lgs7j6/even_more_awful_hilarious_and_absolutely/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"> reporting</a> and the negative feedback the game had received. It promised a series of fixes, two of which have already been released, though even after those hotfixes went live, the technical testing wizards at Digital Foundry reported that MindsEye has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">"<em>abject technical performance</em>,"</a> even with the latest patch.</p>

<p>Build a Rocket Boy has yet to comment on the layoff reports, or release a new statement beyond its latest hotfix last week. The studio did also deny that it was <a href="https://x.com/buildarocketboy/status/1935040621124972727">using bots to reply positively to negative reviews</a>, a claim that was brought up after a few people online noticed some similar wording in posts claiming that MindsEye gave players <a href="https://x.com/MckKirk/status/1934880019353928189">"<em>goosebumps,</em>"</a> or that they had<a href="https://x.com/MikeChannell/status/1934689743574344094"> only experienced a few bugs, and that the game reminded them of Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>It's unclear where MindsEye sits in the sales charts, but with layoffs already on the table, it's likely that it underperformed, to say the least, which brings into question whether Build a Rocket Boy will deliver on any of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">post-launch plans for MindsEye</a>.</p>
<p>MindsEye's poor launch also brings into question what will happen with what was supposed to be Build a Rocket Boy's flagship product, <a href="https://wccftech.com/everywhere-a-new-game-by-ex-gta-producer-revealed-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2022/">Everywhere</a>. MindsEye was originally billed as a premium experience players <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-everywhere-gta-producer-leslie-benzies-teaser-new-details/">could play within Everywhere</a>, which itself is meant to be this massive platform through which players could make their own creations and play games made by Build a Rocket Boy, similar to what Epic has built with Fortnite.</p>
<p>That plan was later changed, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hitman-maker-io-interactive-teams-with-build-a-rocket-boy-to-publish-mindseye/">MindsEye being a standalone release</a>, and Build a Rocket Boy having to put out a statement that Everywhere had not been "<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-future-of-gta-producers-everywhere-is-in-doubt-as-mindseye-adopts-its-creation-suite/"><em>abandoned</em></a>." Now, however, it could likely be abandoned, since we don't even know if Build a Rocket Boy will be around long enough to make it.</p>
<p>This is just speculation, but it seems like MindsEye was meant to be a sort of proof-of-concept for the creation platform that Build a Rocket Boy envisioned Everywhere to be. If MindsEye had been a massive success, that would be the foundation for building out Everywhere, and the ultimate showcase for what's possible in the platform Build a Rocket Boy were creating. You could say MindsEye's success was meant to be the fuel for the rocket that would be Everywhere.</p>
<p>If that was the plan, it seems fair to say that it has failed, at least for now. Who knows, this could still potentially be the beginning of MindsEye's own arc where Build a Rocket Boy patches it into an entirely different game, something that players actually like and want to play.</p>
<p>Or, these layoffs, should they be confirmed, could be the beginning of the story players are more familiar with, the one where, within a year's time, Build a Rocket Boy is another shuttered studio.</p>

The drama-fueled, high-stakes thriller ends just before the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> battles kick off in<em> Rogue One </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. A true feeling of catharsis to the galactic conflict only existed off screen, leaving fans looking for ways to reenact the showdowns for which <em>Andor</em> lays the groundwork.<br></p><p>It helped that one of the show’s actors, Muhannad Ben Amor, used the spotlight to share his <em>Battlefront 2</em> love in an Instagram story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that subsequently went viral</a></span>. He said he played almost 500 hours of the game when he was younger (he was only 12 when it released) and called for a sequel.  “Grew up with <em>Battlefront 2</em>—been a veteran since day one,” Amor said. “Let’s HOPE <em>Battlefront 3</em> happens.” He wasn’t the only one trying to manifest <em>Battlefront</em>’s return on social media. </p><p>The Reels and TikTok algorithms were full of <em>Star Wars </em>memes after <em>Andor</em> wrapped, and they instantly became a pipeline to nostalgia-bait of people playing and talking about <em>Battlefront 2</em> like it was a lost treasure from a bygone era. The flood of content was a mix of players reliving the game’s greatest hits, like transforming into Yoda or Darth Vader and demolishing opponents on the battlefield, or putting life on hold to finish Supremacy matches like school had just let out for the summer  in the late, pre-pandemic 2010s.</p><p>Social media platforms convincing you that everyone else is doing a thing can be a powerful incentive. FOMO is a hell of a drug. It also helps that<em> Battlefront 2 </em>is currently dirt cheap. The game is on sale for just $4 on PC and disc copies are still bargain bin fodder at places like GameStop. But I think another major dynamic to the <em>Battlefront</em> renaissance is a recent frenzy of <em>Titanfall</em> rumors <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">that culminated in the news</a></span> that a mech-based multiplayer incubation project had just been canned at EA. Amid fresh layoffs even as the<em> Madden</em> publisher lavishes shareholders with stock buybacks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the calls for <em>Battlefront 3</em></a></span><em> </em>have reached a fever pitch at the exact moment when it seems the least likely to ever become a reality.</p><p>The role of <em>Battlefront 2</em> as a “throwback” to a better time is an ironic one considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296">its greatest legacy remains a pay-to-win loot box cash grab so brazen</a></span> it forced the entire gaming industry to back off of the microtransaction trend. But with that controversy no longer shading every aspect of the conversation around the game, the parts of <em>Battlefront 2</em> that were fun have been able to shine more than ever. Unburdened by the hype and new release expectations of a $60 game, <em>Battlefront 2</em> can just be that multiplayer distraction that hits all of the <em>Star Wars</em> fanservice sweet spots. <em>Battlefront 3</em> might never happen, but the dream of one has never been more alive. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>According to Varnell, the skill trees are so varied that players could take the same character and action skill into a fight and still be able to fulfill different roles in a firefight. This is a big departure from Borderlands 3, where action skills were generally tied to certain playstyles and didn't offer much room for improvisation.</p><p>As for the overall numbers, players could be looking at a very in-depth system for all the skills they can play around with. For example, Borderlands 2 had up to 10 skills per skill tree for each character, while Borderlands 3 offered four skill trees and up to 20 skills for each one across various tiers. A lot of these skills focused on buffing characters when certain actions were performed, with reduced ability cooldowns, rapid healing, and action-skill enhancements being offered for the right build.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with the standard version of the game priced at $70. A Switch 2 version is also coming at a later date.</p><p>"This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ramée said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy has reportedly started the layoff process at the studio, after an underperforming launch.</p>
<p>The report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">written by IGN</a>, states the developer has informed staff the redundancy process has begun, with sources claiming over 100 employees could be impacted.</p>
<p>A source who wished to remain anonymous told IGN the 45-day consultation process had begun, which according to UK law kicks into effect when over 100 layoffs are planned within a 90-day window.</p>

<p>This news comes after a launch which disappointed many eager fans waiting to play the game that had, originally, been touted as a rival to Grand Theft Auto. The game, since its release, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">plagued with bugs, performance issues</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-crashes-caused-by-a-memory-leak-developer-says-as-it-remains-committed-to-ensuring-all-players-have-a-great-experience">crashes</a>, and what many have called 'dated design'. Right now MindsEye is rated Mostly Negative on Steam, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">though a hotfix has been released</a> to improve the game for those still eager to give it a try. However, even after the patch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-mindseye-has-abject-technical-performance-even-after-its-latest-patch">things are still far from perfect</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though the publisher of MindsEye <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief when asked by IGN</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane wrote: "although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-developer-reportedly-prepping-for-layoffs-after-botched-launch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>THQ Nordic has announced their 2025 Digital Showcase will take place on 1st August, featuring a bunch of the games that will be featured, and potentially teasing more about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/darksiders-is-back-watch-the-teaser-now/">the upcoming Darksiders project</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Included in the trailer were clips of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/reanimal-revealed-by-the-makers-of-little-nightmares-tarsier/">Reanimal</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/wreckreations-new-trailer-is-all-about-building-tracks-racing-together/">Wreckreation</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/14/wreckfest-2-content-update-1-brings-tracks-cars-patch-notes/">Wreckfest 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/see-the-first-gameplay-trailer-for-titan-quest-2/">Titan Quest II</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/the-eternal-life-of-goldman-is-a-platformer-with-a-wonderful-ligne-claire-art-style/">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/is-the-gothic-1-remake-a-gothic-revival-or-a-gothic-ruin/">Gothic’s remake</a>, and maybe one or two more that I missed.</p>
<p>OK, so it doesn’t seem that Darksiders is included in the trailer itself – the dark fantasy imagery would be more Titan Quest II – but they do tell everyone to “saddle your horses” in the trailer blurb. You know who rides horses? The four horsemen, of course.</p>
<p>“This year’s showcase promises a feast of world premiere announcements, fresh updates on previously announced titles, and a few surprises we didn’t hint at already… or did we?” the company writes.</p>

<p>The stream will kick off<span dir="auto"> Friday 1st August 1st &nbsp;at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / </span><span dir="auto">21:00</span><span dir="auto"> CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry, we're not done yet, CD Projekt has said about a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update that also represents that same phrase, it being about the third patch to be labelled the final one the game'll be getting. Update 2.3 was originally set to be dropping on this week, but now it's been delayed so the devs can make it about the same size as its predecessor.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're probably adding more stuff to the pile of new things we never thought Cyberpunk'd still be getting at this stage. We're multiple encores deep in the Samurai gig at this point, but hey, the crowd's still having a great time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We initially hoped to put Update 2.3 in your hands on June 26th," the studio wrote in a post addressed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SX5CJ2hN_c">choom nation</a>, "However, we'll need some more time to make sure we're happy with it — we're aiming for a scope similar to Update 2.2. We'll update you further as soon as we can!"</p>
<p>So, no new details about what to expect in this next patch, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oh-it-turns-out-cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-one-more-update-after-all-and-its-not-too-far-away">was announced</a> alongside Cyberpunk making its debut on a certain new console made by a company often associated with the profession you enlist if your loo's clogged. Well, aside from the fact it's apparently going to about as beefy as its predecessor, the previous holder of the 'last Cyberpunk patch, for realsies' title.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, an infectious digital virus can be a good thing, like when your brainrot spreads to all your friends’ video game consoles and they finally play a game you’ve been yelling about for a decade. Last week, after the previews went up for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a></span>, I looked on my shelf for my copy of <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>, the excellent, underrated 2016 RPG that marries monster-taming and a detective serial story. I was devastated to see that I no longer had the game, so I went to PlayStation Network to buy it there, only to find Bandai Namco had apparently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.siliconera.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-appears-to-have-been-delisted-in-north-america/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.siliconera.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-appears-to-have-been-delisted-in-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delisted the game from PlayStation’s online stores in 2018</a></span>! Thankfully, it’s been ported to PC and Switch, and I found the Switch <em>Complete Edition</em> that contains both the base game and its parallel story follow-up, <em>Hacker’s Memory, </em>was on sale <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V42555Q?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07V42555Q" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">on Amazon</a></span> for $25, which is half off.

Though the game is built upon the same mythology as the rest of the series, <em>Cyber Sleuth </em>is a standalone story that anyone can enjoy. Admittedly, the turn-based battles are pretty rote (<em>Time Stranger </em>is a pretty big improvement, based on what I played at Summer Game Fest), but their simplicity means they don’t get in the way of the real meat: the detective story and dense monster-taming mechanics.</p><p>Even if you’re not looking for a critter collectathon, <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>’s biggest draw is its <em>Persona</em>-esque vibes and its elaborate mystery. As the title suggests, you play as a digital detective who is investigating a virtual reality world called EDEN, where users are logging in and ending up in a comatose state in the real world. The titular digital monsters are also running rampant through the program, and as the lines between real and digital begin to blur, it’s up to you and your friends to get to the bottom of the calamity that threatens both worlds. It’s got a lot of moving parts, but it all comes together in a really satisfying fashion by the end of its roughly 50-hour run.</p><p><em>Hacker’s Memory</em>, meanwhile, is a parallel story that follows a hacker who is dealing with all this nonsense from a different perspective, and is best played after <em>Cyber Sleuth,</em> as its story overlaps with the original. It’s another 50 hours or so of digital detective work, and while it’s not quite as impactful, it’s still a great, meaty addition to a game that deserves more players. With sales this cheap and <em>Time Stranger </em>on the way, there’s never been a better time to give one of the best <em>Digimon </em>games a shot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'd get it if you're all sick of hearing about New York City's Democratic mayoral primary, but a bunch of New Yorkers run this site and we're all pretty invested in it! It's also broken local containment, not just because <a href="https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the candidates</a> is <a href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very online</a>, but because the race itself presents an opportunity for all of us to rethink how we participate in electoral politics.</p><p>A poll <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/5363214-cuomo-mamdani-ny-mayoral-race/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this morning</a> suggests a tighter-than-ever race between frontrunners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani, with Mamdani coming out on top once you account for the intricacies of ranked choice voting. NYC adopted ranked choice voting in 2021, when it didn't go so well: <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/30/1011747612/the-human-error-thats-snarling-the-new-york-city-mayors-race" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">errors</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_New_York_City_Democratic_mayoral_primary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign implosions</a> snarled the process and ultimately led to Eric Adams coming out on top. This time around, candidates have been slow to work together but ultimately done so, most notably with candidates Brad Lander and Mamdani <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/13/mamdani-lander-cross-endorsing-mayor-00405357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endorsing</a> each other through a message most of the Democratic candidates have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/opponents-left-are-banding-together-try-stop-andrew-cuomo-new-york-cit-rcna212967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rallied</a> around: don't rank Andrew Cuomo.</p><p>To that end, game designer and former New Yorker Robert Yang has released a free browser game called <em><a href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/cuomo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don't Rank Cuomo</a></em>, where players click their way through changing versions of NYC ballots in an effort not to click on Cuomo's name. Yang writes, "why should New Yorkers have all the fun?&nbsp;Now through the timeless magic of video games, anyone can&nbsp;don't rank Cuomo!" The game quickly gets tricky, with entries not in English or ballot positions that swiftly move around, all with a time limit to ramp up the pressure. Despite this, it's pretty forgiving, giving you opportunities to try again if you mis-click or run out of time.</p><p>Yang wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3lsa4bx2frs2a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that the mods of the "NYC" reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/1lhmn09/hey_i_made_a_free_little_web_browser_game_for_new/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted a link</a> to the game, which is very funny but also coincidentally highlights how contentious this race has been. The <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/politics/2025/06/pro-cuomo-pac-responsible-nearly-half-all-outside-spending-across-all-nyc-primary-elections-year/406209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monied Cuomo camp</a> has gone on a campaign to discredit Mamdani, who has the best chance of taking him on, while everyone else has been <a href="https://hellgatenyc.com/cuomo-opponents-remind-new-yorkers-sexual-harassment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desperately trying to remind voters</a> that, whoever you favor, you don't have to rank Cuomo just because you've heard his name before.  </p><p>Through how frequently Cuomo's name slipped under my mouse cursor, Yang's game points to how hard Cuomo is working to make New Yorkers feel like they have to vote for him. But the game also highlights the way in which NYC's ranked choice system gives voters more options than just "vote for a bad guy" or "stay home." More than just hoping your preferred candidate wins, you can use your ranked choice ballot to actively cast a vote <em>against</em> a candidate you dislike. Our political system can look like more than just sighing heavily and holding our noses. If you're in NYC, Tuesday's primary is a small chance to put a different system into action. </p><p>Both <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/andrew-cuomo-fight-and-deliver-party/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuomo</a> and <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/03/eric-adams-reelection-independent-00267865?ref=fast-politics.ghost.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Adams</a> will likely end up on November's mayoral ballot regardless of how Tuesday's primary goes, though the <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2025/04/03/working-families-party-general-election-candidate-mayor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Working Families Party</a> has plans to challenge them there too. So whatever happens Tuesday, things are far from decided. If you're in NYC and haven't voted yet, please (safely) brave tomorrow's heat to do so, and encourage those you know to do so too. And if you aren't a New Yorker, you can live our horrors, but also our joys, vicariously through a video game from the comfort of your computer.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips"><h3>SiIvaGunner Is An Elaborate Game Music Joke Collective And One Of The Best Parts Of YouTube</h3></a><p>SiIvagunner started as YouTube elaborate in-joke about game music on YouTube and has evolved into a volunteer, Discord-managed democratic artist collective.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song"><h3>New Scylla Songs!</h3></a><p>"Now we've got you in our tentacles"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game]]></content:encoded>
