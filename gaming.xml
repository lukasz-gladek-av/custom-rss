<p>UFL, a free-to-play football game from Strikerz Inc., was set to be released in just a few days, on September 12. However, it has suddenly been delayed by three months by the developer, being pushed back to December 2024. It was cited that the pushback is because of concerns about the game’s quality, with Strikerz Inc. wanting to deliver the best experience possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-already-popular">Already Popular</h2>



<p>Several weeks ago, UFL underwent a massively successful open beta test that pulled in more than two million players. Many of them opted to throw some cash at UFL to secure early access to the full game, which was due to commence in the coming days. </p>



<p>It’s these players that are most irritated by the delay, as their early access period now won’t arrive until the end of November.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.uflgame.com/en-en/blog/ufl-release-date-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement published</a> on the UFL site, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Having analyzed your feedback and a lot of game data, we’ve decided to reschedule the UFL release. We’d like to explain why we made this decision and what it means for you. While we could release the game as scheduled, we believe taking a little more time will allow us to provide the best experience possible. </p>



<p>The majority of issues are related to polishing and fine-tuning the features that contribute to the game’s overall feel.<strong> </strong>We understand that there’s no recipe for a perfect football game, but it’s essential for us to ensure the game meets our high standards — and your expectations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>UFL will now be released on December 5 and <strong>not </strong>September 12, as previously announced. If you’ve pre-ordered and paid cash money for the game, you’ll get access on November 28.</p>



<p>Many have slammed this decision as irresponsible, explaining that UFL will now be forgotten as EA Sports FC 25 will be released at the end of September and will be the priority title for soccer fans. </p>



<p>Were you looking forward to playing UFL?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-regrets-guitar-hero-destiny/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phil-spencer-regrets-%E2%80%98passing%E2%80%99-on-destiny-and-guitar-hero.970470/</guid>

<p>In a recent segment that aired at PAX West, Phil Spencer spoke at length about his time in the gaming industry, leaning on some of the choices he regrets making many years ago. In the ‘Story Time with Phil Spencer’ presentation, the Xbox leader revealed that he mourns ‘passing on’ games like Destiny and Guitar Hero.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-worst-game-choice-decisions">‘The Worst Game-Choice Decisions’</h2>



<p>Over an hour at PAX West, Phil Spencer divulged his intimate experiences with the games industry, touching on anecdotes dating back more than twenty years. During his segment, he revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve passed on some of the worst… Like, made some of the worst game-choice decisions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Expanding on that, Spencer revealed that he never secured Destiny effectively at Xbox, missing the opportunity to make it an Xbox exclusive. He admitted it ‘didn’t click’ with him when he played it. It took months for him to be swayed by Destiny, which at the time was naturally close to Microsoft thanks to Bungie being under the firm’s umbrella.</p>



<p>He then spoke about dropping the ball with Guitar Hero because he didn’t think the concept would work:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>An interesting one is when this team came down to Redmond and Alex Rigopulos, he pitches a game where they’re actually going to make plastic guitars, and they’re going to plug into consoles, and then they’re going to sell tracks where you’re going to play Simon on this guitar and I’m like, really? Do we really think that’s going to work?</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-made-some-of-the-worst-game-choice-decisions-says-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Eurogamer</a> for the quotes</em></p>



<p>Activision ultimately picked up both Destiny and Guitar Hero from a publishing perspective, and both became remarkably successful titles. In 2009, Activision claimed that Guitar Hero 3 was the highest-grossing game of all time, and when it was released, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2011-03-25-npd-guitar-hero-3-is-this-generations-highest-grossing-game.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABT5B4QkI_KEyu55Ptwv1eO_J4F2Q4xxJNL6VOHfLmlYg3qB6GTnQ8gqtoc5cDG_4e77-bn2_bqc1OdmpHZ5bwTnsr6Sa8mhaEnZJyHvS6c7olBcJz_Lu7C9_1NJEELkwYWSN-jjoRZSrkCWTMsmjCmMM90P0oZCNM7NgAQ08TrA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it beat the likes</a> of Wii Fit and Black Ops in gross sales.</p>



<p>In dollars and cents figures, it was claimed that Guitar Hero 3 grossed almost $1 billion.</p>



<p>In Phil Spencer’s words, ‘I heard that turned into a pretty good game…’</p>

<p>In January, gameplay surfaced from a cancelled Call of Duty project that would have been developed and released by Neversoft in 2013. It was dubbed ‘Future Warfare’ and compiled under the codename ‘NX1’, and several months ago, snippets of gameplay were leaked online.</p>



<p>Now, a full Xbox 360-based beta build for Call of Duty: Future Warfare has surfaced online. It was spotted by eagle-eyed Reddit users, with several users on social media posting images and clips of the Call of Duty title sadly lost to the depths of time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prototype-ghosts">‘Prototype Ghosts’</h2>



<p>Both the leaks that surfaced in January and the gameplay leaks that have appeared in recent days bear striking similarities to Call of Duty: Ghosts, the title that was eventually released in 2013. Neversoft was a supporting studio in the development of Call of Duty: Ghosts, with the lead studio being Infinite Ward. </p>



<p>That might go some way to explaining why there are a few resemblances between the two games.</p>



<p>On the Gaming Leaks and Rumours Reddit, images and videos were posted showcasing the leaked beta product, but owing to the terms of service of the site, no download links were provided. However, in the thread that followed, several users advised on how to find and download the build – which we advise you to do with <strong>extreme caution</strong> if you decide to go down that path.</p>



<p>Below is one such clip uploaded to Twitter:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-future-warfare-leaked/">In January’s leaks</a>, we learned the names of several maps, modes, and a bit of context about the story. It was eventually scrapped, but not before Neversoft had pieced together a few campaign missions and some multiplayer content.</p>

            <p>
Enotria: The Last Song, the "summer Soulslike" from Italian indie developer Jyamma Games, has been delayed indefinitely on Xbox - just weeks before its planned 19th September release - with the studio claiming Microsoft has "decided to ignore us" as it attempts to navigate certification.
</p>
<p>
Enotria - a third-person action-adventure set in a sun-lit world inspired by Italian folklore - has had an erratic relationship with Microsoft's platform so far. Back in March, Jyamma revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">no longer be launching Enotria on Xbox</a> at the same time as other platforms, so it could focus its efforts on creating a "superior experience for PC and PS5 players".
</p>
<p>
However, two months later, it announced a revised release date - shifting the game's launch from August to September - with an Xbox version suddenly back on the cards. But Jyamma is now slamming the brakes on once more, delaying Enotria: The Last Song indefinitely on Xbox as a result of what it initially <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">only referred to</a> as "challenges".

<p>
As <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/they-dont-care-about-enotria-and-they-dont-care-about-you-jyamma-games-ceo-blasts-xbox-amidst-indefinite-delay">spotted by Windows Central</a>, though, Jyamma CEO Jacky Greco later went into additional detail on Discord. Following a community manager's statement dismissing speculation the studio had been "paid by Sony", Greco shared his own frustrations relating to the delay. "You can ask Xbox why they haven't answered us for two months," he wrote. "Obviously they don't care about Enotria and they don't care about you... We've Xbox Series X/S version ready, but we can't proceed with submission and release, I spent a lot of money for porting and they decided to ignore us."
</p>
<p>
A similar statement also <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830673938311250263">appeared</a> on Enotria's X/Twitter feed. After a fan inquired about the "main challenge" holding up release, Jyamma wrote, "Communication with Xbox. The game works fine on Series S and X but we cannot go through the submission process and they can take even two months to reply to us."
</p>
<p>
Greco later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/">shared</a> a little more on the issue the studio had enountered, explaining it was unable to open Enotria's Xbox store page and submit the game - something Microsoft's support teams reportedly initially took responsibility for, before further communications were ignored. "We really want to release the game on Xbox ASAP," Jyamma <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830670151106338864">added</a> elsewhere, "but with lack of communication on their side it is a hard task indeed."
</p>
<p>
The suggestion seems to be things might be resolved pretty quickly if Jyamma could get a response from Microsoft, but in the meantime, Enotria: The Last Song will only be available for PlayStation 5 and PC when it launches on 19th September.

<p>Fortnite is soon entering the third week of Chapter 5, Season 4, and players are worried about whether they can collect all battle pass rewards before the season ends. One of the best ways to gain XP and jump through tiers in the battle pass is by completing weekly quests, as completing a set of them can net you loads of XP. This guide will explain how to complete Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Week 2 Quests.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-2-quests">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 2 Quests</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 2’s quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Eliminate opponents with the Striker AR (3)</li>



<li>Sprint distance after taking damage (100)</li>



<li>Use a Mod Bench in different matches (2)</li>



<li>Damage opponents within 5 seconds of receiving damage (150)</li>



<li>Hire Characters or recruit defeated Henchmen (5)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-fortnite-week-2-quests">How to complete Fortnite Week 2 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-opponents-with-the-striker-ar">Eliminate opponents with the Striker AR.</h3>



<p>The first Quest for Fortnite Week 2 can be done quickly. All you need to do is land at one of the new POIs and look for the Striker AR. Alternatively, you can also take on Emma Frost at The Raft and defeat them to acquire the mythic Striker AR. Once you have found the weapon, eliminate 3 NPCs or opponents to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sprint-distance-after-taking-damage">Sprint distance after taking damage</h3>



<p>The next one is also an easy task. For this Fortnite Week 2 quest, pick up a fight with one of the NPCs, let them shoot you once and then run like there’s no tomorrow. Keep on running until you receive a ‘Quest Completed’ pop-up.&nbsp;Players have to run for 100 meters to complete this quest. </p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-mod-bench-in-different-matches">Use a Mod Bench in different matches</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 2 quest is challenging, but not for the reasons you think. The main issue with using a mod bench is that it is only available in limited areas: vaults and the floating island. Moreover, these areas are only accessible halfway through the match, so surviving for that long can be challenging for some. However, once you can access the mod bench, you must add one or more attachments to any weapon across two games to complete the quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-within-5-seconds-of-receiving-damage">Damage opponents within 5 seconds of receiving damage</h3>



<p>The next one is another challenging quest requiring you to engage in battle. Fortunately, similar to all the other quests, you can complete this quest, too, by damaging NPCs. So just head on over to one of the NPCs, let them shoot you first and reply instantly with a shotgun to the face. One or two tries should be enough to finish the quest. If you feel confident, try completing this against a real player.&nbsp;To compete with this question, you must inflict 150 damage in the first 5 seconds of receiving damage. </p>

<h3 id="h-hire-characters-or-recruit-defeated-henchmen">Hire Characters or recruit defeated Henchmen</h3>



<p>The last Fortnite Week 2 quest has players hiring other characters and henchmen to do their dirty work. Players can find many characters across the map who can be employed with gold bars. On the other hand, Henchman needs to be knocked down first, and then you can interact with the downed Henchman to recruit them.&nbsp;Hiring or recruiting 5 of them should do the trick. </p>



<hr>



<p>That’s all the quests for Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4, Week 2. In the comments, let us know which ones you will complete first.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s another week, so more headlines about Xbox are due to hit the internet. Enotria: The Last Song has taken the spotlight this time and claimed in its recent press release that it will have to delay its Xbox version due to encountering challenges with Xbox.</p>



<p>As always, social media erupted with wild theories and accusations, with the usual console war bullshit spreading, such as the game had to be delayed due to the Series S. </p>



<p>I managed to talk a little more in-depth to Giacomo Greco, CEO of Jyamma Games, about the issues and why the game has been delayed for Xbox. The TL;DR answer is that the game has been postponed due to a lack of communication from Xbox regarding an issue where the developer can not open its store page and submit the game. Greco tells me that the issue has nothing to do with the hardware limitations of the Series S. In fact, Greco assures me that everything on the Series S runs fine and that there have just been some minor tweaks to the graphic settings.</p>



<p>Greco says that the company has had this issue for months [not allowing them to create a store page] and has been back and forth with various Xbox support teams and people. Still, none of them have figured out the issue and have admitted the problem is on their [Xbox’s] end. In the end, Jyamma Games’ requests eventually fell on deaf ears, meaning that they had to postpone the Xbox version.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Xbox will resolve this issue so that Enotria can be released soon, but Greco said, “We will do our best to make the release [on Xbox] as soon as we can.”</p>



<p>For now, though, Jyamma Games has no answers and a significant hole in its bank from spending on an Xbox port.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment.</p>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-1-quests-nbsp">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 1 Quests&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite Week 1 quests for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a>&nbsp;season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Damage opponents while airborne (500)</li>



<li>Eliminate an opponent with Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol (1)</li>



<li>Reach 10 players remaining (1)</li>



<li>Travel distance while airborne in a vehicle (100)</li>



<li>Search chests in Named Locations (25)</li>



<li>Eliminate opponents (3)</li>



<li>Collect Common or Uncommon weapons (15)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-how-do-you-complete-fortnite-week-1-quests">How do you complete Fortnite Week 1 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-while-airborne">Damage opponents while airborne</h3>



<p>The first one is simple: players only need to inflict 500 damage while airborne, and there are two ways to do so. First, you must get your hands on War Machine’s Hover Jets. Then, head to any location with NPCs, fly up in the air, and start riddling them with bullets. Alternatively, you can jump while shooting, and the damage in the air will count towards this Fortnite Week 1 quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-an-opponent-with-doctor-doom-s-monarch-pistol-nbsp">Eliminate an opponent with Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 1 quest is pretty simple; however, acquiring Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol might be challenging. To do so, you must head to Castle Doom and square off with Doombot. Defeating him will grant you the Monarch Pistol and the Doom Gauntlets. Once you have acquired the Monarch Pistol, beat a player or an NPC to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-reach-10-players-remaining">Reach 10 players remaining</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 1 quest is purely skill-based and may need some tries. Reaching 10 players remaining can be difficult in solos, so consider inviting your friends for this quest.</p>

<h3 id="h-travel-distance-while-airborne-in-a-vehicle">Travel distance while airborne in a vehicle</h3>



<p>For this one, players need to travel 100 meters while airborne in the vehicle, and you can do this in one go if you find the correct slope and use the boosts at the right time. One good strategy would be to drive it off a cliff as the long descent would also help towards the meters travelled. Alternatively, you can also visit the welding tower near Castle Doom and use the wind to get a jump start and then boost away in any direction to complete the Fortnite Week 1 quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-search-chests-in-named-locations-eliminate-opponents-and-collect-common-or-uncommon-weapons-nbsp">Search chests in Named Locations, Eliminate opponents and Collect Common or Uncommon weapons.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The following 3 Fortnite Week 1 quests are pretty simple. The first one needs players to search for 25 chests across all named locations, which can be completed across multiple matches. The next one needs you to eliminate three opponents. For the last one, you must collect 15 common or uncommon weapons. None of these three quests require individual effort and might be completed as you play the game.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<p>That’s all the quests for Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4, Week 1. In the comments, let us know which ones you will complete first.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Developers have often cited the Xbox Series S console as a limitation and/or a significant optimization <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenge</a> during game development. Microsoft's choice to deliver a cheaper but considerably less powerful hardware (the Xbox Series S only has 20 Compute Units clocked at 1.565 GHz for an estimated computing power of 4 TFLOPS, whereas the X has 52 Compute Units clocked at 1.825 GHz for an estimated computing power of 12.16 TFLOPS) still has fans debating whether it was worth it, four years alter. Xbox console sales are still dwindling, and developers continue to point at the issues of optimizing their games for the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>The latest to do so is Funcom's Chief Product Officer Scott Junior, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> as part of our Dune Awakening Gamescom Q&amp;A. In another interview at the Cologne convention, Junior <a href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> VG247 that one of the reasons for the game's delay on consoles compared to PC is the need to optimize for Microsoft's weaker console.</p>
<p><em>So, it's one of the reasons we're coming out on PC first. There's a lot of optimisations we need to do before we release on the Xbox. But yeah, Xbox Series S is a challenge.</em></p>
<p><em>Unreal does a lot of the work for us in some ways. What we're more doing is optimisation of assets, and using various technologies, be it FSR or something else, to replicate frames. We want the game to look stunning on high-end, whether you have a 3070 or a 4090, but we also want it to look good... I don't think we've released our min-spec yet, but you know, powerful cards from a few years ago should be able to run the game. It should look good - it won't be able to leverage the ultra-spec options, but it'll still look nice.</em></p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-currently-runs-at-25-fps-on-series-s-but-xbox-is-helping-with-optimization-devs-praise-their-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from GSC Game World that the Ukrainian developer is now optimizing STALKER 2 for the Xbox Series S after successfully bringing it to 60 frames per second on the X. The game is currently running at around 35 frames per second, but they're aiming to improve it (with some help from Microsoft's team) before the launch on November 20.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dune-awakening-xbox-series-s-challenge-funcom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-a-%E2%80%9Cchallenge-%E2%80%9D-funcom-says.970272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dune-awakening-xbox-series-s-challenge-funcom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It seems as if Xbox is taking nothing but “Ls” lately, with numerous developers stepping forward to discuss how difficult it is to work with their hardware and restrictions. We still don’t have word on Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox, with countless rumors circulating about why. Now, developer Funcom says bringing Dune: Awakening to Xbox Series S is giving them some trouble. It’s a “challenge,” they said.</p>



<p>When talking about the issues surrounding Dune: Awakening’s development on Xbox Series S specifically, chief product officer Scott Junor, at Gamescom last month, as reported by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, said the game is set to release on PC and PlayStation 5 simultaneously but not on Xbox day one due to the Xbox Series S proving to be a “challenge.” He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So, it’s one of the reasons we’re coming out on PC first. There’s a lot of optimisations we need to do before we release on the Xbox. But yeah, Xbox Series S is a challenge. </p>



<p>Unreal does a lot of the work for us in some ways. What we’re more doing is optimisation of assets, and using various technologies, be it FSR or something else, to replicate frames. We want the game to look stunning on high-end, whether you have a 3070 or a 4090, but we also want it to look good… I don’t think we’ve released our min-spec yet, but y’know powerful cards from a few years ago should be able to run the game. It should look good – it won’t be able to leverage the ultra-spec options, but it’ll still look nice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-dune-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">For those who don’t know</a>, Dune: Awakening brings the world of Frank Herbert’s design to a grand scale with a massively multiplayer online survival game in which players will loot, craft, and wage war across the deserts of Arrakis in a bid for power and spice. You can eventually form a House and become more powerful.</p>



<p>With such a massive endeavor, it makes sense that Funcom finds the lesser hardware of the Xbox Series S a “challenge” to work with to create its vision without sacrificing quality or content. </p>

            <p>
Thatcher's Techbase - the Doom WAD that sees players descending to the Tenth Circle of Hell to thwart the return of "one of humanity's greatest threats" - has been yanked from Bethesda's new in-game mod browser after being reported for "real-world politics".
</p>
<p>
Thatcher's Techbase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thatchers-techbase-sees-the-return-of-one-of-humanitys-greatest-threats">initially released back in 2021</a>, but developer Jim Purvis recently decided to take advantage of Bethesda's official community-published mod support - which launched for PC and consoles as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-1-2-enhanced-bundle-surfaces-on-steam-with-new-episode-from-machinegames">Doom 1 &amp; 2's enhanced bundle</a> back in August - giving Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox owners the opportunity to play the WAD for the first time.
</p>
<p>
But alas, the four-map Thatcher's Techbase - which includes a soundtrack by Paradise Killer composer Barry "Epoch" Topping and voice work from Hades' Laila Berzins - has now seen its moment in the console spotlight come to a premature end.

<p>
In a takedown notice <a href="https://x.com/letshugbro/status/1829549197429027287">shared by Purvis on social media</a>, Bethesda said Thatcher's Techbase had "been reported for real-world politics and has been removed". While the company stressed the mod was not in violation of its Terms of Service or Code of Conduct, it encouraged Purvis to "educate yourself on Modding Guidelines and Community Rules".
</p>
<p>
Thatcher's Techbase does, of course, remain available to PC players through the usual, non-Bethesda channels - and while console players will now be missing out, they can at least take some solace in the fact they're playing a decent version of Doom. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-doom-and-doom-2-are-nightdives-latest-remasters-the-definitive-editions">recently took at look at developer Nightdive's latest remasters</a> of the id Software classics, calling them, "Not quite perfect - but excellent nonetheless."

<h2 id="h-there-is-bound-to-be-some-darkness">‘There Is Bound To Be Some Darkness’</h2>



<p>Jyamma Games <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed in a recent release</a> that it’ll be some time before Enotria: The Last Song is released on Xbox, if it ever surfaces at all:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Even in the beautifully detailed world of Enotria, there is bound to be some darkness.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, at this time, we have to announce an indefinite delay of the Xbox version.</p>



<p>We understand how disappointing this news is to the Xbox community. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and the hard work of our dedicated team, we’ve encountered challenges that have delayed our release on the Xbox platform. We want to emphasize that this is not a decision we’ve made lightly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Enotria is a Soulslike with a unique aesthetic based on ‘Italian folklore’. The world in the game is detailed and sumptuous, boasting intense architecture and rich environments filled with cathedrals, castles, and ancient ruins. </p>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 4 has brought Marvel back to the island, with some great cosmetics up for grabs in the battle pass. However, earning enough XP to cross all those tiers can be difficult for some players. A great way to acquire XP in Fortnite is through weekly quests, and this guide will walk you through all the Week 0 quests of the latest season.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-0-quests-nbsp">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 0 Quests&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 0’s quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Damage Opponents with Dual Micro SMGs (1,000)</li>



<li>Search containers in different Named Locations in a single match (2)</li>



<li>Hide in hiding places or bushes in different matches (3)</li>



<li>Eliminate opponents with SMGs or shotguns (10)</li>



<li>Eliminate an opponent with Captain America’s Shield (1)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-how-do-you-complete-fortnite-s-week-0-quests-nbsp">How do you complete Fortnite’s Week 0 Quests?&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-with-dual-micro-smgs">Damage Opponents with Dual Micro SMGs</h3>



<p>For this Fortnite Week 0 quest, players must use the Dual Micro SMGs; this weapon can be found anywhere on the Fortnite island, through chests, on the ground or through other players and NPC characters. Players have to inflict 1,000 points of damage with this weapon, and fortunately, you can damage NPCs for this quest. Therefore, consider landing at Castle Doom and taking out the Doombots for this quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-search-containers-in-different-named-locations-in-a-single-match">Search containers in different Named Locations in a single match</h3>



<p>In this quest, players must loot as they usually would during matches. Just land at one of the named locations and open chests, Avengers chest or ammo box, then head to another named location and do the same to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-hide-in-hiding-places-or-bushes-in-different-matches-nbsp">Hide in hiding places or bushes in different matches.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>To complete this quest, you have to hide in three different places. These include bushes, dumpsters, and porta potties. You can find them at POIs like Castle Doom, The Raft, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-returns-for-ios-devices-in-eu-and-android-devices-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Returns for iOS Devices in EU and Android Devices Globally </a></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-opponents-with-smgs-or-shotguns-nbsp">Eliminate opponents with SMGs or shotguns&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is one of the Fortnite Week 0 quests requiring some skill, as players must eliminate ten opponents with either the Dual Micro SMGs or the Sovereign Shotgun. Fortunately, this quest can be completed over multiple matches, but remember to provide the finishing blow with either your shotgun or the SMGs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-an-opponent-with-captain-america-s-shield">Eliminate an opponent with Captain America’s Shield</h3>



<p>Captain America’s Shield is the new mythic weapon in the latest Fortnite season; it allows players to shield themselves, damage multiple opponents at a time, and ram through stuff, too. Finding this mythic can be difficult, but an Avengers chest might be your best. Once you have acquired Captain America’s Shield, you can eliminate an NPC to complete the quest. If you are confident, take on a real opponent for this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That’s all the quests for Fortnite Chapter 5, Season 4, Week 0. In the comments, let us know which ones you will complete first.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>London-based game developer Rocksteady has suffered layoffs, according to a report freshly published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer</a>. The bulk of the layoffs is reportedly found in the studio's Quality Assurance department, which had its headcount nearly halved to 15 down from 33. Moreover, at least one non-QA member of the studio has publicly revealed on social media he was fired while on paternity leave.</p>
<p>Sources within Rocksteady cited by Eurogamer acknowledge that this round of layoffs will inevitably cut into the quality of game development, as well as burden the remaining developers with more work.</p>
<p>The cause can easily be found in the failure of the studio's most recent game, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. It took Rocksteady nine years after Batman: Arkham Knight (eight if you count Batman: Arkham VR), and despite all this time, the final game was highly disappointing. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a mediocre 5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>
<p>Its performance was just as bad, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing</a> Warner Bros. a 41% decrease in game revenues year-over-year compared to February 2023's outstanding launch of Hogwarts Legacy, which would become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-selling game of 2023</a>. Rocksteady has attempted to improve Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch but with little effect on its overall reception.</p>
<p>According to a previous rumor, a portion of the studio is currently helping make a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Director's Cut version of Hogwarts Legacy</a>. The good news is that even after these layoffs, Rocksteady doesn't seem to be in any real danger of being shut down, and there are whispers it will go back to what it does best: Batman games.</p>

It absolutely captured that late-70s sci-fi aesthetic of dark gray cladding broken up by utilitarian-gray panels covered in dull blinking lights, and I stopped to think about how much work must have gone into that wall. Looking elsewhere on the screen, I was then overwhelmed. This wall was the most bland thing in a vast hanger, where TIE Fighters hung from the ceiling, Stormtroopers wandered in groups below, and even the little white sign with the yellow arrow looked like it was a decade old, meticulously crafted to fit into this universe. I felt sheer astonishment at the achievement of this. Ubisoft, via multiple studios across the whole world, and the work of thousands of deeply talented people, had built this impossibly perfect area for one momentary scene that I was intended to run straight past.<br></p><p>Except I ran past it three times, because the AI kept fucking up and I was restarted at a checkpoint right before that gray wall over and over.</p><figure id="" data-id="1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-recommend-id="image://1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stands in front of a planet-set, with rocky mountains against the orange sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay stands in front of a planet-set, with rocky mountains against the orange sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-recommend-id="image://1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stands in front of a planet-set, with rocky mountains against the orange sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m struggling to capture the dissonance of this moment. This sense of absolute awe, almost unbelieving admiration that it’s even possible to build games at this scale and at this detail, slapped hard around the face by the bewilderingly bad decisions that take place within it all.</p><p>To be excited about a beautifully crafted wall is to set yourself up for an aneurysm when you start to notice the tiny, inflecting details on characters’ faces, or the scrupulous idle animations of a bored guard. Then as I tried to conceive that this same level of care was taking place across thousands of locations in multiple cities over a handful of planets, my genuine thought was: “It’s ridiculous that we mark these games on the same criteria as others.” How can someone look at <em>this</em>, this <em>majesty</em>, and say, “Hmmm, seven out of ten?” And then a guard sees me through a solid hillside and ruins fifteen minutes of painstaking stealth, and I wonder how it can be on sale at all.</p><p>In 2024, we have reached the most deeply peculiar place, where AAA games are feats that humanity would once have recognized as literal wonders, and yet play with the same irritating issues and tedious repetition as we saw in the 90s. This contrast, this dissonance, is absolutely fascinating.</p><figure id="" data-id="7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-recommend-id="image://7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flying toward a wreck in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flying toward a wreck in space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-recommend-id="image://7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flying toward a wreck in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft strikes me as the leader in this bizarre space.

The <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series routinely builds entire cities, even countries, in authentic detail, to the point where we almost take it for granted. It has always struck me as the most horrendous waste that a game like <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey </em>can recreate ancient Greece in such wonderful detail, and then gets thrown away, that entire digital space never used again for anything else. It could be given to the world, offered as a setting for a thousand indie games, reused and recycled as such an achievement deserves. Instead, it’s there for that single game, where we reasonably kvetch about the frustrating details of a broken quest, or at how crowd AI bugs out at crucial moments.</p><p>And this is only to touch on the art and architecture. We’re not even mentioning the fantastic writing, the exquisite voice acting, the sound effects, the musical score, the lighting, the concept art that makes such designs possible, and the direction and leadership that can bring all these disparate parts together. All as a backdrop to my repeating the run across the gantry because a distant AI decided to be triggered by a Nix it couldn’t possibly see, or because that time when I pressed Square it decided to throw a punch instead of trigger a takedown.</p><figure id="" data-id="071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-recommend-id="image://071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stares at an industrial complex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay stares at an industrial complex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-recommend-id="image://071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stares at an industrial complex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m old enough to remember a time when we’d lament that a beautifully drawn point-and-click adventure was no fun to play, and be so disappointed that such lovely artistic skill had been the backdrop for illogical puzzles and bad writing. Imagine the camera shot pulling out from that adventure game and revealing the room it’s in, the house that contains that room, the town that house is in, the city that town forms part of, and the country in which that city exists—that gets you close to the scale at which the same issue plagues us 40 years later.</p><p>Just that opening city in <em>O</em>utlaws, Mirogana, is more than gaming was capable of ten years ago, let alone 40. It, alone, would be enough for an entire game, with plots and missions and characters. And it’s a blip in this game’s mindblowing breadth. I cannot over-express the scale of what’s offered here, and how incongruous it feels that it can all feel so easily dismissed given such fundamental errors. Errors that mean the game attracts headlines like, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/star-wars-outlaws-simple-gameplay-combat-stealth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/star-wars-outlaws-simple-gameplay-combat-stealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Is Too Simplistic For Its Own Good</a></span>.” And I get it! I know what the article means! It’s right that its stealth is banal and badly implemented, and yet such a core element of the game. But God damn, why are we able to reasonably call <em>this creation</em> “simplistic”?</p><p>I’ve no idea what the solution can possibly be, but I feel it sits somewhere in a new order of priority. One that involves scaling back the ambition of everything that a large-scale developer knows it <em>can </em>achieve, and re-focuses resources on fixing the absolute basics that it so often cannot. Because the tragedy of a piece of art like <em>Outlaws</em>—or any number of other architectural masterpieces that we see come and go in this industry every month—being able to be sniffed at with a (deserved) 7/10, is too awful.</p><p>Read More: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>At Gamescom this year, I saw a talk (currently embargoed) about how wind will cause a game’s world to behave differently, and on one level it was incredible stuff, a technological marvel.

It could end up being a 7/10 game with technologically astounding wind.</p><p>And so I come back to that wall. And I thank everyone involved in making it so special, the artists who spent so long ensuring it felt authentic, and the level designers who placed it, and the people responsible for collision detection who ensured I couldn’t walk through it, and the people who coded the Snowdrop engine so it could exist at all, and the producers who encouraged the developers who implemented it, and every single person who was in some way responsible for making me that wall to momentarily stare at.

<p>As someone who typically spends more time in single-player campaigns than competitive multiplayer scenes, I’m excited for more bombastic gameplay from Call of Duty in October. But as the game primarily focuses on multiplayer, there’s more info about the competitive gameplay than anything else. So, here’s everything you need to know about the Black Ops 6 campaign before release!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-have-a-campaign">Will Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Have a Campaign?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, yes, Black Ops 6 has a complete campaign with numerous missions that allow you to approach your objective uniquely. They’re not all moving to Point A, shooting everything in sight, watching a cutscene, rinse, and repeat. Players are said to have access to a safe house between missions, where they can play out upcoming objectives with an evidence board, along with upgrades and NPC dialogue to help further the story.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-story-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">What is the Story of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s story mode is set in the early 1990s, following the fall of the Berlin Wall. We’ll interact with high-profile politicians and military personnel, contend with cutthroat spycraft, infiltrate compounds, and utilize spy gadgetry to complete objectives.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Black Ops 6 at gamescom - “Most Wanted” Campaign Level Playthrough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fh03Y7Hgv08?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As is typical with the Black Ops storyline throughout the years, the sixth game features numerous story twists that should keep the gameplay and storyline fresh and leave us guessing what’s to come. </p>



<p>Of course, being Call of Duty, there’s a lot of bombastic gameplay, too. We’ll breach and clear safe houses, engage in all-out warfare, and utilize a number of unique pieces of equipment and weapons to get each job done.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-campaign-in-black-ops-6">How Long is the Campaign in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Following the rather disappointing and depressing length of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III’s campaign last year, which took some players just a few hours to finish, Treyarch aims to impress this go-around. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-wont-be-a-long-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign length</a> for Black Ops 6 is said to be approximately eight hours from start to finish. As always, some players may finish it sooner, and many will take longer, depending on their play style.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-a-sequel-to-cold-war">Is Black Ops 6 a Sequel to Cold War?</h2>



<p>Set in the early 1990s, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be a direct sequel to Call of Duty: Cold War, which was set in the 1980s. As expected, Frank Woods returns as part of the storyline, “adjusting to a new role within the CIA.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, we know that Alex Mason and Jason Hudson, both of whom played significant roles in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, are dead in Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>If you’re participating in the Black Ops 6 multiplayer beta, you might want to learn more about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-beta-progress-carry-over/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what carries over and what doesn’t</a> upon full release in October!</p>

			<p>Survival Horror is going through a big resurgence at the moment (even if it never really went away) with genre titans <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/check-out-two-new-trailers-for-silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill</a> being joined by originators like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a> and indie breakouts such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>. Amongst this assortment of monstrous experiences, Conscript stands out with its setting and visuals. Largely the work of a solo developer, Jordan Mochi, the end result is a traumatic and challenging game that takes the tried and tested tropes of the genre and mixes them with a truly horrific tone and feel.</p>
<p><iframe title="CONSCRIPT | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg0_nVHmbWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While not unique in its wartime setting – relatively recently both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/07/psychological-horror-ad-infinitum-new-trailer/">Ad Infinitum</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/17/amnesia-the-bunker-review/">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> featured a similar backdrop – Conscript really comes into its own by focusing on the real horrors and traumas of The Great War (a name that becomes more ironic as time marches on). Supernatural elements are largely kept to the background here and instead the most horrific aspects are the violence and inhuman acts carried out by soldiers following orders. Your fragility and fears go a long way to replace the usual zombies and monsters that characterise the genre.</p>


<p>Set during the Battle of Verdun, you play as a French soldier who is trying to find his missing brother and make it through the conflict alive. In between chapters you play through short quiet flashbacks that help to familiarise you with your character and their background whilst also serving to offer a dynamic contrast with the dark and claustrophobic nature of the rest of the game. While this highly personal story runs the risk of romanticising or sentimentalising a savage and lethal part of history, the opposite is the case. This story places you within the conflict and gives you the opportunity to empathise with those put in an impossible position.</p>


<p>Conscript’s art direction is very distinctive. Using a top-down camera and employing a PS1 era level of fidelity gives the game a grimy look that is perfectly suited to the trenches and bunkers you’ll be traversing. The use of line of sight and the environmental darkness ensure that you never feel at ease too. Environments themselves are somewhat lacking in variety but that is a necessary part of the setting. That being said, the game does offer a range of locations from the trenches and forts to an occupied French town. The audio accompanying this is suitably oppressive and low key with the main focus being on atmospheric sound effects.</p>
<p>Very much in keeping with the Survival Horror genre, you’ll spend your time scavenging for resources, making choices about how best to best items to craft new supplies, juggling your weapons within a limited inventory and solving puzzles using logic and key items. This is all very on brand and there is little here that deviates from the established traditions, but that isn’t a criticism. In fact, most of the puzzles are well designed and just difficult enough to be enjoyable with a number requiring you to make notes.</p>

<p>Combat is a pretty large component of the game too, with a decent range of melee and ranged weapons to be scavenged and used as you try to survive. Enemies mostly consist of a handful of German troops with armaments that go from shovels to flamethrowers. A couple of more armoured types are used as mini bosses, but the combat is deliberately monotonous to highlight the pointlessness of the conflict. Your weapons can be upgraded by collecting weapon parts scattered across the maps and a recurring merchant is available who feels like an early ancestor of Resident Evil’s more iconic shopkeep. Here, the main currency is cigarettes, an especially evocative period feature.</p>
<p>There are various difficulty levels available, with extra rewards and trophies locked behind specific approaches, such as not killing outside of setpiece encounters or not taking damage. I began on the default difficulty and it mostly felt the right side of challenging, but the pre-release build did suffer from a rodent problem as the swarms of rats that appear after a few hours were far too fast and savage, with their attacks made even worse by a virulent poison effect. You can mitigate this to some extent by using grenades to destroy their nests and by burning bodies to prevent them spawning. This has been addressed in a patch (at least on PC) so should be less of a problem now.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Conscript is a worthy entry into the Survival Horror genre and comes highly recommended. It takes all the ingredients of the genre and marries them to a vital and under-represented part of history in video games to create a standout title that deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>
