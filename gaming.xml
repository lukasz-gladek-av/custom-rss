            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>I’ve spent every evening the past week reuniting with a dear old friend. Super Monkey Ball and I were inseparable back in the GameCube days, but we grew apart when the series traded in its perfect blend of devilish challenges and finely-tuned physics for bland level design and imprecise motion controls aimed at a more casual audience – so you can imagine my apathy when Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble’s initial announcement focused so heavily on the uncontrolled chaos of its 16-player online battles. But I’ve never been happier to be wrong, as tucked away inside Banana Rumble is the greatest set of traditional Super Monkey Ball levels the series has seen since the GameCube originals, backed up by tight mechanics that give me the complete control I needed to overcome its demanding late-game obstacles. Monkey Ball is finally back, and now all I want to do is roll.</p><p>Banana Rumble’s impressive set of 200 courses is divided into 20 cartoony worlds containing 10 stages apiece. In classic Monkey Ball fashion, the setup is delightfully simple: You have 60 seconds to roll your monkey from the start to the goal, but the hurdles between those points change radically across the adventure. The opening stages aren’t too challenging, smartly acquainting you with Banana Rumble’s mechanics so you’re ready to go when it does turn up the heat. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As a certified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2002/08/24/super-monkey-ball-2-gamecube-review">Super Monkey Ball 2</a> master, I had no trouble with the first 80 levels or so. But they’re still a joy to roll through, as I had to deal with curves, ramps, rails, switches, and bumps reminiscent of the level design seen in the excellent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/11/16/super-monkey-ball-3">Super Monkey Ball 1</a> and 2. Plus, speedrunning is a classic element of the originals, and it was a ton of fun to see how rapidly I could blast through levels that don’t demand too much precision, like stages where you can slam dunk into the goal with a perfect launch right from the start if you know what you’re doing. I realized pretty quickly that Banana Rumble was a return to form for the series, and I had the best time rolling through the early levels while bopping to the wonderful GameCube-inspired soundtrack.</p><p>That breezy feeling didn’t last long, though, as Banana Rumble does not hold back in its second half. The 10 EX worlds unlocked after completing the main story delivered on all the Monkey Ball challenge I’ve been begging for the series to bring back. Suddenly, I was dealing with grueling stages that truly tested my monkey mettle, from crazy rotating contraptions to invisible tilting seesaws to the narrowest of walkways you have to carefully tiptoe across, Banana Rumble is constantly introducing new challenges and smart twists on old ones. Some of the final levels took me dozens of attempts, and there’s nothing quite like the feeling when my main monkey AiAi finally breaks through that one elusive goal. In fact, I’ve been so engrossed in completing every stage Banana Rumble has to offer that one night I couldn’t even be bothered to get up to turn the lights on after it got dark outside, so I was sitting in complete darkness rolling my monkey around until well past midnight. Totally worth it.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Logan Ranks Every Super Monkey Ball</h3><p>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Rumble is the first brand new Monkey Ball game in over a decade, and the series' first chance to be truly good since over two decades ago. </p></div><h2><strong>Chaos, Controlled</strong></h2><p>That fantastic stage design and variety means nothing unless it <em>feels </em>right, and Super Monkey Ball nails it for the first time in decades. While it may look like you are directly moving your orb through each course, Super Monkey Ball is actually about controlling the stage, not the monkey. At its best, the control stick is aligned 1:1 with the angle of the stage, giving you pinpoint-precise command over how the terrain tilts – and in turn, how your monkey rolls through it. </p><p>2021’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-review">Banana Mania</a> (which remade all the levels found in Super Monkey Ball 1, 2, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/03/09/super-monkey-ball-deluxe">Deluxe</a>) should have been a home run as it returned to the best stages in series history, but the controls were so sluggish and imprecise that it made them overly frustrating at best and borderline unplayable at worst. Exact controls are a necessity for the toughest levels, and Banana Rumble handles so well that whenever I fell off the stage it almost always felt like my fault, which inspired me to improve on the next run. Banana Rumble even offers extensive control options for both the stage and the camera, so I cranked every possible setting to the max and found that gave me the expert level of control I was seeking. The physics aren’t entirely perfect – sometimes I didn’t get the level of bounce I expected when dropping from a high ledge – but this is still easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily the best-feeling Super Monkey Ball since the first two.</p></div><p>Banana Rumble has also finally ditched the series poorly-implemented jumping mechanic (if I’m tilting the stage and my monkey is trapped in a ball, why would they be able to jump?) in favor of an exciting new spin dash, which takes a page from Sonic the Hedgehog and lets you charge up and release a quick burst of speed. Whereas the jump never amounted to more than a gimmick in past games, the spin dash is a genius evolution of Monkey Ball’s core mechanics. It’s only mandatory in a handful of levels, but almost every single stage has some sort of shortcut or exploit that’s only possible to pull off thanks to this new ability. </p><p>A properly-aimed spin dash can catapult your poor monkey across the map in the blink of an eye, and it’s a speedrunner’s dream to uncover all the ways to take advantage of this smart addition. Banana Rumble rewards players who understand the mechanics and level design with optional routes hiding in plain sight that require expert skill to reach, and it adds a lot of replay value to an already packed adventure.</p><h2><strong>Banana Split-Screen</strong></h2><p>Multiplayer has been welcomed back to the main game, which was shockingly missing from the last two entries. You can tackle all 200 stages with up to three other players in split-screen local multiplayer or online co-op. Playing with others online is pretty seamless – I played through the entire campaign online with a friend and we never had a disconnect. Banana Rumble also runs at a very smooth 60 FPS when playing alone on Nintendo Switch, and it maintains that level of performance when you add online play into the mix. The frame rate takes a slight hit in split-screen, but not to the point where it feels unplayable.</p><p>Playing with others turns Banana Rumble into a surprisingly strategic cooperative experience. Everyone begins the stage at the same time, and only one player has to complete it in order for the group to move on. This also makes each level’s optional missions easier to complete: Every stage tasks you with collecting a certain number of bananas, completing it in under a certain number of seconds, and finding the hidden golden banana which often requires a high-level technique to snag. Assigning one person to get to the goal as fast as possible while the rest seek out bananas adds a fun layer of planning to the whole experience. I even had fun tackling levels online with random players, as I helped some Monkey Ball rookies clear some easier worlds and worked with others to grab some tricky golden bananas in later stages, using encouraging emotes and phrases to cheer my teammates on. I only wish Banana Rumble also included a more traditional Challenge Mode where you take turns and work through all of the levels individually at your own pace.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One issue with online multiplayer is that it kicks all of you out of a party after you complete a world, so I would have to share a new lobby code with my friend every single time we wanted to keep playing. Additionally, when working through the adventure mode online, Banana Rumble doesn’t show you the story cutscenes, meaning if you want to know what’s going on with AiAi, MeeMee, Baby, GonGon, and their new friend Palette, you’ll have to either play locally or catch up on all the cutscenes in the gallery after the fact. I don’t play Monkey Ball for the story – and the story here is extremely basic and barebones anyways – so I actually preferred not seeing the cutscenes so we could get straight to the stages, but it does feel like a strange omission.</p><p>Banana Rumble’s biggest monkey’s paw wish is its aforementioned battle mode. Longtime Super Monkey Ball fans know how iconic legacy party games like Monkey Target and Monkey Bowling are, but there’s nothing here that held my attention for more than a couple minutes. The five modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired, with so few maps in rotation that I felt like I’d seen everything they had to offer after less than an hour. There’s generic racing, banana gathering, and bomb passing that feel like cheap knockoffs of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>’s battle mode. I’m guessing others feel the same way, as it took me several minutes to find a match with a full 16 players just a few days after launch. The performance also takes a serious hit in battle mode, reducing the smooth 60 FPS of the adventure mode to a choppy slideshow at times. Local multiplayer comes with its own set of limitations, as you can’t play battle mode online with two people on the same system, and three-to-four player battles aren’t even an option locally. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The five battle modes all feel extremely shallow and uninspired.</p></div><p>But even if you completely ignore Banana Rumble’s undercooked battle mode, there’s still so much to do here. I’ve already completed all 200 stages, but I’m nowhere close to finishing all of the stage missions – some of which I’m still scratching my head at as I try to figure out how I’m supposed to grab dozens of bananas and make it to the goal in time. There are hundreds of cosmetic items to buy with in-game points to style your monkey, too. I’m a simple man, so I bought AiAi’s classic orange T-shirt from the original games and called it good, but it’s cool how many outfits and accessories are available for Banana Rumble’s 12 playable characters (or more, if you get the optional SEGA Pass that adds Sonic the Hedgehog and friends to the mix).
</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble is a brilliant return to form. Monkey Ball has finally found its way home again with a set of 200 fantastic courses that range from delightfully charming to devilishly challenging, backed up by tight mechanics and predictable physics that put me in total control of my monkey’s fate. This isn’t just a cover album of Monkey Ball’s greatest hits, though, as the new spin dash ability is a genius evolution of the franchise’s core ideas, and smartly-implemented online play adds fresh layers of cooperation and strategy. The underwhelming and forgettable battle mode is Banana Rumble’s biggest disappointment, but the sheer amount of optional objectives and replayability found in its adventure mode make it easy to ignore. It doesn’t quite reach the heights of the amazing GameCube originals, but Banana Rumble is easily the best Super Monkey Ball game in over 20 years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Book of Adria is a bestiary detailing the many demons, beasts, and undead creatures players face in the games. Book of Lorath looks at the numerous magical relics that Sanctuary’s heroes and villains seek to control.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the reams of lore, each volume includes illustrations and concept art from the games and in-universe correspondences between various characters to add texture to the Diablo series’ grim setting.</p><p dir="ltr">The books are available to purchase individually, though you'll wind up spending more money (roughly $70 right now)--and you won't get the slipcase.

            <p>
ack in March, Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join Xbox Game Pass post-Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher, and it looks like the floodgates are finally starting to open; Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is reportedly set to hit the subscription service this August, with more Activision games coming "very soon".
</p>
<p>
That's according to reliable leaker eXtas1s who, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/">writing on eXputer</a>, claims to have spoken to sources and seen "certain graphic evidence" pointing to Game Pass releases for a number of Activision titles in the not-too-distant future. eXtas1s' most specific claim is that of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy's August arrival - since <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august">corroborated by Windows Central</a> - but there's reportedly more on the way.
</p>
<p>
eXtas1s says Activision's Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and Spyro Reignited Trilogy are also heading to Game Pass - and while they "cannot guarantee" the titles will arrive alongside Crash Bandicoot, they're both reportedly joining the subscription service "very soon".

<p>
To date, Microsoft has only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">confirmed one Activision Blizzard title for Game Pass</a> beyond Diablo 4 - this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which is set to be a release day addition to the catalogue on 25th October, just over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision was made official</a>. Last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer warned fans the publisher's titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-blames-lengthy-buyout-process-for-delay-in-adding-activision-blizzard-titles-to-game-pass">wouldn't start showing up on Game Pass until 2024</a>, blaming the holdup on "a lot of uncertainty" around the buyout process.
</p>
<p>
But with the wheels seemingly now in motion, it hopefully won't be long before Microsoft and Activision finally give the masses exactly what they've been clamouring for: every Zork title on Game Pass for PC. Until then, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-lineup-for-july-2024-announced">July's Xbox Game Pass additions</a>, including the likes of Journey to the Savage Planet, Tchia, Neon White, and The Case of the Golden Idol.

The dock can also back up save game data or easily extract photos captured by the Game Boy Camera.</p><p>Epilogue, the company behind it, shared a short video of the new feature on X and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/the-gb-operator-turns-your-game-boy-camera-into-the-worst-and-best-webcam-youll-ever-have">told <em>Time Extension</em></a>, “We now have a live feed from the Game Boy Camera, but still need to fine-tune some things and allow for configuration options.”</p><p>It also described the new feature as “the worst and the best webcam you’ll ever have.”</p><p>A previous attempt at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgSWPvqUGIto">turning the Game Boy Camera into a webcam</a> required a stack of hardware, including a Super Nintendo, a Super Game Boy cartridge, a device to convert a composite video signal to HDMI, and a video capture card for a PC. Epilogue’s solution looks much simpler and nearly painless — except for those forced to see their co-workers livestreamed through a relic of digital photography.</p><p>In addition to the Game Boy-focused GB Operator, Epilogue recently shared the first images of its upcoming SN Operator, which offers the same functionality and PC connectivity but for Super Nintendo cartridges. There are currently no details on when the SN Operator will be released, and “coming soon” is the only timeline shared for the GB Operator upgrades.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2024-gama-horizons-fellowship-offers-grants-to-diverse-creators-and-businesses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturer's Association (GAMA) has opened applications for its annual diversity drive. Officially called the GAMA Horizons Fellowship, the program will provide grants and support to tabletop publishers and retailers from marginalized groups.</p>
<h2>The 2024 GAMA Horizons Fellowship program</h2>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/07/02/gamas-annual-diversity-drive-opens-offering-1000-grants-convention-support-to-fledgling-board-game-publishers-retailers/">Board Game Wire</a>, the GAMA Horizons Fellowship is an eight-month accelerator program. It will offer $1,000 grants and support to creators and retailers from historically sidelined demographics, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ability.</p>

<p>The program is open to new or prospective US and Canada-based board game publishers. The companies must be at least 51% owned or operated by people from the above-mentioned demographics.</p>
<p>Successful GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants will get more than just money. Those select few will receive mentoring and peer coaching, a one-year complementary GAMA membership, free admission, and booth opps at GAMA Expo and Origins 2025 with travel and lodging included, and access to virtual classes from industry veterans.</p>
<p>For those wishing to get their foot in the door of the tabletop industry, GAMA is one of the biggest organizations in the business. In addition to hosting two major board game conventions, they assist publishers and retailers in all assets of development and marketing. This organization can make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="noopener" target="_blank">or break</a> one's career in the tabletop space.</p>
<p>The report ends with testimonials of earlier GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants. Golden Lasso Games' Kimi Hughes stated it "opened up a whole new world of knowledge and connections."</p>
<p>PlayForge's Jesse Stommel provided a similar anecdote. He mentions the difficulty of management during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as his struggles being queer and disabled and how the program let him find invaluable people that were in his corner.</p>

It’s great way to catch up on bargain bin stuff you might have never gotten to (<em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>, <em>GTA V</em>) as well as more recent stuff that hasn’t dropped in value yet. For example, you could play some of 2024's biggest games so far like <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, and <em>Tekken 8</em> and save roughly $50 in the process.

Now that the deal is finalized, Xbox owns a ton of franchises and games, including <em>Call of Duty, Warcraft, </em>and <em>Candy Crush. </em>But so far, eight months after the deal was completed, only one Activision game—<em>Diablo IV</em>—has made its way onto Game Pass. However, it appears more are finally on the way. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a report by <em>Windows Central</em></a></span> on July 3, <em>Crash Bandicoot N.

Fishing is a big part of Stardew Valley and a great way to make money early on in the game, but there are a few mechanics you won't be able to use right away. One of those mechanics is bait, which can be used to cause fish to bite faster.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to use bait</h2><p>The reason you can't use bait right away is that the Bamboo Pole Willy gives you doesn't have the ability to use bait. Instead, you will need to upgrade to the next tier of fishing pole, the <strong>Fiberglass Rod</strong>, which has a slot for bait. The Fiberglass Rod costs 1,800G and is unavailable until you reach Fishing Level 2, which will require you to do some fishing. Every fishing rod you unlock after this point will have a bait slot. Bait is also used in Crab Pots, which will only catch something if it has a piece of bait in it, and which you have to refill. Holding bait and interacting with the Crab Pot will place it inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328667" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328667"></a><figcaption>Once you get a fishing pole that has a bait slot, you can equip bait directly from your inventory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The fishing rod itself can have the bait added directly to your inventory by moving it to the fishing rod. Fishing rods can hold a large amount of bait, so you don't have to reload in between fish.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get bait</h2><p dir="ltr">Fishing bait can be obtained in multiple ways. There is the default bait, along with some specialized versions, which can be crafted using bug meat and other items after leveling up your Fishing skill. Bug Meat is acquired by defeating bug enemies in the mines. You can also craft a Worm Bin, which unlocks at Fishing Level 4, which will periodically produce bait. It can occasionally be found in treasure chests found while fishing and Willy sells it in his shop.</p>

                <p>Oftentimes, the most challenging part of playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> is when you spawn into a world for the first time. That's because you come into the world with nothing, and things can quickly become overwhelming if you don't already have a plan in mind. Heck, you won't even have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-map-in-minecraft/1100-6524696/" data-ref-id="1100-6524696">map</a> yet. One of the first things you'll want to do is build a house as soon as possible. Thankfully, your first house doesn't need to be anything fancy. It just needs the bare minimum to live. This guide will break down everything you'll need to know about building the best starter house in Minecraft.</p><h2>Break Trees</h2><p dir="ltr">Minecraft will start you off near trees when you spawn for the first time. You'll want to use this to your advantage. The first thing you'll want to do is begin breaking down many trees by punching them and collecting the wood that's left behind. Once you've collected enough wood, you'll want to convert it into <strong>Wood Planks</strong>. Don't worry because you can do this without a <strong>Crafting Table</strong>.</p><h2>Build a small house</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that you've collected enough wood, you'll want to build a small house where you can stay. The size of it doesn't matter, but <strong>we recommend starting with a 5x4 size</strong>. Don't worry about making specific rooms. Make sure you have enough room to store all the essentials. While making your house, it's important to mention that you should <strong>hold off on the roof until you've placed a few torches</strong> around to ensure hostile mobs don't spawn inside.</p><h2>Make a Crafting Table</h2><p dir="ltr">The second you build the foundation for your tiny house, find a nice little corner and make a Crafting Table. To do this, <strong>open up the inventory menu and place four Wood Planks in the four slots, and you'll be able to make the table</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328762-minecraftstarterhouse.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328762" data-ratio="0.62133333333333" data-width="375" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328762-minecraftstarterhouse.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328762"></a><figcaption>Here's how you make a crafting table.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328762-minecraftstarterhouse.png"></figure><h2>Craft a bed</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you've built your house, you'll want to venture off and look for some sheep to craft a bed. You'll need to kill the sheep and collect their Wool. Once you have <strong>three of the same color Wool, open up the inventory menu and place all three in the crafting section alongside three Wood Planks to craft a bed</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328763-minecraftstarterhouse3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328763" data-ratio="0.42020497803807" data-width="683" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328763-minecraftstarterhouse3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328763"></a><figcaption>Nothing beats a good night's rest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328763-minecraftstarterhouse3.png"></figure><p>All that's left for you to do now is place the bed inside your home and <strong>lay down on it to set your respawn location</strong>. This means you'll reappear here whenever you die, so long as it's your most recent respawn location.<strong><br></strong></p><h2>Get to crafting</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that you have a bed, you'll need to craft some other essential items. Here's what to focus on next:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Double Chest (Place two regular chests side by side)</li><li dir="ltr">Sticks</li><li dir="ltr">Wood Door</li><li dir="ltr">Wood Weapons/Tools</li></ul><p dir="ltr">All the items mentioned above don't require anything other than wood. So don't worry about needing other supplies just yet. Trees will continue to be your go-to for these projects.</p><h2>Collect cobblestone and build a furnace</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you've crafted one of every wooden tool, you'll first want to use the <strong>Wood Pickaxe to mine cobblestone</strong>. Cobblestone can be easily found anywhere. If you're having a hard time finding some, all you need to do is dig down, and after destroying a few dirt blocks, you'll run into it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You'll only need to collect a total of eight cobblestones</strong>, but it doesn't hurt to have a few extras. Now that you have the cobblestones, place them on the crafting table, and put <strong>eight of the blocks in the crafting menu to make a furnace</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328764-minecraftstarterhouse4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328764" data-ratio="0.4029197080292" data-width="685" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328764-minecraftstarterhouse4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328764"></a><figcaption>Here's how a furnace is made</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328764-minecraftstarterhouse4.png"></figure><h2>Craft torches and place them around</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two different ways to craft torches, but to keep things simple, you'll want to <strong>use any Wood Logs</strong>. Go to the furnace you placed in your house, and place the wood in both the top and bottom slots. <strong>This will start the process of creating Charcoal</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328766-minecraftstarterhouse5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328766" data-ratio="0.43888070692194" data-width="679" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328766-minecraftstarterhouse5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328766"></a><figcaption>Here's how to make Charcoal.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328766-minecraftstarterhouse5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you feel like you've created enough, grab some sticks and <strong>place both sticks and charcoal in an empty crafting slot to make Torches</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328767-minecraftstarterhouse6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328767" data-ratio="0.42120765832106" data-width="679" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328767-minecraftstarterhouse6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328767"></a><figcaption>Here's how to make Torches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328767-minecraftstarterhouse6.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Build a roof</h2><p dir="ltr">The last part is pretty simple. Now that you have everything you need in your starter house complete the roof and place a few torches on top to ensure hostile mobs don't spawn at night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328768-minecraftstarterhouse7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328768" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328768-minecraftstarterhouse7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328768"></a><figcaption>It ain't much, but it'll get the job done. (Animal mobs not included)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328768-minecraftstarterhouse7.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now that you've done that, your starter house is complete!

                <p>Maps are crucial if you have long-term plans to play in any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>world. As the name suggests, maps allow you to chart specific areas in the world so that you always know how to get to certain locations. Luckily, making them is fairly straightforward, but they won't operate as intended if you make them wrong. Don't worry; this guide details everything you need about crafting and using a map.</p><h2>How to craft a map</h2><p dir="ltr">To craft a map, you need the following items first: <strong>one compass and eight papers</strong>. As soon as you get your hands on those items, go to a Crafting Table, and you should see an option that'll allow you to make one. But if it doesn't appear, you'll want to place all the items, as shown in the picture below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328748-howtomakeamapinminecraft.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328748" data-ratio="0.41399416909621" data-width="686" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328748-howtomakeamapinminecraft.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328748"></a><figcaption>Here's how you make a map in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328748-howtomakeamapinminecraft.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning there's another way of crafting a map. To do this, all you'll need is <strong>nine papers</strong>. Once you have all nine, place them on a craft table and make the map as usual. What's unique about this map is that it won't have a player tracker. This type of map is known as an <strong>Empty Map</strong>. Instead, it'll just be a map of the general area, as shown in the picture below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328751-howtomakeamapinminecraft2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328751" data-ratio="0.40882352941176" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328751-howtomakeamapinminecraft2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328751"></a><figcaption>Here is how you make an Empty Map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328751-howtomakeamapinminecraft2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you accidentally make a map like this, don't worry; it can easily be fixed. You only need to craft a compass and go to a crafting table with both items. Now that you're there, all you need to do is place both items in the crafting menu with a player tracker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328756-image%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328756" data-ratio="0.41167883211679" data-width="685" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328756-image%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328756"></a><figcaption>Easy fix.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328756-image%281%29.png"></figure><h2>How to upgrade a map</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the first things you'll notice as soon as you make a map is how small it is. Don't worry, though, because <strong>it can be increased in size up to four times</strong> with the right supplies. To do this, you'll need to use a <strong>Cartography Table.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Now that you're there, you'll need to place the map you have in the top left slot and a piece of paper in the bottom left slot. Once you do that, you'll pick the new map appearing in the middle right slot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328759-howtomakeamapinminecraft5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328759" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328759-howtomakeamapinminecraft5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328759"></a><figcaption>Here's how you upgrade your map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328759-howtomakeamapinminecraft5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The moment you grab it, the map will be increased, and more ground will be covered. To upgrade to level four, all you need to do is repeat the cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also name your map from the Cartography Table, <strong>but note that doing so will not give you any gameplay advantage</strong>.</p><h2>How to copy a map</h2><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that you can copy any map. To do this, you'll need to use a <strong>Cartography Table </strong>again.</p><p dir="ltr">When you get there, place your map on the top left slot and place an Empty Map on the bottom left. After you do that, you'll see a map icon appear on the middle right slot with the number two next to it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328760-howtomakeamapinminecraft6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328760" data-ratio="0.74852941176471" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328760-howtomakeamapinminecraft6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328760"></a><figcaption>Here is how you copy a map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328760-howtomakeamapinminecraft6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can grab both maps and give one to a friend or store the other for safekeeping.

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows arrives on November 15, offering up a sprawling world to explore and two playable characters for you to master. If you're a longtime Assassin's Creed fan, consider pairing your preorder with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506746047?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed Shadows art book</a>, which arrives just a few days after the video game on November 19. The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows contains over 250 pages of art and commentary and should serve as a cool companion for the game. It's pretty rare for a video game art book to release alongside the game. The hardcover book is available in two formats--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506746047?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506745148?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deluxe</a>--and both are now up for preorder ahead of their launch this holiday season.</p><h2>The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2><h3>$50</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328501-shadowscover.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328501" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328501-shadowscover.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328501"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328501-shadowscover.png"></figure><p>This hardcover art book is 256 pages long and is published by Dark Horse Books. The company has a history of producing high-quality collectibles, and The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows should be no different. The team at Ubisoft worked with Dark Horse Books to pull together "an art book in the tradition of the world-spanning Brotherhood, aiming to satisfy and inspire shinobi assassin and samurai of all generations." In other words, this aims to be a comprehensive book that touches on all major aspects of the game. If you preorder now, you'll get the lowest price offered between the time you order and release--you won't be charged until Amazon ships your book.</p><hr><h2>The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows (Deluxe Edition)</h2><h3>$95 ($<del>100</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328502-61llnatc3fl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328502" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328502-61llnatc3fl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328502"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328502-61llnatc3fl._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The deluxe edition is seeing a slight discount ahead of launch, and it’s a nice upgrade from the standard edition. This version also clocks in at 256 pages, though it's loaded with exclusive packaging and additional accessories, such as a decorative slipcase and a portfolio with a gallery-quality print. Just like with the standard edition, you'll pay the lowest price Amazon offers until launch when your order ships.</p><hr><p>If you haven't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">preordered Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, you'll find tons of retailer-exclusive offers in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows preorder guide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekkens-katsuhiro-harada-says-the-developers-actually-love-anna-despite-what-fans-think<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Harada put some respect on Anna's name. </h2></div><section><p>Tekken 8 director Katsuhiro Harada's official X/Twitter account has quickly become the fighting game community town square thanks in part to his extra long behind-the-scenes trivia posts and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">occasional Waffle House asides</a>. Harada's latest bit of Tekken lore dump put to bed a long-running fandom perception that Tekken devs have always hated Anna Williams. </p><p>In an impromptu Q&amp;A X/Twitter post, Harada responded to a fan's question about the relationship dynamic between Nina and Anna. In his <a href="https://x.com/harada_tekken/status/1808400818837901531?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1,317-word response</u></a> — which was written during his lunch break — Harada also addressed the community rumor about Tekken devs hating Anna by stating the exact opposite. </p><p>"By the way, there is a small group of people who believe that Anna is not loved by the development team and they even say that Anna is hated [by the] dev team," Harada wrote. "Well, it doesn't matter, Because it's NOT true at all, but the Anna portrayed in the story of TEKKEN is filled with a lot of thoughts and feelings from me and the animation staff."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/anna-1720032586737.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna Williams In Tekken 7.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For those unversed in the melodramatic soap opera that is fighting game story modes, Tekken's long-running narrative can be boiled down as a family drama playing out in a series of high-stakes martial arts tournaments. While the epicenter of the series' familial beef involves the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-character-reveal-is-reina-perhaps-the-spiritual-successor-to-heihachi"><u>Mishima family's ever-increasing family tree</u></a>, Anna and Nina Williams serve as Tekken's tertiary rivalry. Some FGC players have felt Tekken developers heavily favor Nina as the series' golden child in that rivalry and view Anna as its black sheep. </p><p>Much of the Tekken fandom's perception of Anna being disliked by its developers was instilled by the number of times Nina would trounce Anna in a myriad of cutscenes and win quotes throughout the series. This perception also wasn't helped by the fact that Nina Williams is more often than not guaranteed as a launch character in Tekken game rosters, including Tekken 8. In contrast, Anna was allocated as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/tekken-7-season-pass-2-launch-trailer">DLC character in Tekken 7</a> and has yet to be announced in Tekken 8. </p><p>In the post, Harada revealed that he mainly worked on the development of Anna in Tekken 3 and that he personally created the names of her moves.</p><p>"Originally, Nina was very popular with players since the beginning of Tekken. There is a yin and yang to things, and Anna's popularity was often contrasted with Nina's," Harada said. "Back in Tekken 1 and 2, many mid-boss characters were 'convertible character' to other characters, but we wanted to make Anna from Tekken 3 as unique as possible to gain popularity."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/anna-nina-1720032652759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna And Nina Clashing In Tekken 7.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Harada also acknowledged the gap in the sister's popularity throughout the years and took the position that even when Nina outshines Anna like a one-sided episode of Tom and Jerry, the team made sure <a href="https://youtu.be/Lry3FzA8uBw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna's charms shone through for players</a>. </p><p>"For this reason, Anna's settings in the game reflect the feelings of the people in charge of Anna on our development team. For example, Anna's settings include the following: "Anna is tired of losing not only the battle with Nina, but also the popularity ranking in the Iron Fist Tournament. I believe that was the very sentiment of those of us in charge of Anna (myself, the animation team, and the modeling team)," Harada added. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/vs-youtube-tekken7-seasonpass2revealfeaturingneganfromamcsthewalkingdeadps4x1pc-143-2-1720033071911.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna Blowing Nina Up With A Rocket Launcher.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Harada concluded his huge Anna and Nina Williams lore dump with a list of triva about their relationship that basically doubled down agaisnt the miconception that Anna is completely washed in comparison to her sister. Here are some of the notable bits of pro-Anna trivia:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Anna is a better cook than Nina</li><li>Anna is better at darts</li><li>Anna is better with heavy weaponry like an anti-tank rocket launcher</li><li>Nina only assassinated Anna's fiance in Tekken 7 (and stole her wedding dress) because her would-be hubby had a "very dark side" that Anna wasn't aware of. Nina is also awaiting a thank you from Nina for the trouble. </li></ul><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Tekken 8, we gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Tekken 8 is an incredible evolution for the series, with tons of single player content, an excellent suite of training tools, a great online experience, and exciting new mechanics that make Tekken more dynamic than ever."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

Today, the FTC is reminding ASRock, Gigabyte, and Zotac that they’re illegal.</p><p>In fact, the FTC sent letters <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/asrock-warning-letter.pdf">to ASRock</a>, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/gigabyte-warning-letter.pdf">Gigabyte</a>, and <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/zotac-warning-letter.pdf">Zotac</a> that suggest the FTC’s concerns aren’t just <strike>skin</strike> sticker-deep. Each letter tells the manufacturer to change its warranty and review its customer support practices to make sure they aren’t illegally threatening your warranty.</p><p>“Staff would be concerned if GIGABYTE, in practice, denied warranty coverage based on the warranty provisions quoted above or any similar provision,” reads part of one of the letters.</p><p>As of today, each of these companies’ warranties does include such a threat. The very first line in <a href="https://www.asrock.com/support/index.us.asp?cat=Policy">ASRock’s warranty</a> reads, “Manufacturer’s warranty will be null and void if products are modified, damaged or otherwise tampered with, for example, the outer case is opened or additional optional parts/components are installed/removed.” </p><p><a href="https://member.aorus.com/global/productwarranty">Gigabyte includes</a>: “If the manufacturing sticker inside the product was removed or damaged, it would no longer be covered by the warranty.”</p><p>The particular right-to-repair law the FTC is invoking here isn’t one of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23738770/right-to-repair-updates-laws">the state-by-state ones</a> that are now taking effect — it’s the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act that attempts to keep companies from making bad warranties and misrepresenting them in the first place. </p><p>“The Warranty Act prohibits warrantors of consumer products costing more than five dollars from conditioning their written warranties on a consumer’s use of any article or service, such as repair service, which is identified by brand, trade, or corporate name, unless (1) the warranty states the article or service will be provided to the consumer for free, or (2) the warrantor has been granted a waiver by the Commission,” the FTC writes.</p><p>“FTC investigators have copied and preserved the online pages in question, and we plan to review your company’s written warranty and promotional materials after 30 days,” the agency is telling each firm.</p><div><p>In 2018, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/13/17349568/hyundai-nintendo-sony-updated-warranties-ftc-warnings">the FTC put Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft on notice</a> for doing the same thing with their game consoles, as well as Asus, HTC, and Hyundai. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/13/17349568/hyundai-nintendo-sony-updated-warranties-ftc-warnings">Nintendo, Sony, and Hyundai updated their policies</a> less than two months later.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/74736/warranty-void-stickers-are-illegal-in-the-us-what-about-elsewhere#:~:text=Warranty%20Void%20Stickers%20Are%20Illegal,What%20about%20Elsewhere%3F&amp;text=If%20you've%20ever%20opened,those%20stickers%20aren't%20enforceable.">iFixit has a blog</a> on how “warranty void if removed” stickers may be legal in other parts of the world.</p><div><p>Asus has also recently been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus">rethinking its customer support and warranty after a Gamers Nexus investigation</a>, but that one didn’t have to do with voided warranties.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, DICE has <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1808516412819861814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a limited-time Battlefield 2042 crossover event with another franchise under EA's portfolio: Dead Space. The mode is called Outbreak and will run for a week (Tuesday, July 9-16). Here's the official brief provided in the press release:</p>
<p><em>In Outbreak, the human resilience and resourcefulness of the squad will be tested against a new and relentless enemy as they attempt to escape the Boreas lab.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can unlock free rewards for participating in this unique collaboration, including a new weapon charm and skin, as well as a new player card background and tag. This collaboration also includes a Dead Space bundle that includes a legendary "Marked Man" Specialist Outfit, 3 legendary weapon skins, and more. The bundle can be purchased for 2200 BFC.</em></p>

<p>Battlefield 2042 famously disappointed when it launched in November 2021, becoming the lowest-rated installment in the popular shooter franchise. However, DICE stuck with it for a couple of years, improving it in various ways, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returning to the traditional class system</a> beloved by fans. Still, support for Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-support-ending-motive-joining-dev-team-iron-man-still-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now winding down</a> as work on the next installment in the IP intensifies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios has joined DICE, Ripple Effect, and Criterion, who are all working on the new Battlefield game. The Dead Space remake launched in early 2023 to very positive reviews; it got 8 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in ours</a>:</p>
<p><em>The new Dead Space is a mostly-successful revival of a survival horror landmark, offering atmospheric new visuals and a series of precision updates to combat, level layouts, and the game’s scary bits that ought to surprise and excite veteran engineers.</em></p>
<p>However, fans who were hoping to get the remake treatment for the entire trilogy received some bad news in April when Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Electronic Arts never internally greenlit the Dead Space 2 remake. As such, the franchise is once again on hold, and part of Motive is working on Battlefield (another team <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-motive-ue5-early-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is making the Iron Man game</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/watch-dogs-movie/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Watch Dogs movie has officially begun filming, but there’s currently no release date yet.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the Ubisoft X (formerly Twitter) page, where the <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publisher said</a>, “Lights_Camera_Action.exe.” alongside posting an image of a clapperboard from the set.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not much can be gathered from the image itself, as it appears to be the production team rather than any cast members. However, we know that Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde are set to star in the movie in some capacity. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s head of content Margaret Boykin, New Regency CEO Yariv Milchan, and company president of motion pictures Natalie Lehmann are producers of the movie.</p>



<p>The move to start production will undoubtedly start discussions on whether or not a new Watch Dogs game is in the works. Unfortunately, despite the series’ success, we’ve not been able to verify if a new game has been greenlit. The first and second games accumulated 20 million units sold combined.</p>



<p>The last game in the series was Watch Dogs: Legion, which was released in 2020 by Ubisoft Toronto. The game received mixed reviews from critics.</p>



<p>Are you excited about a Watch Dogs movie? And would you like to see another Watch Dogs game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
