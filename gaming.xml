            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced new Unearthed Arcana for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. Specifically, they have revealed official Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer playtest material, meaning the class may be returning to the game in a future supplement.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/the-artificer" rel="nofollow">official post</a> on D&amp;D Beyond, Wizards of the Coast has released the Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Artificer Unearthed Arcana for all users. The post includes a half-hour YouTube interview with Todd Kenrick and D&amp;D's lead designer, Jeremy Crawford.</p>

<p>The playtest material is notable since the Artificer class was absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Player Handbook</a>. This updated version of the fantasy TTRPG rules was marketed as an update and consolidation of core player options, so the community saw its omission as a slight.</p>

<p>The class's core appeal is still intact: creating gadgets and gizmos that run on magic. The big change is that magical infusions, the ability to imbue mundane items with magic abilities, have been replaced with the ability to make magic items.</p>

<p>There's still a limitation on how many can be made based on Artificer level. But being able to just make Bags of Holding or Sending Stones is a notable upgrade. Furthermore, artificers can destroy these magic items to regain spell slots in a pinch. The benefits of the 2014's Artificer infusions are now separate magic items which can be made with the 2024 Artificer's class features.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer's late-game features are also tweaked. Flash of Genius can be used in response to a dice roll failing and can be used multiple times equal to their Intelligence modifier. And Soul of Artifice doesn't require a Reaction anymore, just destroy a magic item when you drop to 0 HP and you're back in the fight with 20 HP.</p>

The Alchemist's Chemical Mastery feature has been redesigned, allowing them to cast the 2024 spell Tasha's Bubbling Cauldron.</p>

<p>The Armorer's Perfect Armor has gotten a damage boost. The Artillerist's Eldritch Cannons have gotten more tactical options and explosive punch. Lastly, the Battle Smith's Steel Defender has gotten some adjustments to its health and damage output.</p>

<p>The release of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> Artificer Unearthed Arcana may hint at the class returning in a future supplement. It is hard to tell since certain UA material like the Mystic class has been lost to the ages. But given the Artificer's popularity, this may hint at good things on the horizon.</p>

<p>The feedback survey for this Unearthed Arcana goes live December 24, 2024.</p>

And some of these players are tired of being tossed into matches where their entire team is duelists, forcing them to play healer or tank to help balance the lineup. </p><p>One solution to this problem is a role queue. Found in games like <em>Overwatch 2</em>, a role queue lets players pick a role, like tank, and then find a match that needs that specific role. In <em>Overwatch 2</em>'s case, this means every match has a tank, two attackers, and two healers. This should lead to more balanced teams, but the devs behind <em>Rivals </em>don’t seem interested in adding this system to the shooter.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/marvel/news/marvel-rivals-dev-offers-update-on-when-to-expect-role-queue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to <em>Dot Esports</em></a></span><em>,</em> Chen said that the studio is “not considering a role queue” at the moment. </p><p>“The team’s goal is to offer a wider variety of team composition through team-up skills and their own designs, to let people play their Marvel superheroes rather than limiting players to choosing a role.” </p><p>Chen further explained that data from matches shows that <em>Rivals </em>currently doesn’t need a role queue system. </p><p>“We want people to have a Marvel experience where they’re free to select what they want. [Since the beta test earlier this year], things have been rational and within expectations. In our Competitive play recently, there is a lot of different compositions emerging from players and we’d like to continue to monitor these fun compositions and how they impact our game.” </p><p>While some might be upset that Chen and developer NetEase aren’t rushing to balance the game or add a role queue system, I’m happy to see an online multiplayer game studio step back and let things be chaotic and messy for a bit before jumping in to sand things down and make everything more fair and balanced. </p><p>One of the reasons I enjoy <em>Rivals </em>is because everyone feels powerful and matches rarely play out the same way as nearly every character seems viable with the right comp or strategy. And while a role queue might be nice in ranked mode, I hope if it is ever added, it doesn’t signal a shift to balancing all the fun out of <em>Marvel Rivals. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now we get an encore during the holidays as well. This year’s Day of the Devs: Game Awards 2024 Edition didn’t disappoint either. Every time I think the heavily curated, very personal, extremely intimate showcase <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297">can’t possibly top the last one</a></span>, somehow it still does.</p><p>As the video game industry ping-pongs from one big-budget sequel and live-service disaster to the next, with seemingly ever less room for creativity, experimentation, and risk-taking, Day of the Devs reminds us that wild, wonderful things are being made all around us as long as you know where to look. And the organization, which started as a collaboration between DoubleFine and iam8bit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dayofthedevs.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dayofthedevs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">before becoming a donation-supported non-profit</a></span>, does indeed know where to look. </p><p>This year’s event featured 19 rad-looking games from all sorts of genres, sporting a wonderful assortment of visual styles and coming from devs around the world,  and I can’t wait to try them all. Especially <em>TankHead</em>, which seems like what you’d get if you set <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> in the world of <em>Wall-E</em>. </p></div></div><div><p>A successor to the 2009 cult hit <em>Eliss</em>, <em>Faraway</em> is about a shooting star charting the cosmos while chasing high scores and vibing out to a soundtrack that reminds me of <em>FTL: Faster Than Light</em>.  The whole game is operated with a single button input as you use gravity wells to slingshot your way around celestial bodies. “Let me teach you something about infinity,” says the game’s creator. It’s meant to be infinitely replayable like <em>Tetris</em>: simple on the surface but full of lasting depth. </p><p><strong>Developer and publisher:</strong> Little Eyes <strong>/ </strong>Steph Thirion</p><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p><p><strong>Release date: </strong>2025</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831000/Faraway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2831000/Faraway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Steam Wishlist</strong></a></span></p></div><div><p><em>Ultimate Sheep Raccoon</em> follows in the footsteps of its predecessor, <em>Ultimate Chicken Horse</em>, with lo-fi pastel art and chaotic antics.

Do you think the company cares as much about the rights of <em>other </em>people's games on their platforms?</p><p>Hrm, I dunno, let's take a look. Anyone who's tried to wade through the garbage prominently available on the eShop would already have some doubts about the company’s standards on that front already, but for a more specific case study, check this out:</p><figure></figure><p>On the top left is <em>Unpacking</em>, which is a very good video game. The next five games are most definitely not <em>Unpacking</em>, even though their key art makes them very much look like it. They're not made by the same team, they're not continuations or sequels, they're just some slop--seemingly using AI art on the thumbnails, no less--made to try to cash in on the established game's brand.</p><p>That's some mobile gaming-type bullshit. Surely Nintendo--with the company's history of quality control and video game litigiousness--would not allow such a thing? Like, if <em>Super Mario Galaxy's</em> shop listing was immediately followed by an AI-generated thumbnail for <em>Super Mario Galaxy: New Chapters</em>, someone would end up either bankrupted or strangled and stuffed in the back of a black Toyota Crown.</p><p>Here, though, even <em>Unpacking's </em>creators are being left on read.

He says the number of loading zones in the self-contained cyberpunk city of Neon was especially surprising, in part because there were so few of them there before the game's lighting engine was finished.</p><p dir="ltr">"It could have existed without those [loading screens],” Purkeypile said.

For New Atlantis, I think it's just to make it so you don't have to sit there for the entire train ride."</p><p dir="ltr">Purkeypile did note that some of the problem was "inherent to the Creation Engine and the way it works," referencing Bethesda's decision to stick with an engine some have argued was outdated and ill-suited to the task of holding together a galaxy-sized game.</p>

I personally hate to see Hawkeye coming because I know his arrows will find their way right between my eyes, even when I’m in flight as Star-Lord. But Iron Fist has emerged as a surprise pest, even for characters you’d think would be a good counter for him.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193348" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193348,197298,197284" data-current="193348"><div><p>God Of War Is Still The GOAT For Opening Boss Fights</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193348/193348_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18794.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As the name implies, Lin “Iron Fist” Lie is a mostly melee-focused character but is a force to be reckoned with even for long-range or flight-based heroes. He’s able to quickly rush down squishy heroes and deliver enough punches and kicks to take out the opposing support, leaving the entire enemy team to quickly fall without heals to back them up. That’s what most melee-based <em>Marvel Rivals </em>heroes are meant to do, but Iron Fist has survivability and mobility that makes him both a nightmare to kill at close range, and a tough enemy to keep at a distance.</p><p>Iron Fist becomes especially bothersome when he uses his Living Chi ultimate, which boosts his damage, speed, and range, making it impossible to escape his barrage of punches and kicks. He’s now activating the fight or flight mode for all the support players in the game. Several of the damage-dealing Duelist characters have trouble with him, too. Hilariously enough, his dash abilities give him enough air time that he can nip at the heels of Iron Man as he’s flying away. Some are calling for a patch. I hope he stays busted. Fuck ‘em up, Lin.</p><p>Notably, he has a tougher time brawling with the tanky Vanguard heroes like Captain America or Thor, but if your goal is to knock the foundation out from under the enemy team, Iron Fist is good at chasing down and picking off weaker targets. Any good Vanguard who is protecting their team can counter him, but there are plenty of bad Vanguards out there who leave the healers on their teams eating knuckle sandwiches.</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is still only a few weeks old, and players are still trying to sort out what is a skill issue and what is an actual balance “problem.” Personally, I hope the game doesn’t end up sanded down into a competitive-driven game so concerned with balance that it becomes less fun for the majority of its player base. Only time will tell how NetEase chooses to approach balance changes in the coming months.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Developer MachineGames has whipped out a second update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: a patch that in fact fixes a whip issue for the rugged archaeologist. It's one of many bugs squashed, alongside double-vision issues after nearly drowning and frame-rate stuttering in cutscenes.</p><p dir="ltr">The second update--posted <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4lXgd5pRCMbAkv9clGQW6A/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-2?linkId=100000319960825" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Bethesda's website</a>--aims to address a problem in which Dr. Jones couldn't equip his whip. The Indiana Jones and the Great Circle patch also brings "improvements to global illumination on Xbox." Basically, shadows look even better, with the image quality appearing less washed out. MachineGames also noted that it corrected a problem on PC where global illumination could be disabled because of "playing with below-minimum VRAM graphics cards."</p><p dir="ltr">Last week saw the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circles-first-update-adds-path-tracing-better-whip-behavior/1100-6528311/" data-ref-id="1100-6528311">the first update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, offering up path tracing on PC</a> for select Nvidia cards. MachineGames is working on the feature (which is like souped-up ray tracing) to AMD cards in the future, but it's not part of this second update.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-pulled-a-john-travolta-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528440/" data-ref-id="1100-6528440">Harrison Ford showed up at The Game Awards</a> and heaped praise on Troy Baker and Todd Howard for their work on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

Developer Riley Testut is heavily encouraging users to click that external link by tripling the price you’d otherwise pay to Apple for In-App Purchase versions of those same Patreon tiers.&nbsp;Testut calls it the “do not buy sale.”</p><p>The update both embraces and protests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040881/apple-outside-payments-app-store-policies-iphone-ipad">the External Purchase Link Entitlement</a> that Apple introduced in January, which allows developers to link to outside payment platforms in exchange for giving Apple a slightly reduced 27 percent cut of sales. The App Store policy change was made following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24039983/supreme-court-epic-apple-antitrust-case-rejected">rulings in the Epic vs Apple lawsuit</a> that found Apple had acted anticompetitively by preventing developers from telling users about payment methods that bypassed its own payment system.</p><div><figcaption><em>Clicking this link within the Delta app settings will take you to the Patreon page to sign up directly.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Delta</cite></p></div><p>Testut says Delta is likely the first app to use the entitlement. The $3, $5, and $10 monthly memberships on Patreon — which provide additional benefits like iPad and SEGA Genesis support, and private Discord access depending on the subscription tier — are listed in the iOS app at $10, $15, and $30, respectively.</p><p>“We <em>really</em> don’t want people to use in-app purchase,” Testut told <em>The Verge</em>. “We’ve been using Patreon for years, and it allows us to do things Apple’s IAP system can’t — such as issuing refunds and handling customer support — making it much more convenient for creators like us.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">"There's only so much I can do with hands."</p><p dir="ltr">Raccoon Logic creative director Alex Hutchinson attributes this quote to his animation director, Mike Menillo. It's a funny line, but it's also a short-and-sweet elevator pitch for one of the biggest changes for Revenge Of The Savage Planet, the follow-up to 2020's Journey To The Savage Planet.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge is taking players out of the head of their characters and placing them over the characters' shoulders, as the first-person view gives way to a new third-person format. For players of the original game, this is a radical change, but for the team at Raccoon Logic, it was the perfect way to stretch their creative legs as they try to one-up the last journey.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat in on a hands-off demo during a recent online press event, and while the change in viewpoint is jarring, based on the team's reaction, it's a move that could pay off immensely when it's again time to travel to the stars.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417137"></a><figcaption>Is that a mushroom? Nope nope NOPE!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Shifting perspectives</h2><p dir="ltr">The change from a first- to third-person perspective is not indicative of either option's quality, according to the team; it's simply a matter of preference. "First-person feels more immersive, but third-person is more appealing to a mainstream audience," Hutchinson said. "It’s a balance. Neither is better or worse--just different."</p><p dir="ltr">From the jump, the switch to third-person felt, from a development standpoint, like a whole new world of opportunity was opening. Third-person allows the team to focus on things like physical comedy, status effects, and even emotion. The player-character shown in the demo walks, jumps, slides, and dodges around the world with personality, and in a way that only this viewpoint can show off.</p><p dir="ltr">"Third-person is really exciting because it gives us the opportunity to add a ton more character to the player's avatar," Hutchinson describes. "We can add personality to their walk and runs, and we can have them exude charm with every action." Platforming becomes easier too, as a player can actually see a platform as they jump on it--or, as Hutchinson described it, "you can see your feet!"</p><p dir="ltr">Player agency also gets a boost from the perspective change, as costumes will now be available for a little bit of intergalactic dress-up. These costumes may look familiar, but Hutchinson assures us that these costumes are "legally distinct," with "Temu Star Trek," "Temu Power Ranger," and "Temu Han Solo" among the terms used to describe them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Two-player co-op and the "sweet spot"</h2><p dir="ltr">Revenge Of The Savage Planet will feature co-op, with two players being able to journey through the wild worlds together at a time. The team makes clear that this is not due to any technical limitations; the team is actively choosing to limit co-op to two people in one session.</p><p dir="ltr">Hutchinson says that, in his experience, co-op games with two players hit the "sweet spot." When only two players are paired up, they'll engage each other more through banter or light-hearted jokes. It's not just about the task at hand; duos tend to be more willing to explore, mess things up, and laugh about what's happening in real time. Any more than that, however, and those groups stick to talking about the objectives rather than allowing themselves to live in the moment, or what Hutchinson refers to as a "shared space."</p><p dir="ltr">"I’ve directed a bunch of two player co-op games, from Army of Two: the 40th Day, to Far Cry 4, to Savage Planet, and I love the idea of you and your best friend, or kid, or partner, versus the world," Hutchinson says. "I want people to have the experience I had growing up; on the couch with a pizza, sitting next to your best friend, sharing your day."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417135"></a><figcaption>Oh boy, here I go exploring again.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Poop jokes and corporate satire"</h2><p dir="ltr">One major returning element from Journey To The Savage Planet is its levity: The first game was inherently silly, with over-the-top fake advertisements playing on TVs and radios within the game world. Those are coming back along with some new ones to seek out, but the game also contains a more biting commentary on the state of the world, particularly in a corporate setting. This is, as Hutchinson calls it, "a game for all ages."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the silliness does come through in our demo, as the hero can kick any enemy away with the push of a button, sending them flying into the air. At another point, they defeat a small enemy that leaves behind some red goo, which then sets a small woodland creature on fire on contact. We even get a brief glimpse of one of the aforementioned in-game ads, where Shama Lama's Ding Dong Academy is offering classes, but with a warning that "parkour and pottery may result in permanent injuries."</p><p dir="ltr">"I think with enough density, people skate over the bits that they don’t find funny, and dwell on the bits they do," Hutchinson says. "We try to keep the game moving fast, we don’t belabor a joke, and we let people cause their own chaos for what we like to think of as 'interactive slapstick.' But jokes are always poking a bit and taking a risk; we hope we find an audience who appreciates it!"</p><h2 dir="ltr">A new journey</h2><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Revenge Of The Savage Planet is a bigger version of its predecessor, and the team at Raccoon Logic hopes those who enjoyed it the first time will continue to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">"You liked co-op?" Hutchinson asks. "Now you can play split-screen on your couch or cross-play with your weird friend from Sweden."</p><p dir="ltr">"You like jokes?" We have more systemic chaos that will let you slip on green goo then set yourself on fire while trying to battle an alien crab with human eyes."</p><p dir="ltr">"You liked one alien planet? Now we have four!"</p><p dir="ltr">Along with those changes, though, comes a bold new perspective thanks to the third-person view. By cranking up the first game's best bits, and throwing in the extra character elements and customization that third-person allows, Revenge Of The Savage Planet is shaping up to be a bigger and better journey--poop jokes and corporate satire included.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge Of The Savage Planet is scheduled to launch in May 2025 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix’s mobile game <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> came out today, a week ahead of the disturbing show’s second season, and a few days before the premiere of <em>Beast Games</em>, Mr. Beast’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embattled</a> take on the show with Amazon. All of these things are distinctly not <em>Squid Game</em>, which is what makes them so very <em>Squid Game</em>.</p><p>First things first: <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> is fine, and I enjoyed playing it this morning. It’s a lot like <em>Fall Guys</em> without the physics (game director Bill Jackson told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/495597/squid-game-unleashed-free-to-play-release-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, “We didn’t want the characters to feel unreal and have their physics feel unreal”). Characters start in the iconic green jumpsuit, though their outfits can be customized with currency you earn by playing. Some, like Kang Sae-byeok, are characters from the show, while others have been invented for <em>Unleashed</em>. Each character has a dossier in their info screen that tells a backstory about why they joined the game.</p><p>The levels themselves are takes on the show’s challenges; without the psychological aspect that made the show so compelling, they’re largely races to a finish line. There’s Red Light, Green Light, which came back in a later round in one of my games with the addition of buzzsaws. The dalgona challenge, where characters had to carve a shape from a candy, here is a race along the outline of shapes to fall to the ground and make it to a finish line, a compelling combination of teamwork and competition. The marbles episode appears to be recast as a race to a school, with busses, electrified water, and fire to avoid. The challenge where characters inch across a glass floor stays pretty straightforward and works well as a game level. A final round I spectated, a take on the hand-to-hand combat that ended the show’s first season, features players knocking each other out of a slippery squid-shaped arena, grabbing weapons and shields from floating present boxes that are definitely an aesthetic contrast to the actual moment in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>The brutality of the show is present in moments where you’re eliminated, either ragdolling to a bloody death or being sharply felled by a sniper. Developer Boss Fight has done a good job keeping the contrast between the show’s bright, cute spaces and the violence behind them without tipping too far in either direction. As Jackson told Polygon, “You don’t want to create a world where players don’t want to be;” I’m sure it was an immense game design challenge to try to make a game players would want to play and have fun with from a narrative about characters’ life experiences forcing them into an unthinkably terrible situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Atop all this is all the stuff of any mobile game: leveling up through play, earning different kinds of currency that can be spent on outfits or giving your character new abilities surrounding in-game items like bats and dodgeballs. While it makes sense from a gameplay perspective to earn currency while you play and not just when you win, the whole idea of this runs against the core concept of the show. Money was such a hard, ever-present feature in <em>Squid Game</em>, from characters’ motivations to the pig full of cash dangling above their heads. Here, as in many mobile games, money feels cheap and abundant, which sands off much of its meaning. If you, like me, aren’t the kind of player who’s motivated by cosmetics, it basically doesn’t matter at all.</p><p>Here’s where <em>Unleashed </em>and <em>Beast Games</em> and Netflix’s reality competition <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em> all miss the point. <em>Squid Games</em>’ games got their meaning from the story behind them, both the show’s written narrative and the deeper issues it pointed to. It cast a spotlight on money and power and class divides and the fundamental unfairness of society, all of which resonated with viewers because we’re so <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/23/opinions/squid-game-netflix-why-americans-are-obsessed-lowe/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aware of these issues</a> but can feel like we have few outlets for challenging or changing them. It would be fun to, say, climb on a <em>Ninja Warrior</em> course because the course is the topic of that show; in <em>Squid Game</em>, the <em>fun </em>is just a set dressing that highlights how unfun and unfair it is to try to survive in actual society. If you strip all that away to just the mechanics, all you’re left with is uncomfortable reality shows and a perfectly fine mobile game dressed in <em>Squid Game</em>’s aesthetics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are individuals at the top of Amazon and Netflix and the Mr. Beast empire who are less bloodthirsty corollaries to <em>Squid Game</em>’s rich antagonists, who see art and people as nothing more than dollar signs (Remember when Netflix exec Bela Bajaria, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/01/16/how-much-more-netflix-can-the-world-absorb-bela-bajaria" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked</a> about her favorite shows, replied with “I’m a fan of TV” before having strong opinions about the wine on a private jet?). I don’t want to presume these people are ignorant of the conflict they’ve wandered into, or get all holier-than-thou about what Netflix can do with its properties or what <em>Squid Game</em> creator Hwang Dong-hyuk should do with his show. I’m sure everyone involved is hyper-aware of how <em>weird</em> the extended <em>Squid Game</em> universe is, even as they milk it for every drop of cash and viewer engagement it’s worth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In a different world, maybe <em>Squid Game</em> could have stayed what it was without getting little bits nibbled off to feed the <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IP machine</a>. But the world we live in is the one where the people who make money are going to make money, and the rest of us are going to find resonance in <em>Squid Game</em>’s message while still thinking “it would be fun to play a version of this without killing someone or getting shot in the head,” and where Boss Fight has made a totally OK, even enjoyable mobile game to satisfy both those parties. <em>Squid Game</em> the show highlighted the conflicting choices people make in our current system; in that way, maybe all these spinoffs fit right in. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
