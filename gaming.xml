            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kickstarter-tariff-manager-helps-creators-navigate-volatile-trade-environment<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A Kickstarter tariff manager is being introduced. The crowdfunding platform that has given creators of all stripes a chance to bring their projects to new audiences is helping those same creators navigate the volatile trade environment caused by the US government.</p>

<h2>The Kickstarter Tariff Manager Announcement</h2>

<p>The Kickstarter tariff manager was announced in an official <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/first-look-the-kickstarter-tariff-manager/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. The post states that the manager is part of the platform assisting creators with navigating rapidly changing trade policies. Up to this point, this assistance has included tips on shipping logistics and conveying information to campaign backers. This manager is the first major form of aid that isn't just useful information.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-freighter-on-sea.jpg?itok=fxMp-1ZS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-freighter-on-sea.jpg?itok=p69J7ZsS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>According to the post, the Kickstarter tariff manager will aid all US-based creators more flexibility, control, and transparency during the fulfillment process of a crowdfunding campaign. This is important because an import fee during this time can lead to disruptions of budget, delayed timelines, and even difficult tradeoffs on what can be delivered.</p>

<p>To this end, the tariff manager can allow creators to introduce a surcharge to backers to cover import costs. This will lead to a separate line item on the backer's payment page. This ensures full transparency to why backers are charged extra after their respective pledge level and shipping fees.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if backers cannot pay these extra costs, the manager will allow them to contact the creator directly and discuss solutions. This can include requesting a refund, adjusting their pledge level, or other compromise agreed upon by both parties. If the campaign in question was just for a TTRPG book however, there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a chance</a> it won't be affected by these tariffs.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter tariff manager is another tale in the ongoing story of the board game industry reacting to the trade tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration. The severe costs have already caused the closure of developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>, publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a>, and online retailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a>. The sudden and aggressive implementation of the tariffs have even caused Stonemaier Games to file <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>THe Kickstarter tariff manager will be introduced as part of a new Pledge Manager several weeks from now.</p>

            <p>
Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> was announced… sorry, hang on, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">almost four years ago</a>? Cripes, time really does fly when you're waiting on the incredibly anticipated follow-up to one of the most popular games of all time doesn't it! It's no secret that developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is happy to take his time with his next game, and good on him for doing so. However, he also can't help himself but continue to work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, releasing another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">pretty big update</a> for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">farming game</a> only last year. The good news is that, based on some comments in a recent interview, Haunted Chocolatier is the main focus going forward.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/">PC Gamer</a>, Barone explained,"The 1.6 update is pretty settled at this point. There were ongoing console ports and bug fixes, but it's pretty settled now. I'm committed to not working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with Haunted Chocolatier… I think it's in a good place. I feel very solid about it. I think if anyone picks up Stardew Valley for the first time in 2025, I'm very proud of it, and I think they'll have fun with it if they like this kind of game."
</p>
<p>
Another issue he's facing is his own work, specifically the work he did when he started development all those years ago. "It's been a few years that I've been working on it now and it's like, I look at some of the stuff I did at the beginning and I'm like, 'Oh man, here we go again. I'm gonna have to redo all of this," Barone said. Though, he did note it's not a case of anything being bad, just that given the passage of time he's a "different person" and his "aesthetic sensibilities have evolved."
</p>
<p>
That's one of the fatal flaws of game dev these days I think. How on earth can you properly reflect the artist you are now when it's a project you've been working on for years? A question I'm curious to see answered whenever Haunted Chocolatier does come out. Which, I imagine, is still probably a good while away.

                <p dir="ltr">Would original Banjo-Kazooie composer Grant Kirkhope return to score a new entry in the series? Absolutely. Does he think there will be a sequel for the 3D platformer? Let's just say he's not holding his breath.</p><p dir="ltr">Kirkhope chatted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banjo-kazooie-sequel-chances-better-than-zero-but-not-much-says-composer-grant-kirkhope" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a> about the chances of a new Banjo-Kazooie. "I just think it's unlikely," said Kirkhope. He sees a couple of obstacles to the franchise returning, such as finding the right developer (since Rare is unlikely in his estimation) and the size of the fanbase. "If you think I've got a hundred and something thousand followers on my Twitter, and that's the Banjo bubble, if that's all it is then that's not going to make any money," Kirkhope said. "You need millions of people to buy the game, and you've got to sell it to a whole new generation of kids."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="302190212" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All the way back in 2022, Microsoft made waves in the video game industry by striking a legally binding agreement with Communications Workers of America (CWA), the union that now represents thousands of workers within the company. “Microsoft will remain neutral when Activision Blizzard employees express interest in joining a union, providing a clear path to collective bargaining for almost 10,000 workers,” read <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a joint release</a> from CWA and Microsoft during a time when the latter was facing regulatory scrutiny over its then-proposed purchase of Activision Blizzard. At the time, it seemed like a match made in heaven, but two years later, workers find themselves stuck in bargaining hell.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, approaching the third anniversary of the neutrality agreement and the second anniversary of QA workers at Zenimax – the first video game studio union at Microsoft – beginning the process of bargaining for a contract, CWA says proceedings have stalled. It chalks this up to Microsoft’s failure to address concerns about remote work, an issue that has led to <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outcry from workers at other Microsoft-owned companies like Activision</a>, as well as Microsoft’s “unilateral decision to replace in-house quality assurance work with outsourced labor without notifying the union.”</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Microsoft for more details, but the company did not reply as of this publishing.</p><p>While early returns, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an agreement to curb destructive uses of AI</a>, seemed promising, <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rounds</a> of mass layoffs soon followed in 2023 and 2024. The relationship between Microsoft and the nascent Zenimax QA union has since devolved.</p><p>“It’s become increasingly clear that although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table,” Zenimax Workers United member and senior QA tester Autumn Mitchell said in a statement received by Aftermath. “We are frustrated. Our union will continue fighting until we secure a first contract, and we’re prepared to do whatever it takes – even if that means withholding our labor.”&nbsp;</p><p>This follows demonstrations outside of Zenimax offices in Texas and Maryland last week, as well as <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a strike authorization</a> from the hundreds-strong Zenimax bargaining unit earlier this month, which 94 percent of members voted in favor of. At the time, workers spoke out against return-to-office policies and what they viewed as penny pinching from their corporate overlords.</p><p>“Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said Zenimax senior QA Tester Zachary Armstrong in <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-vote-authorize-strike-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a release</a> issued by CWA.</p><p>“Our in-house contractors have been working on minimal wages with no benefits, including no paid sick time,” associate QA Tester Aubrey Litchfield added. “Workers are choosing not to start families because of the uncertainty of finances. We’ve released multiple titles while working fully remote.

			<p>Today, Netmarble announced that Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will have its full launch as a free-to-play title on May 21, when the game will be available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, Epic Games Store, and Windows Launcher, and on mobile devices via Android or iOS across the world with the exception of Asia, which will have to wait until later this year. The online action/adventure/RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-enters-early-access-on-march-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched on Steam Early Access on March 26</a>; the developers have introduced several fixes and improvements based on community feedback over the past few weeks.</p>
<p>Recently, Game Director Hyunil Jang outlined the game's roadmap with the following letter to the community:</p>
<p><em>First, let's talk about field boss matchmaking. Field bosses are multiplayer content that allows up to 12 players to participate together. During the early access period, we had them spawn frequently so that many players could take part. However, we noticed that because they appeared so often, players were more spread out and it actually made it harder for groups to come together and enjoy the content fully. To improve this, we're planning to reduce the number of times Drogon appears each day. We understand this will lower the number of attempts players can make, but we believe it's more important to create an environment where people can enjoy the content together. That said, if this change doesn't have the positive impact we're hoping for, we'll absolutely listen to your feedback and make adjustments again. </em></p>
<p><em>Among the feedback to the early access version of the game and the closed beta we had earlier, there were a lot of requests about additional language support. We're happy to let you know that we plan to support Portuguese and Turkish at launch.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] Next, I want to talk about the Founder's Pack and the availability of optional purchasable items within the game. For those who joined early access through the Founder's Packs, these were designed to include a sample of the various purchasable items that will be available at launch. To thank our Founder's Packs players for helping us fine-tune Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, additional costumes that can be used by all classes were sent to all players who purchased the Founder's </em><em>Packs. We're also preparing additional rewards for early access players before the official launch. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is designed with player control in mind, ensuring a rich and rewarding experience regardless of optional purchasable items, as they are not essential to fully enjoy all aspects of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>Next, I'd like to talk about the RP system. We closely reviewed player feedback and gameplay patterns from early access and we identified several areas for improvement which we're currently working on. One of the biggest points was a shortage of RP. The original intent of the RP system was to help manage fatigue and ensure players could still earn meaningful rewards even with limited play time. However, many of you shared that the current RP supply felt too low, which made the overall experience less satisfying. We completely understand this concern, and the team is actively discussing balance adjustments to increase the daily amount of RP provided.</em></p>
<p><em>Another point we heard was that there isn't too much to do once RP runs out. Right now, players can still take part in content like field bosses or explore Westeros after using up their RP, but we </em><em>agree there's room to offer more. We're working on adding new types of content, including exploration challenges and co-op content, to keep things engaging even beyond RP. </em></p>
<p><em>If you've played our early access build, you'll have already explored the snowy regions of the North, the stained opulence of the Red Keep, and the lush green meadows of the Reach. Ultimately, our goal is to bring the entirety of Westeros to life with that same level of detail and authenticity. The next region we'll be visiting is one that hasn't received a lot of love in either the books or the show: the Stormlands, ruled by Stannis Baratheon. Our level and background teams work very hard to give each region its own distinct vibe, and the Stormlands live up to their name with a dark and oppressive feel and atmosphere matching the region's tone.</em></p>
<p><em>The narrative for this next chapter will be slightly darker as well. We'll dive a little more into the aspects of religion and what it would mean to a medieval society like that of Westeros to have</em><br>
<em>their king suddenly declare that all the people under his rule are now obliged to change their faith to that of a god whose name they can't even pronounce. </em></p>
<p><em>Our aim has always been to deliver a more polished and complete experience, but we recognized that there were areas like bugs and overall stability where we still have work to do.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/duolingo-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You’ll remember my <a href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rant against Duolingo</a>, which has now turned one of Aftermath’s Discord channels into a regular vent session as we share the language learning app’s latest follies. (My recent complaint: I pop in to do one lesson and it keeps foisting XP boosts on me, a naked attempt to keep me on the app that absolutely works, because I am a rube.) Well, I’m back with a new complaint, which is the harder pivot to AI Duolingo CEO Luis von Ahn <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/657594/duolingo-ai-first-replace-contract-workers?utm_content=buffer2a099&amp;utm_medium=socialpost&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced yesterday</a>. </p><p>In a message to staff also posted to the company’s <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322560534824865792/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, von Ahn writes that “Duolingo will remain a company that cares deeply about its employees,” then says that the company will be replacing <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/duolingo-cuts-10-contractors-uses-173030211.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a> contractors with AI, writing, "We’ll gradually stop using contractors to do work that AI can handle." This is part of the company’s decision to become “AI-first,” a nonsense buzzword that even von Ahn can’t pitch without admitting it sucks, writing (emphasis mine) “Being AI-first means we will need to rethink much of how we work… [W]e can’t wait until the technology is 100% perfect. We’d rather <strong>move with urgency and take occasional small hits on quality</strong> than move slowly and miss the moment.”</p><p>This strategy will also involve considering AI in hiring and performance reviews, whatever that means, and that “headcount will only be given if a team cannot automate more of their work.” While von Ahn writes that "This isn’t about replacing Duos with AI" (contractors are indeed not staff) he does write that "It’s about removing bottlenecks so we can do more with the outstanding Duos we already have," which reads to me like a way of fancying up the "do more with less" afflicting countless industries these days.</p><p>In his note, von Ahn seems to claim that these decisions are in service of Duolingo’s mission: </p><blockquote><p>To teach well, we need to create a massive amount of content, and doing that manually doesn’t scale. One of the best decisions we made recently was replacing a slow, manual content creation process with one powered by AI.&nbsp;Without AI, it would take us decades to scale our content to more learners. We owe it to our learners to get them this content ASAP.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Rather than use the revenue from Duolingo’s <a href="https://investors.duolingo.com/static-files/99006c40-d8cf-41ca-b5b1-c5cb1fa5ba88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 10 million paid subscribers</a> to hire more experts to create–I cannot stress this enough–<em>learning content that requires subject matter expertise</em>, von Ahn seems to believe that quantity is the top goal, and that its users <em>deserve </em>a flood of what even he admits could be shit. This certainly squares with my own experience of Duolingo, which employs every cheap gamification trick in the book to simply keep me in the app and push me to pay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7322657005800759297/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LinkedIn</a>, Duolingo’s chief engineering officer Natalie Glance shared a Slack message she wrote to the engineering team explaining how AI will fit into their work. This message features new directives such as “AI will be everywhere in our product” and “productivity expectations will rise.” Here’s my personal favorite: </p><blockquote><p>Start with AI for every task. No matter how small, try using an AI tool first. It won’t always be faster or better at first–but that’s how you build skill. Don’t give up if the first result is wrong.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Again, these people are <em>literally admitting</em> AI won’t work, but are still asking engineers now laboring under heightened productivity expectations to spend their even-more-precious time managing this sub-par tech. "That's how you build skill" puts the AI tools' failing back on the user, the "<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Have%20Fun%20Staying%20Poor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have fun staying poor</a>" of the AI world, and asks engineers to troubleshoot AI when they could instead be using their <em>real live human skill to do the jobs they were hired for</em>.</p><p>That Duolingo execs can write all this and still insist the company prioritizes humans, whether that’s workers or users, is a staggering level of AI brainrot. None of this helps people. Workers, if they still have jobs, will be asked to pivot to clumsy tools. Users will be fed content Duolingo itself admits could have mistakes; in the language I’m learning, Irish, this is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dean-tane.bsky.social/post/3lnwt46sgps2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already</a> a problem, with the computerized voices mangling the pronunciation to such an extent that I live in dread of the app giving me listening exercises because I often have no clue what it’s attempting to say. All of this means what AI always means: creating more–God help me–<em>content</em> with less people, assuming workers and users are so stupid that we’ll lap up whatever shit is shoved in our faces or crammed into our workflows because the people at the top can’t imagine we’re not as enthralled with the latest fad as they are.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m new enough to Duolingo that giving up my streak or uninstalling the app isn’t a big ask, though I’ll also admit that I’m loathe to give up on all the new vocabulary it’s teaching me. Luckily, I have options: my public library gives me free access to <a href="https://mangolanguages.com/libraries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mango Languages</a>, and I know other libraries have Rosetta Stone or other programs. I’ve recently been experimenting with user-made <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anki decks</a>; the program is much clunkier than Duolingo, but way more customizable and robust. For those of you learning less obscure languages than Irish, I’m sure there’s an even greater wealth of resources out there. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike"><h3>Almost Three Years After Neutrality Agreement, Negotiations Between Microsoft And Unionized Workers Aren’t Going Well</h3></a><p>"Although Microsoft tries to position itself as a good-faith employer, there’s another story being told behind the scenes at the bargaining table"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grace-sinners"><h3>Grace Did Nothing Wrong</h3></a><p>Some Sinners fans need to ease up on homegirl

        <p>Would be nice if they could just be honest for once</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><em><strong>Update</strong>: Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTk1MzQ2OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2NTU4MjY4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVkhVQjFUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.Ok9U1G-8KnrQWSRme5JF1VqfCPIxgENs3iq9d32PeRc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">since reported</a> that between 300 and 400 positions have been "eliminated" across EA, including around 100 at EA. One of the cancelled incubation projects was also apparently an extraction shooter set in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> universe.</em></p>
<p>
Apex Legends developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a> have announced that two of its incubation projects have been cancelled, leading to what it calls a number of "target team adjustments across <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi</a>." You may notice that this language is particularly obtuse, in that it doesn't refer to these adjustments as layoffs. However, according to a report from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-dev-respawn-cancels-another-incubation-project-around-100-employees-impacted">IGN</a>, layoffs have occurred, though just how many is currently unknown.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
IGN says that it believes around 100 individuals are affected by the decision, which includes developers, publishing, and QA workers across the aforementioned Apex Legends, Star Wars Jedi, and incubation projects. It's worth noting that one of these projects was actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">reportedly cancelled in March</a>, and IGN understands that "some, though not all, of the developers from the incubation project reported on in March have already been moved to work on Iron Man at EA Motive, Battlefield, and other projects."

<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA</a> also reportedly didn't comment on how many have been impacted, but did say that they are offering those affected 30 days to find another role within the company. They're also apparently trying to help find roles for as many people as they can internally.
</p>
<p>
The report also says that Respawn SVP of operations Daniel Suarez is now taking over the role of general manager at the studio, reporting directly to Vince Zampella. Alongside being founder of the studio, Zampella was previously general manager, while also serving as the head of the Battlefield series. Zampella is continuing as group GM and EVP for both Battlefield and Respawn.
</p>
<p>
It's probably also worth noting that Jeff Grubb, known for his insider information (he recently accurately reported on the Oblivion remaster dropping last week), has apparently been told that there are <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y">wider layoffs taking place at EA</a>. Grubb says he doesn't know an exact number, but it's apparently similar in size to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lnxurth7xs2y">layoffs that took place last year</a>, which saw around 670 employees affected at the time.
</p>
<p>
Honestly, the whole announcement from Respawn is predictably tone deaf. It claims that Apex Legends will be "exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play", while ignoring the fact that cutting a team to such a degree whilst it's in the midst of making "Apex 2.0" won't help them meet those margins the game is currently failing to achieve. Fingers crossed that everyone affected is able to land on their feet.

One of these canceled incubation projects is the same one <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/respawn-has-quietly-canceled-a-multiplayer-fps-incubation-project">already reported on back in March</a>. The other, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reports</a>, was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe, code-named R7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These decisions aren’t easy, and we are deeply grateful to every teammate affected — their creativity and contributions have helped build Respawn into what it is today," the post continued. "We’re offering meaningful support to those impacted, including exploring new opportunities within EA."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN understands that roughly 100 individuals are affected by the changes, including a mix of developers, publishing, and QA workers on Apex Legends, as well as smaller groups of individuals on the Jedi team and on the incubation projects. IGN also understands that at least some, though not all, of the developers from the incubation project reported on in March have already been moved to work on Iron Man at EA Motive, Battlefield, and other projects. When asked, EA declined to comment on the exact number of individuals impacted, saying it is offering impacted individuals 30 days to find a new opportunity inside the organization and is endeavoring to find roles for as many individuals as it can internally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Internally at Respawn, work will continue on Apex Legends as well as the game's next iteration, the next entry in the Star Wars: Jedi franchise, and support on the upcoming Bit Reactor Star Wars game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-zero-company-officially-revealed-with-2026-release-window">Star Wars: Zero Company</a>. EA declined to say whether or not any other incubation projects are currently in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, Respawn SVP of operations Daniel Suarez is being elevated to general manager of Respawn, and will report directly to Vince Zampella. Previously, Zampella served as GM of Respawn, the studio he founded, in addition to his role as head of the Battlefield franchise. Zampella will continue as group GM and EVP overseeing both Battlefield and Respawn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-isnt-doing-the-business-for-ea-so-its-making-apex-legends-20-to-come-out-after-battlefield">just last February</a>, EA told investors that Apex Legends was "not headed in the direction that we have wanted" and hadn't been for some time. CEO Andrew Wilson said that Respawn is currently working on a major update, dubbed "Apex 2.0".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our expectation is that Apex will also be one of those franchises and that sometime on a longer-term time horizon, there will be an even bigger, more meaningful update to that broader game experience, an Apex 2.0, if you will. This will not be the final incarnation of Apex," Wilson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes continue a trend at EA of canceled projects, layoffs, and restructuring that's been going on for several years now.

It’s for up to three players (you can play solo with two bots, like in the PvE Operations mode), and, as you’d expect, you fight increasingly difficult waves of Tyranids and Chaos. Your class and weapon levels are based on your PvE levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Difficulty will increase for each wave defeated, so you’ll have to prepare yourself accordingly to vaporize as many waves as you can,” Focus and Saber said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The companies also offered a first look, below, at the Horde mode map, which takes place in Kadaku. Kadaku is the Imperial Jungle World Space Marine 2 players will already be familiar with. The Horde Mode release date is yet to be announced, but it sounds like it’s not too far off.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/29/sm2-1745946503242.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">That's a big gun on Kadaku. Image credit: focus Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what else Patch 8 will bring, Focus and Saber players can expect more free and premium DLC, including a Blood Angels cosmetic pack, a White Scars Champion Pack, and a rebalancing of the Absolute difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had indicated that they wanted Absolute difficulty to be even tougher in order to differentiate it more from Lethal difficulty, and it sounds like that’s on the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last month, we did a community poll on Focus Together to collect your feedback and see what you were interested to see on the Absolute difficulty to differentiate it more from Lethal,” Focus and Saber said. “You will see the changes we made as part of the 8.0 update. Expect an even tougher challenge!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect a lot more from Patch 8, the companies said. PTS players will be able to test Patch 8 before it's released.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus and Saber had previously confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-moves-to-set-the-record-straight-insists-its-not-abandoning-the-game-following-space-marine-3-announcement"><u>Space Marine 2 </u><u><em>is </em></u><u>getting a new class</u></a>, but there’s no mention of it in the Patch 8 post. Most assume it will be the Apothecary, as close to a medic class as Space Marines have. But there is hope that it could be the Librarian, which would mean super cool warp-powered space magic. Also confirmed coming are new PvE operations and melee weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot happening in the world of Space Marine 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>despite the surprise announcement that development of Space Marine 3 development had begun</u></a>. Space Marine 2’s year one roadmap remains in place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Sam's Club memberships are <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpXOVw?object_uuid=851fc1cd-08ba-4a3f-8d31-cf016fd7cf0b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">60% off today through Groupon</a>, which is about the easiest win you are going to find if you like cheap bulk snacks, discounted tech, and occasional panic buys of kayaks you will never use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even better, a membership right now gets you access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Pokémon TCG deals</a> that have been selling out fast, including the Charizard ex Super-Premium Collection at a price you can explain to your wallet.</p><p id="sams-club-membership-1-year"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sam's Club Membership (1 Year)">Sam's Club Membership (1 Year)</h2></p><div catalogid="69f51126-8354-46ab-b22b-cabdf67d8cf0" id="219758"><div id="219758" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sam's Club Membership (1 Year)</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Extra $5 off for today only</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sam's Club memberships are rarely this cheap without some kind of catch, but today you can pick up a one-year "Club" membership for $20 after an extra $5 discount, or upgrade to "Plus" for $60 if you want perks like free shipping. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think the Club tier is the real steal here, especially if you just want access to the savings without needing someone to upsell you into a tire rotation package. With more than 25,000 people already jumping on it, I would not sit on this too long.</p></div><p id="charizard-ex-super-premium"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Charizard Ex Super-Premium">Pokémon TCG Charizard Ex Super-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="69f51126-8354-46ab-b22b-cabdf67d8cf0" id="219757"><div id="219757" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Charizard Ex Super-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have been trying to land the Charizard ex Super-Premium Collection without paying scalper prices, this is probably your moment. Sam's Club has it for $49.94, and in my opinion, that is about as good as it gets without waiting for some mythical clearance event. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are getting ten booster packs, three promo cards, a Charizard figure, and a code card for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-game-sale-switch-2-woot">Pokémon</a> TCG Live. You will need a membership to grab it, but compared to what this set has been going for elsewhere, that feels like a small trade-off.</p></div><p id="single-pokmon-card-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Single Pokémon Card Deals">Single Pokémon Cards Are Crashing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my opinion, this is a strong two-for-one situation. You save on the membership, you get early access to deals that are usually wiped out by the time they hit the regular shelves, and if you have been thinking about jumping back into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-29-2025">Pokémon TCG </a>without paying eBay prices, this is probably one of the better windows you will see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
