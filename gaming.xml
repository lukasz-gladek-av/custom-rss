			<p>Despite having been out for well over a year, players are still making some interesting discoveries in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth highlighting the amazing depth of its combat system which is sadly left unexplored due to the game's generally low difficulty level.</p>



<p>Over the past few days, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@2052brad">Brad Man</a> shared on YouTube two videos highlighting the hidden properties of Tifa's Overpower ability and Red XIII's Crescent Claws and Reaper Touch. The hidden properties of Overpower, in particular, can completely shake up combat, allowing Tifa and the rest of the party to interrupt and launch in the air even heavier enemies, resulting in a more satisfying experience. As such, it's really weird how the game doesn't provide any information on these mechanics, ultimately ending up reinforcing the wrong idea that some have regarding what is, in my opinion, one of the best combat systems seen in modern role-playing games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was originally released on PlayStation 5 on February 29 2024, and was ported one year later on PC. Although plenty of mods have been released on PC to improve the experience and introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-requested-feature/">features and mechanics</a> not available in the vanilla version of the game, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is a game that's more than worthy experiencing, as Kai highlighted in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a>.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. With Final Fantasy VII Remake hitting the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S soon, there's little doubt the rest of the trilogy will eventually make its way onto every modern gaming platform at some point.</p>

<p>Hell is Us is a brand-new action game headed up by Rogue Factor and supported by Nacon. It’s launching in a busy 2025 period and competing against some real AAA brutes. Nevertheless, if you’re hyped for it, let’s check out the Hell is Us release date and announced start times.</p>



<p>You take the reins of Rémi in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-is-us-release-date-confirmed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hell is Us</a>. You fight Hollow Walkers, and the supernatural gameplay and storytelling are a major part of the game’s fabric. It leans into the ‘punishing’ aspect of combat, but from what I’ve seen so far, it looks to be infinitely rewarding. With 2025 building up to a stacked climax, Hell is Us has got its work cut out.</p>



<p>I’ve got everything you need to know about Hell is Us’ release date, and start times for major time zones. </p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-hell-is-us-coming-out">When is Hell is Us Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Slice and dice. Credit to Nacon</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Rogue Factor’s Hell is Us is scheduled to release on September 4 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>As I’ve said, September 2025 is a crazy one for gaming releases. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-release-date-explained-start-times-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> are just some of the blockbuster launches on the way.</p>



<p>A new IP like Hell is Us is going to have a tough time competing. But if you’re into your action games, chances are this supersedes other releases anyway!</p>



<h2 id="h-hell-is-us-start-times-amp-early-access-launch-information">Hell is Us Start Times &amp; Early Access Launch Information</h2>



<p><strong>We believe Hell is Us Standard Edition goes live at 1 AM PDT on September 4, and early access starts 72 hours ahead of time on September 1.</strong></p>



<p>There’s an early access incentive for Hell is Us. If you choose to do this, you essentially jump the queue by three days. This does require you to shell out even more cash for the Deluxe Edition, though. It all depends on how keen you are for Hell is Us and its release date.</p>



<p>While you contemplate this, here are the release date and start time details across key US time zones, the United Kingdom, and Australia—thanks to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP6665-PPSA09259_00-HIU0000000000000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/imagine-dragons-interview-last-flag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/interview-imagine-dragons%E2%80%99-dan-mac-reynolds-talk-%E2%80%98last-flag%E2%80%99-their-upcoming-video-game.1281564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At one point or another, you’ve probably heard an Imagine Dragons song. From “Believer” to “Thunder” to “Radioactive,” the American pop-rock band’s music has dominated the world since 2008 thanks to its catchy beats and powerful lyrics. Their songs have been featured in movies, TV shows, adverts, and even video games. But now, Imagine Dragons brothers, Mac Reynolds, the band’s manager, and Dan Reynolds, lead singer, are taking their creative minds to create their own video game dubbed “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-flag-limited-time-steam-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Flag</a>“.</p>



<p>Development of Last Flag started sometime in 2020 under the brothers’ newly founded development studio Night Street Games.</p>



<p>Speaking with both Dan and Mac Reynolds, I wanted to know more about this newfound venture, what inspired Last Flag, and where they’d like to take Night Street Games in the future. But first, I was curious about why the brothers wanted to develop a game based on the Capture the Flag game mode and the inspiration behind it. </p>



<p>Mac Reynolds tells me, “The game is actually inspired by real-life capture the&nbsp;flag, which we played a lot as kids. Although we loved the CTF game modes in Unreal Tournament, Quake, and a ton of other games – none of them had that core element of “hide your&nbsp;flag&nbsp;anywhere you want.” There’s something freeing about that component that makes every game different and brings in a little more psychology when you’re sneaking around the map trying to put yourself in the enemy team’s shoes. As soon as we started down that path in development, we knew there was something special and different about it. Since then, it’s been all about how we capture that in a game loop that feels super replayable and fun as a team.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>One of the characters is a Boy Scout, which makes sense because of the game’s inspiration. But what’s the story behind the other characters we see?</strong></p>



<p>Dan Reynolds says, “Each of the contestants has their own reason for auditioning for the show. Some of them are more obvious, but others you really have to dig around as a player to discover. Julius, for example, is a bounty hunter turned author who is looking to promote his new book. Alejandro, our soldier, is trying to draw attention to his sister, who went missing when they were younger. He wears her guitar on his back in hopes she’ll see him on TV and keep her hopes alive. Some people may have more nefarious reasons for being there…”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>I believe the game started development around 2020? How did you go from an idea to actually making the game, and have there been any unforeseen challenges during development?</strong></p>



<p>Mac says, “Making your first game is a little like making your first album – you spend a lot of time in blue sky territory just thinking and planning and tinkering before things start taking shape.&nbsp; You never get that luxury for your second game or album, so we tried to stay unboxed in our ideas for as long as we could.&nbsp; It started with conversations Dan and I had, and then sketches, and even songs and animations Dan made that started to flesh things out.&nbsp; We tried everything from isometric views to fog of war before we found what felt like the right embodiment of all these ideas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There have been plenty of challenges in the dev process.&nbsp; One of these was figuring out how to take something a little chaotic, though lots of fun (hiding the flag anywhere), and give it enough of an objective framework that it doesn’t just feel like luck if you happen on the other flag.&nbsp; A lot of brainstorms with the team and particularly Matthew Berger (our incredible Game Director) led us to the idea of radar towers and other elements which tamed that chaos JUST enough.”</p>



<p><strong>[For Dan] What’s this entire process for you been like compared to writing music? I’ve heard you’re something of a programmer yourself – have you implemented any of those skills into the game?</strong></p>



<p>“I usually write from a pretty vulnerable and autobiographical place, so it was a nice change to just focus on the world of Last Flag and this whole 70s universe when working on the music. It was a pretty collaborative process with myself, Dave Lowmiller (our audio lead who also is in a metal band and did sound for Battlefield), and Grammy-nominated producer JT Daly. A ton of real instruments and time-period-appropriate recording techniques were used. We’re having a lot of fun.</p>



<p>I started taking programming classes online years ago, and it’s really become my outlet when I’m not on stage. I’ve gotten pretty decent at prototyping ideas in Unity, and when we first started Last Flag, that was really our jumping off point until we were able to grow the incredible team of devs we have today.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><strong>Now that Last Flag is getting nearer to completion, are the creative juices flowing for some other ideas and the next venture for Night Street Games?</strong></p>



<div><p>Mac says, “Our team has already been pitching ideas for game two to each other, as well as exciting places to take Last Flag in the future. But for now, we’re really trying to focus our creative energy on listening to feedback from our players and never allowing ourselves to feel too comfortable in thinking we know exactly what the perfect version of this game will be. We learn something every day from them, and have plenty of ideas to cultivate and incorporate into the game before we can let our foot off the gas.”</p><p>Dan tells me, “We definitely want to be a multi-game studio, but we know that means doing this first one right. This isn’t a side project for us, so we try to keep a long-term perspective on how we make this first game. We want to be doing this for a very long time.”</p></div>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721340/Last_Flag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last Flag is currently available in a&nbsp;free, limited-time demo on Steam</a> from August 25–September 1&nbsp;as part of Steam’s Third-Person Shooter Fest.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-publisher-promises-fix-clans-locked-day-one-dlc/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Paradox Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-october-21-lasombra-toreador-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that two of the clans available in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, Lasombra and Toreador, would be locked behind a day-one DLC, Shadows and Silk (or the purchase of the Premium Edition), it was not hard at all to imagine a community uproar. </p>



<p>That is indeed exactly what happened. After a few days of mulling, it seems like Paradox is willing to make some fixes to that, as reported by Community Manager DebbieElla on the official Discord channel.</p>



<p><em>We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we're making adjustments ahead of Launch to reflect this.<br>We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible. In the meantime, please join us tomorrow on Twitch at 17:00 CEST, where we'll be showing off more of the game!</em></p>



<p>We'll have to wait some more time to learn exactly what Paradox plans to do to allow Bloodlines 2 players to select Lasombra or Toreador as Phyre's vampire clan without having to get the $21.99 Shadows and Silk DLC. </p>



<p>I recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pre-gamescom-2025-hands-on-a-tasty-morsel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got my hands on a Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 demo</a> before Gamescom 2025, but there's more content coming from Gamescom itself, so stay tuned. Meanwhile, here's a quote that sums up my first impressions of the game:</p>



<p><em>There was much cause to worry about Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, especially after such a highly anticipated RPG sequel was given to a developer with no prior experience crafting roleplaying games. From the little taste I played, though, I think the folks at The Chinese Room have done well in most regards. It may not turn out to be a spectacular masterpiece like The Witcher 3 or Elden Ring, but I reckon it is likely to be a solid and fun action RPG with a great neo-noir story, at least based on the intriguing premise seen in this demo.</em></p>

<p>Marvel Rivals’ next big event is on the horizon, providing a huge boost to Chrono Tokens earned to help you surge through any owned Battle Passes, and we’ve got all the details.</p>



<p>In the Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm event, weekly missions, challenges, and season missions provide 2x Chrono Tokens when completed, providing up to 2000 extra, a perfect boost to complete the current Battle Pass ahead of the start of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-marvel-rivals-season-4-release-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a>.</p>



<p>As any owned Battle Passes are permanent though, it’s the perfect opportunity to catch up on previous seasons you might not have finished, but be prepared, as the event is only for a limited time.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-marvel-rivals-chrono-storm-event-start">When Does The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event Start?</h2>

<p><strong>The Marvel Rivals Chrono-Storm Event kicks off at 2am PT on August 28, landing just in time for the weekend.</strong></p>



<p>With the start of the event right around the corner, I highly recommend pausing any grinds you have going to complete challenges and saving them for the event start. This way, you can benefit from the bonus Chrono Tokens that will be distributed.</p>



<p>Of course, if you have a long list of challenges to complete, you may as well crack on, as the amount of bonus tokens you can earn is capped at 2000.</p>



<p>Here’s when the Chrono-Storm event begins in time zones across the world.</p>

<p>The games in question are <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/cold_fear">Cold Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/i_am_alive">I Am Alive</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/child_of_eden">Child of Eden</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grow_home">Grow Home</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/grow_up">Grow Up</a>. Notably, none of these have ever seen a release on Nintendo consoles, but with Atari's focus on multi-platform titles in recent years, it's reasonable to assume that some (if not all) may gain new life on the Switch and/or Switch 2.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Atari has expressed its desire to "expand and evolve" all five games, though what this might look like is unclear for the time being.</p>
<p>Child of Eden in particular is a good find for Atari, in our eyes. Originally released in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and PS3, the musical rail-shooter was directed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who has since gone on to achieve remarkable success with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tetris_effect_connected">Tetris Effect</a>, and currently serves as the executive producer for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a>, due for release on the PS5 later this year.</p>
<p>The game also included optional motion controls via Microsoft's Kinect and the PlayStation Move, so we reckon this would translate quite easily to the Switch Joy-Con. Though it is playable with standard controls, of course.</p>
<p>Aside from that, we're also quite fond of Grow Home and Grow Up; two adorable platform titles with minimal, low poly visuals. We're definitely excited to see what Atari can do with these games, and indeed all five titles, in the months and years ahead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like all change for Call of Duty with the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, amid pressure from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> and its commitment to “gritty realism.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty’s foray into goofy skins territory is not a new phenomena, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin"><u>weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</u></a>, some fans have said they’ve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a “gritty realism” aesthetic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj">Developer DICE has indicated it has no plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for</a>, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DBLTAP</a>, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's commitment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg"><u>Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</u></a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Battlefield 6 set to go up against Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 later this year, Activision has now issued a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a> that indicates it’s ready to make significant changes to the types of bundles it releases for the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s perhaps even more significant news here: Activision confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries, and given Black Ops 7 directly follows last year’s Black Ops 6. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7. Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone's Bloke Biter Shark Skin Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What impact will this have on Black Ops 7? It means that at launch, at least, you won’t see all those goofy skins running around Multiplayer. It sounds like Multiplayer will look like Black Ops 7, at least at the start of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where will Activision go from here? Its community post suggests it’s ready to tone down the goofiness for Black Ops 7’s entire lifecycle, although it’s worth pointing out we don’t have specifics here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of Call of Duty,” Activision said. “Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Throughout development, Treyarch and Raven’s north star has been to deliver a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 while taking some big swings. You’ll see it across Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, Zombies, Co-Op Campaign (including Endgame), and even Dead Ops Arcade 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Over the years, we’ve had a variety of games and experiences that fans have enjoyed from the Modern Warfare series to the Black Ops series and beyond. Today, we wanted to share with you some of the ways we’re approaching things with Black Ops 7.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision went on to say that Black Ops 7 bundles and items “will be crafted to fit the Black Ops identity.” “We hear the feedback,” the mega publisher added. “We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core Call of Duty experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If Activision truly leaves goofy skins behind, then it’s leaving a lot of money on the table. The company wouldn’t release Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and Nicki Minaj skins if they didn’t make loads of money. Perhaps, with the release of Battlefield 6, Activision felt it had reached a tipping point, and it needed to take drastic action to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever the case, reaction is a mix of shock, excitement, and frustration. There’s shock that Activision actually canceled carry forward for Black Ops 7, excitement about getting back to Call of Duty’s roots, but for some a frustration that the time and in many cases money spent earning cosmetic items in recent months die with Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a spot of scepticism from some within the Call of Duty community, who suspect Activision may hold the line for Black Ops 7's first few months of life, but eventually retreat into goofy skin territory once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision ended its community update by promising more information on all aspects of Black Ops 7 soon. Battlefield 6 comes out October 10, with Black Ops 7 following in November. It’s going to be really interesting to see how this all shakes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've got plenty more Black Ops 7 coverage coming out of gamescom 2025, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-responds-to-lazy-accusations-and-battlefield-6-lets-all-have-fun">Treyarch shrugging off "lazy" accusations and the threat of Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

A teaser trailer for the film Return to Silent Hill has been revealed, giving us a first proper look at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> adaptation, its version of Pyramid Head, and a release window.
</p>
<p>
Christophe Gans is in the director's chair, following his work on the 2006 Silent Hill film starring Sean Bean. Jeremy Irvine (Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, Treadstone, War Horse) stars as James.
</p>
<p>
Gans previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">film would be a faithful adaptation of Konami's beloved Silent Hill 2</a>. "I am delighted to partner with Cineverse, which has shown a genuine understanding of fanship," said Gans back in May. "Return to Silent Hill is an adaptation created out of deep respect for a true masterpiece of a game, Konami's iconic Silent Hill 2. I hope fans will enjoy and be fulfilled with the experience this new film has to offer."

<p>
The trailer, above, is only 40 seconds long, but it does show a suitably foggy environment, that iconic shot of James looking in the mirror, and of course some scary nurses. Best of all, it ends with a first look at Pyramid Head.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill is set for release in January 2026.
</p>
<p>
It's all part of a resurgence of Konami's horror franchise, following the success last year of Bloober's Silent Hill 2 remake. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> will be released next month - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-producer-insists-it-is-an-action-horror-game-and-any-comparisons-to-a-soulslike-are-disingenuous">no, it's not a Soulslike</a>.

			<p>You would not necessarily think of skiing being a base for a rhythm game, but the team at Buffalo Buffalo have. The studio’s roguelike rhythm game Fresh Tracks takes up to the fictional location Norwyn, where you have been tasked by the Mythic Koda to reunite the rest of the Mythics to defeat Mar, the Mythic of Terror. To do that you need to complete the story songs of the Mythics, and defeat enemies while skiing to the rhythm.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fresh Tracks- Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0Aud7LV_-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fresh Tracks has you skiing to the rhythm of the music, collecting whispers which are notes from the songs and also a currency to buy temporary charms. You also have to avoid the obstacles that crop up, meaning you need to switch from rail to rail, and you have to use your weapon to clear the path of enemies. Along with switching rails, you will also have to lean to avoid objects and hop to clear floor traps and gaps as well.</p>


<p>Each weapon has its own rhythmic power as well, but you start with Vygor which replenishes health when it is charged up. Other weapons are unlocked through completing story songs and getting more lore. Fresh Tracks has a good approach to its lore as it incorporates each of the Mythics into the tale. Mythics will accompany tell you stories of Norwyn, but each of the Mythics has new information for each lore. So, if you want the full picture you need to complete runs with each of the Mythics. Mythics also have their own boons that can help on a run, as well as their own favourite types of song. For example, Koda makes boss battles easier and prefers the more poppy songs. Mythics are only unlocked when you beat them in a boss battle.</p>


<p>As Fresh Tracks is a roguelike, you will be able to choose, the skis, weapon, and Mythic you equip. Skis offer different advantages from granting temporary invulnerability to discounts in the merchants store. Merchants are available during runs to buy temporary charms from, with these adding a bit more life or more charges to your weapon. Charms can also be picked up when you select which track to tackle on your run, but all charms disappear when a run ends. When your run does come to an end you will be sent to the start of the map, but shortcuts do get unlocked after you beat a boss, but these shortcuts are locked to the Mythic you had equipped when you defeated the boss. When you have unlocked a shortcut you will have to decide between taking that or visiting the merchant to get charms, so you may avoid a boss battle but you may also miss out on a charm that could prove to give you an advantage.</p>
<p>Fresh Tracks has original songs composed for it which cover a few genres including pop, dance, rock, rap, and even a bit of theatre. There are some bangers among the 28 tracks with Endlos, Ekkos, and Make Your Mark being my favourites. The first two could be in the charts, they are that catchy. As you go through the story you do not know which songs will be presented to you on the path, apart from the boss battles, and each one of these has a difficulty setting from easy all the way to having to be perfect. Again, on a run you do not know what difficulties you will face, though there are options which will remove either the easy or most difficult track difficulties.</p>

<p>Playing through Fresh Tracks is like playing through a story concept album, as the lyrics to the songs also link to the lore. The visuals of Fresh Tracks are decent with some levels looking fantastic, like Stille Mountain and The Kor. I did enjoy the voice acting too and the way each of the Mythics had their distinct styles while telling the stories that make up the lore, as well as each having their own music preferences.</p>
<p>While I do enjoy the music, some tracks show up a lot and that means the game can feel repetitive as the same levels keep appearing on runs. I’m sorry, but The Blizzard did start to wear out its welcome after a while. There also seemed to be some minor input delay on rare occasions, but it didn’t show up often.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Fresh Tracks gives a fresh take on the rhythm genre and I really the story set up and some of the songs, which are legit great pieces of music that could be released as singles. It is a game that will attract those who want to perfect runs, and the challenge it provides is tough but worth the entertainment.	</p></div>

Those loaded up on the game's Season Pass and DLC will see the likes of Steve and Alex from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, SpongeBob SquarePants and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/persona_5_royal">Persona 5</a>'s Joker all heading to the track, but none of them will be able to utter a word. It's a strange omission, but Takashi Iizuka has been on hand to explain why all the wider characters are keeping quiet.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/iizuka-explains-how-sonic-racing-crossworlds-dlc-guest-characters-were-chosen-and-why-they-dont-have-voices/">Destructoid</a>, the Sonic Team head explained that there's already a lot of interaction between the racers, so asking the wider studios to <em>also</em> add voice lines for each character would have expanded "the scope of the review that we’ll have to ask the external companies," and potentially made things "difficult" in the process.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jwnvyp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>On top of that, Iizuka claimed that the development team was keen to focus their attention on the Sonic characters first and foremost, ensuring that the interactions between them were nailed down before worrying about the wider cast. "They really had to focus, put all the effort into Sonic," he explained, "and they had to give up on the non-Sonic characters".</p>
<p>Now sure, we won't be all that torn up about not hearing dialogue from PAC-MAN and a Minecraft Creeper, but don't you think it'll look a <em>little</em> weird to have the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza</a>'s Kasuga Ichiban silent for the whole race? We'll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p>SEGA is kicking off a CrossWorlds <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-sonic-racing-crossworlds-open-network-test-for-switch-announced">Open Network Test</a> on Switch later this week (from 29th August - 1st September), and pre-loads are now live. This'll be your last chance to check the game out before it launches on 25th September, with nine courses and seven different CrossWorlds at your pre-release disposal. Let's hope that our screams of excitement are loud enough to drown out the uncanny silence from select racers.</p>

Here's what we know about the bug and how to avoid it.</p><p>The bug has been detailed under known issues in Helldivers 2's Discord, and concerns the ODST MA5C Assault Rifle. "When on the bridge, if all players equip this weapon from the armory and then the host leaves it will cause your game to crash," the bug report reads. The crash is currently impacting players on all platforms, and Arrowhead is investigating a fix.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST - Legendary Warbond Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For now, thankfully the crash is not too difficult to get around. To avoid any possibility of this crash ocurring, Arrowhead recommends equipping the ODST from the loadout instead of the armory.</p><p>The studio has also notified of another issue impacting Warbonds--Helldivers 2's equivalent of a battle pass. Arrowhead has warned that players may be unable to spend Super Credits while they are holding onto a Warbond Token. Until the issue is resolved, players will have to choose between saving their Warbond Token for a future Premium Warbond and holding off on purchases, or using it on a current Warbond they don't own yet and spending Super Credits as usual.</p><p>The Halo: ODST Warbond was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">Helldivers 2's first "Legendary Warbond,"</a> rewarding players with more items than a standard one--including four weapons, two armor sets, and plenty more. The Halo crossover dropped on the same day as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">Helldivers 2's Xbox launch</a>, a combination that has brought a lot of new and returning players to the game.</p>

                <p> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>'s next update The Third Edict is set to add a whole new act, region, and plenty of other new content to the game--but it's the new asynchronous trading system that really has players excited. Grinding Gear Games has shown off the system's new in-game market browser, just days out from the update drop.</p><p>GGG explains in the video that the in-game trade browser wasn't quite ready to be shown off when the studio did its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">initial content drop</a> for The Third Edict, but it's now ready to go. The in-game market browser works similarly to PoE 2's official trade website, allowing players to search for items they want in the player-to-player trade system. The new asynchronous trade system means the seller no longer has to be online for a trade to take place--buyers can now purchase it directly from the seller's Hideout.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q972GGaOMBM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q972GGaOMBM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The seemingly simple feature brings a major quality-of-life improvement for PoE 2 players, simplifying what was previously a fairly involved, multi-step process into an easier task. The asynchronous trade system is set to come to the original Path of Exile in future too, provided its integration into PoE 2 goes smoothly.</p><p>As a whole, The Third Edict update is full of quality-of-life changes, with the GGG devs setting out to take "a good crack at solving every problem people are currently unhappy about," as game director Johnathan Rogers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">said in a Q&amp;A</a>. The update also includes the addition of Act IV, new endgame content, a sprint ability, PoE 2's first league, and heaps more.</p><p>Despite the massive update, Path of Exile 2 doesn't seem likely to leave early access--or subsequently going free-to-play--anytime soon. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-leave-early-access-in-2025-dont-believe-thats-possible-anymore/1100-6534129/" data-ref-id="1100-6534129">developers have said</a> it doesn't look possible for PoE 2 to get to a full release in 2025, and how long it remains in early access after that it will depend on the state of the game.</p><p>The Third Edict <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2s-next-major-content-update-the-third-edict-gets-release-date-and-twitch-drops/1100-6533991/" data-ref-id="1100-6533991">releases on August 29</a>, and PoE 2 will have a free access weekend from August 29 to September 1 along with the update's launch.</p>

                <p>In case you needed any more confirmation that Criterion is now all in on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield</a>, the Burnout creator and long-time Need For Speed custodian is now officially branded as "A Battlefield Studio"--leaving the future of the Need For Speed franchise in question.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/burnout-creator-need-for-speed-developer-criterion-renamed-battlefield-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a user from the Need For Speed subreddit spotted Criterion's new official subtitle on EA's website, where "A Battlefield Studio" now appears under the usual studio logo. Members of the subreddit are understandably not too optimistic about what the change means for the Need For Speed franchise, which is still ostensibly under Criterion's purview.</p><p>The rebranding is really just confirming what we already knew--in February this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-isnt-dead-but-criterion-is-focused-on-road-ahead-with-battlefield/1100-6529198/" data-ref-id="1100-6529198">EA announced</a> that Criterion was being moved under the Battlefield Studios banner in order to support the single-player experience for Battlefield 6. At the same time, it was announced that development on the next Need For Speed title was being paused--though EA has promised that the franchise is not dead.</p><p>Criterion has worked on Need for Speed titles since 2010's Hot Pursuit, and has been the main developer on the series since 2020, when control was shifted back from Ghost Games. The studio released Need for Speed Unbound in 2022, but in subsequent years a majority of the staff were assigned to support the Battlefield series following restructuring within EA.</p><p>While EA has said that it plans to bring the Need for Speed franchise back in the future, it's unclear whether future games will still be developed by Criterion, now that it's been designated under Battlefield Studios. It's no surprise that Battlefield 6 is the focus of EA's attention at present, with the much-hyped shooter due to release on October 10, 2025.</p>

            <p>
If you were hoping for more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> - and wondered why it has such a long name - director Guillaume Broche has said the game is "not the end" of the series.
</p>
<p>
Broche spoke with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4&amp;t=321s">MrMattyPlays</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-teases-potential-sequel-dlc/">TheGamer</a>) about what's next for studio Sandfall Interactive.
</p>
<p>
"Clair Obscur is the franchise name," said Broche. "Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise. Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise."
</p>

<p>
A new game will be on the way, then, though likely not a direct sequel. Broche stated later in the interview he prefers to forget previous work when he "writes sequels".
</p>
<p>
And, as has been noted in previous interviews, Broche was heavily influenced by the Final Fantasy series. So if Clair Obscur is the franchise name, it's likely whatever is next will be completely different to Expedition 33 - just like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s series. 
</p>
<p>
But will it still feature the fantastic turn-based action combat? It's certainly proven popular, so let's hope so!
</p>
<p>
Previously the studio stated it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-exploring-new-content-accessibility-features-and-all-sorts-of-bits-and-bobs-for-future-game-updates">exploring new content and accessibility features</a>, as well as "all sorts of bits and bobs". Further, Broche noted a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-on-switch-2-could-be-interesting-says-director">Switch 2 version of the game</a> "could be interesting". So there's likely more to come from Sandfall besides a possible sequel.

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> publisher Paradox look like they might be sticking a stake in their rather unpopular plans to sell two of the game's vampire clans as paid day-one DLC. I say "might be" because nothing specific's been committed to yet, beyond some nebulous making of "adjustments ahead of launch" in response to fan feedback on the gating-off of Lasombra and Toreador bloodsuckers.</p>
<p>In case you missed the announcement of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sticks-two-bloodsucker-clans-including-the-sexy-one-behind-paid-day-one-dlc">these two clans being packed away</a> into the £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 coffin of Bloodlines' Shadows and Silk DLC pack, it came right as the long-in-the-works RPG got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">fresh trailer and what should hopefully be its final release date</a>. The only ways to get the clans were to buy that pack on top of the base game, or splash out £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 for the premium edition.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/554580174864384001/1115895131573342279/1410005970746347633">Bloodlines 2 Discord</a> last night, World of Darkness community developer DebbieElla emerged from the shadows with what looks like the first inkling of an impending change. "We are listening to your feedback about the Lasombra and Toreador clan access, and we’re making adjustments ahead of launch to reflect this," she wrote. "We will share more information about what this means as soon as possible."</p>
<p>That was it, aside from a line promoting a livestream on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/worldofdarkness">World of Darkness' Twitch channel</a> at 4PM BST / 5PM CEST / 11AM ET today, August 27th, which I only mention here in case it turns out to be the place Paradox share that promised info.</p>

</figure>
<p>Up to this announcement, Paradox and Bloodlines developers The Chinese Room had been sticking by the call to paywall the two clans. Our James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">grilled them about it at Gamescom</a>, and the response was along the lines of the Toreador and Lasombra being additional work on top of The Chinese Room's original plans for the game, so therefore fine to charge extra for.</p><p>"We've made a huge amount of changes over that time, based on that cycle, if you like, including a massive amount of story content and features and all the rest of it. So we have been expanding it from where we originally planned to land it, I think, constantly, and Paradox have been really good when we go, or when the clients go, or when Paradox go: 'We should add a bit more here. Let's push the date back.' As you know, the date has pushed back, but that has been to fatten it out into something that we feel does land where the players want it," Bloodlines 2 narrative director Ian Thomas told us.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, project design director Jey Hicks insisted that this 'extra' stuff is "not all, like, just fluff that we're chucking in". We'll have to see what these promised "adjustments" look like, but a complete u-turn would rightly miff folks who've already pre-ordered the premium edition because it includes these extra clans. We'll let you know when Paradox reveal exactly how they're pulling their feet out of all this deathhound doo-doo.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has announced the dates and locations for its next round of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Fan Fest events, suggesting the next expansion is still a long way off.
</p>
<p>
Typically, three events are held every couple of years across America, Europe, and Japan ahead of each new expansion, detailing future updates to the MMORPG.
</p>
<p>
Now we know the first of this next wave will be in California in April 2026, followed by Berlin in July 2026, and then Tokyo in October 2026. The announcement was made alongside a special video to celebrate the 12th anniversary of the game.

<p>
So what does this mean for players?
</p>
<p>
New expansions usually release a few months after the Japanese Fan Fest event, meaning the follow-up to Dawntrail will likely be released in early 2027 if following the same pattern (or even midway through the year, as was standard before Endwalker).
</p><p>
That would put 8.0 three years behind 7.0 (Dawntrail), the longest break yet between expansions. With Patch 7.3 for Final Fantasy 14 just recently released, and typically five patches (and some smaller ones) between expansions, that means there's just two major patches to last until 2027.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We're thrilled to announce the dates and locations for FFXIV Fan Festival 2026!</p><p>📍 Anaheim, California - Apr. 24-25, 2026<br>📍 Berlin, Germany - Jul. 25-26, 2026<br>📍 Tokyo, Japan – Oct. 31-Nov. 1, 2026</p><p>Stay tuned for more info! ✨ <a href="https://t.co/mvj1VAutMN">pic.twitter.com/mvj1VAutMN</a></p></div>— FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1960600668877807896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
So why the longer development cycle this time?
</p>
<p>
Firstly, Dawntrail brought a graphical overhaul to the game to modernise it after over a decade since launch. As such, updates and expansions are likely more complex now.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, added to that complexity, is Square Enix's multiplatform strategy - Final Fantasy 14 is now available on Xbox as well as PlayStation and PC, with a simultaneous launch of the next expansion likely.
</p>
<p>
What's more, director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> recently hinted to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">VGC</a> a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> version could be in the works - not only would developing this take time and resources away from the next expansion, it would add yet another platform to that simultaneous launch.
</p><p>
A further caveat is the future of the PS4 version of the game. Yoshida recently told <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">Feed4Gamers</a> the team is reaching the limit of data for the PS4's OS, meaning Square Enix could follow the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and PUBG by ending service for the older console.
</p>
<p>
Lastly there's Yoshida himself, who has increasingly been working on other projects within Square Enix. Final Fantasy 16, of course, was released back in 2023 but recently launched on PC and Xbox, but he was also co-producer on last year's Fantasian: Neo Dimension. There's also the forthcoming Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles being developed by CBU 3 within Square Enix, the development team headed up by Yoshida.

<p>
Until the next Fan Fest events, we'll receive patches 7.4 and 7.5, which will move the narrative on towards the next big story arc and the next expansion. Yoshida told Feed4Gamers there won't yet be a new character introduced in these patches as with Wuk Lamat for Dawntrail - that character proved unpopular with some fans.
</p>
<p>Still, there's always the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-are-collaborating">Monster Hunter Wilds collaboration</a>, right?</p>
<p>
The long wait for the next expansion is worrisome for fans, especially as player numbers in Final Fantasy 14 are reportedly dropping. There are still over 30 million registered accounts for the game, but anecdotally players are moving elsewhere. Ironically, the MMORPG's popularity grew in the wake of players moving from World of Warcraft, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-cool-world-of-warcraft-stuff-not-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live">Wow's new expansion and housing update on the way</a>, perhaps the waters will flow in the opposite direction.
</p><p>
I was lucky enough to attend both the Las Vegas and London Fan Fest events back in 2023 ahead of Dawntrail's release. As a first-timer, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-fan-fest-is-a-theme-park-for-its-passionate-community">Las Vegas Fan Fest event was particularly special</a>. Still, at the very least, the move to Anaheim California next year is great news for anyone looking to avoid the scorching Nevada summer heat.

<p>Will focus on expanding Nintendo movie adaptations into other mediums</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Stars" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6ef5aeb870d8/nintendo-stars.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250827.html">has announced</a> that it is renaming its subsidiary company 'Warpstar Inc.' to 'Nintendo Stars Inc.' following its consolidation earlier this year.</p>
<p>Warpstar Inc. – founded on 31st July 2001 – had previously been a joint venture between Nintendo and Hal Laboratory to oversee the <strong>Kirby</strong> franchise, expanding it into other mediums such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby:_Right_Back_at_Ya!">Kirby: Right Back at Ya!</a> anime series back in 2001. It became an official subsidiary of Nintendo on <strong>1st April 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>As for its function going forward, Nintendo Stars will be responsible for "the ancillary-use business tied to films that feature Nintendo Intellectual Property". In simpler words, then, it'll focus on the expansion of movie adaptations into other ventures, such as events, merchandise, licensing – that sort of thing.</p>
<p>We know, of course, that Nintendo has two upcoming movie projects in the works: the 2026 sequel to T<strong>he Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>, and the 2027 live-action adaptation of <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>. The company recently provided our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-announces-first-cast-members-for-the-legend-of-zelda-movie">first glimpse at the cast for the Zelda movie</a>, with Bo Baragson playing the role of Zelda, and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth playing the role of Link.</p>
<p>Nintendo Stars will also continue its work in the expansion of the Kirby franchise into other mediums. The subsidiary has literal decades of experience at this point, so Nintendo is keen to utilise its expertise, aiming to "strengthen the relationship between Nintendo and its customers".</p>
<p>Our opinion? 'Nintendo Stars' doesn't have quite the same ring as 'Warpstar', but hey, we'll take it.</p>

            <p>EA has finally revealed an early access release date for Skate. The much-anticipated skateboarding game will be releasing on 16th September, for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
<p>Skate will be free-to-play with cross progression and cross platform play, with paid cosmetics able to be snagged by those willing to fork out some cash for outfits and the like. The early access version will launch with four neighbourhoods to explore. The game is also fully open world and always online, so you and other skaters will be rolling around completing challenges and inevitably falling over together.</p>
<p>As for post-launch support, the game will be receiving seasonal updates which will feature "fresh challenges, cosmetics, music, world updates, and new events".</p>

<p>With this reveal, there's still no words on the release date for the iOS and Android version of the game. But at least we'll all finally be able to try out Skate ourselves after months of info drops and little teases. The game has been playable behind the scenes as part of closed tests, but for the average person it's remained a mystery.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/itsuno-left-capcom-didnt-want-make-dmc-dd-sequels/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/itsuno-left-capcom-because-he-didn%E2%80%99t-want-to-make-dmc-and-dd-sequels-until-retirement.1281468/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, news <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-brings-several-ex-capcom-developers-to-lightspeed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke</a> that Hideaki Itsuno had recruited several fellow former CAPCOM developers to his new LightSpeed Japan Studio, which is also opening a new office in Osaka in addition to the existing one in Tokyo.</p>



<p>Now, through <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-director-hideaki-itsuno-explains-why-he-left-capcom-and-whats-next/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, Itsuno has finally explained why he decided to leave CAPCOM around a year ago. As it turns out, it was mainly because the Japanese publisher would have put him on more Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma sequels, while the game designer wanted to do something new before he retires.</p>



<p><em>For me, based on my age, this is my last chance. The gaming industry has decreased the number of AAA releases, and I was asked to create a new AAA by Lightspeed. I’m not young anymore, so more than “now it’s the right moment,” it’s more like, “this is my last chance” to challenge myself. For Capcom, creating Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma sequels is always going to be the top priority, and keeping in mind that making a game takes 4 to 5 years, this might be my last big opportunity.</em></p>



<p><em>Before you realized you are working on making the Devil May Cry 6 or 7. It’s not like I don’t want to make them, I do, but it’s hard to balance the time it takes with the personal satisfaction of making them, and with Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon’s Dogma 2, I already did what I wanted to make.</em></p>



<p>It's definitely an understandable sentiment. Itsuno is certainly not the only veteran developer who recently decided to leave a big triple-A studio to work on something else of his own creation.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the developer says he is satisfied with how Dragon's Dogma 2 turned out (though personally, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I'd have to disagree on that</a>), and that he got more inspired by games like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle than other action games after the release of Devil May Cry 5.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-sets-new-record-for-concurrent-users-on-a-gaming-platform-beating-even-steam.1281462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last Saturday, around 8 AM Pacific Time, Roblox <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bloxy.news/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered</a> a new record for concurrent users on a gaming platform: 47.3 million users were online on August 23. That's 6.1 million concurrent users more than the peak registered by Valve's Steam platform in March: 41.2 million concurrent users. Earlier that month, Steam had <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-breaks-40-million-online-users-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the 40 million concurrent users milestone</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox's new peak is a massive jump compared to its previous record of 32.7 million users, which was set on another Saturday, July 19. Setting two records in the span of a month shows that the platform continues to grow nearly nineteen years after its original debut, which took place on September 1, 2006.</p>



<p>The game creation platform currently has two dominators: Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot. Together, they accounted for over 37 million of those concurrent users, meaning that more than 77% of the userbase was playing one of those games. Grow a Garden was the leader, with a peak of 22 million concurrent players, also a record for the highest concurrent peak ever recorded in a single game.</p>



<p>Originally developed by a sixteen-year-old player known only as BMWLux, Grow a Garden subsequently saw Splitting Point Studios and Do Big Studios purchasing shares and participating in its development. It's essentially an idle farming simulator where players start with a small plot of land and watch their plants grow into lovely flowers, fruits, and vegetables. Players can harvest and sell their produce to earn Sheckles, which can be used to purchase seeds, gear, eggs, and decorative items. They can also complete quests and participate in seasonal events to earn free seeds, gear, pets, and decorative items.</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot also attracts many players to Roblox, with an estimated peak of 15 million concurrent players. This game was made by a user known as SpyderSammy, in partnership with another user known as do_small and developer Do Big Studios. It is described as a sort of tycoon experience where the goal of the game is to steal Brainrots from other players to earn money, which can be used to buy more Brainrots. However, others will try to steal yours, so you must defend them.</p>



<p>As a reminder, a couple of weeks ago, the state of Louisiana <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed</a> a lawsuit against Roblox Corporation, alleging that it is a breeding ground for sex predators and that its owners do not employ sufficient safety protocols to protect children.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-already-beaten-battlefield-6-analyst/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-has-already-beaten-battlefield-6-and-it%E2%80%99s-because-of-%E2%80%98autopilot-purchasing%E2%80%99-analyst-says.1281459/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite comments suggesting that Battlefield 6 will ‘boot stomp’ Call of Duty this year, many believe the impending conflict between Black Ops 7 and EA’s new Battlefield title has already been decided. In a recent report published as part of the Alinea Analytics newsletter, it was suggested that Black Ops 7 will outsell Battlefield because of consumer habits and nothing more.</p>



<p>The report spoke of ‘autopilot purchasing’, with Call of Duty fans buying the new release year in, year out, even if they’re displeased with the offering. That’s why Battlefield 6 won’t ‘win’ this year.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-battlefield-6-beat-call-of-duty">Can Battlefield 6 Beat Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The recent <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-has-already-sold-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Insight newsletter</a> discussed whether Battlefield 6 could stand firm as a ‘COD killer’, a term that has been lobbied a lot in recent years. Once upon a time, XDefiant was poised as a COD killer, and we all know how that went…</p>



<p>Alinea’s expert analysts pulled a number out of the hat, revealing that 60% of beta-based wishlisters of Battlefield 6 have played a Call of Duty game on Steam, which is a damning enough number right out the gate. The team admitted that Battlefield 6 could do better than any other game in franchise history, but it still won’t be enough to topple Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Rhys Elliott of Alinea put it perfectly in the report:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>COD<strong>&nbsp;is still dominant despite all this</strong>. Its core audience still loves the game and buys it every damn year. And that isn’t going to change just because&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>&nbsp;is rad and tracking incredibly well.</p>



<p>For many gamers,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is an annual ritual. Tens of millions of players, many of them casual gamers, buy the newest&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>&nbsp;every year without hesitation. This “autopilot purchasing” habit is decades deep, and breaking it requires more than one awesome&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>&nbsp;release.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elliott went on to explain ‘that&nbsp;<strong>players will buy it even if they complain about it</strong>.’ It also doesn’t help Battlefield’s situation that Black Ops 7 is guaranteed to be a day-one title on the Xbox Game Pass subscription service. When Black Ops 6 was released on Game Pass last year, it was the single biggest day for new subscriptions on the platform.</p>



<p>I’m of the standpoint that Battlefield 6 <strong>doesn’t need to beat Black Ops 7. </strong>I’m more than comfortable with both games existing alongside each other, and even Battlefield’s developers stressed the same thing. They serve unique demographics in a few ways, and I’ll play both and make my mind up later as to which I prefer.</p>

<p>It was recently announced that Atari has formed a strategic IP agreement with Ubisoft to revitalize <strong>five forgotten games</strong>. The deal was inked recently, and it was confirmed that Atari will re-release these games under the new publishing arm that the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atari-revive-infogrames/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought back to life</a> in April 2024.</p>



<p>The five games now owned by Atari will likely provide a nostalgia hit for Ubisoft fans.</p>

<p>I’m particularly excited about I Am Alive, a 2012 blink-and-you’ll-miss-it post-apocalyptic survival game pieced together primarily by Ubisoft Shanghai and Darkworks, a studio that also worked on Cold Fear, which sadly closed its doors in 2011.</p>



<p>I Am Alive wasn’t an award-winning game by any means, but it offered players a perspective of a shattered world with a moral lens overlay. It took a whopping seven years to develop the game, and when it was done, it offered just a few hours of gameplay on a digital-only release.</p>



<p>I’ve always been eager for a follow-up to I Am Alive, which I feel is a criminally underrated game. Here’s a trailer for the title:</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250826081788/en/Atari-Announces-Strategic-IP-Agreement-With-Ubisoft-To-Revive-Five-Acclaimed-Titles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement</a> on the new IP deal, Ubisoft’s Deborah Papiernik, VP of New Business, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Millions of players have experienced these worlds over the years, and this will open the door for long time players to revisit those memories while inviting new audiences to discover them for the first time.</p>



<p>Atari has a rich gaming legacy and deep appreciation for these classic titles, we’re excited to see how they’ll evolve and connect with players in fresh, meaningful ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Echoing the sentiment was Wade Rosen, CEO of Atari:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft and Atari both have a legacy of crafting worlds that players can fall in love with — games that resonate with generations of players not just for how they played, but for how they made us feel.</p>



<p>We’re excited to reintroduce these titles while also exploring ways to expand and evolve these franchises.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>80 is the new 50</p>

<p>Niantic's popular augmented reality mobile game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a> will be getting an update in October, raising the level cap from 50 to 80.</p>
<p>This update will drop on <strong>15th October 2025</strong> and will apparently make the levelling journey "more fun and engaging" by adding new rewards, new cosmetics, and more for each levelling milestone. This update will also see players "jump in level based on their total earned XP". Niantic further states how "no player will go down in level".</p>
<p>Apart from this, there's also going to be a special limited-time update with XP bonuses and Timed Research taking place.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2sj2iQyBTQs" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2sj2iQyBTQs?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed390852xkuvtw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sj2iQyBTQs" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<hr>
<p>Below is a breakdown of everything trainers can expect (via the official Pokémon GO game site):</p>
<ul>
<li>The level cap will increase from level 50 to level 80. The overall leveling curve from level 1 to 80 will be rebalanced, and players can earn levels more frequently.</li>
<li>Tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 to 50 will be removed.</li>
<li>New Level-Up Research tasks will be added to levels 71 to 80.</li>
<li>Players at level 70 and higher have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players.</li>
<li>New rewards will be added to level-up progression, like increased storage capacity for Pokémon, items, and Gifts. This includes new avatar items starting at level 25!</li>
<li>Based on previously earned experience, some players may automatically jump in level on October 15. Those players will receive rewards associated with reaching those levels at that time. Details about which players will jump in level, and by how many levels, will be shared later.</li>
<li>No players will go down in level, but the amount of XP needed to reach the next level may change depending on your current level. Stay tuned for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also earn the following rewards <em>before</em> 15th October 2025. These items will not be available for levelling up after this date. This also applies to the Level 50 Jacket.</p>
<figure><a title="Pokemon GO" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0c16bcf699db4/pokemon-go.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And here's the rundown about the XP Celebration event (including the bonuses). This event runs from now until 14th October 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li>2× Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent Throws</li>
<li>+3,000 XP from winning raids</li>
<li>+3,000 XP from winning Max Battles</li>
</ul>
<p>Timed Research will also be available to trainers who are Level 5 and above, with the chance to earn over 7 million XP. A level 47 Level-Up Research task is also being adjusted, so instead of requiring trainers to "explore 25km in a week eight times", you'll now only have to do it twice.</p>
<hr>
<p>This follows the recent arrival of Eternatus and the introduction of Max Battles.

</section></header><section>

<p>At the end of July, Nintendo released an update for the Switch Online Super Nintendo app adding <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/mario_paint">Mario Paint</a>.</p>
<p>This update included mouse support (for Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 controllers and USB mouse compatibility), as well as the ability to remap buttons. The same update also featured mouse support for the existing releases <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/nobunagas_ambition">Nobunaga's Ambition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario Super Picross</a>.</p>
<p>In case you missed this news at the time, Nintendo has now released an official trailer in English highlighting these new features. You can see everything in motion across games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and Mario Paint. Apart from this, this update also apparently improved the SNES app's CRT filter.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the Switch 2, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/surprise-the-n64-app-is-also-getting-some-enhancements-on-switch-2">updated the N64 app</a> as well with additional features like a rewind ability and a new CRT filter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA Sports is back with NHL 26, the latest installment of the long-running hockey franchise. As with any new release, NHL 26 features a number of trophies and achievements to unlock for all of the completionist who’ll boot up the game. </p>



<p>When it comes to sports games, earning achievements is a bit different than story-focused titles. These games reward you for winning games and championships, completing tasks in various game modes, scoring certain types of goals, and more.  </p>



<p>So, without any more delay, let’s get into everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-nhl-26-trophy-and-achievement">How To Get Every NHL 26 Trophy And Achievement</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In total, there are 49 trophies and achievements to earn in NHL 26. The challenges range from winning a Champions Hockey League trophy in Be A Pro to simply assigning a scout to the CHL in Franchise mode. If you want to 100% the game, you’ll have to play every mode in the game, including online modes like World of Chel and Hockey Ultimate Team.</p>



<p>You can check out all of the trophies and how to earn them below courtesy of <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/36114-nhl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-nhl-26-secret-trophies">NHL 26 Secret Trophies</h2>



<p>Unlike fellow EA Sports title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-madden-26-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>, NHL 26 has no secret trophies to unlock this year. All 49 of the achievements can be seen when you load up the game on Xbox Series X|S or PlayStation 5.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-and-trophies-are-in-nhl-26">How Many Achievements And Trophies Are In NHL 26?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 49 trophies and achievements to unlock in NHL 26.</strong></p>



<p>Looking further shows that there are 34 bronze trophies, 12 silver, two gold, and one platinum trophy to unlock. Compared to NHL 25, there are two less total trophies and achievements this time around. There are four less bronze trophies, but two more silver.</p>



<p>As far as unlocking them is concerned, they are all pretty straight forward. Most can be done in various single-player modes. Others, however, require you to play online against other players such as winning a Ones Eliminator Tournament in the World of Chel.</p>
