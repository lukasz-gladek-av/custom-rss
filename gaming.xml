			<p>Crowbar Collective, the studio behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-black-mesa-version-1-0-launch-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Mesa</a> (the fan-made remake of Half-Life), has announced a new cooperative first-person shooter game for PC called Rogue Point. It will be published by Team17, whose General Manager Ann Hurley said in the press release:</p>
<p><em>Team17 has had amazing success in the shooter genre and we’re delighted to offer another incredible title in that space by teaming up with first-person shooter veterans Crowbar Collective. We’ve seen the high quality they brought to Black Mesa and together we know Rogue Point will take things to the next level.</em></p>
<p>Crowbar Collective CEO and project lead Adam Engels stated:</p>
<p><em>We’re very excited to share that we have partnered with Team for our upcoming co-op shooter, Rogue Point. We cannot wait to go in depth about the game, and everything we learned while creating a new [intellectual property] (as well as turning Crowbar Collective into a full time development studio). We can’t thank Team 17 enough for their support and expertise. Just like Black Mesa, we want to heavily involve the community in our development and updates. Our community was critical in the Early Access of Black Mesa and having Team 17 as a partner for Rogue Point helps us focus on development and community feedback!</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Point | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFQvOaxl6lk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game will debut <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> in 2025, where it will stay for about a year, according to Crowbar Collective's estimates. Here's an overview of Rogue Point straight from the store page:</p>
<h2><em>Campaign</em></h2>
<p><em>Dive into the heat of battle in our campaign, where high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning. Team up, gather intel, and launch assaults against top-tier mercenaries. Face off against the formidable 5 Star Merc, the pinnacle of MERX lethal contractors. Brace for tough, unyielding enemies and relentless action that will push your skills, gear, and teamwork to the extreme.</em></p>
<h2><em>Relentless Replayability</em></h2>
<p><em>Fight and maneuver your way through missions spread across 4 diverse locations:</em></p>
<p><em>● The Airport</em></p>
<p><em>● The Mall</em></p>
<p><em>● The Office</em></p>
<p><em>● The Oilrig</em></p>
<p><em>Each sprawling map is reshaped by the game's Parametric Design System, offering new strategies and challenges with every play. The constantly evolving gameplay ensures every mission feels as thrilling and unique as your first, keeping the excitement alive in every campaign.</em></p>
<h2><em>AI Classes</em></h2>
<p><em>In Rogue Point, your enemy is MERX. These mercenaries for hire will challenge your team to strategize and work tactically. Each MERX class has their own AI playstyle that to pack a punch in their own unique way.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Soldier</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Your basic grunt class. They carry pistols &amp; assault rifles, throw grenades, and work in a squad. You’ll encounter these a lot in Rogue Point, but they are never to be underestimated.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Berserker</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Juiced up on substances and with no regard for their own life, the Berserker's singular goal is to close the distance and slice your whole team with a machete. They are agents of chaos and will wreck your carefully crafted game plan.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sniper</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Heavily fortified in the far distance, snipers will pin your team down and deny you entry into important areas. Their only tell is the laser beam from their gun, and your teammate’s head exploding next to you.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Heavy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Heavies are big, slow brutes that don’t take cover and eat bullets. You can dump all your ammo into them with no effect. Run the other way, or find their one weakness.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>5-Star Mercenary</strong></em></p>
<p><em>These legendary MERX commanders have received the top star rating in the app. Intel on these is sketchy, but we know that these endgame encounters will require your team’s full strength to have a chance to take them down. If you succeed, take a trophy from their body as proof you have triumphed.</em></p>
<h2><em>Intuitive Gameplay</em></h2>
<p><em>Rogue Point is perfect for both fresh recruits and seasoned veterans, presenting an accessible entry point that reveals layers of depth for those who seek a challenge. Crave fast-paced action or deep, skill-driven gameplay? Rogue Point kicks down the door to a world of relentless, gripping excitement.</em></p>
<h2><em>Economy</em></h2>
<p><em>Earn your keep on the frontlines, then purchase new hardware for your arsenal. Deck out your loadout with hi-tech attachments, and plenty of tactical equipment to make infiltration and extraction a breeze. Master the currency of combat. Own the battlefield on your terms.</em></p>
<h2><em>Build Your Team</em></h2>
<p><em>Work as a team to overcome the odds. Rogue Point is purpose-built to reinforce teamplay and pull players into the combat. You have to adapt, overcome, fight, and manoeuvre with your squad to win. Start with nothing more than a pistol and an armoured vest and earn an elite arsenal through successful missions and strategic team play.</em></p>
<h2><em>Risk VS Reward</em></h2>
<p><em>Rogue Point has teams taking risks not just on mission, but in the planning and loadout stages as well. Use the game's Dead Drop for a chance at getting the best gear, and specialized weapons you cannot get anywhere else.</em></p>
<h2><em>Weapons and Customization</em></h2>
<p><em>Complete missions to earn money and buy useful weapons and gear. Get the exact loadout you want or take a chance with a Dead Drop package to get gear.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>20+ Weapons with multiple skins</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>40+ Tactical Items and Attachments for your arsenal</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>60+ Cosmetic Items with multiple skins</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>24 Mission Layouts across 4 locations</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Endgame</em></h2>
<p><em>Campaign seems too easy? Well, put that to the test as you take on the ultra-hard Endgame Mission - a daunting challenge with tougher enemies and relentless action, pushing your team, your gear and your tactics to the limit! Put the exclamation point on your campaign</em>!</p>

The 55-inch is down to just $798, while the 65-inch is only $998.</p><p>These are the lowest prices ever for LG's B3 Series OLED TVs--and the best deals we've seen on OLED TVs in general all year. As such, we wouldn't be surprised if these offers sold out today. If you want one of them, you may want to forgo the gamble and spend $49 on a Walmart+ subscription. Even for the extra $49, these deals are awesome.</p><p>The 55-inch carried a retail price of $1,700, and the 65-inch was $2,400 when the B3 Series launched last year. Since these are last year's model, those prices are no longer representative of the normal going rate today. The 55-inch dropped down to $1,199 before it sold out at most retailers, while the 65-inch was $1,299 before going out of stock at other retailers.</p></div>                      </div><p>Aside from 10 inches of extra screen real estate on the 65-inch model, these TVs share the same specs. This includes an OLED display, 4K resolution, webOS smart TV platform, and impressive 120Hz refresh rates. They also support Alexa, Apple HomeKit, and Google Assistant. The B3 comes with LG's Magic Remote, a very nice remote with conventional inputs as well as motion and voice controls.</p><p>Both TVs use the α7 AI Processor Gen6, allowing them to automatically improve picture quality depending on what you’re watching. They’re good for gaming too, with a 0.1ms response time, Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, and VRR to reduce tearing. And if you have several consoles in your entertainment center, you'll be happy to know these TVs have four HDMI ports. Notably, two of the ports are HDMI 2.1, which helps you take full advantage of the graphical power of the PS5 and Xbox Series X.</p><p>As mentioned, these LG OLED Smart TVs launched last year and have since been replaced by the B4 Series. Still, they offer remarkable value at these new low prices. If you want the latest release, however, you’ll find the LG Class B4 Series available with discounts at <a href="https://howl.link/jk8cirxi2hh1j?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17313461828244?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/build-shadow-the-hedgehogs-head-out-of-720-lego-bricks-for-only-56/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/king-boos-haunted-mansion-lego-mario-set-gets-first-price-cut-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">King Boo's Haunted Mansion Lego Mario Set Gets First Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>   </ul> </div>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> is returning to the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/" data-ref-id="5000-355766">Overwatch's</a> 6v6 format (and all of its original character abilities and maps) for a limited-time in an upcoming event mode Blizzard is calling Overwatch: Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It is basically as the name implies; from November 12 to December 2, Overwatch 1 will essentially be playable inside Overwatch 2. That means the mode will only feature the game's original roster of 21 heroes and their original abilities, on modes and maps from Overwatch 1. It also means that, at least for the first few days of the event, "there will be no hero limits and no role limits," as was the case when Overwatch first launched. After those first few days, a single hero rule per team will be enforced for the remainder of Overwatch: Classic, according to Blizzard's announcement <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBj4SCL4PNo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kBj4SCL4PNo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As Blizzard describes it, the event brings back the "chaotic" gameplay from Overwatch 1, complete with some of the roster's completely match-altering abilities, like Mercy's team-reviving Resurrect ultimate or Symmetra's powerful, map-spanning teleporters. It also means a return to friendly-fire, as D.VA and Junkrat will once again be able to harm themselves with their abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">There will, however, be a few differences between Overwatch 1 and Overwatch: Classic. For starters, loot boxes and the original Overwatch's UI aren't coming back, nor are the original, non-reworked versions of Overwatch's maps. Instead, it will use the reworked Overwatch 2 versions of the original Overwatch's 12 launch maps. Players also won't be able to use skins or cosmetics, even if they are from the original game, when playing Overwatch: Classic. Heroes will instead be restricted to their default appearance in Overwatch 1 for the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard had previously announced it would be testing a return to 6v6 for Overwatch 2, but Blizzard insists that Overwatch: Classic is not that. Additionally, Blizzard says it's not planning for Overwatch: Classic to be a one-and-done event and that it could return, even if it doesn't have much more to say at this time.</p><p dir="ltr">"While we're not planning for this to be a single event, we will be measuring player response to inform our future plans," Blizzard writes.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's announcement of Overwatch: Classic further contributes to a trend of popular shooters, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex: Legends</a>, banking on the nostalgia players have for the launch versions of their favorite games. Fortnite is reportedly bringing back its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-returns-permanently-in-december-report/1100-6527620/" data-ref-id="1100-6527620">Fortnite OG game mode (feauring the game's original map and weapons) permanently</a> in December. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-devs-talk-lifelines-rebirth-season-23s-new-rocket-launcher-and-the-future-of-apex-legends/1100-6527578/" data-ref-id="1100-6527578">Apex: Legends' Season 23</a> introduced Launch Royale, a limited-time mode that brings back the game's original map, characters, weapons, and abilities much like Overwatch: Classic will.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 recently launched Season 13, which brought a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-new-halloween-game-mode-mutates-heroes-for-brutal-pvp-action/1100-6527094/" data-ref-id="1100-6527094">PvP Halloween event</a> alongside major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-season-13-patch-notes-bring-big-changes-to-sombra-tank-updates/1100-6527210/" data-ref-id="1100-6527210">balance changes to heroes like Sombra</a> and some of the game's most popular tanks. As for when players can expect more 6v6 action, Blizzard says it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-will-roll-out-6v6-testing-during-season-14/1100-6527389/" data-ref-id="1100-6527389">conducting 6v6 tests during Season 14</a>, which begins on December 10. The first test will require a hero in each role, while a second test slated for later in the season will test out the "classic 2-2-2" role composition," with some tweaks.</p>

There are still many titles being released, but I feel that the era of games where the volume is the selling point is coming to an end.”</p><p> Nagoshi left the<em> Like a Dragon</em> publisher three years ago to set up his own studio, and is currently working on a new project with NetEase Games. As the new game enters full production, he said the team is currently deciding on the final estimate of how much content will be in it. It sounds like he’s steering away from just making it big for the sake of an impressive-sounding interview soundbite or back-of-the-box quote </p><p>“Of course we have the map, but the current version is so large that it’s almost too large,” he told Famitsu. “This time, while researching existing games, we started by making a fairly large map with roads and highways. Now we are gradually shrinking it down and exploring the best balance for the game.”</p><p>The size of a game’s map, the total length of its script, and the average runtime for players are often deployed in pre-release marketing campaigns to bolster the sense that a game is worth its asking price. Value is reduced to how long it will keep a player busy, rather than whether any of the stuff they are doing feels meaningful or fun. That might be a plus for people who just want two or three games that will occupy them all year long, but for everyone else it can make getting to the “good” parts of a game feel like working a second job. </p><p>We’ll see how much that philosophy ends up impacting Nagoshi’s next project. The last <em>Like a Dragon</em> he oversaw as an executive at Sega, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473">2020's <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em></a></span>, ran 45 hours on average, or over 100 for those seeking a completionist playthrough. I’m guessing whatever he reveals next won’t exactly be short either. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Blizzard has announced that 6v6 matches are coming back to Overwatch for a limited time with Overwatch: Classic. The — new? — mode launches November 12 for all players and will run to December 2.</p>



<p>The announcement came alongside a new teaser video for the mode showing the original cast of characters, game modes, and maps.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/YMrIozIBTl0GxGBZ.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>“Eight years ago, Blizzard released a completely new gaming world called Overwatch,” Blizzard said <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a blog post</a>. “Connected by a theme of fighting for the future, millions of you jumped in to experience new heroes like a time-jumping adventurer, an esports champion turned mech pilot, and a genetically-modified gorilla from the Moon.</p>



<p>“Now you’ll be able to relive the nostalgia in a series of new limited-time events in Overwatch 2, where you can experience the original heroes, abilities, and maps in the classic 6v6 team-based action you remember.”</p>



<p>Overwatch: Classic will see access to 21 characters from the original launch of the game. The mode takes players back to Overwatch 1.0 from May 2016 with classic abilities from the heroes. The heroes will be grouped into their original classes, but the mode will feature the No Hero Limits rule meaning you can have a full team of the same heroes.</p>



<p>Regarding maps, all 12 original maps will be available along with the four original game modes.</p>



<p>As far as if Overwatch: Classic is the way for Blizzard to bring 6v6 back permanently, the studio says not right now.</p>



<p>“We are running separate 6v6 test modes in future seasons to gather feedback and gauge player interest on that format,” Blizzard said.</p>



<p>What do you think of 6v6 matches coming back to Overwatch via Overwatch: Classic? Let us know in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1197/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> finally arrived in stores. And while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">the lack of a disc drive</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag have been unpopular with players</a>, Sony President Hiroki Totoki has assured investors that sales of the mid-generation console update haven't been negatively affected.</p><p>As noted by video game reporter <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1854839684054368505" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genki_JPN</a>, Totoki recently told Japanese investors that, "In terms of the pricing, many people made different comments on that, but pricing on PS5 Pro has not had a negative impact, I don't think." He added that, "Hardcore users are the target of this hardware."</p><p>Considering that the PS5 Pro has barely been out a week, it seems premature to assess whether it's a success or a failure. What we do know is that PS5 Pro consoles appear to be readily available in stores, which means they haven't sold out. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lack-of-ps5-pro-shortages-means-some-scalpers-are-re-selling-at-a-loss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a> is also reporting that several scalpers have had to sell their PS5 Pros at a loss due to the lack of demand that accompanied the PS5 when it debuted in 2020. And as mentioned by Totoki, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/just-who-is-the-ps5-pro-for/1100-6526452/" data-ref-id="1100-6526452">PS5 Pro isn't geared towards the average player</a>.</p><p>However, the scalpers have reportedly had more success reselling the optional disc drive that can be added to the PS5 Pro. Several retailers have already sold out of the disc drive, which has given the scalpers an opportunity to fill the void until Sony can meet the demand. That suggests that there is a demand among the hardcore for a PS5 Pro that can play discs. Whether Sony will eventually release a PS5 Pro with a disc drive remains to be seen, especially since the company is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">making deals for PlayStation 6 manufacturing</a> down the line.</p>

Once there, the team splits into two groups as they make their way through the mission. Rook leads one group while you have to make the call between whether Davrin or Harding will lead the second team. This will take them out of your party selection for the duration of the mission and you’ll see them throughout the assault guiding the rest of your party and helping you from time to time. All of this culminates in a final fight with the elven god <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-saturday-night-live-snl-outfit-dragon-age-1851687610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-saturday-night-live-snl-outfit-dragon-age-1851687610">Ghilan’nain</a></span>, who nearly kills Rook in the scrap. However, the leader of the second team will create an opening to deal a killing blow to the god, only to be impaled by her and left to fall seemingly to their death.</p><p><strong>If you came here looking for a way to save Harding or Davrin, I’m sorry to report that it’s impossible</strong>. This isn’t a <em>Mass Effect 2</em> Suicide Mission moment, it’s an original <em>Mass Effect </em>Virmire decision. Harding and Davrin’s lives are mutually exclusive and whichever one you choose to lead the team will die by the end of the assault…presumably. When you return to the Lighthouse base, you can go to their respective rooms and examine some of their belongings. Rook will mention that there was “no trace” of whoever sacrificed themself for the cause, which could give BioWare an out to bring either character back in a future game. But whatever <em>Dragon Age </em>does in the future, <strong>you will lose Harding or Davrin for the remainder of the game</strong>, and if you romanced them you won’t see the culmination of that relationship.</p><p>There’s also another similar decision you make between Bellara and Neve that results in the character you choose getting captured by the elven gods. To be as spoiler-light as I can, I’ll just say you will be able to save them later in the game, but they will not rejoin your active party. So it’s not all bad!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s only fitting that NieR: Automata, one of the titles that inspired Stellar Blade initially, would enjoy a crossover with the action-packed PlayStation 5 exclusive. Directors Kim Hyung Tae and Yoko Tara, two long-time video game developers with deep respect for each other, join forces to bring console fans a collaboration unlike any other.</p>



<p>How does the NieR: Automata DLC work in Stellar Blade? According to the recent announcement, Emil from Emil’s Shop in NieR appears in Stellar Blade, selling eleven collab-specific items that somehow help combine both game worlds. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On top of the NieR: Automata DLC, Stellar Blade also receives a photo mode on November 20. The game’s upcoming photo mode allows you to pause the action at any point, snapping screenshots of Eve in various poses, expressions, landscapes, and even battle scenes for the ultimate action shot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There seems to be a brand-new side quest in the game that teaches you how to utilize the photo mode and rewards you with money and items upon completion. It’s an excellent way to introduce the mechanic and spark creativity.</p>



<p>Furthermore, on the same day as the photo mode and NieR: Automata DLC—November 20—a patch will launch simultaneously that includes additional appearance cosmetics, lip-sync language support, additional songs for camp, character customization, new battle mechanics, like auto-targeting and ballistics correction, and more!</p>



<p>What did you think of Stellar Blade? Let us know in the comments below, or start a thread on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official community forums</a>!</p>

Players become a self-made detective in a world where reality and the surreal intertwine, diving into a series of missing person cases and uncovering hidden truths within the city.</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Astrolabe Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Rusty Winter</em> is a game that is inspired by classic hard-boiled detective stories and good old urban legends. Set against the cold, industrial backdrop of the City of Ge’shan—a place echoing the faded glory of once-thriving industrial towns—the narrative unfolds as a romantic yet serious story infused with dark undertones and surreal twists. Using a delicate, richly-detailed pixel art style, the game brings every shadowed alley and forgotten corner of Ge’shan to life, as the protagonist unravel its strange mysteries one clue at a time.</p><p>The story revolves around a complex missing person case. Meet a cast of characters as diverse and worn as the city itself, and chase down leads that blurs the boundaries between reality and the paranormal. Uncover urban legends, and maybe even dive into some absurd extraterrestrial tales. Original music, vivid animations, and nostalgic mini-games enrich the journey across a decaying town on the brink of change. Along the way, witness the struggles of the townsfolk, catching glimpses of transformation—and perhaps even redemption.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol - the standalone sequel to 2022's widely acclaimed deductive adventure The Case of the Golden Idol - launches tomorrow, 12th November (14th November on Switch, due to an "unexpected delay"), and ahead of its arrival, developer Color Gray Games has shared a post-launch roadmap promising four bits of paid DLC.
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol, if you're unfamiliar, takes the murder-mystery sleuthing formula of its predecessor and shifts it from the 18th Century to the 1970s. Here, players must solve 20 cases of "crime, death and depravity", all somehow connected by the now-lost Idol of the title, in an "age of hallucinogens, disco, fax machines and parapsychology".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Katharine Castle called The Rise of the Golden Idol a "compelling modern mystery thriller that's bigger, better and more ambitious than its already brilliant predecessor" in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review">four star review</a>, praising some "wonderfully devised puzzles that really give your brain a good runaround before you're able to prise open its hard-won secrets". And Color Gray Games has now revealed there's even more to look forward to following its release.

<p>
As detailed by the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/4478360632965464065?l=english">on Steam</a>, The Rise of the Golden Idol will receive four self-contained DLC Investigations throughout 2025, each telling a standalone story featuring "at least" four cases. "These are optional side content and are not required to conclude the story in The Rise of the Golden Idol," it explains in its announcement. "Rather, these are for fans who want more puzzles, more characters, and more mysteries to solve." 
</p><p>
The first of these Investigations, titled The Sins of New Wells, launches in "Q1" next year, and sees players following Detective Roy Samson through four new cases as he deals with an organised crime syndicate plaguing the city. "Drugs, death, and ancient Lemurian magic will make the headlines," teases Color Grey Games. Two more DLC releases are scheduled for "Q2" 2025, with a fourth and final on due in "Q3".
</p>
<p>
The Rise of the Golden Idol is set to cost $19.99 USD (with a 10 percent launch discount) when it arrives for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and Steam this week, but mobile users can play as part of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> subscription. Each DLC release will be priced at $5.99, and all four post-launch chapters are included in a $17.99 Detective Pass, which also throws in the complete Golden Idol soundtrack. Color Gray Games notes there's also a permanent stacking discount for The Case of the Golden Idol owners, meaning they'll be able to get the follow-up and all future content "even cheaper". And if you're the try before you buy sort, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716400/The_Rise_of_the_Golden_Idol/">Steam demo's available now</a>.

			<p>Today, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1856003986601496823" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Spyro Reignited Trilogy will be available on Game Pass starting tomorrow across all tiers, including the base Game Pass Standard (previously known as Xbox Live Gold).</p>
<p>Insider extas1s <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a rumor that the Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy would join Game Pass in August. We're three months later, but the little dragon's remastered adventures are finally here. The game collection was originally released six years ago for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and our Francesco De Meo showered it with praise, except for some technical issues:</p>
<p><em>The Spyro Reignited Trilogy doesn't just play great but also looks great. Graphics have been redone from scratch, and they make the game almost look like a Pixar movie, with excellent animations and colorful, detailed locations. Sadly, performance isn't as great. The game runs at 30 FPS on the original PlayStation 4 model, and there are some evident frame pacing issues. The frame rate also drops here and there, so the experience isn't always too smooth. The soundtrack can also be a bit hit and miss, especially the dynamic soundtrack, but it's also possible to play through the game with the original music from the PlayStation games. Voice acting, on the other hand, is spot on at all times.</em></p>
<p><em>With the&nbsp;Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Toys for Bob and Activision have shown how a proper remaster should be developed. All three games are incredibly faithful to the original releases, and the few additions make everything here and better. If it weren't for the technical issues plaguing the collection, the&nbsp;Spyro Reignited Trilogy would probably be the best remaster ever released so far.</em></p>
<p>Those problems shouldn't be too prevalent on the way more powerful Xbox Series S|X and PC hardware where Game Pass users will check out the trilogy, though.</p>

This will also include a return to the 6v6 rule set, two-tank role queue player compositions, and the no-limit mode that lets you play whatever characters you want without any restriction. This will also bring some old maps like the two-point capture maps Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, and Volskaya Industries back into rotation. Check out the trailer below:</p><p>According to Blizzard’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on the event</a></span>, this is “separate” from the team’s broader 6v6 plans, as it will focus primarily on the original hero roster, rather than all the characters who have been added since. I didn’t start playing <em>Overwatch </em>until 2019, so some of this will be new to me, such as there being four roles instead of the current three. Some of the abilities seen in the trailer, like Symettra having six turrets, are things I only know by reputation, so this will be a way to fill a hole in my <em>Overwatch </em>experience.</p><p>Admittedly, I don’t think this does much for me, given that my big problems with <em>Overwatch 2 </em>are largely about its failure to deliver things like the story missions and generate any plot momentum, rather than about pining for the <em>Overwatch </em>of old. But if this gives me a reason to play the game with some regularity over the next few weeks and brings friends who won’t play <em>Overwatch 2 </em>with me back, that’s a net win, I suppose.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> is currently in its 13th season, which features a Halloween-themed battle pass and a Widowmaker mythic skin. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>MachineGames has released a new deep dive gameplay trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, with the archeological adventure set to launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-is-coming-to-ps5-but-only-after-xbox-and-pc-december-release/">3rd December, and on PS5 in spring 2025</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Deep Dive - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ik6WEckZKh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>MachineGames Audio Director, Pete Ward, guides us on this tour through the first person action adventure. While there’s some new clips and things to see, it’s fair to say that this video covers a fair bit of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview-action-puzzles-exploration-disguises/">familiar ground from previous trailers,</a> including the figure of Tony Todd as a mysterious and very imposing antagonist right at the start of the game – who sadly passed away age 69 last week, making this game a posthumous appearance – and the companion character, photojournalist Gina, who teams up with Indy on the chase after Emmerich Voss who’s on a global hunt for otherworldly artefacts.</p>
<p>Indy has a camera of his own, using it to take photos of the world as you adventure, potentially getting clues from Indy as you do so. This fills in Indy’s journal, which will track the adventure so far and all the clips. You might also have to get your Agent 47 on with some disguises to get into restricted areas.</p>

<p>I got to go hands on with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle last month, and had a rather good time. Playing in first person (with a few snippets of third person) might be different from what you’d expect, given that Indiana Jones inspired the likes of Tomb Raider and Uncharted, but it works. I said, “I’m rather keen to see how this full adventure comes together. MachineGames are taking a less obvious path, but that’s going to lead to a much more individual and distinctive game and journey. And if you’re going to trust anyone to make a game that’s a lot to do with beating up fascists, it’s probably them!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-vote-charizard-ex-best-card-in-the-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> players have voted Charizard ex the best card in the game, with his meta game rival Mewtwo ex coming in a close second.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An IGN poll asked players which of 10 popular cards was the most popular and, with 20.8% of more than 1,000 votes, Charizard ex took the crown. This Stage 2 Pokémon has the highest damage attack in the game, with Crimson Storm's 200 power able to take down any other card in a single shot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex is extra powerful because of fellow fire type Moltres ex though. This card lets the player flip three coins and add a fire energy to a bench Pokémon for every heads, so players use it to overload a Charmander, Charmeleon, and eventually Charizard on the bench so it's not impacted by the loss of two energy when using Crimson Storm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The second best card in Pokémon TCG Pocket, as per our player poll, is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">the biggest rival of Charizard ex at the top of the meta</a>: Mewtwo ex. It came in at just a touch below with 20.1% of votes, so the two are practically neck and neck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewtwo ex works in a similar way as Charizard ex, though as a basic Pokémon itself, players will often put it directly into the active Pokémon slot. It also has a two energy, 50 damage attack, and 150 hit points to keep it around and doing damage, meaning players have enough time to set up a Gardevoir on the bench.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Stage 2 Pokémon takes some time to set up, with Ralts and Kirlia coming before it, but once it's on the bench, players can use its Psy Shadow ability to add one energy to the active Pokémon. This again counters the discard two energy cost of Mewtwo's 150 damage attack, as the standard energy joins the Gardevoir energy each turn to add two at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Charizard ex and Mewtwo ex came Pikachu ex in third place, with 17% of votes, and in fourth place, but way below, came Starmie ex. Both of these have high damage, low cost attacks, meaning if players can deploy them quick enough it's hard for opponents to build a strong board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next in the poll came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">the infamous Trainer card Misty at 7.3%</a>, followed by Professor's Research at 5.2%, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">Farfetch'd at 5%</a>, Sabrina at 4.5%, and Dragonite at 4.1%. Only the last of these is the leader of its own deck and not a supplementary card, and seemingly the only non-ex Pokémon to stand a chance against the meta leaders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this could change when another set comes out, of course, and while developer Creatures Inc. hasn't revealed when this will be, a datamine of Pokémon TCG Pocket alluded to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-datamine-alludes-to-expansion-set-in-january">an expansion set in December and the next full release in January</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game. It lets players open packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collect cards</a>, build decks, and battle others, a simple formula that has already proved popular given <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">it made $12 million in just four days</a> and was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-passes-30-million-downloads-in-9-days">downloaded more than 30 million times in just nine</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is keeping interest high by releasing myriad events catered to different playstyles. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">The first offered players freebies in the form of Wonder Picks</a>, and to entertain more than just collectors, Creatures Inc. soon launched battle events both in single player and player versus player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">The Lapras ex Drop Event lets players take on a handful of water decks</a> for a chance of winning the beloved Pokémon, while the PvP event embraces Pokémon tradition by putting badges on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.
