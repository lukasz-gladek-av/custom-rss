            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silksong </em>has sent ripples through the indie game world simply by existing. Just last week, all manner of mice and men were on the verge of deploying their best laid plans, but now with the long-dormant juggernaut suddenly days away from release, everyone else has <a href="https://aftermath.site/silksong-indie-delays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run for the hills</a> – even bigger names like <em>Baby Steps</em>, the new game from <em>Getting Over It </em>creator Bennett Foddy, and <em>Demonschool</em>, a promising-looking <em>Persona</em>-esque tactics RPG by a team of indie vets. These games are nothing like <em>Silksong</em>; were they really in danger of getting steamrolled? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk to <em>Demonschool</em>’s creative director about retreating and living to fight another day.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft to discuss the aforementioned delay and the climate surrounding it. While <em>Demonschool</em>’s publisher, rather than development team, ultimately made the call, they’re far from alone in rolling out the red carpet for the long-awaited indie darling and then sprinting full force in the opposite direction. Will <em>Silksong </em>really suck all the air out of the room, though? Or are developers overreacting?</p><p>Then we talk about two pieces of news in what has proven to be a banner week for unions: IGN workers, worn down after multiple rounds of layoffs, have <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-union-action-ziff-davis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resolved to do their jobs</a> – and no more – for the next six months. Meanwhile, the hundreds-strong dev team behind <em>Diablo </em>has <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formed a union of their own</a>, and they’re hoping to secure layoff and AI protections, as well as pay equity. Finally, we reminisce about the last time we dug a hole.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can dig an even deeper hole.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Y’all’s publisher made the announcement that <em>Demonschool </em>was delayed, and the impression I got is that that was not necessarily your preferred decision.</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>Yeah, we had a discussion with them about it, so they didn’t just blindside us. We talked about it, and I was more in favor of staying, but I understand why they wanted to move. Our game, <em>Demonschool</em>, is an RPG, basically. It’s an RPG with tactical battles, so you could argue that it doesn’t intersect with <em>Silksong</em> – which is sort of what I was arguing [with the publisher]. But the fact is, if you want to make decent money off your game – which, at this point, when you’ve been working on it for a bunch of years, you have to. I wish we didn’t live in a capitalist society, but guess what? We do. So I’ve gotta make a certain amount of money, we’re gonna run out of money, etc.</p><p>If you want to [make money], your best shot is at being the indie game of the week that is getting discussed. And if that doesn’t happen, you’ll lose out on all the curious people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>There’s that whole school of thought that if you’re not competing directly with a game genre-wise on Steam, then you’re not necessarily in the clear, but you’re probably OK. For the piece I wrote last week about people contemplating delaying their games, I talked to Simon Carless, who does a lot of analysis of Steam and discoverability more generally, and that was his larger thesis. He was like “Well, I think that indies sort of overrate how important your release window is, especially relative to other games.” If <em>Demonschool </em>was a Metroidvania, that’d be one thing, but why delay something like <em>Demonschool</em>, which is substantially different than <em>Silksong </em>if conventional wisdom – at least from one guy who looks at a lot of numbers – is that you don’t necessarily need to?</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>One of the weird things about games is, not that many other industries do this thing where we try to get out of each others’ way. So there’s an argument that maybe you don’t have to. Film industry does it. Books don’t. Music doesn’t. But games are really long; they take a lot of time. So mindshare can last a long time. And like I said, it is ultimately about the people who are just curious. You want to break out into people who like games in general – not just the genre fans. The people who like games in general are gonna be looking at the most popular thing at that time.&nbsp;</p><p>But I felt like, yeah, maybe people could buy two games. Maybe there’s people who don’t want to play <em>Silksong</em>. Maybe there’s people who want to play something else, and maybe it’s a good opportunity for us to be that other thing. But the problem is, you can’t prove any of those without A/B testing it, which you can’t do, because you either release it or you don’t.</p><p>It’s hard to know what to do, so you’ve just gotta use your best judgement and your best guess. And in a way, the delay is good for us. It’s annoying, but in a way it’s good because the publisher’s paying for it, so we get paid for a little longer, and we’re able to really polish stuff.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I remember, last week especially, when the first delay announcements were starting to trickle in, some people were saying, “Oh, developers don’t seriously think they need to delay their games; they’re just doing it for the free press. They’re doing it because it will get them mentioned in articles alongside <em>Silksong</em>, and then they’ll gain more visibility.” My impression is that that was not really the case?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brandon:</strong> Nobody was doing that. The gains you get from that are so minimal compared to anything else, like a Steam Next Fest or something. Announcing a delay is not a positive news beat. We got some wishlists out of it, and we tried to turn it into a positive, but what you wind up getting on social media is a bunch of people dumping on you, basically. There were a lot of people who were nice about it, but it’s hard not to focus on the ones who are saying mean things or being like “I don’t care.” There’s the whole spectrum of stuff you get from existing on the internet. So I don’t think it would be anybody’s first choice as a promotional vehicle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It also goes back to what you were saying earlier, where you kind of naturally incur more costs if you delay, because that’s time that you’re not making money off the release.</p><p><strong>Brandon:</strong> Yeah, and it’s more copies that we have to sell. The more the game costs, the more we have to make back in order to break even. That’s also a factor, and that’s why we try to self-fund as much as possible as well, so that we don’t have to have a big amount to recoup. It’s very scary. When you have a publisher, you’re not going into actual debt, because they’re paying for it, and if it doesn’t sell, they’re on the hook for that.</p><p>But there is an emotional debt that at least I feel, where I feel a responsibility to make that money back. And maybe that’s weird and naive, but I just want to do right by people who have tried to believe in me and the team, and I want them to succeed as well off of this. And so we’ve gotta sell 100,000 copies to break even.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Is that the real number, or just a hypothetical one?</p><p><strong>Brandon:</strong> That’s a real number.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Wow, that’s a lot of copies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>We’ve been working on it a long time! When you’ve got a team of five-to-seven people, and they make a bare-minimum-to-survive-in-a-city type of wage, that’s a lot of multiplication that you do on numbers to keep that thing going.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Then you have to take into account the overall economics of Steam. How many games these days sell that number of copies? It can’t be a lot.</p><p><strong>Brandon: </strong>It’s not. There’s a lot of pressure to make sure you’re presenting the game in the way that will sell the most, because there’s so much to make back – so many copies you have to sell. Obviously the first thing you have to do is make the game good, but then there’s so much other stuff around that that has to happen in order for your game to be seen and positioned in such a way that people will know to buy it, know that they want to buy it, know that it exists at all.</p><p>It’s frustrating because we’ve really tried very hard to let people know that this game exists, but all the promotional vehicles have scattered to the four winds. It used to be that you could go viral on Twitter, and there you’d be. Now Twitter’s a nazi hellscape. Someone can do great on TikTok, but you can’t manufacture that; someone who’s already popular has to pick you up and do something cool. There’s all this nonsense that you have to think about.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/long-story-short-bojack-netflix"><h3>Long Story Short Is A Lot, In A Good Way</h3></a><p>The new family drama from the creators of Bojack Horseman is funny, moving, and just the right amount of intense</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/vivi-is-screwing-up-magic-the-gathering-and-you-know-what-good-for-him"><h3>Vivi Is Screwing Up Magic: The Gathering, And You Know What?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> launched, Kazutaka Kodaka joked that his studio Tookyo Games might go bankrupt if the game didn’t do well. Thankfully, the massive visual novel experience ended up doing so well he later clarified that the team no longer felt that bankruptcy was a possibility. Despite that, it felt like it might take a miracle for the team to be able to put out another game if they were so close to shuttering after completing this one. As it turns out, Kazutaka Kodaka treated us like the victims in his own infamous twist-filled mystery thriller games. He quickly announced the development of a new game alongside DMM Games and Spike Chunsoft where the gimmick is that it is actually five different games in one – and that smorgasbord title is called Shuten Order.</p>
<p><iframe title="SHUTEN ORDER Gameplay Intro Trailer (Nintendo Switch, Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLlfmevjGAk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While I loved&nbsp;The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;a lot, it felt all too familiar as a fan of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/danganronpa">Danganronpa</a>&nbsp;series. Perhaps that’s because it shares so much of a visual and auditory identity with those games. Perhaps it’s because the game kicks off with all-too-familiar mysteries of locked classrooms and quirky teens that it drags it’s feet expanding into truly original ideas. None of it was bad, just familiar.&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;by comparison, is a revelation.</p>


<p>It finally feels like Kazutaka Kodaka is doing something fresh and new with this game, and there’s a lot of reasons for that. For one, the entire plot setup is refreshingly unique – our protagonist wakes up in a mysterious hotel room with no memory of their identity or their past. Two self-proclaimed angels tell her that she has been murdered, but they placed her in a new temporary body and have given her the alias of Rei with the goal of completing “God’s trial”. The task? Interrogate five key members from a mysterious organization known as Shuten Order, discover which of them is our killer, then get them to confess. Oh, and kill them too.</p>


<p>In the opening hours of&nbsp;Shuten Order,&nbsp;layers of dubious explanations and hauntingly under-explained world details are stacked on top of each other at a staggering rate. Before you can even question who these angels are if they’re real, you’re also grappling with learning that you live in a city-state founded by a religious cult – then, before the dubiousness of that can even sink in, it’s hinted that the world outside of this mini-country is a literal apocalypse. Despite the ominous circumstances of the game’s world, the streets are lined with confetti and festival banners celebrating the heroes of the Shuten Order. A cutscene shows you the celebrations playing out, but the cacophony quickly goes from just loud to overbearingly chaotic – voices and cheers and sounds overlap in an overwhelming, barely decipherable mess.</p>
<p>There’s a really hauntingly beautiful sort of cluttered chaos to the entire aesthetic of the game that is unlike anything else I’ve seen. Stylish title cards outlining the day and time explode onto the screen regularly, and when your protagonist uses the mysterious “power of God” to make unexpected miracles or coincidences occur, a terrifying animatic of inhuman language and shapes and sounds pops onto screen that seems to represent some kind of representation of whatever god is helping you. Most of the game is represented by talking character portraits and subtly stylised text boxes that look like a regular video game, but when these alarming animatics pop in, it really adds to this sense of urgency and strangeness that elevates the game so much.</p>

<p>Your guardian angels prompt you to pick one of the five leaders of the Shuten Order to identify as your killer – the implication is that your choice is guided by divine will, and whoever you pick&nbsp;is&nbsp;the killer. Whoever you pick also dictates an entirely different gameplay experience you’ll be going through as you investigate their secrets and hunt their confession. Kishiru Inugami makes you play an Ace Attorney-style investigation game. Yugen Ushitora has you playing an all-too-familiar death game escape adventure. Teko Ion’s route takes the form of a flowchart-exploring non-linear visual novel.&nbsp;Honoka Kokushikan’s route is a high-stress twist on a dating sim visual novel. Most striking of all, though is Manji Fushicho’s story – which isn’t a 2D visual novel genre-spin at all, but instead a fully 3D top-down stealth horror game.</p>
<p>I started off with Honoka Kokushikan’s route, intrigued by the idea of a romantic adventure, but I was initially disappointed by how it felt identical to the base game. Characters joke about how “different” the world looks once you step into her route, but all that’s really changed is that your text boxes are a slightly different shape. Thankfully, over the course of her 6-ish hour route, a lot of unique gameplay ideas start to crop up and you’re given a satisfying amount of freedom to explore the weirdness of the route. Each of the five routes clocks in at a similar length of time, and they all do a surprisingly good job of fully committing to their bits and giving you a full-games worth of mechanical depth and mix-ups. About half the routes feel whole enough in terms of narrative to come across as their own intriguing little mystery games, but the other half are so clearly part of a larger puzzle and don’t fully stand up on their own. Special shout-out to Yugen Ushitora’s escape-room route, because it’s inexplicably formatted like a vtuber livestream with a 3D anime girl reacting to everything in the corner while her chat pops off above her head.</p>

<p>As a complete experience, Shuten Order does unfortunately fall into a very similar trap as a lot of other works by Kazutaka Kodaka – there are really fascinating ideas and twists presented in the game, but character dialogue is so overbearing in repeatedly explaining and clarifying every interaction that it feels like this sometimes-exhausting 50 hour experience could have been a much swifter, snappier, and more satisfying 30-35 hour adventure. Like his other games though, the sheer creativity and one-of-a-kind aesthetic in this game ends up making the sometimes mind-numbing dialogue worth digging through. Shuten Order blends quiet tension with loud and anxiety-inducing frights perfectly without ever even acting like it’s a horror game. It isn’t, except for that one route where it is. It’s just an amalgamation of overwhelming sights and sounds that’s equal parts beautiful and confusing. It’s an uncompromising experience, and one I won’t forget for a long time.</p>

<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158314/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Leave it up to Kazutaka Kodaka to come up with one of the weirdest stories in gaming, huh?</p>
<p>Following on from the outrageously ambitious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>, the creator has now joined forces with developer Neilo on the new visual novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a>. I say ‘visual novel’, and that’s absolutely the overarching genre, but it also manages to feature five distinct sub-genres within its surprisingly lengthy story. Wild stuff.</p>
<p>Shuten Order itself is the titular cult obsessed with the idea that humanity itself is doomed. In fact, the cult not only believes that the end of times is at hand, but is actively <em>wishing</em> for it, rejecting any notion of an afterlife or an all-seeing deity. In what can only be described as divine intervention, however, its founder awakens following their brutal murder, seemingly resurrected to track down the culprit. If that’s not enough, two angels also accompany you throughout the game to provide advice and guidance. Could the cult be...wrong?</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158317/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With just a few days on the clock before your resurrection ‘expires’, you’re tasked with completing ‘God’s Trial’: identify your murderer, get them to confess, and then, well… kill them. The potential suspects are limited to just five individuals: Shuten Order’s ministers, each of whom presides over a specific department. So you’ve got the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education, and so on.</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen which of the five ministers to accuse of your murder, you’ll have to pursue them and try to gain a confession, and it’s here where the gameplay diverges into one of five sub-genres.</p>
<p>I started with the Ministry of Security, which essentially sees you working to solve the mystery of a deadly entity called ‘Nephilim’, a grotesque creature that stalks its prey and gouges their eyes out. Lovely stuff. The Security path sees you navigate a series of labyrinths set in different locations as you progress through the story. It’s mostly a case of finding an item or activating a switch and then making it to a final destination without being caught by Nephilim, who constantly shuffles along the corridors. It’s shallow stuff with some pretty basic 3D visuals, and on its own doesn’t really hold up all that well.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158311/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In fact, the same could very well be said for every sub-genre: The Ministry of Education focuses on a romance story in which you need to woo three women within a typical school setting; The Ministry of Health is an escape adventure focused around a ‘death game’ that fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> will no doubt appreciate; The Ministry of Justice is a straightforward investigation in which you need to gather clues and deduce the correct course of action; and finally, The Ministry of Science is a multi-perspective visual novel that features several ‘protagonists’.</p>
<p>None of the gameplay tropes feel particularly new, and pretty much all of them can be seen in Kodaka’s previous work, but I guess you could say that this is the first time they’ve all been cobbled together in one single game. With that in mind, if you’re familiar with the likes of Dangaronpa or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/zero_escape_virtues_last_reward">Zero Escape</a>, then much of Shuten Order will be pretty familiar territory.</p>
<p>Despite the marketing push to highlight the different sub-genres, the overarching story is really the main draw here. As you start to unravel the mystery, you’ll meet some seriously entertaining characters along the way, and Kodaka’s writing alongside illustrator simadoriru’s visual design is consistently striking and unique.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158308/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Where Shuten Order begins to falter is in its execution of those sub-genres. Kodaka <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/unsettling-yet-captivating-shuten-order-creators-talk-cult-religion-and-dismemberment">has stated</a> his ambition to present a “culmination of all the visual novels I've ever read”, and it’s certainly an ambitious attempt, but the approach here screams ‘Jack of all trades’.</p>
<p>The five different branches wind up feeling little more than a novelty, and not a particularly compelling one. I mentioned how the Security path features basic visuals, but this is nothing compared to how simple and mundane the actual gameplay is. The devs want you to feel nervous as you avoid the gaze of Nephilim, but there's zero challenge, and it ends up just being a nuisance.</p>
<p>Similarly, the romance path has you searching (stalking?) for your potential date, with the game presenting multiple locations to visit, but not giving much indication as to where you actually need to go. So you wind up just guessing until you reach the right goal, forced to engage in random NPC conversations if you happen to search in the wrong place. This isn't a game that respects your time.</p>
<figure><a title="SHUTEN ORDER Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158306/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s not a short one, either. The length will vary depending on how much you’re willing to invest in the story and investigate every possible avenue, but each of the five narrative branches could easily take you 10 hours or so. At a total of 50, Shuten Order felt quite bloated and would have benefited from focusing on just one or two key gameplay hooks to tell its story. Coming off the back of The Hundred Line, which demonstrated an exceptionally strong combination of visual novel storytelling and tactical gameplay, the attempt to showcase several different genres here means that none of them are really able to shine.</p>
<p>What <em>does</em> shine, however, is the visual design. Shuten Order displays exceptional use of colour that really sets it apart from other visual novels, and the juxtaposition of the striking blues, yellows, and pinks against a story steeped in misery and despair is particularly notable.</p>
<p>Similarly, the music is consistently engaging, shifting in tone at all the right moments, while the Japanese voiceover work never falters. There’s no Western VO here, however, so you’re out of luck if you happen to prefer your Japanese visual novels dubbed.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it all runs well on the Switch, with reasonably short load times. If you happen to be playing on the Switch 2, then you won't find any issues with performance, but you should note that character illustrations at certain distances can look almost pixelated, slightly – a simple symptom of blowing up the Switch 1 game's handled resolution on the larger 1080p screen. If you can, play it on the Switch OLED; the colours look simply marvellous on that stunning display.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Shuten Order is an ambitious visual novel that tells an intriguing story with consistently engaging characters and more than a few twists and turns. Unfortunately, with the inclusion of five distinct forms of gameplay driving the story, it ultimately feels bloated and directionless, and not one of the sub-genre sections is polished enough to stand on its own two feet.</p>
<p>I wholeheartedly commend the audacious, multi-genre effort, but Shuten Order would have benefited from a lot more focus.</p></section>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> developers Misfit Attic have revealed Below The Crown, a chess-flavoured fantasy roguelike with an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-style meta-layer and some sexy 80s CRT visuals. You are a wizard, tasked with Gathering A Party and braving an offbrand Tron dungeon to retrieve some gold. Your upgradeable party members are based on chess units, and each floor of the dungeon is a grid-based combat puzzle inspired by classic chess manouevres like Forks and Pins. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Misfits Attic founder Tim Keenan calls it a "gateway drug into chess", but the press release often seems more eager to dunk on chess than celebrate it, as it straddles the line of being "accessible for newcomers and compelling for experts". They want to sell people on the wonders of chess, a beautiful abstract strategy game that dates back hundreds of years, while also reassuring a younger generation of nerds that Below The Crown is absolutely nothing like chess, a stupid non-computer game played by losers that doesn't even have any magic spells in it. 
</p>
<p>
"Forget memorized openings, drawn-out endgames, and stalemates," it reads. "Start with one piece, a badass wizard, instead of 16 - and bid the tedium of analysis paralysis adieu." Sayonara, chess, you monstrous waste of perfectly good timber! I love you. You're an awful experience and I hope all of my friends get hooked on you. Let's kiss with tongues, you embarrassing plod.
</p><p>
Chess aside, Below The Crown is billed as a "thinking person's roguelike" in the style of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay The Spire</a>, which seems a bit mean to other roguelikes. I consider the roguelike a fairly cerebral genre by default. It's not like saying "thinking person's ballpit", is it. "Make smart plays to capture enemies and survive an ever-changing dungeon," the press release goes on. "Imbue the party with abilities like Vision for placement flexibility or Shadow Protection, granting a shield while on a dark tile. Acquire spell cards and skills to ramp up throughout a run, collecting gold to sate the Emperor, but also finding mysterious runes along the way..."
</p>
<p>
That dot-dot-dotting probably pertains to the aforesaid Inscryption-esque meta-layer, which sees you pulling back from a computer <em>within</em> the computer to answer enigmatic corporate queries. "From daily stress surveys to strange ranking rituals, the game isn't afraid to break the fourth wall and surprise the player with unexpected weirdness," the press release adds. I am making a note, "expect weirdness". Keenan also calls Below The Crown a "massively singleplayer experience", with a custom board editor and the ability to share your creations online.
</p>
<p>
I will forgive all this frenzied marketing footwork because Misfits Attic are the creators of Duskers - a lonely Lieutenant Gorman simulator, and solid candidate for the title of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">best space game</a>. According to me, anyway: whoever last edited that Best Of didn't include it, and they didn't put it on our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">best horror games</a>, either. Philistines! 

</p><p>Misfits recently announced that they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">making a "spiritual successor" to Duskers</a> featuring ship-building, under the working title "Humanity 2.0". They're also making a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> lite" in which you try to manipulate enemy factions into fighting each other.

              <p>Valve’s extremely popular PC gaming store Steam is now requiring users in the United Kingdom to <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">verify their age</a> using a credit card. This is a direct result of the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-steam-users-must-now-verify-age-to-access-store-pages-for-mature-games-thanks-to-online-safety-act">As of August 29, as spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it looks like Valve is now requiring that all users in the United Kingdom verify how old they are before they will be able to access mature video games. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has also updated its official Steam Support website</a> with new information about age verification, telling UK users that “in order to access Steam store pages for mature content games,” they’ll need to go through an “opt-in process” that requires age verification via credit card. Going through this process will “trigger a £0 authorization” on the card to check if it’s active and real.</p> <p>Valve says that as long as the credit card stored on the Steam account is valid, the account is considered “age verified.” So you should only have to do this once. Hopefully.</p> <p>According to the updated Steam Support website, Valve “reviewed” all age verification methods and determined that using a credit card preserved “the maximum degree of user privacy” compared to some other sites and services that use AI-powered facial scanning tech.</p> <p>“The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience,” explained Valve on the website. “The verification process therefore provides no information about a user’s content preferences to payment providers or other third parties. Valve handles the verification process using its own internal payment processing system, which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard.”</p>

 <p>Also on the site, when explaining why this new verification process is being forced upon users, Valve directly and politely lays the blame on the UK’s new online safety laws and Ofcom, the nation’s independent regulator for online safety.</p> <p>Valve isn’t the first video game company to run into issues with the UK’s Online Safety Act, which has placed large, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/no-uks-online-safety-act-doesnt-make-children-safer-online">controversial restrictions and regulations</a> on how people under 18 can access the internet. In July, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox began rolling out its own age verification process</a> in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/account/age-verification-faq/#:~:text=We%20are%20piloting%20an%20age%20verification%20process%20for%20players%20who%20register%20for%20new%20accounts%20in%20the%20UK%20and%20Ireland.%20If%20you%20are%20setting%20up%20an%20adult%20account%2C%20you%20will%20be%20asked%20to%20provide%20proof%20that%20you%20are%20over%20the%20minimum%20age%20for%20that%20type%20of%20account%20using%20an%20age%20verification%20service.">Sony is “rolling out”</a> an age verification process in the&nbsp; UK, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can earn free Battlefield 6 goodies from Battlefield 2042. The problem is that the grind is slow, and players have complained. In keeping with EA’s recent acknowledgment of player feedback, Battlefield 2042 players can expect regular double—and triple XP—weekends every weekend moving forward.</p>



<p>The Battlefield Team has once again heard your cries. The community has lamented how long it takes to level up the Battlefield 2042 Free Battlepass to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> items. If you like your double XP weekends, your day is about to get much better.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-rewards-will-be-easier-to-get-with-battlefield-2042-double-xp">Battlefield 6 Rewards Will Be Easier To Get With Battlefield 2042 Double XP</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Still a grind, but less of one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>An August 29 update from the Battlefield Team (through <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a>) has recognized the negative noise surrounding the Free Battlepass in Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team has had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’ve heard your concerns that you might have missed out on an XP weekend already, or might miss one of the upcoming ones, making it harder to catch up and get all the items from the Free Battlepass you’ve wanted. We therefore will have a double XP events every weekend until the Free Battlepass ends on October 7. Additionally, the last two weekends will feature triple XP gains, so keep those circled in your calendar!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s right: Double XP every weekend basically until Battlefield 6 launches, and the occasional triple XP weekend for good measure.</p>



<p>There are countless items for you to earn in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-road-to-battlefield-6-pass-all-exclusive-bf6-rewards-how-to-get-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 Road to Battlefield 6 Pass</a>. The more you earn now, the greater your haul of cosmetics and bonuses by the time Battlefield 6 finally makes its way around.</p>







<p>Is this going to make you complete the entire Free Battlepass for BF6 bonuses? Is this a smart move from EA, showing that it’s prepared to listen to players ahead of Battlefield 6’s launch?

"We showcased them in a series of hands on presentations attracting praise from the player community and gaming media. And although we clearly see that sales of the on the new console are currently dominated by Nintendo’s first party titles, we were very pleased with Cyberpunk being among the best selling third party games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Switch 2 might pack much better hardware than the original, but a game I’m still surprised to see running at all (much less pretty well) on a Nintendo system is Cyberpunk 2077," we wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 Cyberpunk 2007 review update</u></a>.

<p>A frame rate brawl</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>SEGA popped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">July Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> to reveal that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a> would be brawling their way onto Switch 2 on <strong>13th November</strong>. Of course, the former is already available on Switch 1, but this new release promised improved graphics and frame rates, alongside some bonus language options.</p>
<p>The announcement was all well and good, but we haven't seen anything from either game in the month since — and when it comes to titles that are already available on other platforms like these, we're particularly interested to see how they'll run on the fresh hardware. Well, SEGA has the answer.</p>
<p>The publisher recently dedicated roughly 40 minutes of a livestream to showcasing Kiwami and Kiwami 2 Switch 2 gameplay, and both look really rather strong. Now yes, the frame rate displayed in the first game is not quite as "improved" as we were led to believe in the Direct announcement, but perhaps it's just a capture issue? Who knows! Kiwami 2 appears that bit smoother (starting around the 25-minute mark), so let's roll with that example.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a> slotted itself into nicely into the Switch 2's launch line-up, providing some sweet 4K/60fps goodness to the series' oft-recommended starting place. If Kiwami 1 and 2 can offer more of the same on the console when we get to play the entire thing in November, then we'll be very happy indeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>officially the most-streamed English movie in Netflix’s catalog</span></a><span>. It is one of the most surprising success stories of the year. A completely original animated musical has captured the hearts and minds of audiences, all while Sony and Netflix were woefully unprepared for it to blow up the way it has. It debunks conjecture that people aren’t interested in original animated features, and now that it has, we can examine why projects by Pixar, once the&nbsp; top dog in animation, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>haven’t hit the same way they used to</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Elio</span></i><span>, Pixar’s sci-fi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-manga-genre-isekai-enter-oxford-dictionary-1851375582"><span>pseudo-isekai</span></a><span> film about an orphaned boy looking for family among aliens, had the company’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926"><span>worst-ever box office debut</span></a><span> back in June, and as Pixar’s original movies continue to flounder and fail to gain an audience while a sequel like </span><i><span>Inside Out 2 </span></i><span>can be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ne-zha-2-inside-out-2-box-office-record-2-billion-china-1851765730"><span>one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time</span></a><span>, the narrative increasingly becomes “people don’t want original stories or ones too specific to a certain lived experience.” Well, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is a brand new story based in Korean mythology and is topping the charts for both movies and music, so that’s obviously not true. What’s the difference? Well, one </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>artist has a theory.</span></p> <p><span>Radford Sechrist is a story artist on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, as well as the husband of director Maggie Kang. Sometimes he posts about art and animation on TikTok, and he had some insight as to why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been so successful while movies like </span><i><span>Elio</span></i><span> and even </span><i><span>The Bad Guys 2</span></i><span>, which had a pretty significant drop in box office after its opening weekend, are struggling. Sechrist says that even though a lot of animated movies are marketed as “all-ages,” only so many of them are truly aiming for adults as well as kids. He then goes on to argue that, in order for an animated film to become a big pop culture phenomenon, it has to target people in their 20s and up, and it will then naturally trickle down to children through platforms like YouTube and TikTok.</span></p>

   <p><span>“I think the issue is that kids only watch shows where they’re seeing people talking about it on YouTube, and the people talking about it on YouTube are in their 20s,” Sechrist says. “So if you’re developing a movie, you kind of have to think about people in their 20s first before the kids will even hear of the movie. So things like anime, </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, you have to sort of shoot for that age of demographic and you have to get people in their 20s excited so they’re talking about it. Then the kids will see that, and as long as you don’t put anything in the movie that’s too much for a kid—but let’s be honest, there’s like 5-year-olds watching </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>.”</span></p> <p><span>Sechrist points out that some of the most notable exceptions to this are in animation targeting pre-school children, or in shows like </span><i><span>Bluey</span></i><span>, which are aimed at children but engage in enough adult themes that parents gladly watch the show alongside their kids. Anecdotally, when I went to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>its singalong screenings</span></a><span>, the kid to adult ratio in the crowds wasn’t exactly lopsided. I went with a group of adults, and we weren’t the only childless party at those screenings. My friend even joked that she forgot the movie was “for kids” until we arrived at the theater because its fandom has transcended age. That speaks to the truth of Sechrist’s theory that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ adult appeal, which it establishes through adult themes, quality animation, and music you’d actually listen to outside of the movie, has helped it break past the “kids movie” bubble that movies like </span><i><span>Elio</span></i><span> may be stuck in. He says that he would encourage Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, and anyone else working on an animated property to consider if something is reaching the 20s-and-up demographic, or if they want it to be so specific in its younger audience that it never escapes those trappings.</span></p> <p><span>Pixar’s box office trajectory has become a big topic in conversations about the state of animation writ large, but some nuance is lost when you ignore that several of Pixar’s movies have been released on Disney+ alongside a limited theatrical release in the years since the covid-19 pandemic. In any case, Pixar’s upcoming projects are pretty sequel heavy, with </span><i><span>Toy Story 5</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Incredibles 3</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> all in the works. The studio’s next movie, an </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-like story called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a><span>, is coming to theaters on March 6.</span></p>

              <p>I’ve purchased few collector’s editions in my time. I never know where I’m gonna put the damn things, I often end up selling the stuff later on, and, well, sometimes you hear and see horror stories that dissuade you from shelling out two or three times the cost of a game to just get some ugly plastic junk. Sadly, it seems that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269">excellent <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta</i></a> has that very problem, with its special edition containing a diorama that sounds neat in practice, but is actually pretty ugly and disappointing according to fans.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/us/en/topics/2529/">Advertised as a pretty neat-looking diorama</a> of a memorable scene from early in <i>Snake Eater</i> when Snake has to recover his backpack from a hanging tree branch, fans on r/metalgearsolid are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2na11/mgs_delta_collectors_edition_is_trash/">sharing their disappointment</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2y9gf/that_200_is_feeling_way_worse/">with the actual product</a>. The foliage not only doesn’t match what was advertised, but in some cases it looks like it was just tossed in there, with some stuff laying on its side. Oh, and the model of Snake? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2qr02/major_do_you_read_me_this_is_snek/">Yeesh</a>. I’ll also add that Snake is supposed to call Major Zero on the radio <i>after</i> he gets the backpack, so like omg this scene just totally disrespects the lore.</p>   <p>If you managed to get your hands on the Japanese or European versions of <i>Delta</i>’s collector’s edition, however, you likely have a much prettier piece of shelf decoration. In Japan it retails for 38,500 yen or around 260 bucks, a bit more than it did here, but the bust of Snake it comes with isn’t just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n3a9kd/the_collector_eu_is_beautiful/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">satisfyingly detailed</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2sipk/snake_finally_complete/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the pale viper wrapped around him</a> <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-japan-collectors-edition-includes-snake-bust/">as matches the advertisements</a>; it also features a lovely reference to one of the game’s ending scenes in the white and red flowers blooming around its base.</p>   <p>So if you’re an <i>MGS</i> sicko like myself, and you do have shelf space to spare, definitely figure out how you can get your hands on the overseas version of this collector’s edition.</p>

<p>Albeit a port of an older game, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the big third-party launch titles for the Nintendo Switch 2. And while the game was both available in both digital and physical form, players clearly had a preference for how they wanted the game.</p>



<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/08/cd-projekt-group-presentation-h1-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">earnings report</a>, CD Projekt Red revealed that of the game’s sales on the console, more than 75% of players bought the physical version of Cyberpunk 2077. </p>



<p>CD Projekt Red joint CEO Michał Novakovski believes that the game sold well physically on the system because they included the full game, including the Phantom Liberty expansion, on the 64GB game card. Novakovski said that they believe players find the “plug and play experience” attractive. He added that the Switch 2 enhancements for the game helped push it to a new audience, but he does think digital sales will pick up moving forward.</p>



<p><strong>“This dominance of physical sales continues into the current quarter with additional stock orders coming in,”</strong> he said. <strong>“In the long run, we expect the breakdown of sales between these channels to reflect our past experiences with the share of digital sales progressively increasing as time goes by. It’s worth noting that physical and digital sales channels have different economics. Digital sales naturally yield higher net revenue, while physical copies involve additional manufacturing and packaging costs as well as distributor fees.”</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 brings back Battlefield 2042’s popular Portal game mode. If you can’t wait until BF6’s launch to see what it features, a Battlefield 6 Portal gameplay footage leak has given us all a sneak peek of what to expect—did someone say Battlefield 6 meets Only Up?</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> has returned. With the open beta now way behind us, it’s time for Labs participants to get back into testing and ensure the FPS sequel is primed and ready for its October launch. But, like with Labs before, you can expect leaked footage to appear from time to time. A new video has surfaced showing off Battlefield 6’s revamped Portal mode.</p>







<figure><figcaption>No limits to your imagination. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>EA and Battlefield Studios are promising some wild scenes with the new and improved Portal mode. Players can build their own maps, and as we’ve seen in a new leak from <a href="https://x.com/TheBFWire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Wire</a>—even homages to hit indie games.</p>



<p>A full 5-minute video shows off Battlefield 6’s Portal mode in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">returning Labs test</a>. It’s not the most compelling footage, admittedly, and will be a mere taste of the creations and chaos the community is bound to concoct. But in the video, the tester has assembled a mammoth-sized structure, intricately designed to be climbed.</p>



<p>Comments on the video compare the footage to that of Only Up—the viral 2023 game in which you have to climb an entire landscape until you reach the top, risking total failure if you fall. Once at the top, the Battlefield 6 player looks down, and a full-blown firefight is taking place atop the structure.</p>



<div><article><p><span>BREAKING: Leaked Battlefield 6 Portal Gameplay 👀 </span></p></article></div>



<p>BF6 devs claim <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-mode-will-keep-the-game-fresh-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s Portal Mode will keep the game fresh for years</a>. To be honest, I don’t doubt it, and I’m excited to see what some creative people are capable of building in Portal.</p>



<p>Did you play much of Battlefield Portal in 2042? Do you already have ideas of what you want to make in Battlefield 6? Let us know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Sure, Kairos is a planet ruled by an all-powerful dictator who enforces his whims on the population with invasive behavior-altering technology that has a high likelihood of killing you if it's removed, but compared to everything else happening right now--*frantically waves arms*--that's not a dealbreaker.</p><p>The gap between Borderlands 4 being officially announced and its arrival on PC and console has been relatively short. Gearbox first showed off the game--after hinting at it for months--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/">during the 2024 edition of Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, teasing a new world for Vault Hunters to explore and even more loot to grab as they fight against the sinister forces in control of Kairos.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKjgWa7cpCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dKjgWa7cpCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The last few months have seen Gearbox reveal a substantial number of details about the game, including detailed looks at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">four Vault Hunters</a> players will have the option of playing as. There's the science-powered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-finally-introduces-harlowe-the-teams-own-mad-scientist/1100-6534213/">Harlowe</a>, walking Tediore weapons advert <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-character-short-introduces-rafas-violent-past/1100-6533568/">Rafa</a>, not-so-gentle giant <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-character-short-introduces-amon-and-his-vault-monster-killing-arsenal/1100-6533957/">Amon</a>, and the Siren <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-borderlands-4-trailers-introduce-latest-siren-character-show-off-necromancer-abilities/1100-6533123/">Vex</a> for this new adventure.</p><p>Gearbox also recently spoke about the tone of the game, and how the studio strived to create a grounded sense of humor. Surprisingly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-developers-credit-borderlands-3-dlcs-for-inspiring-the-sequels-tone/1100-6534241/">the Borderlands 3 expansions served as a big source of inspiration</a>. Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has announced a new process for validating the age of users and comply with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/25/welcome-to-the-new-internet/">UK’s controversial Online Safety Act</a>. Thankfully, Valve’s path to confirm your age is much less intrusive than the one we’ve seen many social media companies and tech giants taking.</p>
<p>From now on, UK-based users looking to visit Steam store pages for mature rated games and their community hubs will require you to be logged into an active user account and opt-in for mature content. This does mean there’s no more blindly clicking through a quick date picker without logging in, which was useful for casually browsing.</p>


<p>Of course, this will now need a new process to verify a user’s age, and in the UK your age is considered verified so long as there is a valid credit or debit card stored on the account – while Valve stated “credit card”, banks issue different debit cards to customers who are above and below 18 years of age and perform age and identity checks for their accounts, so they should still provide the same age checks in this process.</p>
<p>This stands in stark contrast to AI-based age guesstimation using phone cameras – some of which were initially fooled by the photo mode in Death Stranding – or demands for passport and drivers licenses to validate. Steam is a storefront, so it’s reasonable to expect a payment method for validation. As excessive as the legislation is, both for the demands being imposed on companies, users and online communities and for the dampening effect this has on important kinds of speech and knowledge, this is a relatively low key approach from Valve.</p>
<p>It is, however, a shame that other options are not available. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/xbox-adds-age-verification-in-the-uk-for-the-online-safety-act/">Age verification on Xbox is to be fully enforced from early 2026</a>, and you can prove your age using government-issued ID, age estimation, mobile provider check, or credit card checks. I’d like to see Valve add mobile checks as well – you need to provide a phone number as part of adding a credit card anyway, and that’s also a decent datapoint.</p>

<p>Valve commits to processing this data in a manner that is identical to their rest of its data processing for purchases and payments, using an internal payment processing system that meets PCI-DSS standards. If, however, your given card fails the age check, you will need to contact your bank and go through a Steam support process.</p>
<p>Here’s the process for Steam users to follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into your Steam user account.</li>
<li>Visit the Account Details page and click the button labeled “Add a Payment method to this account”.</li>
<li>You will be redirected to a form where you are asked to enter your credit card details.<br>
Required inputs:
<ul>
<li>Credit Card type</li>
<li>Credit card number</li>
<li>CVV</li>
<li>Expiry date</li>
<li>Name and billing address</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click “Continue” to trigger a £0 authorization.</li>
<li>You will be presented with a challenge that is determined by your card issuing bank’s policies, e.g. via one-time-password (OTP) or via app.</li>
<li>If the process is successful, you can now choose to add previously unavailable mature content types on the Store Preferences page.</li>
</ol>

<figure><a title="Fear Effect" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/31abc5797e520/fear-effect.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Almost out of the blue, Limited Run Games' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fear_effect">Fear Effect</a> port has arrived on the Switch eShop... right now! Yep, you can go and download the PS1 classic from the eShop for just <strong>$9.99 / £8.99</strong> (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/fear-effect-for-ps5-ps4-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>The release comes with almost no fanfare, as neither Limited Run Games nor developer Implicit Conversions (who is working with Atari and Digital Eclipse on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>) have said anything about the game dropping today at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Still, we thought it was coming as the game arrived on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/cult-classic-ps1-adventure-fear-effect-is-suddenly-available-on-ps5-ps4">PS4 and PS5 earlier today</a> with the same lack of fanfare — some people thought it was even a mistake.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rluqjp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We've actually known about this rerelease for a while, as Limited Run Games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/acclaimed-ps1-hit-fear-effect-is-coming-to-switch-in-2025">announced it last year</a>, but it's been radio silence ever since. Now we've got the game on a Nintendo console for the first time ever.</p>
<p>In case you haven't heard of the game before, Fear Effect is a 2000 PS1 game that pioneered cel-shaded visuals and looping FMV backgrounds, which forced the game to be shipped on four discs. While the controls and gameplay received mild criticism at the time, the narrative, writing, and visuals were all lauded, and the game has become a bit of a classic for PlayStation fans.</p>

            <p>Are you sitting down, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>? It's alright. I've just got...some news I need to tell you. There's no easy way to say this. A modder's decided to put a bunch of Fortnitey emotes and dances inside you.</p>
<p>We can see the likes of dabs, the NaeNae, and even a stanky legg on the scans. They're cranking it, spanking that, and Snoop Dogging all over your internal organs too. There's nothing we could have done. That surgery which ported you from 2006 to 2025 increased the risk of this drastically, but how else were 12 year olds supposed to learn about the need to CLOSE SHUT THE JAWS OF OBLIVION?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We could rage against the cause of these symptoms, modder CosmicBoogaloo with their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/5039?tab=description">Dance and Emote Animation Pack</a>. We could curse them in the name of the divines, of the Aedra, or even the Daedra. We could subjugate ourselves before Dagon himself, calling on his lust for revolution to grant us the malign powers required to reverse this regrettable chain of events.</p>
<p>We could crusade with the fury of Pelinal Whitestrake against any and all who download the mod, and go on to press one of the keys it assigns a Fortnitey dance or emote to. We could cast their characters, mid-subtle dab or weird bottomless twerk, into the fiery pits of The Deadlands, where they'd inevitably float around going 'UGGGH', 'OOOOAGGHH', and 'NYYYYUUGGHHH'.</p>

<p>We could outlaw its 19 emotes and 20 dances, including the ability to make it rain despite the fact that this province lacks paper money and criss crosses you can dougie into a running man before movin' like Bernie. We could instruct every legion guard to stop violators of this anti-taunting legislation with deadly force. We could yell from the summit of the White-Gold Tower: 'You there in the Arena district, cease flexing those muscles and woohooing at once, or else incur the wrath of mighty Akatosh!'</p>
<p>We could do all of that, but it wouldn't matter. Those who wish to use this profane mod have likely already grabbed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/UE4SS%20for%20Oblivion%20Remastered">UE4SS</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1172">Simple BP Mod Loader</a>. </p>
<p>The dabbage is irreversible.</p>
