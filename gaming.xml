            <p>Former Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra has slammed Marvel Rivals, intimating its an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> clone.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted tweet posted yesterday, Ybarra called NetEase Games' free-to-play team-based PVP shooter "Overwatch Marvel Rivals", adding that much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-also-coming-to-ps5-of-all-platforms">Light of Motiram</a> is "a clear copy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>", Marvel Rivals clearly took inspiration from Blizzard's own team-based PVP shooter, Overwatch.</p>

<p>Epic Games recently unveiled Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person shooter built into the game’s core platform. It’s a competitive shooter by nature, boasting both a ranked and unranked ecosystem, and it has been designed to mimic one of the best-known esports operating models in the world.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in early access on December 11 – but let’s talk about the game’s potential to disrupt the established Fortnite esports paradigm.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ballistic-will-change-the-fortnite-scene">Ballistic Will Change the Fortnite Scene</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite Ballistic</a> is a tactical shooter that borrows elements from Counter-Strike 2 and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Each game is split up into several rounds, and the model follows the traditional ‘attackers vs. defenders’ structure that we know from so many other games. In Ballistic, Attackers need to carry a Rift Point Device to one of two sites on the map and plant it while the defending team tries to prevent that from happening.</p>



<p>That’s as cut and dry as it gets in the esports world, and it’s a system mirrored by Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, and other games.</p>



<p>It’s a first-to-seven game, which means each series will be a lengthy one.</p>



<p>Like other titles, Fortnite Ballistic gives players the bare minimum when they start each match. They’ll have a Ranger Pistol and 800 credits, and they’ll need to manage their eco appropriately as the game unfolds, earning more credits for eliminating enemies and planting the Rift Point Device.</p>



<p>In many ways, this is the most cookie-cutter model possible, but in others, it could be a boon for the Fortnite esports ecosystem that has been sorely missing after many years of battle royale rotations.</p>



<p>In Ballistic, weapons and equipment have been tapered to a select few items, to keep things as balanced as possible. In place of abilities (like VALORANT), players can use ‘Flex Gadgets’ such as the Proximity Mine, Bubble Shield, and Recon Grenade to gain an edge over their opponents.</p>



<p>It sounds like a dream for competitive FPS fans, and the fact that it’s built in Fortnite – a free-to-play title – means that it’ll have a huge draw at launch on December 11. There will be a ranked and unranked offering for players to soak up, and new settings will be introduced to the game to address the addition of a first-person perspective.</p>



<p>It’s only launching with one map, but imagine what things will look like when there is a host of maps and more equipment to flick through. This could be a cultural shift for the Fortnite esports ecosystem.</p>

			<p>Epic Games has just <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1865395948362293652" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprised</a> fans with the reveal of Fortnite Ballistic, an upcoming 5v5 tactical first-person competitive game mode launching next week on the popular Battle Royale game. Due to debut in early access on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will release with a single map (Skyline 10), a starting set of weapons and a limited number of items. Epic plans to add more content and make changes based on player's feedback post-launch.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a Fortnite Ballistic match, players are divided into attackers and defenders, like in Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, for example. Before the start, they can choose one of five Flex Gadgets to use during the match. Attackers have the goal of planting a reality-shattering Rift Point Device at one of two locations on the map, while defenders must foil their plan at all costs. A round is over when the Rift Point Device explodes or one of the teams is completely eliminated. After six rounds, players switch sides. The session ends when one team has won a total of 7 rounds.</p>
<p>In Fortnite Ballistic, players can buy their chosen gadget and keep two of their Flex Gadgets in their inventory each round. These cannot be dropped or picked up by other players. When used correctly, Flex Gadgets can make a difference in the outcome of a round. A few examples: plant booby traps with the Proximity Mine, shield the team with the Bubble Shield, mark nearby enemies with the Recon Grenade, and flush out foes with the Frag Grenade or Impulse Grenade.</p>
<p>From the get-go, players will get to pick between Unranked and Ranked matches. The former option offers a more casual experience and provides backfill for players who drop out of matches. Ranked play, on the other hand, is for those who want to test their skills against other players in a competitive environment where the winning team gains rank and the losing team loses rank. Moreover, Ranked matches are not backfilled. Players who leave ranked matches will receive a rank penalty and will not be able to join another match for a period of time. Matchmaking in Ranked Fortnite Ballistic will be based on a party's average rank.</p>
<p>What do you think about this new mode? Does it interest you, or will you stick to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-season-og-rumored-to-return-permanently-starting-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanently returned Fortnite OG</a>?</p>

<p>Epic Games has lifted the lid on Fortnite Ballistic, an all-new first-person experience built <strong>inside </strong>Fortnite. It’s launching in early access on December 11 with both ranked and unranked modes. It’ll serve as another angle to the Fortnite competitive ecosystem that players have loved for many years, but this time, the perspective has been completely altered.</p>



<p>In a post on the Fortnite blog, it was revealed that Fortnite Ballistic will launch into early access with <strong>one map</strong> – Skyline 10. It’ll drop with a select assortment of weapons and items, and as the community explores the game, Epic will make the necessary adjustments.</p>



<p>The new perspective starts here.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-introducing-fortnite-ballistic">Introducing: Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a no-build competitive shooter that utilises the Fortnite platform in a much more intense way. It’s a no-holds-barred, 5v5 first-person shooter that’s broken down by rounds. Players are free to use their presets from the core platform, which means they’ll be able to use outfits, wraps, sprays, emotes, and more in Ballistic.</p>



<p>When it drops on December 11, Fortnite Ballistic will be available on all platforms and regions where Fortnite is supported <strong>except </strong>South Korea and Russia, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-goes-first-person-with-ballistic-a-tactical-5v5-shooter-launching-in-early-access-dec-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post revealed</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s how it works:</p>



<p>To start the match, players are sorted into two teams, attacking and defending. The attackers will try to plant a device at site A or site B on the map, while the defenders try to defend said sites. It’s the most typical competitive operating model we know, and it’s replicated in the likes of Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Counter-Strike, and VALORANT.</p>



<p>Continuing the CS/VALORANT vibe, players will start each round with a pistol and credits, and as they play, they’ll unlock <strong>more </strong>credits, and thus better weapons and equipment.</p>



<p>It’ll have ranked and unranked modes from the get-go.</p>

            <p>Good news, Pokémon fans - Pokémon TV is back.</p>
<p>Pokémon TV, the app and website that let you watch episodes from the long-running Pokémon anime for free, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tv-app-axed-leaving-episodes-scattered-between-paid-streaming-services">was removed from app stores earlier this year</a>, but now it's returned, albeit in a new home on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@OfficialPoke%CC%81monTV">YouTube</a> and with a truncated library.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the official Pokémon TV YouTube channel, where you can explore the world of Pokémon with Ash &amp; Pikachu!" announces the channel description. "Experience some of the most iconic moments from their adventure with our full episodes, live streams, compilations, and so much more!"</p>
<p>Right now only nine episodes from the first season are available, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRcHmntfmJ8CnSmj4C284-a1euH518aQa">playlist itself</a> seemingly contains another 16 unpublished videos, so it looks like more episodes are on the way.</p>
<p>The app's removal in March was especially upsetting given after that point, Pokéfans were unable to follow the saga of Ash Ketchum - and beyond - without needing to subscribe to a streaming service.</p>
<p>Now, however, it looks as though Pokémon has found a new home where fans can once again follow Ash for free.</p>
<p>In related Pokémon news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reportedly-surpassed-200m-in-first-month">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket is thought to have raked in over $200m during its first month of launch</a>.</p>
<p>The mobile card game managed to reach $208m in gross revenue on 29th November. That's roughly £164m for those of us here in the UK, with that figure being across both the App Store and Google Play. The report also said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a>'s average daily player spending was $6.5m during its first month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players will be split into two teams, with one that has to plant the bomb — sorry, I mean the “Rift Point Device” — and another that has to defend against that.

Teams will switch sides after six rounds, and the first to win seven rounds will be crowned the victor.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Epic has cribbed a game idea for <em>Fortnite: </em>its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23993046/fortnite-is-going-full-speed-ahead">racing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">festival</a> modes both borrow a lot from Psyonix’s <em>Rocket League</em> and Harmonix’s <em>Rock Band</em> (Epic owns both studios), the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego</em> survival mode</a> has a lot of similarities to <em>Minecraft</em>, and Epic even admitted that the (now-gone) Impostors mode <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722606/epic-games-fortnite-imposters-mode-copy-among-us-credit">was inspired by <em>Among Us</em></a>. Heck, the game’s main battle royale mode was actually a spinoff that followed the success of <em>PUBG</em>.</p><p>But now that Epic is trying to make <em>Fortnite</em> into something more akin to <em>Roblox</em> (another inspiration!), where players are encouraged to sample lots of experiences instead of just one, modes like Ballistic and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/21/24183255/its-going-to-be-a-busy-weekend-in-fortnite">Reload</a><em> </em>let Epic experiment with different ideas without changing the core battle royale experience. And since your purchased <em>Fortnite</em> outfits and gear generally work across all of the modes, there’s a financial incentive for Epic to add more experiences, too.</p><p>Ballistic launches in early access on December 11th. <em>Fortnite</em> creators will be able to publish their <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24258447/fortnite-creators-first-person-shooters-fps-unreal-editor">own experiences</a> with first-person modes <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1864747437384176063">that same day</a>.</p><div><p><em>Ballistic</em> is arriving during an already busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The game’s Japanese-themed season kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24309607/new-chapter-new-island">at the beginning of the week</a>, and on Friday, Epic launched the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">permanent version of its throwback OG mode</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Be warned that if you win a round by detonating the Rift Point Device, you might still die in the explosion, which is going to be an interesting wrinkle for teams who have to defend the armed bomb from a team that wants to disarm it. The first team to win seven rounds takes the whole match.</p><p>In its announcement for the mode, Epic describes Ballistic as being "early access," rather than a fully featured new mode. That tracks with the fact that Ballistic will have just a single map at launch, the city-based Skyline 10.</p><p>Fortnite Ballistic will arrive with both ranked and unranked varieties. In ranked, the game will not backfill your team with new players if your allies leave--but if your game crashes or disconnects, you'll actually have a three-minute grace period to get back in, something Fortnite has never allowed in an official mode before. And, yes, there are leaver penalties in ranked Ballistic, including a short matchmaking ban.</p><p>Despite being a first-person mode, Fortnite Ballistic will support most of Fortnite's cosmetics, including skins and emotes.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Ballistic is a new 5v5 mode launching next week in early access within the main Fortnite client. 
</p>
<p>
It's also Epic Games' first proper foray into first-person for Fortnite - a move that has been long-awaited by some fans.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic arrives on Wednesday 11th December with one map - Skyline 10 - plus a limited number of weapons and items. These will all be expanded over time based on player feedback, Epic Games has said. 
</p>
<p>
Matches begin with players sorted into teams of either attackers or defenders. Attackers must deploy a payload - a Rift Point Device - while defenders must stop them. Players swap sides after six rounds, and the game is over when one team wins a seventh round in total.
</p><p>
If it all sounds a bit <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> or Valorant, well, there's clearly inspiration here. But, of course, Fortnite is already full of character skins - which will all be supported - and so the different loadouts you get here seem more customisable.

<p>
Each match begins with players picking one of five Flex Gadgets, such as proxy mines, bubble shields, and different types of grenade that can launch you (and your enemies) or mark them for your teammates. 
</p>
<p>
As with most other Fortnite shooter modes, Ballistic will host both Ranked and Unranked modes, with the former offering a ladder to climb and penalities if you leave matches. 
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fortnite Ballistic follows yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-og-will-rotate-chapter-1-seasons-every-couple-of-months">arrival of Fortnite OG as a newly-permanent mode</a>, and last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-6-season-1-map">launch of Chapter 6 for the game's main battle royale</a> offering. 
</p>
<p>
Next up? Epic Games has already begun teasing a fresh update for its main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode that seems like it may feature the Storm King...

There is no word yet on whether the streaming version of <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> will come with any extra content, like behind-the-scenes videos, cast interviews, or a Director’s Cut that can make better sense of this confusingly bad film. On the bright side for this movie, there are a few examples of films gaining new life in streaming. </p><p>DC Films’&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em> was a box office smash, grossing over $749 million worldwide, but was maligned by critics for its inconsistent plot, Batman’s pervy kiss on Harley Quinn, and some of the most confusing powers.

<p>These are the second round of layoffs this year alone. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-true-colors-studio-deck-nine-lays-off-20-of-staff">Deck Nine also laid off around 20 percent of its workforce back in February</a>. A couple of months later, an investigation into Deck Nine showed that although its games celebrated diversity and inclusivity, its own culture allegedly fostered toxicity, hate speech, harassment, crunch, bullying, and abusive leadership as a result of inaction from senior management.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [95 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified.

She suffered too much irl that she’s become a little (very) <a title="Companies > fuzz" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/fuzz">fuzz</a>y in the head. Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!

        <p><strong>The Story</strong></p><p>The game takes place in the near future, where warped monsters and ghouls have appeared from nowhere, swarming cities and forcing humans to battle against these creatures they’ve termed “demons” in an all-out Demon War. After 30 merciless years of war, the surviving humans have banded together under the Missa Association, a religious group formed by a leader who knows the secret to fighting the demons. Cities and civilizations continue to thrive despite the now regular sightings of bizarre monsters.</p><p>Three years ago, a man known as Shin was rescued from among the rubble in a cryopreserved state. With no recollection of his past, he quickly becomes one of the association’s best warriors and protectors.</p><p>However, when Shin comes across the brilliantly beautiful demon named Lux, she feels strangely familiar. This sensation of deja vu leads him to take her in, even if it means going against the creeds of the association.</p><p>From that very instant, the past begins to slowly unfold, revealing the events that caused the city to take on its current form…</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>In this exploration-heavy 2D action game, you will use your demon blade to interfere with the past, create new platforms, and shield yourself from danger to explore a desolate world.</p><p>Other than the Lumina Sword, you will also have access to other weapons such as swift daggers and long-range guns. Find the perfect weapons to suit your fighting style.</p><p>Upon leveling up, you will receive points that can be spent on unlocking skills that will aid you on your journey.</p><p>The whole game is depicted in Team Ladybug’s critically acclaimed gorgeously animated pixel art, in which each and every frame is painstakingly detailed. Feast your eyes on the harsh yet beautiful dystopian cyberpunk world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Blade Chimera - Release Date Trailer (English)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j3C8-lx4ACM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Blade Chimera - Release Date Trailer (Japanese)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FlmDY7kTdzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="Blade Chimera - Release Date Trailer (Simplified Chinese)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ls1mDXvlmIM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is a two-player game played on two devices. Although it is a <a title="Genres > Co-Op [217 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>, what you see on the screens of both players is completely different.</p><p>For example, although they should be looking at the same person, to one it looks like a storybook animal character, while to the other it looks like a robot. (The difference in perception causes the objects on the field to work differently in each world.) Players share what only they can see with their partner through conversation. They continue their journey by cooperating to solve riddles and puzzles. Players can also play online while talking to each other at a distance.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The basic game system is a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [854 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> puzzle adventure with a two-player cooperative element. During the course of the story, players are faced with a number of critical choices. Depending on the choices made, the story will unfold in several different ways.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Two boys who ran away from home discover a “dead deer” on their journey.</p><p>Seeing it, they faint and everything they see in each other’s eyes becomes different.</p><p>One is the world of animals, the other is the world of machines. The boys must unravel the mystery that happened to them.</p><p>Can they return to their original world?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>The main difference between this game and other games is that you need a partner to play with.</li><li>You cannot play this game alone or against the computer (CPU).</li><li>Two players are always required.</li><li>In other words, this game starts by deciding “Who will you play with?” The game starts with the decision of “who to play with.”</li><li>The total playing time is about three to four hours. During that time, the two players discuss with each other and reconcile their perceptions, solve problems, and make critical decisions</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="&quot;BOKURA&quot; PS5/PS4 Release Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/853b-HiuusU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="『違う冬のぼくら』PS5/PS4 リリース告知トレーラー" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh29qagYthU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Simplified Chinese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《不同的冬天》PS5/PS4 版本发布公告" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn9u55DULcg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
