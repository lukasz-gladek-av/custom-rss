			<p>In 2024, Nacon Studio Milan confirmed that its multiplayer co-op game, Terminator: Survivors, would <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-survivors-has-been-delayed-to-2025/">no longer be released that year as previously planned</a>, and would instead arrive on PC and consoles sometime in 2025. Now, with a little more than two weeks left in 2025, Nacon Studio Milan <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725">has confirmed</a> that Terminator: Survivors has been delayed and will not be released in 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from a post on the game's Steam page, where the developer outlines its goals with Terminator: Survivors, and not only confirms its delay, but also confirms that it has made a major change in direction. Terminator: Survivors will no longer include a co-operative multiplayer component, and will now be an entirely single-player game.</p>



<p>Nacon Studio Milan also confirms that the game will no longer launch as an early access title, and will instead launch in its full 1.0 state whenever it is ready, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>Our aim with Terminator: Survivors has always been to bring you an authentic and immersive open-world Terminator experience that recreates the harsh reality of Skynet's uprising, and the resilience of humanity in spite of it</em>," the post reads. <em>"After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we cam to the conclusion that to give you an authentic 'Terminator' experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer."</em></p>



<p>"<em>We know this may come as a disappointment, but we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgement Day. We've also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access, we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience.</em> <em>You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won't be launching in 2025. We don't have a new date locked in, but we'll let you know when we're ready to share a new release date</em>."</p>



<p>Considering the fact that we went the whole year up until now without hearing from Nacon Studio Milan on Terminator: Survivors, the news of the delay wasn't exactly surprising, but the rest of it certainly is. You don't expect to hear about a game like this changing direction in a serious way, partly through development.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they get it in their hands, and to see if we'll be able to decipher what elements of the final game may have been left over from its previous approach to the Nacon Studio Milan took all the way through to the game's launch. </p>



<p>In the meantime, if you're really hankering for a Terminator game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-once-again-still-launch-in-2025/">Terminator 2D: No Fate was able to get out the door before the end of 2025</a>, and launched on PC and consoles just a few days ago.</p>

                <p>If you've come across The Stench of Corruption quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you may be wondering how to find and complete each of its objectives. It can be challenging to round up each location you need to visit, after all, and find out exactly what to interact with in each spot. Luckily, we've got you covered below.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to knock out The Stench of Corruption, follow the steps below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</a></li><li><a href="#Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</a></li><li><a href="#Search_the_room_for_any_clues_of_the_saboteur_s_identity">Search the room for any clues of the saboteur's identity</a></li><li><a href="#Reach_the_tunnels_below_the_Spaceport">Reach the tunnels below the Spaceport</a></li><li><a href="#Use_the_key_on_any_Flushing_Terminal_to_override_the_bypass_protocol">Use the key on any Flushing Terminal to override the bypass protocol</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</h2><p>Your first stop is the Departure Building on Spaceport, which can be found near the middle of the map, just west of the Launch Tower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282" data-ratio="0.56416028815849" data-width="2221" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282"></a><figcaption>Departure Building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg"></figure><p>Since you'll be visiting the southwest lobby for the next part of the quest, we'd recommend approaching the building from that direction anyway.</p><h2 id="Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</h2><p>The staff locker room is located in the southwest lobby on the bottom floor of the Departure Building.

These My Arcade Mighty Players are a bit cheaper than the Arcade1Up Countercades and their $150 price tag--however, a few Countercades are currently on sale for $130, making them worth a closer look ahead of the holidays. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-Ms-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Class of '81 Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga Countercade</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Countercade-Classic-Portable-Table-top/dp/B0DJGHWD1G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man Countercade</a>.</p><p>The former includes Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and DigDug, while the latter offers Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, and Pac-Mania. Both include a 7-inch LCD display (which is quite a bit larger than the 3.5-inch display of My Arcade), so be sure to give them a look while they're on sale.</p><p>Interested in other retro gaming solutions?

            <title><![CDATA[Warner Bros. Expected To Reject Paramount’s Latest Offer, Sticking With Netflix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-expected-to-reject-paramounts-latest-offer-sticking-with-netflix/</link>
            <guid>1385380</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest development in the saga between Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), Netflix, and Paramount, it appears that WBD is sticking with its original agreement with Netflix.</p>



<p>According to a new report from Bloomberg, the WBD Board of Directors is planning on telling investors to reject Paramount’s latest bid for the company. The report states that the Board’s decision is based on what they believe to be a better offer from Netflix.</p>







<p>“After deliberating and reviewing the Paramount bid, the Warner Bros. board still views the company’s existing agreement with&nbsp;Netflix Inc.&nbsp;as offering greater value, certainty and terms than what Paramount has proposed,” the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-16/warner-bros-said-to-prep-paramount-rejection-on-funding-terms?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> (paywall) reads.</p>



<p>WBD and Netflix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first announced a deal</a> that would see the Warner side of the company be acquired in a deal worth $82.7 billion in total enterprise value and $27.75 per share. The Paramount proposal, that came after the Netflix deal was announce, was for the entirety of the company for $30 per share. That offer seemingly put the value of the television networks and other aspects of the company at a value of just $2.25 per share, if you want to keep the same $27.75 value of the WBD Streaming &amp; Services side.</p>







<p>The news of the rejection shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Not long after receiving the “hostile” and “unsolicited” offer from Paramount, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-paramount-offer-warner-bros-wont-change-netflix-sale-recommendation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WBD release stated</a> that the board wouldn’t be “modifying its recommendation” of the Netflix deal.</p>



<p>It should be mentioned, however, that just because the Board recommends the Netflix deal be chosen, there is always the possibility that the investors vote otherwise. If the Netflix deal moves forward, however, the streaming giant’s acquisition of Warner Bros. is planned to close after WBD completes its split into two companies in 2026. Should that happen, Netflix would own all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warner Bros. Games properties</a>, including Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and more. </p>

                <p>Steam Replay for 2025 is now available, giving players a fun way to look back at their year in gaming. It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.</p><p>Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Earlier today Bloomberg's Jason Schreier published an<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify+wall&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>interview</u></a><u> </u>with Swen Vincke, the CEO of Larian, the company behind the internet's favourite video game and demonic relationship simulator <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. It could not have gone worse for the guy.</p><p>Among all the expected pre-release interview talk about how their next game, <em>Divinity</em>, will be making all kinds of improvements over their last game, there was this:</p><blockquote>Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in<em>&nbsp;Divinity</em>&nbsp;— “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</blockquote><blockquote>The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</blockquote><p>The quote made an audible record scratch on social media before leading to a ton of blowback from<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kortizart.bsky.social/post/3ma4rztk2yk2m?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>artists</u></a> and<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bryantfrancis.me/post/3ma4d2dzp5225?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>beyond</u></a>, so much so that Vincke<a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>took to Twitter to try to explain himself</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Holy fuck guys we’re not "pushing hard" for or replacing concept artists with AI.<p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p><p>I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.</p><p>We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.</p><p><a href="https://gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more</a>.</p><p>We've hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.</p></blockquote><p>Which only made things worse! Because instead of explaining himself, all his follow-up showed is that Vincke does not appear to understand what it is that his art teams actually do, or indeed how their art is made.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua/app.bsky.feed.post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihaduvsxwn6krehu2wr32fvxnqadpx4xk7pcafz3c75cu42pdwcei"><p lang="en">consider my feedback: i loved working at @larianstudios.com until AI. reconsider and change your direction, like, yesterday. show your employees some respect. they are world-class &amp; do not need AI assistance to come up with amazing ideas.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">anoxicart🍤 (@anoxicart.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:eioch6ru2ibkm7uabsa3vzua/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-16T16:20:58.862Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>That's OK, Swen, let me explain it for you! Firstly, any use of AI fucking sucks. It's a creative, economic and societal disaster, so really, there's no excusing its use in any circumstances. That's why people got so upset about the initial quote. But to get more specific, let's take a look at your justification.</p><p>Saying you only use AI for "reference" is wild. Artists use image searches and books as inspiration because they are drawing on art (but also everything else from colour palettes to photos to the weather). There's experience there, things they can relate to, be inspired by. There is no inspiration in slop! Everything AI is presenting to you is simply stolen and amalgamated. It's like asking your phone's autocorrect for relationship advice.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you are using AI to generate ideas to explore, that is using AI in your game. This is duplicitous spin to say otherwise. The entire history of creative industry happened just fine without using AI, there is no need to shoot your game in the foot by using it now.</p>— RJ Palmer (@arvalis) <a href="https://twitter.com/arvalis/status/2001019435776418179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>There's an unsurprising tendency across leaders in the tech world (games included) to see art as merely part of something's production line, a box that needs to be ticked before copies can be sold. It's why AI is often justified as something that saves time, or saves money. But with art, that process <em>is </em>the point. The themes and ideas artists draw on, the way they iterate through those ideas with sketches, the work itself is what creates art. There are no shortcuts.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar/app.bsky.feed.post/3ma4w7yvzzs2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidmwci4fnhh4dxew67pkxmgcgjsx6bco2zotg4f2oax7a2v2zd5wy"><p lang="en">In a lot of ways, Larian was a poster child (alongside folks like Remedy) for how retaining a team and continuing to refine a toolset makes seemingly impossible things achievable.

Why spend 2 years talking about how critical this was to BG3's existence--and then say major parts of it don't matter?</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Xalavier Nelson Jr. (@writnelson.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:oblggmviqritnt4hx4i7qgar/post/3ma4w7yvzzs2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-16T19:50:58.603Z</a></blockquote></figure>

                <p>The success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> went far beyond anyone's expectations with 20 million copies sold and multiple Game of the Year awards. That was all very good for the future of Larian, but it's also creating some pressure now that the developer focuses on its latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game.</p><p>"It's more pressure," Larian founder Swen Vincke told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/swen-vincke-says-theres-definitely-more-pressure-to-nail-divinity-after-the-smash-success-of-baldurs-gate-3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Vincke also indicated that the team at Larian believed that making Divinity would be easier after the studio's experience with Baldur's Gate 3. But that turned out to not be the case.</p><p>"When we started on this, it was like, 'Oh, we know how to do this,'" added Vincke. "By now, we've been humbled by the development experience, by the actual development again: No, we don't know anything. We have to relearn everything, but we do have the experience of the past with us. Every game has its own language that you need to learn."</p><p>Vincke recently came under fire for saying that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">Larian uses some generative AI</a> in game development. He subsequently said that AI is not being used to replace human artists, and that generative AI is used to "explore things" and that it allows artists to "experiment" and "make their lives easier." He added that there will be no generative-AI-created content in Divinity.</p><p>According to Vincke, Divinity will probably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-will-likely-be-an-early-access-game-just-like-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6537011/" data-ref-id="1100-6537011">get an early-access release</a> like Baldur's Gate 3 did. But he didn't fully commit to that and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

			<p>Larian Studios made quite the splash at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a> when it revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">its next project would be Divinity,</a> a continuation of the other major fantasy RPG series under its belt, and the one that's actually bigger than Baldur's Gate 3. Even though the reveal was <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/">spoiled ahead of the actual show</a>, it was still one of the night's highlights and had everyone excited about what's coming next from Larian.</p>



<p>Now, the tone around Larian Studios has changed, just days after The Game Awards, thanks to some recent comments and confirmation from the studio's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke. <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">In a recent interview with Bloomberg</a>, Vincke confirmed a few interesting tidbits about Divinity. Like Baldur's Gate 3, it'll be a turn-based RPG. Vincke also claimed that it'll be "<em>way better"</em> than Baldur's Gate 3, and the point that's making players upset online is that Vincke also confirmed Larian Studios has incorporated generative AI technology into its development pipeline.</p>



<p>On generative AI use at Larian, Vincke admitted to Bloomberg that there's been some internal pushback in the studio, but concluded that "<em>I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it</em>."</p>



<p>That may be true for some of its developers, but once the interview was live, it wasn't just players who are against generative AI use getting about Larian using the technology - it was also former Larian developers.</p>







<p>Amidst comments like this from a former Larian Studios developer and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/larianstudios/comments/1po3oz5/disappointed_in_larian_using_generative_ai_during/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">several comments on Reddit</a> and Bluesky, Vincke has responded to the backlash<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai"> with a statement sent to IGN</a>, where he tries to quell the concerns over how Larian is using generative AI and clarify that Larian isn't looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI technology, nor will it be releasing a game that includes content made by generative AI.</p>



<p>Here's the full statement below, via IGN:</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators. Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use. Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating.</em></p>



<p><em>Any ML (machine learning) tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft. We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI. While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse</em>."</p>



<p>In what you'd call less formal wording, Vincke also <a href="https://x.com/laratlarian/status/2001011042642505833">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to respond to the criticisms he and Larian Studios are facing over using generative AI.</p>

<p>If nothing else, this whole debacle has proven that generative AI technology and its use in game development are still hot-button issues that can have players turning on you in a flash. Some people, generally studio heads and company leaders, are not only fine with using GenAI, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they're also pushing for it everywhere</a>. Studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-teammates-playable-genai-experience-ceo-says-gen-ai-transform-industry-3d/">already experimenting with it</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/">using it in games</a> that <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">are currently available for you to buy right now</a>, games that have sold millions of copies.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-actor-jennifer-english-using-generative-ai-in-games-dont/">Others don't think it should be used at all</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dan-houser-calls-people-pushing-genai-not-the-most-humane-or-creative-people/">others are calling it a crutch or a sign of someone who isn't very creative to begin with</a>, if they feel the need to use generative AI. Whatever side of the debate you are on, it's clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">people care about generative AI being used in games</a>. The question remains, though, will they care enough to vote with their wallets against developers who continue to use the tech, even ones that they previously loved? </p>



<p>Apropos of nothing, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lsx5lwmsmk2j">caught earlier this year having used generative AI tech for assets that made it into the final game</a>. The studio never acknowledged the complaints and quietly patched them out. Just a few days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">it won a record number of awards at The Game Awards</a>, including Game of the Year, <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472">and according to Alinea Analytics</a>, sold another 200,000 copies following the show.</p>

But following some initial backlash, Vincke later clarified <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">to IGN</a> that the studio is “neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI” and published his own statement on X.</p><p>Larian announced <em>Divinity</em> last week at The Game Awards with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w">“cinematic” teaser trailer</a> that didn’t reveal much about the game itself.

		<p>I don’t think it is too much of a surprise that Nacon has confirmed Terminator: Survivors will not be releasing in 2025 given how close we are to the end of the year, and the lack of news over the past while. Nacon has also stated there is no confirmed new release date, and there will be some changes to the game too. The major changes are that Terminator: Survivors will now not have a co-op multiplayer mode, and there will be no Early Access. Instead, Nacon is changing its plans to release the game in full in one go.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator: Survivors | The Aftermath Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LepEDOgw0Ec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Nacon said, <em>“After months of internal testing, discussions with players and fans of the license, we came to the conclusion that to give you an authentic “Terminator” experience with the best possible shooting and exploration gameplay, we would have to put aside the cooperative multiplayer. We know this may come as a disappointment, but&nbsp;we believe it is the right creative direction for an uncompromising vision of the world after Judgment Day.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>We’ve also had to overhaul our release plans, instead of launching in early access,&nbsp;we want your first steps into the wasteland to be a complete and polished experience. You might have guessed already, but that means Terminator: Survivors won’t be launching in 2025. We don’t have a new date locked in, but we’ll let you know when we’re ready to share a new release date. <wbr>Nevertheless, your feedback is a crucial part of our development process, and so&nbsp;we’ll be organizing several closed playtests&nbsp;(under NDA) as the launch window gets closer. If you’re interested in taking part and helping us shape the future of Terminator: Survivors,&nbsp;<a tabindex="0" href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.nacongaming.com%2Fplaytests">you can sign up here</a>.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator: Survivors is a sequel to Terminator 2. The story is set in 2009, a time before John Connor’s resistance has risen up against the machines. You are a survivor and do not have much information as to what brought about the apocalypse. However, as you build up your base and scavenge through the surrounding areas, the narrative running through the game will see you learn about SkyNet, about the emerging resistance and more. The game has been confirmed for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>posted an interview with Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke in which he explained that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>and </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span> developer has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850"><span>started integrating generative AI into its workflow</span></a><span>. This is being used for PowerPoint presentations, placeholder text, and concept art, and according to Vincke, “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way [Larian is] using it.” Despite Vincke’s best efforts to contextualize the ways in which the technology is being used and his promise that no genAI would make its way into the finished product, many fans are not happy, and the statements have generated a massive backlash on social media.</span></p> <p><span>In the past few years, Larian has made a name for itself as a staunchly pro-human game developer. </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>won Game of the Year at the Game Awards, and Vincke himself gave an impassioned speech at the 2024 ceremony about how future GOTY winners would be games that didn’t “treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet” and would be made by people who “knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow.” So, as you can expect, hearing that the studio has started using AI to generate concept art and ideas has felt to some like a mask drop moment for a studio that has been so publicly supportive of human creativity.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ</span></a></p> <p><span>Vincke went on to clarify his comments in a statement to </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, saying this technology is meant to be “</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.”</span></a><span> He also doubled down on his assertion that Larian will not include generated assets in its upcoming turn-based RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><i><span>Divinity</span></i></a><span> when it launches in a few years.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has a whole lot of quests, and one set of them requires you to do some digging on who has contaminated the water supply. This questline eventually leads to A Toxic Trail, which sends you back to a previous location to figure out more about what's going on with the water. In this guide, we'll tell you how to complete A Toxic Trail.</p><p>You don't necessarily need to extract from the map to complete A Toxic Trail, but it's not a bad idea to do so, especially if you don't have a safe pocket for the key that drops at the end of the quest. While it's not required for any quests, it can help you find some good loot on the Spaceport map later.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle A Toxic Trail, read on for each step you'll need to complete.</p><h2>How to complete A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step to completing A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders is to head back to the drain where you previously found the barrel for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-source-of-the-contamination-quest-guide/1100-6535935/" data-ref-id="1100-6535935">Source of the Contamination</a> quest. This barrel can be found outside the Water Treatment Center on the Dam Battlegrounds map by approaching from the north via the swamp. Check the map below for the exact spot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157"></a><figcaption>Water Treatment Control drain location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg"></figure><p>This time, you won't need to interact with the barrel. Instead, simply walk around in this nasty water for a moment to trigger the next step of the quest, which asks you to find traces of the barrel's origin. Luckily, you won't need to travel far at all to round up where the barrel came from.</p><p>Walk to the west just a bit to find a truck in the swamp water. It's hard to miss since it's sitting out in the open, but we've marked the location on the map for you below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158"></a><figcaption>Find a truck submerged in the water here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Approach the truck and interact with the prompt that shows up to take a photo of it. Afterward, you'll receive a final task to search the trucks for clues about who sabotaged the water supply. Just interact with the door of the truck to find a Spaceport Warehouse Key. Pick it up and place it in your safe pocket, as it can come in handy for finding good loot next time you're in Spaceport.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156"></a><figcaption>This truck is the source of the contamination.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg"></figure><p>Now that you're finished with the quest, you can extract at the nearby Central Swamp Lift. Just be mindful that this area can be easily camped by other raiders, so keep your wits about you. When you return to Speranza and turn this quest in, you'll receive a follow-up quest called The Stench of Corruption, which you'll need to complete if you want to earn the Warden outfit.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>

                <p>Activision has made a couple of announcements that seem to suggest the company is trying extra hard to encourage people to buy and play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p><p>For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.</p><p>Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.</p><p>If you're playing on Xbox or PC, you can access Black Ops 7 with Xbox Game Pass or PC Game Pass. Microsoft <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Activision+Is+Trying+Really+Hard+To+Get+You+To+Play+Black+Ops+7+Right+Now&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-12-16+11%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-16+11%3A55%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6537022&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-is-trying-really-hard-to-get-you-to-play-black-ops-7-right-now%2F1100-6537022%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently brought back the $1 trial</a>, which means new subscribers can get Game Pass Ultimate for $1 for the first month.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched in November and reportedly had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">weak comparison to 2024's Black Ops 6 in terms of sales</a>. This could help explain why Activision is offering a discount on the game about a month after launch, though there could be other reasons as well.</p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a> While Black Ops 7's initial sales may have been lower, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game in the US so far.</a> On December 17, we will find out from Circana how Black Ops 7 sold in the US, though the game's availability on Game Pass will put an asterisk on its sales performance.</p>

<p>Launching on Switch on <strong>27th March 2026</strong>, Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection brings together seven DS Mega Man RPGs in one package that includes an art gallery, music, and other quality-of-life features.</p>
<p>PlayStation UK briefly shared a new trailer for the upcoming collection, though it's currently unavailable at the time of writing — perhaps they jumped the gun a little soon? Still, we have these clips:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067szvrpu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/mega-man-star-force-legacy-collection-has-been-rated-for-switch">was rated for Switch just last month</a>, so the release date reveal shouldn't be too surprising. And, for a reminder, here are the seven games included in the collection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Leo</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x Ninja</li>
<li>Mega Man Star Force 2 Zerker x Saurian</li>

		<p>Back in November, Brigada Games delayed the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/quarantine-zone-the-last-check-release-has-been-delayed/">Quarantine Zone: The Last Check&nbsp;</a>after getting feedback from playtesters. The team was still aiming to get the game out for 2025, but has not been able to meet that goal. However, the release date for Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is not that far off with that confirmed for January 12th. It has been priced at $19.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Quarantine Zone | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT8ECnPXShk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Quarantine Zone: The Last Check is set in a world that is facing a zombie outbreak, and you are a checkpoint guard. Your job is to stop anyone infected with the zombie virus, as well as anyone carrying contraband, from passing your checkpoint to a safe zone. Fail and it could lead to catastrophe. As a guard, players are equipped with scanners to detect the virus, but other resources are limited so decisions will need to be made to keep the camp safe.</p>
<p>If you want to give Quarantine Zone: The Last Check a try there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419520/Quarantine_Zone_The_Last_Check/">demo available on Steam</a>. More news about the game and some ways to address the challenges will be released ahead of the release date.</p>

			<p>During The Game Awards 2025, CAPCOM <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-launches-april-24-2026-switch-2-version-added-demo-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the launch date of PRAGMATA, its long-awaited new sci-fi intellectual property. Originally unveiled before the debut of the PlayStation 5 console as a 'next-generation' title, the game suffered multiple delays and was at one point thought to be going the way of Deep Down, another CAPCOM IP that vanished into thin air.</p>



<p>However, CAPCOM reintroduced it this year with trailers, hands-on opportunities at conventions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom</a>, and finally, the release date, after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-romeo-is-a-dead-man-get-korean-ratings-launch-news-may-be-incoming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rating by the South Korean board</a>. Moreover, the developers also released a free demo called 'Sketchbook' that allows players to try the unique blend of hacking and fighting that makes up the core mechanics.</p>



<p>Firstly, as part of the release date news and demo availability, the developers have shared the official PC system requirements, which are listed below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Requirement</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11 (64-bit)</td><td>Windows 11 (64 bit)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5‑8500 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td><td>Intel Core i7‑8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 5500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>16 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 6 GB / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT 8 GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super 8 GB / AMD Radeon RX 6600 8 GB</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>40 GB available space</td><td>40 GB available space</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Additional Notes</strong></td><td>Estimated performance on “Performance” preset: 1080p/45 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. SSD recommended.</td><td>Estimated performance on “Balanced” preset: 1080p/60 FPS. Framerate might drop in graphics‑intensive scenes. AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12 GB or NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 12 GB required for ray tracing. SSD recommended.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As evidenced by the specs themselves, PRAGMATA does not aim to be the next Crysis. Indeed, CAPCOM themselves admitted <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-gave-pragmata-an-early-steam-demo-to-make-sure-the-full-release-runs-smoothly-across-a-wide-range-of-pcs-we-ask-the-developers-about-their-optimization-efforts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Automaton Media</a> that their priority was to prioritize a solid frame rate 'even if it meant sacrificing certain graphical aspects'. In that conversation, the development team also revealed why PC was the first platform to receive a demo (console demos will be released later): this allows them to gather feedback from gamers and optimize the game across the virtually countless PC configurations that can be created with existing components.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRAGMATA PC 'Sketchbook' Demo 4K@60 Gameplay - Max Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1iM1DDPK74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Based on my time with the demo, I'd say PRAGMATA, which is powered by the RE Engine like every recent CAPCOM game, already runs very well, at least on a high-end PC. At 4K resolution and every single graphics setting pushed to the max, including ray tracing and NVIDIA DLAA (AI-powered anti-aliasing while rendering at native resolution), on an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition GPU, the demo averaged 173 frames per second. That's with NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation enabled; there is currently no support for Multi-Frame Generation, so it was set to 2x. AMD users can enable FSR Frame Generation, and for the upscaling component, they can choose between AMD FSR 3.1.4 and AMD FSR 1.</p>



<p>More importantly, FLAT (the Frame Analytics Latency Tool software) registered a very low stuttering 'share' of 3,68%, much lower than most PC games, which range from 8-10%, let alone the worst example so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-performance-test-stuttering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 with its 20,29% of stuttering time</a>. Indeed, subjectively, the demo felt smooth and almost entirely stutter-free.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PRAGMATA_SKETCHBOOK_DEMO_FLAT-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>Now, it also didn't stand out particularly for its visuals. With the game taking place in relatively small interiors, at least based on the demo, perhaps CAPCOM could have delivered more detailed environments and assets as a whole. Still, based on the aforementioned statement, it was not their priority; they wanted to focus on performance instead. The game is also launching on Nintendo Switch 2, as announced at The Game Awards 2025, and I can see it performing well even there.</p>



<p>On the other hand, those seeking a stunning game to show off their shiny new graphics card may want to look elsewhere. Granted, PC users will likely be able to inject path tracing through mods, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-village-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as was the case with previous RE Engine games</a>. CAPCOM only natively added ray traced reflections and indirect lighting to this game, whereas Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will feature native path tracing</a>.</p>



<p>The excellent performance exhibited by the PRAGMATA demo would be even better news if this were a challenging action game akin to Ninja Gaiden 4, to name one. However, this is not that kind of game. It's meant to be a far more relaxed experience, though I personally do hope that CAPCOM adds a Hard difficulty level before launch, as the demo felt far too easy.</p>



<p>Still, I largely enjoyed my experience with the demo and look forward to playing the full game when it launches on April 24, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
