<p id="oSW3ni"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> features a new story set in the land of Shadow, expanding the base game with additional monsters, items, bosses, and build-crafting options. The entire expansion will be quite substantial, measuring roughly the same size as Limgrave, <em>Elden Ring’s</em> starting area. Just note that in order to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24126482/how-to-prepare-dlc-gear-quests-endgame">access the new content</a>, you’ll need to defeat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Radahn</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Mohg</a>, two of <em>Elden Ring’s</em> nastiest bosses.</p>


<p id="Y9l3Jr">These discounted pre-orders grant all the same bonuses as the full-price version. Pre-ordering any edition of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> grants access to the Ring of Miquella gesture when the DLC launches.</p>

While the first trailer for <em>Life By You</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-4-the-kotaku-review-1633166683">looked a lot like <em>The Sims</em></a></span>, Paradox Interactive promised that its spin on the genre would feature even more customization. Players would be able to not only change their clothing, appearance, and homes, but also to customize and control conversations and even career paths. Paradox Interactive also promised that<em> Life By You</em> would be highly moddable, too. However, players won’t get a chance to mod or play the life sim. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PdxInteractive/status/1802793181160825167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PdxInteractive/status/1802793181160825167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 17</a></span>, Paradox Interactive announced that <em>Life By You</em> had officially been canceled. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a statement posted on Paradox’s official forums</a></span>, the company’s deputy CEO Mattias Lilja confirmed the news.</p><p>“This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community’s expectations,” said Lilja. The deputy CEO further explained: <br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Life by You</em> has been in the works for a long time and we’ve been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game. Our hope was always that it would be able to leave a mark in this exciting and new genre for us. That’s why we’ve opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realizing the potential we saw. For each delay we made, we’ve seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture.</p></blockquote><p>As mentioned in the post, on May 20, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/2-weeks-before-its-early-access-release-life-by-you-is-delayed-again-this-time-without-a-new-date/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/2-weeks-before-its-early-access-release-life-by-you-is-delayed-again-this-time-without-a-new-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Life By You </em>was delayed</a></span> just two weeks before its planned early access launch. No new release date was given at the time. Now we know that, according to the deputy CEO, after delaying the release again and taking a “wider view of the game,” it became clear that the studio still had a long way to go. </p><p>“When we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop,” said Lilja. “This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.”<br></p><p>As for what Paradox will do differently in the future to avoid such last-minute delays and cancelations, Lilja was honest and transparent, saying there is no guarantee that this won’t happen again, but the studio will still try to avoid this outcome moving forward. </p><p>“Games are difficult to get right,” said Lilja. “And we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Think about it: the <em>Dragon Age </em>fandom hasn’t had a game to dissect, anticipate, or scrutinize since <em>Inquisition</em> launched in 2014. <em>The Veilguard</em>, which is set to finally wrap up the devastating cliffhanger of <em>Inquisition</em>’s <em>Trespasser </em>DLC, is just a few short months away, and after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">name change</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">cinematic trailer</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-dreadwolf-rook-1851532144">gameplay reveal</a></span>, fans finally have something substantial to chew on, rather than sustaining themselves with comics, short stories, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-absolution-trailer-dreadwolf-inquisition-1849769805&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-absolution-trailer-dreadwolf-inquisition-1849769805">a Netflix anime</a></span>. Having watched BioWare fans go through some tough times between <em>Inquisition</em> and <em>The Veilguard</em>, it’s heartening to see the explosion of fan art, theories, and love outpouring from every side of the internet in anticipation of the next chapter. But that anticipation is tinged with a bit of fear. After waiting all this time, what happens if <em>The Veilguard</em> doesn’t live up to the game someone has imagined for ten years? Worse yet, what happens to BioWare if it has what some might consider its third “strike”?<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Now, <em>The Veilguard </em>is being marketed as a streamlined, single-player, micotransaction-less action RPG. It seems like BioWare has its priorities straight, but it also sounds like <em>The Veilguard </em>exists in the form it did after the studio and publisher Electronic Arts got it wrong twice in a row. That’s what makes it easier to get excited about the fourth game. BioWare has said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-discord-q-a-banter-party-members-1851541486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-discord-q-a-banter-party-members-1851541486">a lot of the right things</a></span> in just the past two weeks since Summer Game Fest. <em>The Veilguard </em>went from a mostly conceptual idea in <em>Dragon Age </em>fans’ heads to something very close to what those fans have been asking for since party-member-turned-villain Solas announced his plans to watch the world burn in <em>Trespasser</em>.<br></p><p>Of course, it’s also been divisive. <em>Dragon Age </em>has shifted subgenres throughout the past 15 years, but <em>The Veilguard </em>is more of an overt action RPG than even <em>Dragon Age II </em>was in 2011. So naturally those who are pining for the tactics-driven gameplay of the series’ first game, <em>Origins</em>, have taken issue with BioWare’s acrobatic gameplay showcase, especially <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-baldurs-gate-3-comparison-better-1851535955">on the heels of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s success last year</a></span>. Look, it would not be a BioWare game if it didn’t also invite some of the most vitriolic online discourse known to man. But after seeing the studio go from chasing bloated open-world trends to making a live-service loot shooter in the past seven years, seeing BioWare make a game that is trimming all that away to get at the heart of what the studio has always done well has reignited excitement for the studio again. I’ll admit, watching <em>The Veilguard</em>’s behind-closed-doors presentation at Summer Game Fest got me welled up in a way that’s only happened a few times in my career.</p><p>The thing is, BioWare fans never really venture too far while their favorite series is on hiatus. If nothing else, the studio did a good job leading into <em>The Veilguard </em>through extended media like comics and short stories to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">introduce characters</a></span> the studio was working on for the fourth game. In fact, a few of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s party members have been waiting for their grand introduction for years. So fans have had time to get a sense of who new characters like Neve the detective mage and Lucanis the mage-killing assassin are long before they showed up in a video game. </p><p>Fans may come to love those new characters, but at the same time, <em>The Veilguard </em>is bringing people back to a story they’ve waited a decade to see through. BioWare is clearly aware of just how invested these eager fans are, and is playing with their expectations and years-long investment. How do you hook a fandom that’s been dying to see a story wrapped up for 10 years? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-varric-tethras-bianca-does-he-die-1851537602">Put one of their favorites in danger</a></span> in an angsty shouting match <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/chailottie/status/1800559633603367255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/chailottie/status/1800559633603367255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">between him and an old friend</a></span>. Tug on their heartstrings and remind them of all the choices they’ve made over the past three games, knowing it was all leading to this moment. Give them something to project their own journeys onto.</p><p>With all the strife <em>The Veilguard </em>has reportedly gone through in its multiple iterations, fans seem relieved to see that, based on what BioWare has shown, a lot of the original vision still seems to remain intact. Case in point: Fans have been scouring old teasers for clues, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/biomarkdarrah/status/725022641623437312?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/biomarkdarrah/status/725022641623437312?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2016 post by then-producer Mark Darrah</a></span> (now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/mark-darrah-rejoins-dragon-age-team-and-mass-effect-studio-will-help-polish-the-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/mark-darrah-rejoins-dragon-age-team-and-mass-effect-studio-will-help-polish-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working on the project as a consultant</a></span>) has caught the attention of <em>Dragon Age</em> diehards. It shows Darrah looking through what seems to be a design booklet for the game with a rook chess piece on the cover. Rook is the name of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s main character.</p><p>While <em>The Veilguard </em>seems to be prioritizing continuity and payoff, the road to arriving at this current vision for the game has been tumultuous, to say the least.

What we’ve seen of <em>The Veilguard </em>suggests that it’s aiming to do the latter, and it feels like a leap of faith for BioWare after all this time.</p><p>There’s a lot riding on <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>. The stakes are high for the series, which fans have been dying to return to for so long.

<p>For those looking for a game to compete with the likes of The Sims, you may want to sit down for this. Paradox has announced <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that it has canceled its life sim game</a> Life By You before it ever sees the light of day.</p>



<p>The game was originally set for an early access release on June 4<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-pulls-life-by-you-early-access-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> before being postponed</a>. Now, just a month after that announcement, the game is no more.</p>



<p>“Sadly, we’ve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim Life by You,” Paradox CEO Mattias Lilja said. “This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community’s expectations.”</p>



<p>Lilja’s announcement continued with an explanation of the game’s cancellation and development.</p>



<p>“Life by You has been in the works for a long time and we’ve been very excited about the promise and the potential of this game,” he said. “Our hope was always that it would be able to leave a mark in this exciting and new genre for us. That’s why we’ve opted to delay it twice, to give the studio and the game a fair shot at realizing the potential we saw. </p>



<p>“For each delay we made, we’ve seen incremental improvements, which in hindsight may well have led us to focus on details rather than the whole picture.”</p>



<p>Lilja says that the decision to delay early access was done so the team could “re-evaluate” the game as a whole. Through that process, he says, the studio’s confidence in getting the game out in a reasonable time was dwindling more and more. While the game had made progress, Lilja says that they felt that more time creating the game wouldn’t get it to a point they were happy with.</p>



<p>“This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process,” he said. </p>



<p>He closed his statement by saying that Paradox will evaluate what led them to this decision and this point. The goal, obviously, is to not have to do this with a game again.</p>



<p>“Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless,” he said. </p>



<p>“We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.”</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The versatility of the Souls-like genre is that a lot of its best ideas can be applied to just about any action-RPG and work well, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/black-myth-wukong/" data-ref-id="5000-599537">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is a good example. It carries a lot of the subgenre's conventions, such as bonfire-like checkpoints that respawn enemies in the area around you, a flask for healing that has a finite number of charges and refills when you rest at a checkpoint, and upgrade points you drop when you die and have to find and recover.</p><p dir="ltr">The difference with Black Myth: Wukong, however, is that it's not nearly as slow, deliberate, dark, or perhaps even difficult as a usual Souls-like. I played a two-hour demo at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, and found the game to be quick and agile, with boss fights that were tough and required a lot of reactivity and skill, but didn't demand nearly as much time put into the usual intense process of learning an enemy's moves or hitting specific openings to win fights. There's difficulty in Black Myth: Wukong that echoes a Souls-like, and a lot of the beats are the same, like reading your opponent and dodging their moves, but this is more of a middle ground between traditional third-person action games and a Souls-like in terms of the overall experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Myth: Wukong: A Fun Action RPG filled with Bosses</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the two hours I played Black Myth: Wukong, I was impressed by how well it struck a balance between a Souls-like feel with an angle on faster gameplay. The game is based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West, and you take on the part of Sun Wukong, a shapeshifting martial artist and anthropomorphic monkey. The demo was a portion of an early chapter of the game, and the impression it gave was that Wukong hadn't yet unlocked most of his martial-arts capabilities yet. You fight through most of the game with a staff used to wallop enemies, but while you're mostly using this one weapon, you'll unlock additional stances over the course of Black Myth that give you different combos and move sets. At the start, however, you have a limited number of moves and abilities--namely, a light attack and a heavier attack you can link together into combos.</p><p dir="ltr">Gameplay mostly focuses on getting clear of an attack and then punishing your opponent for the misguided belief that they could ever hit you. The whole feel of dodging will be familiar to anyone who has spent significant time with this kind of game; dodging depletes a stamina gauge that recharges quickly when you stop moving, but it's pretty forgiving with the number of quick getaways it allows. You get i-frames when you roll clear of an enemy (or quickstep, if you're dodging while locked on), and if you time the dodge perfectly to avoid the incoming strike, time slows a bit and you leave an after-image of the Destined One where you just were. Dodging is always snappy and immediate, and while you can't dodge endlessly, you generally have enough stamina that, with a good sense of timing, you can out-maneuver just about anything an opponent throws your way.</p><p dir="ltr">The meat of combat is a fast-paced dance where you zip around attacks and lay into an enemy whenever you get a chance. Early on, Black Myth also adds another wrinkle in the form of spells you can fire off in the midst of battle. I only saw two spells during the demo, with the first coming as part of the narrative and adding an essential element: the ability to briefly immobilize an enemy mid-motion, opening them up to attack. You can even use the spell on bosses--or maybe, it's especially for use against bosses--and it's great when you know you're about to get whacked with an attack you're out of position to avoid, or you need an opportunity to deal some free damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320321-blackmythwukongscreenshot_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320321" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320321-blackmythwukongscreenshot_09.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320321"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320321-blackmythwukongscreenshot_09.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Spells have cooldown timers, so you can't spam the immobilize ability over and over again, and what's more, they're controlled by a sort of mana meter that refills like your health flask whenever you rest--so you're not going to just be zapping a boss into stasis over and over to beat them down. The spell does give you a key advantage, though, especially if you use it intelligently in concert with combos to maximize your damage potential, or to save yourself from a mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo took place on Black Wind Mountain, a location populated by intelligent monsters called yaoguai, including a band of anthropomorphic wolves. Ascending the mountain, the goal was to reach its summit and the wolves' leader, but that required fighting through a fair few bosses along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Structurally, at least in the demo, Black Myth consists of a few short areas where you'll fight common enemies, most of whom were easy to beat down in this early area, before hitting a boss fight. It doesn't seem that the game is providing especially large levels, at least on Black Wind Mountain. While there are always a handful of opponents between a checkpoint and a boss, the runs seemed pretty short, keeping a fast pace that quickly got you to your next major challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">The boss fights, though, are pretty exciting. The first notable opponent was Guangzhi, a wolf-like monk who wielded a staff with blades at either end--which were also on fire. Guangzhi was a fast, intense boss with a lot of sweeping, fiery moves, so avoiding them often required seeing them coming as early as possible to get the distance to avoid them. Defeating him took a couple of tries, primarily to get a handle on the timing of some of his hardest-hitting attacks, both of which he fired off from a distance. He would sometimes dash forward for a big strike or even throw his staff forward, spinning for a while before it returned to his hand, in an attack that reminded me of nothing so much as the double-bladed lightsaber of Darth Maul.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon beating Guangzhi, Black Myth showed off its major addition to the Souls-like formula: transformation. This was the second of the spells I unlocked. It seems that you'll sometimes be able to claim the weapon of an opponent after you beat them, which gives you the ability to use it in a fight, transforming from Wukong into the enemy you previously defeated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320322-blackmythwukongscreenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320322" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320322-blackmythwukongscreenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320322"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320322-blackmythwukongscreenshot_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's a pretty cool ability. Morphing into Guangzhi gave me an alternate weapon--his fiery, bladed staff--alongside an entirely different move set from what Wukong uses. What's more, transforming into a different character comes with its own health bar, separate from the one you're using (and healing) normally. How long the transformation lasts is dictated either by health, or by doing too many cool moves, with your light and heavy attacks depleting a meter called Might at different rates. When either meter runs out, you transform back into Wukong.</p><p dir="ltr">The useful thing about that second health bar is that taking damage while transformed doesn't affect your normal health--which means you can use a transformation in a pinch, when you're close to dying, to give yourself a brief but extremely useful second wind, as well as a potential damage boost. Like your other spells, transformations run on a cooldown, so you have to use them wisely. Transforming back into Wukong opens up additional opportunities for attack, though, with the ability to fire off moves as you switch back to keep a combo going and inflict extra damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Just after Guangzhi was another wolf boss, but where the fight with the monk was more of a duel, this one filled the "huge monster" role that's common with Souls-likes. The second wolf was a giant white creature with a long reach, huge jaws, and a ton of speed, appearing in a courtyard surrounded by low buildings. Bloodborne skills served well in this fight, where dodging <em>toward</em> the boss was often key to avoiding its sweeping claws, in order to get behind it and actually deal damage. The boss also exerted a ton of speed and agility, leaping up onto the rooftops and bounding around and off them to come down on me from different angles. With Guangzhi and Immobilize in my back pocket, though, I was able to capitalize in a few key moments, freezing the wolf and transforming to get in close and slashing with my fiery blades to take advantage of a burning status effect that dealt extra damage over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320323-blackmythwukongscreenshot_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320323" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320323-blackmythwukongscreenshot_11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320323"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320323-blackmythwukongscreenshot_11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Proceeding along the path, I next entered a thicker forest full of snake soldiers. Like the low-level wolf enemies before them, none of these were particularly challenging. They moved a bit slowly, and while they had a snake-strike lunge move that could be a bit dangerous, they were generally slow and easy to take down. Among the snakes were a few bodies sitting against rocks or trees, and getting too close would see nearby snake skeletons come to life, slither into the armor, and come at me. It was a cool enemy design and added a little bit of the feeling of a trap to wandering the woods, as it was easy to suddenly find yourself surrounded by undead snake warriors if you weren't paying attention. But as with their living cohorts, none of the skeleton snakes could withstand much damage or put up much of a fight. The weak common enemies further emphasized that they're not the focus of the game; bosses are.</p><p dir="ltr">And just beyond that relatively small group of snake enemies was another boss. This one was something of a magician compared to the martial artist and giant wolf I'd just fought. While he wasn't as deadly up close as those flaming blades had been, his ability to teleport around the battlefield presented a different challenge. The boss summons small tornadoes that force you out of certain areas, making it particularly tough to attack him head on, and if you commit to hitting him too much, he drinks from a flask full of poison and spits it all over you.</p><p dir="ltr">He can also summon spectral snakes all around the arena that <em>also</em> spit poison. Taking too many poison hits, like in a From Software game, gives you the poison status effect and drains your health, making it very easy to take only a little damage but find yourself in a seriously bad situation midway through the battle. The spectral snakes appear across the whole arena and force you to disengage with the boss himself so you can run around, smacking each snake individually to dissipate them and protect yourself from their speedy, tough-to-dodge spit.</p><p dir="ltr">The final boss I faced, just after the magician with the fans, was a spear-wielding human in white, flowing robes. This fight took place in a marsh in knee-deep water, making for a calm, pleasant setting to get absolutely wrecked. It was another duel-style fight, with the added caveat that the boss could sometimes slash the air to send ranged attacks my way or spin in the water to summon a delayed blast if I was in too close. The moves reminded me a lot of fighting Isshin the Sword Saint in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, with a similar reliance on agility and long reach.</p><p dir="ltr">While the other bosses could be difficult and took a couple of tries each, this last enemy felt like the first <em>real</em> challenge, especially because the boss busted out a second phase where he got even faster. He also had the tendency to attack in ways that were tougher to read, more like your typical Souls-like encounter. For instance, instead of stringing an expected three attacks together, he might throw out a combo with six or seven strikes, linking several kinds of moves to break the rhythm and catch me off-guard.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320325-blackmythwukongscreenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320325" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320325-blackmythwukongscreenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320325"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4320325-blackmythwukongscreenshot_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Bringing down the man in white was about as far as I got in the demo. There was apparently another boss to take on, as well as at least one more area to explore, but I ran out of time before much longer. What struck me, though, was how much Black Myth: Wukong scratched the itch for something Souls-like, but was satisfying in its faster pacing and more agile approach. Battles against bosses often had the same intensity of what you might find in a Souls-like, but with a heavier emphasis on quick reactions and without being quite as punishing. With a quicker pacing, it felt like there were more boss fights more often, with enough variety to make them all interesting in their own way.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside some great voice acting and gorgeous visuals, I found Black Myth: Wukong's approach to some tried-and-true third-person-action elements to be fun and refreshing. A two-hour demo isn't necessarily demonstrative of the entire game, but what developer Game Science showed off at Summer Game Fest felt like a smart take on a formula that brings a lot of familiar aspects that fans of Souls-likes will enjoy, tuned to a different frequency that makes it feel like something wholly its own.</p><p>Don't miss the rest of GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest</a> coverage.</p>

		<p>Oh, hell yes. It's been a surprisingly busy month of travel for yours truly, bouncing between Illinois to California, then California to Illinois, then Illinois to Washington D.C., Washington D.C. to Illinois, and later this week Illinois to New York, then New York to Illinois. I'm excited to take a break pretty soon, but at least it'll all be punctuated by an event we have been trying to make happen since we started <em>Remap</em> a little more than a year ago: an in-person livestream. This will be our first time <em>renting</em> a studio space, which means there might be some surprises in store for how all this works. But I'm choosing to be optimistic, because I'd like nothing more than to discover that we can keep one of my favorite parts of <em>Waypoint</em> alive and well at <em>Remap</em>, even though we know longer work for a "big" media company. So, please exercise some patience, but also...it's okay to get excited.</p><p>-pk, who still does not know if he can drink beer on this rented set</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>You'll hear interviews with the developers of <em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure, Neva</em>, and <em>Harmonium: The Musical </em>from my time at Summer Game Fest.

  <p id="IBV99p"><em>Life By You</em>, Paradox Interactive’s potential <em>The Sims 4</em> competitor, has been canceled. Paradox Interactive deputy CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/life-by-you-is-cancelled.1688889/">announced the game’s cancellation in a post on the publisher’s forum</a>. “Sadly, we’ve decided to cancel the release of our long-awaited life sim <em>Life by You,” </em>Lilja wrote. “This was an incredibly difficult call to make and is a clear failure on Paradox’s part to meet both our own and the community’s expectations.”</p>
<p id="mDVQ9t"><em>Life By You</em> was last scheduled for its early access release on June 4, but <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">Paradox delayed the game indefinitely on May 20</a>. The May delay was the third time the early access release was pushed back — it was first intended for September 2023, March 5, then June 4. Lilja said the game had “incremental improvements” with each delay, but that the road to release was “far too long and uncertain.” Here’s Lilja on the delay:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="aJ0Xr1">A few weeks back, we decided to hold off on an Early Access release in order to re-evaluate <em>Life by You</em>, as we still felt that the game was lacking in some key areas. Though a time extension was an option, once we took that pause to get a wider view of the game, it became clear to us that the road leading to a release that we felt confident about was far too long and uncertain. This is not to say the game has not shown any promising qualities;<em> Life by You</em> had a number of strengths and the hard work of a dedicated team that went into realizing them. However, when we come to a point where we believe that more time will not get us close enough to a version we would be satisfied with, then we believe it is better to stop. This is obviously tough and disappointing for everyone who poured their time and enthusiasm into this project, especially when our decision comes so late in the process.</p>
<p id="LxtkbM">At the end of the day, our job is to release games that are fun, interesting, and challenging for our players, and our every decision should be taken with that purpose in mind. When we get that right, we earn our pay. So, how do we ensure we don’t find ourselves here again? Honestly, there are no real guarantees. Games are difficult to get right, and we’ll definitely make mistakes, which, as these things go, always become painfully apparent in hindsight, but still shouldn’t reach this kind of magnitude regardless. We have to take a long and hard look at what led us here and see what changes we have to make to become better. In the end, our mission remains the same, and we’ll continue to take whatever steps we need to do just that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="rzFrvH"><a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-cancels-the-release-of-life-by-you-which-impacts-the-second-quarter-with-msek-208-in-a-write-down">In a news release published on the Paradox Interactive website</a>, CEO Fredik Wester said a version of <em>Life By You</em> that met the publisher’s expectations was “too far away.” Paradox Interactive is expecting its second quarter financial results to be “negatively impacted” by the game’s write-down of development costs — adding to a poor performance with recent releases, according to Wester.</p>
<p id="HMUguq">“We’ve performed poorly in recent releases,” Wester said. “Even though we now start new projects in a different manner, it is clear that we must make further changes so that quality is more consistent and the promises we make to our players are met. We have to evaluate how we manage projects and how we organize, for we will and must get better. We have a very solid financial position and a strong core game portfolio, which keeps us confident about our future.”</p>
<p id="fF7MY1">Paradox announced Paradox Tectonic, the studio tasked with developing <em>Life By You</em>, in 2019. Led by former Sims lead and <em>Second Life</em> creator Linden Labs CEO Rod Humble, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNhV-Gnjdy8">Paradox Tectonic officially announced <em>Life By You</em></a> in 2023. <em>Life By You</em> was expected to stand out from the crowded life sim genre <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23657952/life-by-you-paradox-sim-game-rod-humble">with deeper roleplaying elements</a>.

It’s also why <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/long-live-the-mouse-and-keyboard-1787990911&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/long-live-the-mouse-and-keyboard-1787990911">mouse and keyboard</a></span> is seen as the superior input method for any first-person shooter, as the movement of the elbow and wrist gives players a much finer control over movement than a controller’s joystick does. Focus Mode seeks to address that issue, and after a weekend of playing on PS5, I can say the feature does a phenomenal job.</p><p>What exactly is focus mode? Essentially it replaces the typical “left trigger to aim down sights” design ethos of most modern shooters, and maps Focus Mode to the left trigger. When pressing the trigger, the game quickly shifts how sensitive the aiming joystick is. It markedly lowers it compared to shooting from the hip, though you aren’t actually aiming down sights (PSA: You can enable traditional ADS in the settings menu). By doing this, it duplicates the fine-tuned control of a mouse. Not perfectly, but well enough. I haven’t seen another shooter on console do something like this before, and while it might not work for every game it works in <em>Valorant</em>.</p><p>PC players will tell you that if you are playing <em>Valorant</em> correctly, you shouldn’t be aiming down sights at all. Typically players will stop moving and fire from the hip rather than aim down sights. Both have similar accuracy but aiming down sights takes slightly longer to do. Focus Mode emulates that recommended playstyle Within a couple of matches, Focus Mode felt like second nature. That quick-to-pick-up feel comes from the melding of PC and console sensibilities—a PC player will be able to understand the movement Focus Mode is going for, while a console player will understand the input of using the left trigger for more accuracy. </p><p>The only real drawback of Focus Mode is that some feel it makes the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1dgl4iz/console_focus_mode_is_crazy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1dgl4iz/console_focus_mode_is_crazy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too casual</a></span> as the console version also utilizes light aim assist (a common feature on console shooters). While it may be more beginner-friendly, I don’t see a problem in that. Having a more casual space opens up opportunities to make the audience larger and offers players a lower-stakes entry into the game. The competitive players obsessed with if Focus Mode makes the game too casual can continue being competitive on PC. PC players won’t come into conflict with Focus Mode, since there’s no crossplay between console and PC </p><p>I’m happy to play on both PC and console depending on my mood. I think it smartly solves one of the problems that became a sore point for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550"><em>Overwatch</em></a></span>, in that the developers constantly struggled to balance the demand of competitive and casual players. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see new players flock to consoles, then pick up the game on PC if they want to get more serious. </p><hr><p>You can sign up for the <em>Valorant</em> console beta <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://beta.playvalorant.com/en-us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://beta.playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span> if you have a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S. There is no current end date for the beta, nor is there a date for the full console release.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For those planning to dive into the experience the millisecond it becomes available, developer From Software has one request: no spoilers.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1802579506479202486">X post</a>, the developer shared a short message kindly requesting players to be cool to each other and not go out of their way spoiling the expansion's content online. The message reads:</p>

<p>Greetings, Tarnished.</p>

<p>With the release of the expansion of Elden Ring, Shadow of the Erdtree, please be mindful of spoilers for those who want to tread into the Realm of Shadow with nothing but their determination and their minds unclouded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>

<p>Despite this reasonable request, if you're worried about spoilers and don't plan on shutting yourself inside on June 21 and ignoring the outside world until you complete Shadow of the Erdtree, you'll probably want to mute any mentions of it on social media; just to be safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the steady popularity of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>,</a> more people are joining the fight for Democracy day by day. However, can PlayStation 5 users play <em>Helldivers 2</em> without a Plus membership? We can break this down below.</p> <h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-playstation-plus-subscription-to-play-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">Do you need a PlayStation Plus subscription to play <em>Helldivers 2</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, <strong>you will need a PlayStation Plus subscription to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> if you are on the PS5</strong>. Though you have paid for the game, any tier of Sony’s online subscription service is needed to play online.</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">If you have the game without PS Plus, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can only play solo, which is not the best idea</a>. It’s totally doable to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> alone, but after the mid-tier difficulties, the game will feel next to impossible.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-why-is-ps-plus-needed-to-play-helldivers-2" data-injectable="false">Why is PS Plus needed to play <em>Helldivers 2</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">You can play many games online without a PS Plus membership on your PlayStation 5. However, that is only limited to free-to-play games. <em>Helldivers 2</em> is not a F2P game, so you do need a subscription to the service to play online.</p>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">One way you can play Helldivers 2 online is if you enable PS5 console sharing with a friend who does have an active PS Plus subscription. That way, with their account being active as primary on your console, you get the benefits of the subscription. It’ll also allow them to play online since the benefits are under their account.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">The other way you can play <em>Helldivers 2</em> without PlayStation Plus is if you purchase the game on Steam and play through PC. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-responds-to-backlash-over-psn-requirement-hopes-to-regain-the-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Even with the whole PlayStation account fiasco that happened earlier this year</a>, it’s still possible.</p>
 <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="147" data-injectable="false">Even if you disable cross-play and only choose to pair up with others on the PS5 with you, a Plus subscription is still required to play the game. </p>

<p data-characters="244" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Season of Discovery is in full force for <em>World of Warcraft</em> <em>Classic</em>, and with it comes plenty of new rewards and ranks to earn. Of course, each season comes with its own updates as well, and if you aren’t caught up, it can be daunting.</p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-wow-addons-for-season-of-discovery/">Season of Discovery</a> has brought plenty of updates to the player vs player system in the game, too. If you don’t know how ranks or the Honor system works, we’re here to give you all the details you need.</p> <h2 id="h-world-of-warcraft-season-of-discovery-pvp-ranks-and-honor-explained" data-injectable="false">World of Warcraft Season of Discovery PvP ranks and Honor explained</h2> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">PvP Ranks are a way to gain special gear and perks while participating in player vs player action in specific zones. Whenever you kill another player, you earn Honor, which will in turn boost your rank. Think of it like experience points.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Once you hit a certain amount of Honor, you’ll rank up. Each rank has an Honor threshold that you’ll need to reach. Luckily, this is not based against other players, but rather solely on your Honor. Decay has also been removed from the system, so you don’t need to worry about your rank dropping for taking a break from the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true">In order to earn Honor, you need to kill other players. You’ll earn more Honor for killing a player with a higher level or higher rank than you. If you kill a Faction Leader, you’ll get tons of Honor. You’ll also earn more Honor for being a higher level yourself, so level up as fast as you can.</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Another way to earn Honor is to compete in Battlegrounds, and winning them gains you even more. This includes activities such as stealing a base, capturing a flag, or other objectives. Completing these gives you Honor, and if you win the battleground, you’ll earn more.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-the-max-pvp-rank-in-world-of-warcraft-season-of-discovery" data-injectable="false">What is the max PvP rank in World of Warcraft Season of Discovery?</h2> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Currently in the Season of Discovery, the current max rank you can achieve for PvP Honor Ranking is Rank 7: Knight Lieutenant or Blood Guard depending on what faction you’re in. Here are all the ranks so far in the Season of Discover PvP:</p> <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Rank</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Title (Alliance)</strong></td><td data-align="center"><strong>Title (Horde)</strong></td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 1</td><td data-align="center">Private</td><td data-align="center">Scout</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 2</td><td data-align="center">Corporal</td><td data-align="center">Grunt</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 3</td><td data-align="center">Sergeant</td><td data-align="center">Sergeant</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 4</td><td data-align="center">Master Sergeant</td><td data-align="center">Senior Sergeant</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 5</td><td data-align="center">Sergeant Major</td><td data-align="center">First Sergeant</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 6</td><td data-align="center">Knight</td><td data-align="center">Stone Guard</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Rank 7</td><td data-align="center">Knight Lieutenant</td><td data-align="center">Blood Guard</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">As Phase 4 rolls out, these ranks will continue to increase. Each phase update brings new PvP ranks to earn, and Phase 4 is expected to follow this trend.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">You will need to grind in order to reach the highest rank in PvP, but you’ll get the best rewards as a result, much better for killing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-the-hidden-enemies-quest-in-wow-classic/">enemies</a>. This includes special PvP gear that is perfect for Battlegrounds.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-way-to-earn-honor-in-world-of-warcraft-season-of-discovery" data-injectable="false">What is the best way to earn Honor in World of Warcraft Season of Discovery?</h2> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">Battlegrounds are the place you’ll want to go to maximize your Honor each week. Completing objectives is one of the best ways to earn tons of Honor, as well as winning the Battleground. However, just competing on the field will earn you Honor whether you win or lose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">While killing other players of course earns you Honor, too, it’s not the same amount you’ll get for completing objectives on the Battlefield. Plus, killing the same player repeatedly will continue to decrease the Honor earned until you get none at all for killing that same player.</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="false">Killing in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-leave-a-guild-in-wow-classic/">guilds</a> is also a great way to earn Honor. You’ll earn more when you’re playing with friends. </p>

<p data-characters="416" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Paradox Interactive <a href="https://news.cision.com/paradox-interactive-ab/r/paradox-interactive-cancels-the-release-of-life-by-you-which-impacts-the-second-quarter-with-msek-20,c4002478" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the upcoming <em>The Sims</em> competitor, <em>Life by You</em>, has been canceled. Originally announced back in March 2023, <em>Life by You</em> was to be the debut title for Paradox Tectonic, an in-house Paradox development team led by former <em>The Sims</em> head Rod Humble. The cancellation resulted in a MSEK 208 write-down in Q2 for Paradox which according to Google Conversion is roughly $19.8 million.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Life by You | Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kslU9ZGAGxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-rough-times-for-new-ips-at-paradox" data-injectable="false">Rough times for new IPs at Paradox</h2> <p data-characters="539" data-current-count="839" data-injectable="true">Paradox Interactive has long been considered the power player when it comes to grand strategy and 4X title releases, with hit franchises like <em>Stellaris</em>, <em>Hearts of Iron</em>, <em>Crusader Kings</em>, and <em>Europa Universalis</em>. However, recently the company has expanded its scope and begun publishing and developing more titles in the strategy genre, but not necessarily grand strategy. In October 2023, Paradox published a turn-based tactical RPG titled <em>The Lamplighters League</em> but just one week after release <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/paradox-is-taking-a-write-down-on-the-lamplighters-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also wrote it off as a loss due to poor sales</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="true">With Paradox willing to outright cancel <em>Life by You</em> instead of putting in the time and resources to get it where they want to be, it seems as though the project may have been far off from where the company hoped it would be. <em>Life by You</em> was originally scheduled to be released into Early Access in September 2023 but was delayed to March 2024, then June 2024. Just a few weeks before its intended June release, Paradox revealed the life sim had been delayed indefinitely, and now we know why.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true"> <p>For a long time, we’ve held hopes for <em>Life by You</em> and the potential we saw in it, but it is now clear that the game will not be able to meet our expectations. A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release. Moving forward, we should perform at a much higher level, and it’s obvious that we have work ahead of us.</p> <cite>– Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive</cite></blockquote>
 <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="123" data-injectable="false">Fans looking for a new life sim will now have to wait and see what <em>The Sims 5</em>, codenamed Project Rene, will turn out to be.</p>

The concept art was subsequently removed from Imgur and various social media posts “in response to a report from the copyright holder.” It is unclear when the marketing survey was released.

Warner Bros. has remained largely quiet on the project in the years since, although we do know Wonder Woman is a single-player action adventure set in a “dynamic” open-world, is played in third-person, and lets players become Diana of Themyscira in an original story set within the DC universe. Based on what we know of the game and what we’re hearing now, Wonder Woman sounds like a mix between the Batman Arkham games and Monolith’s own Shadow of Mordor.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

This is the successor to the Anker 737 that we deemed the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-steam-deck-portable-chargers-power-banks">best Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally charger</a>. Note only does it carry a significant battery capacity, it also boasts an absolutely massive 250W of USB power delivery to charge even the most power hungry MacBooks, iPhones, and handheld gaming consoles (simultaneously, in most cases).</p><h2>Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank for $124.99</h2><p><em><strong>with 250W of USB Type-C Power Delivery</strong></em></p><div id="197934"><p><h3>Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank with 250W USB Type-C Power Delivery</h3></p></div><p>The Anker Prime is a hefy power bank, measuring 6.4"x2"x2.2" and weighing in at 1.5 pounds. This is a heavier duty power bank designed to charge more power hungry devices like laptops, (multiple) portable gaming systems, and (multiple) phones. It has two USB Type-C ports and one USB Type-A port. Each USB Type C port supports up to 140W of Power Delivery, which is the max charging rate of a new 2024 MacBook Pro 16" laptop. If you want to use both USB Type-C ports simultaneously, one will charge at 140W and the other at 100W. The USB Type-A port also boasts up to 65W of charging, although that drops to 18W if you're using both USB Type-C ports at the same time. </p><p>The 27,650mAh battery capacity is more than you'll ever need on your itinerary. It can charge a Nintendo Switch OLED about 6 times, iPhone 15 Pro Max about 6 times, Steam Deck about 5 times, and an ASUS ROG Ally about 10 times. What also makes the Anker Prime unique compared to most other power banks is the LCD digital readout. It displays a lot of useful real-time information like remaining battery capacity, power input, and power output from each port.</p><p>Regarding bringing the Anker Prime on airplanes, this power bank outputs 99.54Wh, which meets the TSA requirements for carry-on baggage. Power banks need to be under 100Wh, which means this is the absolutely highest capacity you can bring on board without needing special clearance.</p><h3>The Anker Prime is an excellent Steam Deck / ASUS ROG Ally charger</h3><p>Both the ROG Ally and Steam Deck suffer from a short battery life when gaming on the go. For instance, when playing most games at 60 FPS, you're likely looking at four hours of battery life for the Steam Deck and maybe half that on the ASUS ROG Ally, which is equipped with a measly 2600mAh battery. During our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-review">Steam Deck review</a>, we even found games like God of War or Spider-Man could potentially tap out in under 2 hours. At the end of the day, you'll never get the full potential out of your Steam Deck or ROG Ally if you're not equipped with a decent portable charger.</p><p>The Anker Prime is an outstanding charger for the Steam Deck and ASUS ROG Ally portable gaming handhelds. The Steam Deck supports up to 38W, the ASUS ROG Ally up to 65W, and the Nintendo Switch up to 18W of power delivery, That means technically you could charge all three gaming consoles at the same time across all three ports. If you're traveling with a family with multiple Nintendo Switches or Steam Decks, this option will be a lot more convenient than bringing multiple power banks.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/19/ankerprime3port-1710871627064.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>3 port charging diagram</figcaption></figure></output><p>Check out more of our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">favorite power banks of 2024</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-joke-highlights-serious-matchmaking-issue/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-joke-highlights-serious-matchmaking-issue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> executive producer Mark Rubin had a perfectly executed joke locked and ready for a player who had all of their teammates leave a game, but the moment of fun also highlighted a troubling matchmaking issue that needs to get addressed. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">An <em>XDefiant</em> player posted a <a href="https://x.com/mellowistaken/status/1802551434946265264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">picture </a>on Twitter disappointed that all of their teammates left mid-match. Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1802555196058530179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joked </a>that the user should have worn deodorant, which garnered laughs from community members and the player themself. However, the ability to freely leave matches without getting punished has ruined the experience for others. </p> <figure data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="493" data-injectable="true"><em>&nbsp;XDefiant </em>does not use skill-based-matchmaking, meaning players from all different levels of skill and experience can match up against each other. Overall, feedback has been positive, as it creates a unique experience and doesn’t punish players for getting better, and gives them increasingly harder competition. Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a>, “Skill-based matchmaking means every casual game is repetitive—constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful and matched as ranked.” </p>
 <p data-characters="649" data-current-count="649" data-injectable="true">In saying that, having no skill-based-matchmaking does come with pitfalls. After a lobby is formed, teams are then divided based on a variety of factors to ensure that both squads are as effective as possible. However, there will always be the odd game or few where one team dominates another because of a large gap in skill level. In that case, it’s no uncommon that players will leave the match out of pure frustration. Some FPS titles punish players for leaving early and will even temporarily prevent them from finding a new match for a set amount of time if they leave too often. But XDefiant has no such penalty, which creates problems. </p>
 <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="false">Not only does early match leaving hurt the teammates left behind, it’s also unfair to players who get added into a match late because they are put into an unwinnable situation. On June 9, Rubin responded to the concerns by confirming that the team is looking to implement a system that rewards players who stay more, meaning players lose out on an extra reward if they leave early. While this isn’t the penalty some may have hoped for, it could at least potentially cut down on the maximum exodus of lobbies. </p>

  <p id="ERaBpz"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22947204/elden-ring-review-from-software"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> is considered by many to be the definitive FromSoftware experience, with its dark medieval setting of deep lore penned in part by fantasy author George R.R. Martin. The brutal open-world RPG quickly became a favorite for fans of the developer’s Dark Souls franchise due to its massive boss fights and unforgiving combat. <em>Elden Ring</em> only became more popular with the launch of the Steam Deck, thanks to its excellent performance, and its expansion, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079297/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-release-date-editions-messmer-impaler"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, adds new story beats, bosses, and build-crafting options.  </p>
<p id="CE25ye">Whether you’re new to the Lands Between or you’ve already slain your share of Elder Beasts, we’ve rounded up a handsome collection of loot inspired by <em>Elden Ring</em>, including apparel, accessories, books, and more.    </p>

Though it debuted to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/uncharted-ps4-movie-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-rotten-t-1848534337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/uncharted-ps4-movie-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-rotten-t-1848534337">mixed reviews</a></span>, the movie was a box office success, warranting an obvious sequel.</p><p>Though we know very little about the <em>Uncharted </em>sequel at the moment, it’s likely safe to assume that the movie’s leads, Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, will be reprising their roles as the rogue duo of Nathan Drake and Victor “Sully” Sullivan, respectively. The first movie acted as a sort of origin story for how the now-iconic treasure hunters first met, and much of the games have charted the development of their relationship, making their dynamic easy fodder to continue mining for further movies.</p><p>The ending of the <em>Uncharted </em>film also explicitly sets up the beginning of the first game, <em>Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune</em>, which follows Nate and Sully as they track down the treasure of Nate’s namesake, Sir Francis Drake, and come across some Nazi fuckery during their adventure. Though the next film could be an original story much like the first, following the games from here on out seems like a pretty natural progression.</p><p>If the <em>Uncharted</em> sequel film does follow the games and adapts the first one, it will also likely introduce one of the last major characters of the main cast: Elena Fisher. Elena is a reporter who follows (and finances) Nate and Sully’s journey in the first game, but over the course of the series, she becomes Nate’s foil and eventually even his wife. Their will-they-won’t-they dynamic, as well as Elena’s unique ability to cut right through Nate’s BS, gives us some of the best parts of the games. Their banter and sweeping romance is ripe for the big screen, and if I’m being honest, the first film felt like it was really lacking Elena.</p><p>Outside of the confirmation that another <em>Uncharted </em>film is in the works, the series has been pretty quiet for a while now. After retiring Nate in 2016’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/uncharted-4-has-the-perfect-video-game-ending-1778806080&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/uncharted-4-has-the-perfect-video-game-ending-1778806080"><em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em></a></span>, there’s only been one other title in the franchise, which was the subsequent year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/uncharted-ps5-review-uncharted-4-uncharted-lost-legacy-1848421258&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/uncharted-ps5-review-uncharted-4-uncharted-lost-legacy-1848421258"><em>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</em></a></span>. That spinoff, which began as an expansion to <em>A Thief’s End</em>, followed Chloe Frazer, another main character of the series who did happen to feature in the first film. Considering it’s now been seven years since that game came out, some feel like it’s time for a new <em>Uncharted </em>game rather than another film.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885">Naughty Dog</a></span>, the studio that created <em>Uncharted</em>, has been busy since moving on from the series though, predominantly with its other megaton multimedia franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-remake-hbo-show-1851038633&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-remake-hbo-show-1851038633"><em>The Last of Us</em></a></span>. While there’s little hope of the studio picking back up the reins, Sony has plenty of other studios that could take up the mantle, or enough resources to form a team to do it. Maybe one day we’ll get the <em>Uncharted </em>sequel that folks actually want.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Alongside a new fruit, Update 10 also features a new island, new sea events, a couple of new weapons, new items, and a new fighting style. Here is all the new content in <em>Grand Piece Online</em> Update 10:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="13" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>New Fruit:</strong> <ul> <li data-index="0">Pteranodon-Pteranodon – Themed after the devil fruit that King from <em>One Piece</em> uses.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>New Island:</strong> <ul> <li data-index="1">Umi Island (Found in the second sea)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>New Sea Events:</strong> <ul> <li data-index="2">Hawk Eye (Found in the second sea, spawns every 2 hours)</li> <li data-index="3">Roger (Found in the second sea, spawns every 1.5 hours)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>New Weapons:</strong> <ul> <li data-index="4">Dark Blade</li> <li data-index="5">Prestige Dark Blade (Crew Reward)</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>New Items:</strong> <ul> <li data-index="6">Roger’s Ace</li> <li data-index="7">Roger’s Hat</li> <li data-index="8">Roger’s Outfit</li> <li data-index="9">Hawk Eye’s Hat</li> <li data-index="10">Hawk Eye’s Outfit</li> <li data-index="11">Triple Strongest Slash Skill Scroll</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>New Fighting Style:</strong> <ul> <li data-index="12">Kamishiki (roku v2) – Trainer can be found at Sett’s Arena in the second sea</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

While the Second Sea flows a lot nicer, the First Sea is a bit stagnant due to being so old. Thankfully, these changes should help make the progress through the First Sea a bit smoother. Here are all the reworked islands in Update 10:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"> <li>Island of Zou</li> <li>Sandora</li> <li>Shell’s Town</li> <li>Town of Beginnings</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">All of these islands were remodeled and also had NPC HP levels adjusted.

<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While much of the <em>Warzone </em>community sets out to find the best meta loadouts each season, one intuitive player discovered you don’t need a weapon to find success. </p> <p data-characters="478" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">Warzone’s Season 4 update established a clear-cut meta. Most players use some combination of the Kar98k, Superi 46, Kastov 762, or FJX Horus. Raven Software acknowledged the discrepancy and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-devs-are-finally-nerfing-the-overpowered-kar98k-but-not-everyone-is-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Kar98k will receive a nerf in Season 4 Reloaded. Based on the Battle Pass, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-and-warzone-season-4-reloaded-release-date-new-game-modes-and-weapon-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mid-season update</a> is expected to go live on June 26, 2024.&nbsp;In the meantime, players will still have to quiver in fear over getting killed in one shot by the overpowered sniper rifle. </p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">Despite the Kar98k, among a small group of other weapons currently dominating the battle royale, they are all rendered useless when going up against a car bearing down on them at full speed. A <em>Warzone</em> player claimed that cars are the new meta after posting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1dhed75/cars_are_the_new_meta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clip</a> of themselves taking down an entire team of four by running them over with a UTV. </p> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">While chased by the UTV, the enemy team threw everything and the kitchen sink at the driver. All four players desperately fired at the vehicle and unsuccessfully used a bunker buster. One of the users had the right idea and got high ground on a rock and rained down a barrage of bullets. But even that wasn’t enough, as the driver ramped up the slope and launched the last man standing 50 feet into the air to their demise. </p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Anyone who has a chance to watch this crazy highlight should take it as a lesson to start carrying around thermite grenades or C4 to counter elusive vehicles. So until a Kar98k Nerf goes live, hop into a vehicle and turn the tables on them in an offensive maneuver nobody could see coming. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/firefly-vs-jade-best-character-to-pull-in-honkai-star-rail-2-3.903744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/firefly-vs-jade-best-character-to-pull-in-honkai-star-rail/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=firefly-vs-jade-best-character-to-pull-in-honkai-star-rail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="234" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Honkai: Star Rail </em>version 2.3 sees the arrival of the fan-favorite, Firefly, and another IPC debt collector, Jade. Both characters certainly have a lot of appeal to consider pulling for, but if you can only grab one, which should you?</p> <h2 id="h-should-you-pull-for-firefly-or-jade-in-honkai-star-rail-2-3" data-injectable="false">Should you pull for Firefly or Jade in <em>Honkai: Star Rail 2.3?</em></h2> <p data-characters="692" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">The decision between pulling for Firefly and Jade won’t be a difficult one for most people. Firefly has been a part of the Penacony storyline since 2.0, meaning players have had a lot more time to get to know her and witness her actions in the story. Jade, on the other hand, has only been seen in a flashback and mentioned/heard everywhere else, but she hasn’t actually done anything noteworthy as of yet. That will likely change for 2.3, but regardless, she hasn’t had a chance to resonate with the playerbase. So, <strong>from a story standpoint, Firefly is the better pull.</strong> However, if you’re asking this question from a meta-perspective, here’s some fat to chew on.</p>
 <h3 id="h-firefly" data-injectable="false">Firefly</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Firefly-vs-Jade-Firefly-Add.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="653" data-current-count="953" data-injectable="true">Firefly is a <strong>Fire Destruction </strong>character with a hard focus on dealing <strong>Break Damage </strong>consistently. On a team, she primarily serves as the hypercarry and will struggle to function outside this role. The reason is because of her hyper-focus on Break Damage and how that affects her potential team comps. You see, Firefly does not deal any meaningful damage if the target is not broken or cannot be broken. She is entirely reliant on breaking her enemies, and this is a massive negative for her gameplay despite her being extremely good at it. The negative aspect here means she really only has one team comp she can use: <strong>Ruan Mei, Harmony MC, and Gallagher</strong>. </p>
 <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Firefly without the above-mentioned comp is extraordinarily weak, again, because of her focus on Break Damage. All three characters help Firefly perform, and omitting even one of them means your Firefly will be considerably weaker. Ruan Mei, especially, is an utterly massive boost to Firefly’s performance that cannot be ignored. I’d go as far as to say that <strong>if you don’t have Ruan Mei, you should not pull Firefly</strong>. You’re better off using a different character if you can’t pull Ruan Mei. Fortunately, her banner will be rerun in 2.3. Unfortunately, you’ll have to pull two five-star characters to make Firefly’s comp viable.</p>
 <p data-characters="546" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">If you already have Ruan Mei and the rest of the mentioned team comp, <strong>Firefly is an absolute powerhouse that will let you destroy everything in the game</strong>. Ruan Mei provides Firefly with a significant boost to Break Damage. Harmony MC grants Firefly the ability to perform Super Breaks, which will scale extremely well with her. Gallagher supports FIrely with his healing and also helps her break her targets with his own contributions. This team comp is one of the strongest ones in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>… if you can get all the pieces together.</p>
 <h3 id="h-jade" data-injectable="false">Jade</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Honkai-Star-Rail-Firefly-vs-Jade-Jade-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="740" data-current-count="1040" data-injectable="true">Jade is a <strong>Quantum Erudition </strong>character with a significant focus on dishing out large amounts of AOE (Area of Effect) damage. She is a Follow-up attack character, and her kit functions entirely with that aspect in mind. Jade is mainly a sub-DPS that applies an SPD and ATK buff called <strong>Debt Collector</strong> on the target of her Skill, at the cost of their health every time they perform an attack. When Jade or the target of her Debt Collector attacks a target, she gains charges equal to the number of targets hit, up to a maximum of eight. When Jade has eight charges, her Follow-up attack activates, dealing significant damage Quantum damage to all enemies on the field. Jade’s Ultimate deals AOE damage and empowers her Follow-up attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="667" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">With the most important aspects of her kit in mind, Jade greatest weakness is her focus on AOE damage, or rather, the need to hit as many targets as possible every turn. In fights with large amounts of enemies, Jade flourishes and soundly sweeps her foes. However, in low enemy count encounters, her damage suffers greatly. This aspect alone is <strong>enough not to pull for Jade</strong>, as most of the difficult encounters in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> are three targets or less. In a single-target fight, Jade does not perform well due to her lower-than-average multipliers and her inability to gain more than two stacks per cycle (one for herself and one from the Debt Collector target).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true">However, if you need a character to help you clear Pure Fiction, <strong>Jade is a top-tier character and you may want to consider pulling her</strong>. Since Pure Fiction is an end-game mode that is difficult to clear without AOE, getting a character like Jade and building her up will naturally help you a lot in that aspect. With Pure Fiction, Memory of Chaos, and the new Apocalyptic Shadow cycling as endgame modes starting in version 2.3, it is a good idea to consider Jade for Pure Fiction every time it comes up.</p>
 <p data-characters="777" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="false">Utimately, I consider both Firefly and Jade to be niche pulls in the grand scheme of the universe that is <em>Honkai: Star Rail. </em>Both characters are extremely powerful in their roles, but only under the correct circumstances, which is why I don’t consider either one a must-pull. If I had to pick one, <strong>the safest character to pull is Firefly</strong> as long as you already have Ruan Mei. While I am a huge fan of Follow-up team comps, Jade’s contributions to the already immensely powerful Topaz, Dr. Ratio. Robin, and Aventurine team serve no meaningful purpose beyond replacing Dr. Ratio in AOE-heavy encounters. I also believe her true role has yet to be uncovered, much like Topaz’s role wasn’t until future characters were released to improve her performance. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178625/scavengers-reign-co-creator-joe-bennett-interview-season-2-netflix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="hsKDQa">In the media landscape of 2024, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a> feels like nothing short of a wonder. Initially conceived as a 20-minute short film by co-creators Joseph Bennett and Charles Huettner, the series was greenlit for a 12-episode season for Max (then called HBO Max) and slowly gestated in production for several years before premiering in fall of last year. With its emphasis on visual storytelling, phantasmagorical imagery, and heady themes of survival and symbiosis, the most obvious question is simple: How did the creators of <em>Scavengers Reign</em> go about nailing the approach to its peculiar sci-fi universe?</p>
<p id="lnBoQE">“The main principle [of the original short] was that we were following these characters [as they] do a process through nature, and you’re kind of seeing this Rube Goldberg-style process of cause and effect, trial and error throughout,” Bennett tells Polygon. “It had no dialogue, so it was all visual narrative. [...] Gradually, we started leaning into planet Vesta’s nature and what that could be.”</p>
<p id="TQXkpJ">What grew from that fledgling seed of an idea was a densely imagined world of exotic fauna, inscrutable native life forms, and a vast, interconnected ecology of creatures existing in concert with one another. “[The idea was] if every character is utilizing these organisms as some sort of functionality, have that be a thing throughout the show that’s consistent,” Bennett said. “It’s never just that the characters are the central focus. [...] These characters are struggling through so much inner turmoil and psychological stress, and seeing that against the backdrop of this planet that in a lot of ways is unforgiving — that dichotomy was always important to keep in mind.”  </p>
<p id="pT6FcH">Pulling from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24173761/scavengers-reign-influences-inspirations-more-like-shows-miyazaki">influences as far afield</a> as the comics of Jean “Mœbius” Giraud and the animation of René Laloux to the Primitive Technology YouTube Channel, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> was unique by design and from the jump. “One of the things I always heard from Joe and Charles was that you wanted this thing to breathe,” Titmouse founder Chris Prynoski says. “If you look at an episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23735961/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-season-2-trailer-lower-decks"><em>Lower Decks</em></a>, we’re trying to cram as much story in one of those episodes as possible. [...] [On <em>Scavengers</em>], even the shot count, it’s like, <em>We can have a lower shot count but spend more time on making those special.</em>” </p>

<p id="z8VJW4">But that balance was important; cliche though it may be, Planet Vesta is a character unto itself in <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, neither benevolent nor explicitly malicious; a truly alien frontier in which the survivors of Demeter 227 are brought to bear not only the limits of their physical bodies but the full weight of their personal histories. The point of focus is never just on the human characters themselves. The series spends as much time, if not more, scrutinizing the micro- and macroscopic creatures of this beautiful and frequently hostile world as it does the hapless humans struggling to navigate and survive it. </p>
<p id="D6YTLf">The audience sees this not just on screen, but in the way the series is edited, with close-ups of the Demeter survivors regularly interjected with wide shots situating them as tiny iotas dwarfed by the immense scale of the strange and unfamiliar landscape that surrounds them. It makes sense that <em>Scavengers Reign</em> would put so much emphasis on Vesta’s vistas and biomes, given how much time and attention the production team invested into nailing the look and feel of the planet.</p>
<p id="LWSTY4">“We had a nice runway for concept design and building out the ecosystems and all that stuff,” Bennett told Polygon. From character and creature designs to the environments and sound design, every element of the show’s creation fed into one another. “I’m a big believer when creating any kind of show in just that threading [of the creative process] where the composer is making music, and you’d send that to the animators, and that would inspire them in a certain way. Then you would take some of the drawings that the concept designers are making and you send those to the writers, and it’s inspiring to them.”</p>

<p id="z2PIsf">And you can really see that creative cycle and symbiosis echoed throughout the entirety of <em>Scavengers Reign</em>,<em> </em>like in the first episode, when Ursula and Sam repurpose a blowfish-like creature as an air filtration mask and later escape device, or when Azi employs the pheromones of a jellyfish-like creature to ward off the advances of a herd of presumably hostile aliens. “That was the really fun part. You’re like, <em>These creatures pair really well with these organisms and this foliage, which goes well with this whole scenery</em>,<em>” </em>Bennett says. “It was just this idea of like, as different as they are, it all still feels like part of one planet, and  also that there’s some kind of significance to these things. Whether it’s a utility for the characters, or even just what their functionality is on the planet.”</p>
<p id="CDC54j">The result, even in a show with less dialogue, speaks volumes. The first season of <em>Scavengers Reign </em>settles into a deliberately paced and thoughtful sci-fi tale about more than just a group of survivors marooned on a strange planet, but a story about what a healthy, mutually beneficial relationship between humans and their environment should ideally strive for. “We were trying to tell a sincere story,” Bennett said. “The pacing was really important, and giving some brevity to these kinds of things. [...] It was such an organic process all the way up to the end. And so things were just changing, constantly being kind of re-tweaked.”</p>
<p id="O9FBgz">So much change in such a complicated process could cause anxiety, sure. But it felt important to the tone of the show. “You get so much of a better result when people feel like they’re trusted to inject themselves into it,” Prynoski says. “A lot of these primetime comedy-type shows [...] it’s very much about dialing in jokes, which, we’re so fortunate that that was not the tone of this show.”</p>

<p id="XiMMMA">As of this writing, it’s been over a month since news first broke that <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/scavengers-reign-canceled-max-netflix-streaming-1235912035/"><em>Scavengers Reign</em> had been canceled by Max</a> following its premiere last October. Fans and newcomers of the show have been waiting with bated breath for news of a possible renewal of the series through Netflix, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168682/scavengers-reign-netflix-sci-fi-show">added the series to its streaming library</a> on May 31. When asked what his plans for a potential season 2 would look like, Bennett emphasized that it would focus in part on the mysterious group of gold-masked figures who encounter one of Lev’s techno-organic progeny aboard a marooned scavengers ship. “I think there’s definitely kind of a roadmap,” Bennett said. “It starts to get vague maybe, like, five or six episodes in. But there’s definitely a roadmap an idea for those guys. </p>
<p id="30UYy2">“If we’re lucky enough and we can do a season 2, you’ll see a lot more context and it’ll make more sense. But I also really love the idea of not knowing and just going with the flow, and things just change.”</p>
<p id="elksjp"><small>Season 1 of </small><small><em>Scavengers Reign</em></small><small> is now streaming on Netflix and Max. </small></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-xdefiant-factions-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-xdefiant-factions-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="204" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>XDefiant</em> features five factions, each providing unique abilities that cater to different play styles. Even though it comes down to personal preference, some factions provide more versatility than others. </p> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">In the absence of kill or score streaks, as you usually find in an arcade arena shooter, <em>XDefiant</em> leaned into the hero shooter genre and introduced an ability system. Ubisoft urges teams to work together and synchronize different faction abilities to make the most out of the system. So, with that in mind, here is a list of the best factions to use in <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-xdefiant-faction-tier-list" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> faction tier list</h2> <h3 id="h-5-dedsec" data-injectable="false">5. Dedsec </h3> <figure data-current-count="663" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">Players can find success using the DedSec faction, but lackluster abilities and a situational passive trait hold the cyber attackers back. Lockout is a great Ultra ability as it prevents enemies from using their ultra and normal abilities, which is debilitating in any game mode. The Spiderbot is also one of the most annoying abilities in the game as the robot latches on to an enemy’s face and makes them an easy target. Despite that, DedSec lacks versatility and the loaded toolbox that other Factions have. </p>
 <h3 id="h-4-phantoms" data-injectable="false">4. Phantoms </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="685" data-current-count="985" data-injectable="true">If not for a disappointing ultra-ability, Phantoms would earn a higher rank on this list. Aegis creates a spherical plasma shield that protects you and your teammates and a scattergun that one-shot kills enemies in close-range combat. However, the ability drastically slows down movement, and it’s almost too easy for an enemy to slide into the shield and take you out before making much of an impact. Phantoms still remain a strong option because Mag Barrier is one of the best abilities in the game as it blocks enemy fire and grenades and makes it easier to play the objective. In addition, Hardened increases operator health from 100 to 125, which is great for any gunfight. </p>
 <h3 id="h-3-echelon" data-injectable="false">3. Echelon </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="693" data-current-count="993" data-injectable="true">Echelon outclasses Phantoms because of a strong passive trait, a lethal supporting cast of abilities, and a devastating ultra. Inspired by Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell, Sonar Goggles reveals enemies through walls and gives players a pistol capable of killing with one shot. The ultra ability is a nightmare to counter and frustrating to get killed by. Meanwhile, the Digital Ghillie Suit provides brief invisibility or the Intel Suit shares the position of enemies. Both abilities are worth giving a try, depending on your playstyle. Finally, Low Profile removes you from the mini-map, making this faction perfect for aggressive players who enjoy flanking and catching enemies off guard. </p>
 <h3 id="h-2-cleaners" data-injectable="false">2. Cleaners </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="true">There is an argument to be made that Echelon is a better faction than Cleaners, but both have their own set of distinct strengths. Cleaners are also great for offensive-minded players, as Incendiary Rounds deal extra burn damage to enemies. Firebomb dominates game modes such as Occupy, Domination, and Zone Control, as you can easily clear off an entire point with the Molotov cocktail ability. And for the cherry on top, The Purifier ultra never gets old, as you are able to mow down enemies with a flamethrower. </p>
 <h3 id="h-1-libertad" data-injectable="false">1. Libertad </h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="495" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="false">Other factions are flashier on paper and more fun, but you won’t find a better collection of abilities than the Libertad faction offers. Libertad’s passive trait constantly heals you and your allies. Both activated ability options provide an instant health boost, and the ultra ability gives a massive health boost to your team. The ultra ability, in particular, poses a massive threat as it can give an entire team extra health on an objective and makes it very difficult to break. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-creator-says-seamless-co-op-mod-may-be-added-as-a-feature-in-a-future-fromsoftware-game.903711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-creator-says-seamless-co-op-mod-may-be-added-as-a-feature-in-a-future-fromsoftware-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mere days before the launch of the one and only Elden Ring expansion (Shadow of the Erdtree), PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftwares-says-elden-rings-seamless-co-op-mod-is-definitely-not-something-we-actively-oppose-and-may-even-consider-ideas-like-that-with-our-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cornered</a> FromSoftware president and game director Hidetaka Miyazaki. The interview wasn't merely focused on the DLC, though; for example, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-creator-doesnt-blame-you-if-you-need-guides-to-complete-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> Miyazaki how he felt about players using guides to complete Elden Ring, and he replied that it's a perfectly valid playstyle.</p>
<p>Similarly, PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fromsoftwares-says-elden-rings-seamless-co-op-mod-is-definitely-not-something-we-actively-oppose-and-may-even-consider-ideas-like-that-with-our-future-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inquired</a> with Miyazaki about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-coop-mod-is-getting-a-public-beta-on-may-27th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seamless Co-Op mod</a>. For those unaware, this is by far the most popular Elden Ring mod available on PC, with 3.7 million downloads on Nexus Mods. It allows players to experience FromSoftware's game with up to six players (the host plus five) without any of the default limitations.</p>
<p>Not only is Miyazaki not opposed; apparently, he could consider a 'seamless co-op' feature for the studio's future titles.</p>
<p><em>It's definitely not something we actively oppose or want to downplay, wanting to go through the whole game together. In terms of where we were with Elden Ring, it was simply a case of wanting that more loose, casual style—drop in, defeat a boss, drop out. It doesn't put any technical restrictions on the player, it just sort of lets them complete this focus and then move on, so to speak.</em></p>
<p><em>That's not to say we won't consider other ways like you and your friend played, from beginning to end, total co-op—that's not to say we won't consider ideas like that with our future games.</em></p>
<p>Such a feature would definitely attract the favor of many, many players, especially on consoles where mods for the game are not available.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will be released on Friday, June 21, on all platforms. However, check back on Wccftech tomorrow to find our full review of the expansion pack.</p>

  <p id="b3srhK">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/28/3701098/habbo-hotel-developer-releases-api-for-new-games-platform"><em>Habbo Hotel</em></a> community — yes, there’s still a community — is celebrating the announcement of <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em>, a rerelease of the original game as it was in 2005. <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> goes live Tuesday; developer Sulake has been restoring the game for six months after it found “an old decrepit server with some long-lost files.”</p>
<p id="Gl4q0q"><em>Habbo Hotel</em> has remained in existence (with plenty of ups and downs) since 2000, and people have been playing it since. It <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21P28J/">had a particularly large resurgence</a> in 2020 during the pandemic. With all the tweaks and adjustments over the past 20 years, the modern version of <em>Habbo Hotel</em> looks a lot different than your childhood nostalgia. <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> is intended to fix that. “The simplicity, charm and magic of that early version of <em>Habbo</em> are things we want to retain and protect, so we intend to be careful about what we add, and when,”<em> </em><a href="https://www.habbo.com/community/article/34151/launching-tomorrow-habbo-hotel-origins">Sulake wrote on the <em>Habbo Hotel Origins </em>website</a>.</p>

<p id="OkOoPs">Sulake wrote that <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> will be “community-led;” the InfoBus Park is now a “democratic forum” where players can vote on changes to the game.</p>
<p id="UZ8gW7">The <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> Reddit page is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/habbo/comments/1dhvxuy/were_bringin_back_old_school_habbo_hotel/">awash with celebration</a>: The old times are back! There are some caveats to that, though: <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> won’t support casinos or any type of gambling, despite the game being for people 18 years or older. <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> won’t have any NFTs, either, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/habbo-hotel-nft-intergation-avatars/">unlike <em>Habbo Hotel</em></a>.</p>
<p id="LHVuWf">Sulake intends to keep <em>Habbo Hotel Origins</em> alive as long as the game sustains itself.</p>

I’m a harsh critic of action given my martial arts family background, but while there are moments that I felt lacking in martial logic (even with Newtonian-defying Jedi powers at play), there are also deftly choreographed stunts that will leave you wide-eyed, even stunned.</p><p>Spoiler alert: Mae slays Master Indara early, a move that has all the old-school, visceral power of a similarly early death on <em>Game Of Thrones</em>. To cast an actor as illustrious as Carrie-Anne Moss only to kill her off in the first scene of the series is not just shocking, but brave. It’s also the moment <em>The Acolyte</em> won me over.</p><p>“<em>If they kill off Carrie-Anne’s character,</em>” I thought,<em> “they must have big plans.”</em></p><p>Those plans become clearer when we’re introduced to Jedi Knight Yord Fandar (Charlie Barnett), tasked with investigating Indara’s murder. The problem: Mae has an identical twin, Osha Aniseya, a Jedi dropout but who still pulses with the Force. True, the identical twins trope is a bit shticky for <em>Star Wars</em>, and a tad on the nose (good and bad sides of the Force, and all that), but it didn’t undermine my investment, and it won’t yours.</p><p>Oh, and hang in for Yord’s outfit. Trust me.</p><p>All of the Jedi wear gold and tan, a nod to where we are in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline: These are the days of the High Republic, about a century before <em>The Phantom Menace </em>and the rise of Anakin Skywalker, aka Lord Vader, and before the Fall of the Jedi.

While it’s tempting to view these as, essentially, morality tales, <em>The Acolyte </em>reminds us that good versus evil is rarely a binary choice, that shades of gray live in all of us.<br></p><p>So who can you trust ultimately, if all of us are just a wee bit untrustworthy? Here, <em>The Acolyte </em>assuages those pangs of self-doubt with the introduction of Jedi Master Sol (played by the inspired Lee Jung-jae), who swallows whole every scene he’s in. As a lifelong<em> Star Wars</em> fan, I can say with no equivocation that Master Sol has perhaps the greatest Jedi “presence” ever felt on screen.</p><p>Lee learned English just to play the role, and the devotion to the character, Osha’s former instructor and caretaker, is evident. Each line is delivered with such intention and heart, never succumbing to mawkishness. Master Sol quickly becomes the voice of truth here, transforming this new chapter in an iconic series into the kind of character study we long for. <em>Star Wars </em>has always represented a glimpse at a futuristic past that reverberates with hard truths about our present: the frailties of leaders, even the most gifted of them; the immense consequences these leaders have on the generations that follow. Ultimately, though, <em>Star Wars</em> is a parable about the pursuit of a greater good.</p><p>The original <em>Star Wars</em> changed movies forever. George’s prequel trilogy made important ideas like the Force accessible for younger audiences. Carrie-Anne’s <em>The Matrix </em>still impacts how we look at authoritarian systems. We are in the post-<em>Endgame</em> era of Marvel, and arguably the Baby Yoda craze has come and gone. Disney needed a weighty, gripping adventure that could inspire something bigger than just a good review. It needed new icons. It appears to have achieved that with Master Sol. <em>The Acolyte</em> is the genesis of something profound. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Acolyte</em> is streaming now on Disney+</a></span>. </p><p>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If it’s up to Bethesda executive producer Todd Howard, Starfield will be getting annual expansions for the foreseeable future. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with MrMattyPlays</a> on YouTube, Howard talked about the future of Starfield and what he’d like to see for the game moving forward.</p>



<p>Howard says that the current plan is to have a new story expansion each year. </p>



<p>“How long that continues, hopefully a very long time, but we’re planning for the one after this, so there will be another one,” he said.</p>



<p>He then added, as a follow up to a previous question in the interview regarding answering lingering questions from the game’s story, that the goal with the expansions isn’t to answer all of the questions players have.</p>



<p>“We sort of look at it and say, ‘hey, what’s a good angle? What do we want to add to the game as far as an experience or a tone?’,” Howard said. </p>



<p>Right now, Bethesda is working on Starfield’s Shattered Space expansion. The expansion, which is set to launch this fall, follows “a mysterious power stirs in the city of Dazra on House Va’ruun’s hidden homeworld.” </p>



<p>In Shattered Space, players will have to “investigate a frightening cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and gear.”</p>
