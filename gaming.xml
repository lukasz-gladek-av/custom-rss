        <p>As 360 digital store closures looms.</p>

            <p>
With the closure of Microsoft's Xbox 360 digital store looming, the company has announced a final batch of heavy discounts on earlier-gen titles, as well as the release of a new Xbox Series X/S dynamic background, inspired by the Xbox 360's much-loved "blades" dashboard design.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">announced the impending closure of its Xbox 360 digital store</a> last August, revealing it would no longer be possible to purchase games, DLC, or other entertainment content via the Xbox 360 console or web-based Xbox 360 Marketplace from 29th July this year.
</p>
<p>
It did, however, confirm previously purchased Xbox 360 games and DLC would remain downloadable and playable - including via backward compatibility on modern consoles - even after the store's closure. And since then, it's been working with third-party publisher to offer heavy price reductions on its digital Xbox 360 catalogue.
</p> <div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
To that end, today brings a third and final batch of Xbox 360 Marketplace discounts ahead of its closure later this month, and a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-360-price-reductions-available-now/">full list of reduced games</a> can be found on Microsoft's website.
</p>
<p>
And if that's not enough nostalgia for you, Microsoft has also released the aforementioned Xbox 360-inspired dynamic background for Xbox Series X/S, enabling users of a certain age to stare misty eyed into the middle distance as they fondly recall a time those now-stationary Blades could be manipulated with affectionate gusto.

<p>
To grab the new background, hit the Xbox button on your controller to open the guide, then navigate to Profile &amp; system &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Personalisation &gt; My background &gt; Dynamic backgrounds. There, you'll find the Xbox 360 Blades design either under Featured or Xbox dynamic backgrounds, and you can download it by hitting the A button.
</p>
<p>
And finally, if you're eager to advertise your old-school predilections to the world, Microsoft has <a href="https://gear.xbox.com/collections/the-heritage-collection">re-released the Xbox 360 Heritage Collection</a> - featuring a selection of 360-inspired t-shirts and pullover hoodie - on its Gear Shop for a limited time.

		<p>Dead by Daylight’s 2v8 multiplayer mode will be coming next week as a time limited event. 2v8 will be available from 25th July until 8th August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | 2v8 Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2v8 does exactly what it says on the tin, doubling the player count in the game with two killers teaming up to hunt down eight survivors.</p>
<p>The long-awaited game mode won’t stick around for very long, but Behaviour has put plenty of work into trying to rebalance the game around the increased player count. There’s a new super-sized map, as well as gameplay adjustments to rebalance the action. This means there’s&nbsp;a class-like system instead of Perks and Cages instead of Hooks.</p>
<p>In other Dead by Daylight news, cross-progression is coming to the game on 22nd July! Progression, inventory, paid currency and DLC can all be shared between all platforms, with the sole exception of Nintendo Switch not sharing currency or DLC. <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/articles/28143341034644-Cross-Progression-Release-FAQ">Head here for Behaviour’s FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>We have have Lara Croft of the Tomb Raider franchise entering The Fog as the latest game franchise crossover and guest Survivor.</p>

And it seems players agree that these aren’t great versions of these games, as data shows that these ports are likely flopping hard on iOS. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/under-2000-people-have-paid-to-play-resident-evil-7-on-ios-estimates-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported on July 16 by <em>MobileGamer.biz</em></a></span>, data seems to indicate that<em> RE7'</em>s iOS port, which launched on July 2, has only made Capcom around $28,000 via 2,000 people paying for the full game after downloading the free demo. </p><p>Other AAA iPhone ports have also failed to find much success on the App Store. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/those-assassins-creed-resident-evil-and-death-stranding-ports-have-bombed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/those-assassins-creed-resident-evil-and-death-stranding-ports-have-bombed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As previously reported by the outlet in June</a></span>, data indicates that after a month only 3,000 people had purchased <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>, even though its free trial version had been downloaded over 120,000 times. </p><p>2023's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake</a></span> did a <em>bit </em>better after six months on the market. It was downloaded 357,000 times with data indicating that around 7,000 people paid the $30 to unlock the full game. <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, on the other hand, did horribly on iOS. In about the same amount of time, only around 5,700 people paid $15 to play <em>Village </em>on their iPhone or iPad. </p><h2 id="h85919"><a id=""></a>Why AAA games are flopping on iPhone</h2><p>So what’s happening here? Well, I think the higher price points for these AAA ports are scaring away a lot of mobile players who are used to free games. But I think the bigger issue is that these aren’t the kind of games people want to play on their phones in 2024. I love <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span>. It’s a wonderful return to the stealth-focused gameplay and smaller worlds of older <em>AC</em> games, while still feeling modern and fun to play. Good shit! But I have zero desire to play that game on a tiny iPhone with a cumbersome controller attached or via terrible touchscreen buttons. </p><p>These AAA games were designed to be played for hours and hours, often in a comfy chair or couch, with a controller or keyboard and a big screen. And that’s just not the experience you get with a phone. The best mobile games are pick-up-and-play. Things you can open up, have a bit of fun with, and then drop a few seconds later because your bus arrived or your game finished installing on Xbox. </p><p> iPhones will for sure get more powerful and be able to run even more AAA games at high framerates and resolutions in the future. That’s a fact. But I’m not sold on any of these games finding success on the App Store because they just aren’t what most people want to play on their mobile devices. </p><p>So now the question is, with Capcom and other publishers not making money on these ports, how long before Apple stops (probably, this hasn’t been confirmed) funding them and all these AAA games stop arriving on iOS? How long before Apple tosses in the towel on gaming once more? We shall see...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> single player horror game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-casting-of-frank-stone">The Casting of Frank Stone</a> will launch on 3rd September, Behaviour Interactive and developer Supermassive Games have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Murder Mill Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6FODK6lwtM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Coming from the makers of The Dark Pictures Anthology series, The Casting of Frank Stone is an intriguing collaboration with one of the most popular and enduring multiplayer horror games out there.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone steps back to the summer of 1980, with four friends intent on making an iconic example of horror cinema. Instead they set loose a dormant horror into the real world. Your choices while playing this branching narrative will change how their relationships develop, and ultimately their fates while recording their shoot of Murder Mill.</p>
<p>As expected from Supermassive, the game will weave together this branching narrative with environmental puzzles, hunting for clues and Quick Time Events.</p>

<p>Coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, there will be two versions of the game: the standard edition at $39.99, and the deluxe edition at $49.99. This grants instant access to the Cutting Room Floor feature that lets you backtrack to key story points, and eight alternate costumes.</p>
<p>Pre-ordering either version will also unlock rewards in Dead by Daylight:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Frank Stone Mask” cosmetic for The Trapper (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>“Frank Stone” badge and banner (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>Three Rellik doll charms (Deluxe Edition exclusive)</li>
<li>“Murder Mill” shirt cosmetic for all Original Survivors</li>
<li>“Murder Mill” badge and banner</li>
<li>Two million Bloodpoints</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> is one of the best titles available on the Nintendo Switch period, acting as a huge breath of creativity as the console's first new 2D Mario title. Over 150 different levels are available in the game, with plenty of secrets and challenges to uncover as you play through the story. One of the new features of Wonder is the Badge system, which allows you to grant characters unique abilities to use throughout levels. At $47.99, this is a deal you do not want to pass up.<h2>Super Mario RPG for $39.97</h2><div id="203264" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Mario RPG - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> was initially released in 1996 for the SNES, and over two decades later, a remake has been released for Nintendo Switch. This title is an excellent game, even being a great entry point into the world of RPGs. As one of the wackiest Mario titles, there are dozens of unique characters to discover who have never appeared outside of this title. It's also one of the rare occasions where Mario and Bowser work together - the King of the Koopas even joins your party! The legendary Yoko Shimomura even returned to compose the soundtrack, making for an unforgettable Mario experience.<h2>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door for $55.40</h2><div catalogid="0a7e638b-8ee3-4ebe-bd97-da0ae61c1e81" id="201624"><div id="201624" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door (Switch)</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch remake of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-review">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> is getting a small Prime Day discount despite coming out fairly recently. Originally coming out in the GameCube era,  the graphics have upgraded to give the characters and their environments a bigger pop of color, but the comedy threaded into the game's plot remains a classic.

Featuring a Mario sprite running on top of a warp pipe, the HORIPAD controller is an excellent addition to any Nintendo Switch collection.

                <p>Microsoft has allegedly shuttered one of its major Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) teams, laying off a number of employees in the process. The former team leader sent an internal email to a number of Microsoft's staff which revealed the firings, criticized Microsoft's decision, and accused the tech company's leadership of "harassment and toxicity."</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-layoffs-dei-leader-email-2024-7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Business Insider</a> first broke the email. It states that the former leader's "role and team were eliminated due to 'changing business needs' as of July 1st, 2024." Microsoft is following the lead of other tech companies, like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/22/google-meta-other-tech-giants-cut-dei-programs-in-2023.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta and Google</a>, which have also cut down DEI programs founded in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/06/23/addressing-racial-injustice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In particular, Microsoft pledged</a> to double the number of Black and African-American leaders inside the US by 2025, alongside other programs for "addressing racial injustice" such as workplace trainings and approving more Black-owned suppliers and financial institutions.</p><p>According to the email, DEI programs across all businesses are in danger of these kinds of cuts or shutting down completely. It claims that the possibility of conservative political policies like Project 2025 has shaped Microsoft's decision-making. The email explains, "Hence the purposeful and strategic 3-5 year shelf life of many company's inclusion commitments post the murder of George Floyd are being reevaluated and the way I see it, the timing was impeccable so businesses everywhere could reevaluate the path forward should their U.S. federal contracts be at risk if the work continues on its face."</p><p>The email has lot of praise for the team itself. It states that it was staffed with "brilliant, ethical, and world class strategists at the company, helping to make the world a better place." The email also accused Microsoft's executive leadership of "investigated and evidenced discrimination, harassment, and toxicity."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Microsoft for comment, but has not yet received a response.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/16/24199957/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-coming-soon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a new community update, Larian Studios <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1086940%2Fview%2F4240783699885624491">has shared a brief overview</a> of all the things it’s working on for the next <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> patch.</p><p>Larian has previously announced that patch 7, due out in September, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170409/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-pc-consoles">will include the release of official mod support</a> and the introduction of a toolkit that will allow players the ability to create their own mods. According to Larian, the toolkit supports the creation of new items, classes and subclasses, races, and more.</p><p>I’ve been modding my games since the days of <em>World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</em> and <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>. However, I’ve always been intimidated by the idea of creating my own mods, even for games I adore. I’m definitely interested to try out the mod toolkit for myself, especially since a lot of the comments Larian shared from modders attest to its ease of use. If the toolkit allows me to create new narrative content, essentially allowing me to re-create my fanfictions in the game, you will never hear from me again.</p><p>In addition to mod support and the toolkit, patch 7 will also add a nifty dynamic split-screen co-op feature. Instead of co-op games being permanently bifurcated in split-screen mode, players will have an option that will merge the two screens into one if players are close to each other. It looks pretty dang cool in action.</p><p>On the narrative side, patch 7 will add tweaks and updates to companion stories, dialogue, and romance content. Larian’s also adding new cinematics that reflect some of the game’s more evil endings for origin and dark urge characters. </p><p>Though this forthcoming update feels like Larian’s final goodbye to <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/22/24108773/baldurs-gate-3-larian-dungeons-and-dragons">moves on to other projects</a>, the studio reaffirmed that patch 7 isn’t the last update for the game. Cross-play and photo mode are also on the way. In the meantime, it’s offering players the chance to try out patch 7 before it releases in September in a closed beta you can register for on the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1086940%2FBaldurs_Gate_3%2F"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New information spotted online suggests that The Sims 5, also known as Project Rene, has been allegedly canceled. Instead, the team is shifting their focus to working on The Sims 4, where content is consistently produced for the game. Lovestruck is the latest upcoming expansion for The Sims 4 and is due to be released on July 25.</p>
<p>Project Rene was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first shown off</a> in a "Behind the Sims" summit in 2022. Audiences were told that this would be the next installment in the franchise. Since The Sims 4 was released, audiences have been very vocal about features they'd like to see re-added to the popular simulation game.</p>
<p>Maxis had <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-to-get-inspiration-from-animal-crossing-making-multiplayer-experience-more-interactive/">plans to include the open-world feature</a> in the next game and snippets of gameplay from the project were also shown at the summit. However, multiple rumors are beginning to emerge that The Sims 5 has been canceled.</p>
<p>The rumor first appeared on r/GamingLeaksandRumors, suggesting that developers who were working on The Sims 5 have returned to focus on The Sims 4 instead.<a href="https://imgur.com/a/sims-5-cancelled-rumor-LRAnJbv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Multiple screenshots</a> have since emerged, suggesting that key members of the team for The Sims 5 have since left.</p>
<p>The Senior Game Designer for Project Rene has shifted their efforts to The Sims 4, with the Lead Character Artist leaving their EA job entirely. In what seems to be a screenshot of their LinkedIn page, it shows that The Sims 5 is marked as canceled.</p>
<p>For the time being, these comments and screenshots are all speculation, as Electronic Arts hasn't officially made a statement claiming that Project Rene is canceled. However, those dedicated fans of the franchise are not happy to hear the news.</p>
<p>Compared to the other iterations of the franchise and even the spin-offs, The Sims 4 is not quite a fan favorite. It is disappointing that they may be working on it for another 5-10 years, adding more DLC.</p>
<p>For example, there is the upcoming expansion pack Lovestruck, and plenty of free updates have been added to the game. These updates add sprinkles of new content and some new traits and furniture that can be unlocked by logging into The Sims 4 daily. This was another feature created that didn't go down well with the audience, as not everyone has the time to log in to The Sims 4 daily, meaning they will miss out on the exclusive items and traits added to the game.</p>
<p>Until Electronic Arts releases an official statement on The Sims 5, we can only hope and pray that it's actually still in development. We'll update this story when and if the publisher provides a comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/how-should-we-talk-about-the-trump-thing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here in America, we continue to live in the most precedented unprecedented times, where decades of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/03/27/ar-15-facts-what-we-learned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gun violence</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c977njnvq2do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrifying political strategy</a> have converged around the weekend’s shooting at a Trump rally, which left <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce586kxjvnyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one spectator dead and three people injured</a>, including Trump, who was <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/possible-shots-fired-at-trump-rally-in-butler-pennsylvania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit in the ear</a>. Some Republicans have <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/trump-rally-shooting-conspiracy-theories-flourish-online-rcna161752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spread conspiracies</a> blaming the left (the shooter’s motives remain unclear, though officials are investigating it as an assassination attempt). Democrats have been quick to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/reactions-shooting-trump-rally-pennsylvania-2024-07-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offer condolences</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/after-trump-assassination-attempt-biden-campaign-pauses-ads/story?id=111930384" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pull Biden’s campaign communications</a>. And, in peak “one of these things is not like the other,” comedy band Tenacious D <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/jack-black-cancels-tenacious-d-tour-trump-assassination-kyle-gass-1236073486/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled their tour</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenacious D, a band fronted by actor Jack Black and Kyle Gass, was on tour in Sydney, Australia when Gass, as part of making a birthday wish on stage, said “Don’t miss Trump next time.” The backlash was swift. Some Australian wacko politician Luke had to teach me about <a href="https://x.com/senatorbabet/status/1813028533998133257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded the duo’s deportation from Australia</a>. And Black, the other half of the creative duo, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9e5msPpC3y/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=950c251c-cd6d-4924-aefb-4341ce29df7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he was “blindsided by what was said at the show on Sunday. I would never condone hate speech or political violence in any form. After much reflection, I no longer feel it is appropriate to continue the Tenacious D tour, and all future creative plans are on hold.”</p><p><strong>(Update, 5:20pm:</strong> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tenacious-d-kyle-gass-parts-agent-trump-joke-controversy-1235061561/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> reports that Gass has since been dropped by his agent. Gass also made a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9e9hS3x3f1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement on Instagram</a>, writing in part, "The line I improvised on stage Sunday night in Sydney was highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake. I don't condone violence of any kind, in any form, against anyone."<strong>)</strong></p><p>I haven’t thought about Tenacious D since 2006, so I don’t have any skin in the game on the canceled tour or the future of the band. But they’re a unique meeting point for the messy discourse following the assassination attempt. They’re famous enough to be scolded by those who believe in civility (or at least want to perform it), and famous enough to cave to the scolding and issue a generic Instagram statement. But they’re also minor enough to say, or feel they can say, what regular people might want to say as complicated humans living through intensely fucked-up times.&nbsp;</p><p>Black <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hPUM01nuis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared to laugh</a> at the joke on stage, suggesting the canceled tour is less a reflection of an earnest commitment to compassion or civility and more a PR move, especially in light of his career in voice acting. And while you could read Gass’ joke as an incitement to violence about which people should be concerned, there’s no denying it’s an expression of the way lots of regular people are feeling right now, which is one of the functions of art. Canceling their tour feels like the as-yet weirdest example of how much everyone—both public figures and regular folks like you and me—are struggling to figure out how to talk about what happened to Trump.</p><p>Let’s take a look at the field. In terms of people you would expect to be obligated to say something about all this, Democrats have long prioritized <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ExplainTheJoke/comments/14n08xq/what_is_this_referring_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their vision of civility</a> over actually achieving anything politically, so their responses, as well as their strategic silences, aren’t a surprise to me. It has not been lost on many that <a href="https://x.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1812268746574020870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nancy Pelosi sent Trump her love</a> even though Republicans <a href="https://time.com/6226946/paul-pelosi-attack-gop-response-political-discourse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mercilessly mocked</a> the attack on her husband in 2022. “<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/us/thoughts-and-prayers-florida-school-shooting-trnd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thoughts and prayers</a>,” one of America’s leading exports, has taken on a new cast since Saturday. And while taking the high road might sometimes be laudable for everyday humans, we’ve seen, time and again, that Democrats’ “<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/michelle-obama-on-famous-catchphrase-when-they-go-low-we-go-high.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going high</a>” has simply been met by more “going low” from their opponents. By retreating when so many eyes are on the national stage, they’re simply handing the conversation over to one side, and I don’t think it’s fatalist to say that doesn’t lead anywhere good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So far, Republicans have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/trump-rally-shooting-republican-reactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely filled</a> the space with sympathy for Trump and the killed and injured attendees, though also with blame for Biden and the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/2024/07/13/trump-shooting-rally-witness-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press</a>. J. D. Vance, now Trump’s Vice Presidential nominee, said on <a href="https://x.com/JDVance1/status/1812280973628965109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, “The central premise of the Biden campaign is that President Donald Trump is an authoritarian fascist who must be stopped at all costs. That rhetoric led directly to President Trump's attempted assassination.”</p><p>Much hay has also been made over the widow of Saturday’s victim <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/15/us-news/corey-comperatores-widow-reveals-his-final-words-before-he-was-killed-at-trump-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refusing to speak</a> to Biden when he called her, as well as the fact that Trump <em>hasn’t</em> called her. Whatever this says about civility in politics or the rabid commitment of Trump’s base, I think it’s fair for someone grieving the death of their husband to talk to or not talk to whoever they want. She might find herself in the spotlight, but she’s not a public figure under any particular obligation.</p><p>Which brings us to all the rest of us. For us regular people, following the assassination attempt Saturday, social media was abuzz with jokes similar to Gass’, and then just as abuzz with people warning other people not to say stuff that could get them investigated by the feds. This is good advice, and many people are rightly worried about the consequences of being publicly anti-Trump if he wins in November.&nbsp;</p><p>But let’s remember that life does not take place solely on social media, which brings me to a question I—and maybe you—have been wrangling with since Saturday: how should you talk about all this?&nbsp;</p><p>In the privacy of your own life (and, if you’re <em>really</em> concerned about opsec, far away from your phone), you can believe and think and say whatever you want. Is it wrong to wish for the death of someone who has been very clear they wish for your death? Is the assassination attempt the Right’s violent rhetoric looping around to bite them in the ass? And should a <em>comedy rock band</em> play by regular person rules, or by public figure rules?&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the fact that I personally am religious, I don’t believe it’s my job, or the job of any regular people, to dispense a unique grace to Trump or his powerful allies in this instance. A bad thing happening to a bad person doesn’t make that person good, or mean that they are owed a pass on their harmful words and actions. You and I are not under the same obligation Democrat politicians and <em>Tenacious D</em> seem to think they are to pivot our priorities or press “pause” on our causes. We are under an obligation to make our world a place worth living in, whether we define that through our faith or our politics or our art or whatever values guide us. We can hold a lot of different ideas in our brains and hearts at once. Tenacious D might cancel the tour, but we don’t have to.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Supermassive Games' narrative-focused single-player Dead by Daylight spin-off, The Casting of Frank Stone, launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 3rd September.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-narrative-game-the-casting-of-frank-stone-revealed">last December</a>, The Casting of Frank Stone's story begins in Cedar Hills, Oregon, in the summer of 1980, when a group of young filmmakers travels to an abandoned steel mill in order to shoot their horror movie, Murder Mill. Unbeknown to the teenagers, however, a dormant evil lies waiting, and the group ends up capturing far more on camera than it bargained for, creating a "soon-to-be cult classic with an insidious influence."
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, The Casting of Frank Stone follows the interactive horror movie template Supermassive has been steadily refining across the likes of Until Dawn, The Dark Pictures Anthology, and 2022's The Quarry. By making choices as the branching cinematic story unfolds, players can shift the narrative, influencing the direction of the shoot, affecting characters' relationships, and even their fates.

<p>
"Change reality with your choices, unlock new paths with your actions, and discover what horrors your final cut may hold," explains publisher (and Dead by Daylight developer) Behaviour Interactive. "In a story where every move matters, actions can speak louder than words. Explore a cinematic nightmare, testing your wits as you solve environmental puzzles and react to Quick Time Events. Guide your cast of characters through eerie locations and search for clues that hide the bigger picture."
</p>
<p>
The Casting of Frank Stone's 3rd September release date is just one of several announcements made during Behaviour Interative's Dead by Daylight 8th anniversary livestream. As well as highlighting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raiders-lara-croft-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">arrival of Lara Croft</a> in its asymmetrical multiplayer horror game, the studio has also confirmed it's releasing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCumCxtPTew">new 2v8 game mode</a> on 25th July, enabling eight survivors to face off against two killers across five classic maps.
</p>
<p>
Maps have been expanded to accommodate the increased player count, and the number of generators has also doubled, with survivors (who'll now be sent directly to cages if downed) needing to repair eight out of 13 to escape. Other changes include a new survivor class system, which ditches Perks in favour of clearer player "roles", and Power alterations for killers, including a new team-based ability that can be unleashed as a duo.
</p>
<p>
And finally, Behaviour Interactive has confirmed cross-progression is coming to Dead by Daylight on 22nd July, enabling players to share their progress, inventory (excluding platform-exclusive items), paid currency, and DLC between owned versions of the game on PlayStation, Xbox, Steam, the Epic Games Store, and Windows Store  using a Behaviour Account. On Switch, however, things are little more convoluted.
</p>
<p>
Progression and inventory can still be shared between platforms via Switch but paid currency and DLC bought on Nintendo's console can't be shared elsewhere. However, paid currency and DLC bought on a different platform <em>can</em> be used on Switch, and if that sounds excessively confusing, Behaviour Interactive has <a href="https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us/sections/6714025818260-Behaviour-Account-Cross-Progression">released an FAQ</a> to clarify some details.

Effectively, beginning with the upcoming 22nd season, battle passes will be split into halves and players have to pay the price of a regular season for half of one now. The justification from EA and Respawn was that players would receive more content by paying for each of the splits, but it seems that the publisher—which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/did-these-horrible-deeds-clinch-eas-spot-as-americas-wo-452564685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/did-these-horrible-deeds-clinch-eas-spot-as-americas-wo-452564685">repeatedly</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/04/09/ea-voted-worst-company-in-america-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ranked</a></span> at the top of the world’s worst companies—is just trying to squeeze its community for more money. The community notes on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X (formerly known as Twitter) post</a></span> announcing the change angrily insist that this move “is only profitable for EA Shareholders.”</p><p>In short, the news has hardly gone over well, and if you check out <em>Apex Legends</em>’<em> </em>Steam page right now, its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172470/Apex_Legends/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent reviews</a></span> have fallen to “Overwhelmingly Negative,” a distinction reserved for either the absolute worst games or the targets of Steam <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-reviews-1851557175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-steam-reviews-1851557175">review</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-steam-reviews-apology-psn-login-1851455150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-steam-reviews-apology-psn-login-1851455150">bombings</a></span>. The latter happens to be the case here.</p><p>As you can imagine, most of the criticisms being levied at <em>Apex</em> <em>Legends</em> in its Steam reviews chiefly take issue with the battle pass changes, not the gameplay itself. One review reads, “Now with the new battle pass system, I’m deleting the game, as well as most players, bye!” Another cuts right to the point, reading, “Ea as usual destroying a fun game with a ridiculous amount of over monetization. Classic greedy EA.”</p><p>Per the last comment, a lot of folks don’t seem all that surprised that EA, a company known for its numerous microtransaction-riddled titles, might try a move like this. “EA EA EA why do u have to destroy every game u create at some point,” reads one disgruntled review whose writer seems to have been in this position before. The review that cuts the deepest simply says, “2 10 dollar battle passes per season. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/titanfall-3-never-giving-up-respawn-ea-1851499213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/titanfall-3-never-giving-up-respawn-ea-1851499213"><em>Titanfall</em></a></span> died for this slop.”</p><p>The game’s overall rating is still holding at “Mostly Positive.” Folks on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4imlk/apex_legends_reviews_are_overwhelmingly_negative/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4imlk/apex_legends_reviews_are_overwhelmingly_negative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Apex Legends</em>’ subreddit</a></span> think that as well-intentioned a move as it is to review bomb, and subsequently ward players away from what they perceive to be a money pit, they’d be “shocked if this made any difference at all.” Some are a bit more optimistic, but only if they’re able to realistically hurt the publisher’s wallet by the end of the next season, which begins next month. In the meantime, a whole slew of players are giving up on <em>Apex Legends</em>, while others wonder if they’re really ready to throw in the towel on a game they’ve loved for years.</p><p>Despite the backlash, Respawn and EA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4nkn7/is_there_any_dev_response_in_light_of_recent/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1e4nkn7/is_there_any_dev_response_in_light_of_recent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">haven’t said a thing in response</a></span> to the <em>Apex Legends</em> community. If either is considering rolling back the changes, it hasn’t betrayed that in any communications. In light of that, Kotaku has reached out for comment, though have yet to hear back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 is the ultimate way to immerse yourself in the world of the NCAA, all from the comfort of your couch. Dynasty mode is the pinnacle of that glory, allowing you to take the role of a coach and build the school of your choice. Choosing your coach backstory is a key decision when entering the mode, and we've got the rundown on how to pick the best coach type for you in CFB 25.</p><h2>Choosing Coach Role</h2><p>The first decision you'll need to make when selecting your coach for dynasty mode in EA Sports College Football 25 is what your role is going to be. You can choose Head Coach, Offensive Coordinator, and Defensive Coordinator.</p><p>The Offensive Coordinator and Defensive Coordinator are in charge of their respective sides, meaning you'll only recruit and play in the game as one or the other. Head Coach means you're responsible for both sides of the ball, both on and off the field.</p><p>It is also worth noting that you'll have specific goals presented to you throughout the year based on the role you chose. Meeting those goals and your overall position/stats relevant to the side you manage affects how well you're graded at the end of the year.</p><h2>Existing Or Custom Coach</h2><p>The next choice is to decide whether you want to use a pre-existing coach or create your own. Existing coaches come with their own preset skills, schemes, and strategies, giving you an advantage in that they are already leveled up.</p><p>Creating a new coach lets you customize your own, though you'll have to grow them each game. The benefit of this is that you'll be able to customize your strengths and weaknesses as you go, instead of being locked into pre-made archetypes and skills.</p><h2>Which Coach Backstory Is Best?</h2><p>The final and arguably most impactful decision is choosing which of the three backstories you want to go with:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335480" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4335480"></a><figcaption>College Football 25 coach backstories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1841/18416792/4335480-coachtypebackstory.jpg"></figure><ul><li><strong>Motivator</strong> - Get your players to play their best by boosting their rating and composure. Nobody has it better than us.</li><li><strong>Recruiter</strong> - Jimmys and joes, not Xs and Os. You scout faster and recruit better than any other type of coach.</li><li><strong>Tactician</strong> - Boost your player's rating on gameday. Scheme up the big plays and let the visor fly.</li></ul><p>While there is no wrong option, a <strong>Recruiter seems to be the best option across the board</strong>, as it'll help you build your school in the long term thanks to the ability to scout faster and recruit better. Regardless of what you select, you'll earn coach points in each game that go towards buying skills that impact both on and off-the-field actions.</p><p>Once you sign your contract, you'll need to live up to the hype. Contracts and expectations are based on the school's historical records. The bigger the school, the more chance you may get fired and have to find another down the line.</p><p>College Football 25 is one of the biggest releases of the year.
