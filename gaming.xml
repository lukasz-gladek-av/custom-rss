            <p>
I fondly cherish my many memories of claustrophobia, confusion and terror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a>. I can't get enough of the experience of being lodged behind the furniture like some teenager's hurriedly hidden copy of Loaded (or whatever the kids are reading now), rifle pivoting wildly between barricaded doors and windows, as enemy players bustle around the roof like awful, C4-toting pigeons.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then I do feel the urge for some kind of proper, real-time tactical overview. Don't we have drones for that, Mr Clancy? As such, I'm moderately pleased to hear that Ubisoft are working on a top-down turn-based game set in the Rainbow Six universe.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The rumour in question comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-turn-based-game/">Insider Gaming</a>, who appear to have access to a whole wardrobe full of Ubisoft's dirty laundry, and are now skulking inside that wardrobe with a shotgun. The project is allegedly one or two years from release. As it stands, it's said to play a lot like XCOM, but with fixtures and a "loop" borrowed from Siege: you'll pick operators based on their skills to raid buildings and save hostages, all the Clancy favourites. It's said to last approximately 25-30 hours. The report has been corroborated by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, who adds in <a href="https://deadgame.substack.com/p/the-switch-2-is-having-an-xbox-moment">the latest Dead Game newsletter</a> that the project is codenamed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slice-and-dice">Slice &amp; Dice</a> and is led by Elie Benhamou, the game director for Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.
</p>
<p>
The estimable Rock Paper Shotgun verdict on Breakpoint was that it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-ghost-recon-breakpoint">broadly sucked arse</a>, despite a meticulously-woven open world. The rumoured "Slice &amp; Dice" concept seems promising, however, particularly if it can incorporate all the tricky things Siege players do with destructible surfaces. 
</p>
<p>
Assuming the reports are legit, I imagine the major worry for the project's developers right now is the potential impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">Ubisoft's carving out of a new Tencent-backed subsidiary for their most profitable games</a> - that's Assassin's Creed, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>We're still waiting for a proper, top-down tactical overview of how this subsidiary will be run: the deal covers studios in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia, but the number of individual developers involved remains to be determined. It's also not clear how developers might move back and forth between the new subsidiary and the rest of Ubisoft: Siege's development is led by Ubisoft Montreal, but features contributions from teams based in Toronto, Kyiv, Shanghai and Chengdu.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> developer Grinding Gear Games has acknowledged feedback to its Dawn of the Hunt update from players frustrated with the game's slow pace.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3740562">0.2.0</a>, arrived last week with a wealth of new content and a new playable character class, the Huntress. Simultaneously, the developer nerfed plenty of abilities and made other changes to tweak the endgame, many of which have unintentionally impacted the main campaign.</p>
<p>Now Grinding Gear Games has <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205">released a post</a> detailing new and forthcoming changes to appease fans, as development continues in early access.</p>

<p>"Many people are reporting that gameplay is feeling too slow," the developer acknowledged. "Sometimes this comes in the form of people saying that monster life is too high, or player damage is too low, or areas are taking too long. In this post we will talk about some of the things we have already done, and more of the changes we are planning on making."</p>
<p>Having nerfed minion damage and life, these will now be increased to a level similar to before the update, while retaining the new scaling for the endgame.</p>
<p>Monster health has also already been dropped by 25 percent to alleviate clearspeed concerns.</p>
<p>The developer is also looking into the size of environments, with players criticising their large size. "Many players are reporting that areas feel like they are too large," wrote the developer. "Normally when this is the case, the main reason is due to other concerns such as monster life or player damage being incorrect, or just a lack of entertaining content in the area. However, we are checking to see if there are any outliers that players are spending too long in to see if any changes to area size need to happen."</p>
<p>Additionally, the developer is making changes to its new Huntress class, following concerns the power of the class is locked behind the parry mechanic. As such, a new skill will be added to provide Frenzy charges without needing to parry, though this will be carefully balanced to still reward those using the mechanic.</p>
<p>Further, the feel of the parry itself will be improved and spear throws will be buffed to incentivise players alternate more between ranged and melee playstyles.</p>
<p>Server side crashes have been approximately six times higher in this update, but the developer noted these are "significantly easier for us to debug" so should be fixed imminently.</p>
<p>Lastly, quality of life features are on the way such as bookmarking locations on the map, and adding stash tab affinities for more item types.</p>
<p>It's hoped these changes will address concerns from players, with the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/">game's subreddit</a> full of memes and frustration. Perhaps the game's most famous player, Elon Musk, however, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/themayormccheese/comments/1jt42f8/elon_musk_tried_to_prove_hes_a_real_gamer_by/">attempted to play from his private jet and died to the tutorial boss</a>.</p>
<p>Still, Grinding Gear Games is attempting to give Path of Exile 2 more demanding combat in comparison to its biggest competition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>. Indeed, Eurogamer's Bertie described "Souslike thrills" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>As for the full release of the game, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2s-full-release-has-a-65-chance-of-arriving-this-year-says-grinding-gear-games-so-what-could-go-wrong">65 percent chance it will be released this year</a>, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Mouse Work is a fun-looking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shovel-knight-dig">Shovel Knight Dig</a> developer Nitrome began work on in January, just four months ago, following Nintendo's first Switch 2 trailer. 
</p>
<p>
Remember in that trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">how we got a glimpse of a Joy-Con 2 controller zooming along a flat surface</a>? This prompted whispers that Switch 2 would include mouse controls - which, of course, we now know that it does! And it was this hunch that prompted Nitrome to begin work.
</p>
<p>
"The truth is that this project has been developed very rapidly after assuming the mouse mode rumour was true from the January Direct," Nitrome founder Mat Annal told Eurogamer, following the launch of Mouse Work's first trailer - which has already been positively compared to Switch 1 launch title SnipperClips.

<p>
Like SnipperClips, Mouse Work is an indie game from a British studio with experience in Flash development - and it's this background which has enabled Nitrome to make such fast progress, Annal continued. 
</p>
<p>
"We have a background in making games in one month back in the browser days so we are used to working fast," Annal told me, adding that the team was aiming to get Mouse Work ready as soon as possible for the Switch 2's launch window.
</p>
<p>
Mouse Work sees one to four players completing quick mini-games using mouse controls, with more than a dozen shown in the game's reveal trailer, above. There's a distinctive visual style to the project, too, reminiscent of Nintendo's own mini-game compilation, WarioWare. It's definitely one to keep an eye on.
</p>
<p>
Nitrome won <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shovel-knight-dig-a-great-series-safe-in-the-hands-of-the-very-best">praise for its work on Shovel Knight Dig</a>, as well as other past titles such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gunbrick-reloaded-an-ingenious-platformer-gets-a-new-direction">Gunbrick:Reloaded</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bomb-chicken-review-a-blast-from-the-past-that-doesnt-quite-fill-you-up">Bomb Chicken</a>. For more from Annal, Eurogamer previously chatted with Nitrome's founder for a look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-spirit-of-flash-gaming-must-never-die">why the spirit of Flash gaming should never die</a>.

            <p>
Arrowhead Games Studio CEO Shams Jorjani has criticised other games industry executives for letting rank-and-file developers take the fall for what he styles "very unsound business decisions" over the past two years.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
An extremely compressed recap: tens of thousands of people have lost their jobs across companies like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">Embracer</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-toss-another-650-jobs-onto-the-layoff-pyre-in-the-name-of-sustainable-future-growth">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-lay-off-another-185-people-and-shutter-one-of-the-studios-behind-star-wars-outlaws-and-the-division-2">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">Sega</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-announce-900-layoffs-across-naughty-dog-guerilla-insomniac-and-playstation-studios-worldwide">PlayStation</a> in the past year alone, as the industry's beefiest operators <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">struggle to meet the expectations of investors and repay debts</a> following a period of expansion kindled by a gaming boom during the worldwide Covid pandemic lockdowns. Much-hyped, functionally bogus new technologies such as NFTs, cryptocurrency and generative AI have yet to fill the hole, so costs are being cut instead.
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is one of last year's big success stories, despite not having much buzz around it before launch. For all that, and despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/when-helldivers-2-was-at-its-lowest-arrowhead-looked-to-hello-games-and-no-mans-sky-to-keep-their-chin-up">very public difficulty keeping up with an unexpectedly large audience</a>, Jorjani says he's not interested in significant studio expansion. "I want us to be a role model for how to do sustainable growth, because the industry today is not in a good place," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to">The Game Business</a> (HELLO DRINGO) in an interview last week. 
</p>
<p>
"A lot of companies are shedding a lot of jobs. And it's not the people at the top that are losing their jobs, it's people who have moved half across the world to take jobs. And that's because of bad growth decisions made by business leaders who have taken stupid risks."
</p>
<p>
Jorjani had more vitriol to share elsewhere in the chat.  "I wish that our industry hadn't shed almost... 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," he said. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries?
</p>
<p>
"What's happening is that regular developers, are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry. Just because you can hire and triple in size in six months, doesn't mean you should. Or that it's the best thing for the studio's long term business health.
</p>
<p>
"I'm not saying don't grow, but do it in a way where you don't have to then let go of one third of the company because you made stupid decisions. I'm not going to hire a hundred people., I would like to do that and help people in the industry, but my first priority is to make sure that people have jobs for many years." 
</p>
<p>I've written up a bunch of stories about industry layoffs, rich with rhetoric about not taking decisions "lightly" and "aligning" for success. It's rare that the executives quoted in those announcements fall on their swords, or even lightly graze themselves with their swords in the form of some reduced annual compensation. The only caveat I will offer is that executive pay structures can be rather byzantine: many are paid partly in stock, and so have their incomes tethered directly to the company's performance. Still, I doubt the majority are worried about paying their rent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Thanks to Larian's decision to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-mod-downloads-are-at-5-4-million-in-just-four-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release official mod tools for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, several interesting custom campaigns are currently being worked on. One of them, called Act Two Expansion, has received an intriguing teaser trailer from its creator, SquallyDaBeanz.</p>
<p>According to the modder, Baldur's Gate 3: Act Two Expansion adds a whole new region to the game that players can access between Acts 2 and 3. The area includes new areas, dungeons, encounters, items, secrets, puzzles, and lore. The mod aims to provide a whole new region to experience, similar in scope to the Wilderness of Act 1. It is meant to be sandboxy, focusing on combat and exploration rather than story. There will be some new notes, though, expanding on the lore of this region.</p>
<p>The mod takes place after the player leaves the Shadow Cursed Lands but before you reach Baldur's Gate. With the Absolute's army on the march, the main character and their party must find a way to cross the Chionthar River before taking part in an epic battle against the Absolute's army at Rivington.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3: Act Two Expansion is balanced for level 8–10 characters. According to its creator, most mods should be compatible with it, except for those that modify the Shadow Cursed Lands levels and/or level templates. Multiplayer, on the other hand, should be perfectly supported as long as everyone in the group has it installed.</p>
<p>Baldur's Gate 3 supports cross-platform mods, but the creator says this mod wouldn't pass the approval process for consoles, so do not expect to find it there. The current goal is to release it before the end of the year.</p>

The modder is also working on Forsaken, a custom Baldur's Gate 3 campaign that seeks to recreate World of Warcraft's undead starting zone of Tirisfal Glades. A teaser level is already available <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14844" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> game cartridges taste horrible, Nintendo has confirmed, just like Switch 1.</p>
<p>This may sound like a silly thing to write about (because why is someone tasting a Switch 2 game?) but, once again, the bad-tasting Switch cartridge coating is a safety measure.</p>
<p>Original Switch games are coated in denatonium benzoate, which on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/FAQ/After-touching-a-Nintendo-Switch-game-card-my-hand-has-a-strange-bitter-taste-Could-this-be-harmful-/After-touching-a-Nintendo-Switch-game-card-my-hand-has-a-strange-bitter-taste-Could-this-be-harmful-1204008.html?srsltid=AfmBOorBwyOUad4PwhRea2L1pf4c0Yx4LyMH_5sVFlmjF7WNVHysxrXC">Nintendo's own support page</a>, the team describes this as "a bitter-tasting substance". But don't worry, it isn't harmful to your health. It is often used in those polishes that are meant to deter wearers from biting their nails (a tactic my parents' deployed on me when I was younger, I can still recall the taste very well).</p>

<p>"We don't want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption," Nintendo Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta explained to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/">GameSpot</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo had "indeed made it so that if [a Switch 2 game card] enters your mouth, you'll spit it out", Dohta continued. While I assume the likes of you and I would know instinctively not to pop a game into our mouths, small children may not think along those same lines. </p>
<p>Continuing, Dohta said he would not advise even trying just a cursory lick of a Switch 2 cartridge, no matter how tempting it may seem.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto also joined in with the 'why you shouldn't pop a game cart into your mouth' conversation, stating he did indeed lick an original Switch game, but only once and once was more than enough.</p>
<p>"Never again," Kawamoto said, "I can't believe that other people are trying that."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> will be released across both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> and the original Switch.</p>
<p>After months of fans awaiting news on the game's release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-release-window-finally-narrowed-down">Silksong appeared briefly at last week's Switch 2 Direct</a> confirming its release on the new console and a launch window of 2025. It doesn't narrow down the date, but it at least confirms the game remains on the way.</p>
<p>Some fans presumed this meant the game was a Switch 2 exclusive, but Team Cherry's marketing boss Matthew Griffin confirmed on social media Silksong is coming to both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>As one response reads: "...anywhere else?". Silksong is also set for release across PC (Steam), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS4, and PS5.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-lists-hollow-knight-silksong-as-part-of-incredible-upcoming-indie-line-up-and-i-am-acting-totally-normal-about-that">Xbox listed the game in a recent Xbox Wire post focused on its lineup of indie games</a>. And while an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-says-team-cherry">ARG on the release date was debunked</a> at the start of the year, Griffin confirmed at the time "the game is real, progressing and will release".</p> <div>

<p>Along with its appearance at the Direct, it certainly feels like information is starting to build towards a proper reveal. Or is that wishful thinking?</p>
<p>At the least, the <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000096731">Japanese Nintendo site</a> has published some new screenshots of the game showing insect protagonist Hornet in action.</p>

<p>It certainly looks pretty and a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, but fans are still keen to see how the game has developed through its multiple delays.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-a-fantasy-pvpve-action-rpg-announces-new-steam-beta-test-for-late-april/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Mistfall Hunter, an upcoming dark fantasy PvPvE extraction action RPG, is continuing its journey to launch. Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last October during an Xbox Partner Preview event, the game will soon open up for a second beta test on Steam.</p>
<p>The developer from Bellring Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3282300/Mistfall_Hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the second CBT will begin on April 22, 2025, at 01:00 UTC. They also shared plenty of details on the new content and feature additions that players can expect there.</p>
<p>A new class called Reverent Seer will be available to select. These characters use Catalysts to attack or cast spells, making them the first class in Mistfall Hunter with support capabilities. They can also summon supportive runes called Rune Pillars for healing, shielding, and stealth. There are offensive runes, too, that continuously attack, blind, or bind enemies. Furthermore, they're even equipped with a death-prevention spell, which can be incredibly helpful when used at the right time.</p>
<p>The Closed Beta Test will introduce a vast new region north of Brandrgarde. The Forge, where Master Smith Vronn once toiled tirelessly, is now home only to the craftsmen and laborers who have become the Corroded alongside its eternal furnace fires. The developer said that Brandrgarde would simply be too large with these new areas, so they have split the entire fortress into two maps. You'll be placed in one of these two at random in each session.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Mistfall Hunter now supports Solo Mode as well. The maps are the same, though Bellring changed the placement of monsters to accommodate for the different gameplay compared to Trio Mode. Speaking of monsters, there are some new foes to fight: the Warden, the Prison Guard, the Nightwatcher, and the Penitent.</p>
<p>After collecting enough resources, it'll also be possible to upgrade&nbsp;various features in your camp to gain benefits such as increased healing from the Springhorn, increased Warehouse capacity, a higher Gylden Jar limit, and more. In addition, the Warehouse has been upgraded to an account-shared storage facility, which is helpful when playing multiple classes.</p>
<p>There's more: class balance, progression tweaks, performance improvements (including lowered system requirements), and brand new features such as a Friends system, a Fill Team system, an in-game emote system, a Journey system, and real-time voice chat have been added to this new build.</p>
<p>Mistfall Hunter does not have a release date yet, but it is slated to launch this year on PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/oneodio-studio-max-1-wireless-headphone-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oneodio-studio-max-1-wireless-headphone-review.1157991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/oneodio-studio-max-1-wireless-headphone-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>We’re always very keen on discovering the best ways to deliver sounds directly (and often quite loudly) into our ears. If we can do that for less than £200, that’s even better, and OneOdio have proven time and again that they’re capable of delivering top-end sound for less than their competitors. The <a href="https://amzn.to/4i44Qao">Studio Max 1</a> ramps that up, with a package that offers an astounding amount of value.</p>
<p>The Studio Max 1 are a Hi-Res certified pair of headphones that are primarily aimed at the DJ and audiophile market, though they’ll suit anyone with a Nintendo Switch, PC or mobile device as well, so long as you work out if you’re going to get the best out of them.</p>
<p>If we were rating tech on the number of things in the box, the Studio Max 1 would push itself to the top of the pile the moment we opened the voluminous packaging. You’ve got the headphones themselves, USB-A to USB-C charging cable, fabric carry bag, a 3.5mm to ¼” jack cable, a 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable and a further ¼” adaptor. Besides that, there’s the M1 transmitter, which allows Hi-Res wireless connections, from the source of your choice.</p>



<p>Clad all in black, with bright red speaker covers, the Studio Max 1 are a relatively unassuming pair of headphones. The gloss finish, and vinyl-like design of the OneOdio logo on each earpiece is attractive without calling for too much attention, but the plastics used are a little too light and feel cheaper than I’d expect for the price. The headband is topped by a piece of leatherette embossed with the OneOdio brand, alongside red stitching that adds a touch of visual interest.</p>

<p>The joints between the headband and earpieces once again look and feel cheaper, and though I had no problems during testing, I do wonder just how much punishment they’ll put up with over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>Comfort levels are very good here, with plush leatherette ear cushions and a memory foam headband cushion that’s just the right thickness to protect your head through long listening stints. I happily wore them for hours, and didn’t suffer from any fatigue around my ears or on my temple, which is exactly what you want from a headset that boasts a ridiculous 120-hour battery life.</p>
<p>So, the OneOdio Studio Max 1 can connect wirelessly with the M1 transmitter or via Bluetooth, or just be wired up, each of which has specific use cases. The M1 transmitter takes a USB or analogue input and then uses a proprietary RAPID WILL+ connection (Rapid Wireless Low Latency Link) to the headphones that aims for a mere 20ms of latency, when compared to even the fastest Bluetooth codecs. It has all the appearance of a USB powerbank, because it almost could be; the transmitter has a battery built in that can last up to 60 hours.</p>

<p>Of course, the only way to get the best out of the Studio Max 1 is with a library of high-resolution music or a Hi-Res streaming service. All three inputs are capable of Hi-Res playback, but Bluetooth depends on if your device is capable of LDAC. If you’re on iPhone or Nintendo Switch it’s only going to use the standard AAC or SBC codec, which isn’t the best way to experience these headphones.</p>
<p>It’s perhaps little surprise to find that the best connection to be had here is wired. The level of detail is frankly astounding, and using the first of my test tracks Billie Eilish’ ‘No Time To Die’, the Studio Max 1 delivered on all of its technical promises. Billie’s reverb-heavy vocals are joyously crisp, while the swells of orchestration felt powerful and overwhelming, without a hint of bloat or distortion and good separation between the different instrumentation.</p>
<p>The second-best connection is via the M1 transmitter, its multiple inputs and built-in battery making it suitable for turning any wired music session wireless, and with its low latency codec ensuring that you’re as close to the music or action as possible.</p>
<p>The LDAC Bluetooth connection stands as the third best option, as there was a harsher edge here with my other test track, Papa Roach’s ‘Even if It Kills Me’, that wasn’t present via the other two. That’s not to say that it was a bad effort, but compared to my faithful Sony XM5s, the audio lacked the same level of depth or sparkle.</p>

<p>Switching between the wired connections is simple enough, but at various points I struggled to reconnect to the M1 transmitter after being in Bluetooth mode. It’s supposed to automatically connect, and while it seemed to think it had, no audio was passed through. I had to resort to re-pairing the two each time, which was annoying, but not a total deal-breaker.</p>
<p>OneOdio have tuned the Studio Max 1 for reference as opposed to emphasising any particular element of the audio, and it feels like a true representation of the original production which should please producers and aficionados alike. Some listeners may be looking for a more lively response though, and while you can EQ some extra heft or thump to the bottom end, it isn’t the Studio Max 1’s primary use case.</p>
<p>My two favourite cost-effective Hi-Res certified wired headphones remain the Audio-Technica ATH-MSR7 and Philips Fidelio, and though they lose out to the OneOdio on the alternate connection types, they’re still the ones I’d reach for if I was going to indulge in a wired listening session. That said, the OneOdio can fit into your life in a far more complete manner, and will sound great while doing so.</p>
<p><em>The OneOdio Studio Max 1 is available now from <a href="https://amzn.to/4i44Qao">Amazon</a> (15% discount: CJHVATYN) and direct from the <a href="https://bit.ly/42ribFc">OneOdio website</a> (15% discount: STM1social)</em></p>

<p>The reviews for the second season of The Last of Us are rolling out right now, and they’re mostly positive, bar a few outliers. This batch of all-new episodes has been a long time coming, given that it has been more than two years since the first season dropped and turned heads worldwide.</p>



<p>The award-winning show returns to the pleasure of fans everywhere, and if there’s one thing the reviews are confirming, it’s how much meat is on the bones of the second season. The earlier reports are being confirmed – The Last of Us season two only represents the first half of the 2020 release of The Last of Us Part II.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-makes-sense">Makes Sense</h2>



<p>We always knew The Last of Us Part II would be a beast to adapt for a live-action series. It’s an expansive title that spans years and several settings – plus there are two playable characters who each have their perspective on the game’s intense and cinematic story.</p>



<p>It was suggested a while ago by showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann that it would take <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-tv-show-around-forever/">‘two or three seasons’</a> to cover everything in The Last of Us Part II, and that’s not including original content that’s created specifically for the show.</p>



<p>The reviews that are emerging now have confirmed that around <strong>one-half </strong>of The Last of Us Part II is covered by the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-and-episode-count-revealed/">batch of seven episodes</a>. Some have complained that it feels ‘spread thin’ when compared to the first season, which saw the entirety of the game covered by a single sprint.</p>



<p>This likely means that setting up the climax for a painful transition into the third season, which will likely take another two or three years, will be front and centre as the episodes unravel.</p>



<p>The Last of Us season two is set to release with a schedule of one episode a week starting this Sunday, April 13.</p>

<p>In July 2023, Disney Illusion Island was released exclusively on Nintendo Switch. It wasn’t a groundbreaking title, but it boasted a charming enough 2D side-scrolling operating model that allowed players to control some of Disney’s most beloved characters.</p>



<p>It was recently revealed by dataminers that after almost two years on the market, Disney Illusion Island is leaving the Nintendo Switch and heading to PlayStation 5. It hasn’t been confirmed if it’ll be launching on Xbox and PC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-disney">More Disney </h2>



<p>In a listing posted on <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2956512/disney-illusion-island-starring-mickey-and-friends" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSDeals.net</a>, it was revealed that ‘Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey and Friends’ is headed to PlayStation 5 (digitally) on May 30. This information was first uncovered by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lmbnmasc7k2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> on social media.</p>



<p>In Illusion Island, players can pick from Mickey, Minnie, Donald Duck, or Goofy, taking those characters and navigating through perilous levels and avoiding enemy attacks to resolve quests. As the game unravels, players unlock more abilities and broader areas of the map.</p>



<p>From the game’s description from the PS Store scraping:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Join Mickey &amp; Friends on a quest to explore the mysterious island of Monoth and recover three mystical books to save the world from disaster!</p>



<p>Disney Illusion Island Starring Mickey &amp; Friends includes the base game plus the Keeper Up, Mystery in Monoth, and brand new C.A.S.H. update featuring Scrooge McDuck.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a game with local co-op mechanics, so it’s perfect for families. It hasn’t been suggested how much it’ll cost, but it’s $39.99 in the Nintendo Store, so use that as a guide.</p>



<p>The game was developed by Dlala Studios, and it was noted that the title took inspiration from Rayman Legends when it was being created. On launch, the game garnered mixed reviews, going on to land a Metacritic score of 73 but securing some high praise from Nintendo-centric outlets.</p>



<p>For instance, while IGN gave Illusion Island a score of 7/10, Nintendo Life reached for a score of 9/10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-explain-why-solid-snake-silent-tough-guy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima created and released Metal Gear in 1987, introducing Solid Snake to the world. He would go on to become one of the most widely recognised characters in gaming, but his first outing rendered him a silent, stalwart figure incapable of uttering a single word.</p>



<p>Kojima has gone on record explaining why Solid Snake was silent, breaking down his earliest experiences with voice actors and reflecting on past technologies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-games-still-couldn-t-speak">‘Games Still Couldn’t Speak’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/49804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">An An</a> (thanks to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Hideo Kojima explained at length why Solid Snake was a silent protagonist in the first Metal Gear game that debuted in the late eighties:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In 1986, when I entered the game industry, <strong>games still couldn’t speak</strong>. The characters didn’t have voices. There wasn’t even a kanji font, and the characters were just displayed one by one. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut game, Metal Gear (1987), was born as <strong>a silent tough guy</strong> because of this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It didn’t take long for things to change, though. The legendary developer revealed that just one year after Metal Gear was released, a technological leap forward occurred when NEC released the CD-ROM2, a console with a disc drive. This was an evolution that accommodated Kojima’s desires:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Because the media was CD, it was possible to use voice dialogue, which had not been possible until then. I was one of the first to step forward and remake it.</p>



<p>It was my first time doing voice recordings. I did the casting myself, but since I was a complete outsider, I left the management to an agency. I took the first bullet train from Kobe and arrived at the studio in Tokyo. The gorgeous voice actors were already standing by in front of the microphone. </p>



<p>There was no time to greet or even have a meeting. It was an outrageous schedule, with everything recorded in almost half a day. There was no way I could build relationships. The regret and regret of this first experience would greatly change my subsequent voice recordings.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Text translated from Japanese by AI)</em></p>



<p>From there, history started being made, and Kojima went on to explain how his various teams tried to innovate in the voice recording department whenever possible. Today, Kojima’s games feature Hollywood celebrities and deeply cinematic scripts and performances, so it’s fair to say he was successful in that mission.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>How do you follow up on the most successful racing game of all time? Between the Wii U and Switch versions of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart 8</a> has sold over 75 million copies, delivering consistent chart-topping performance for over a decade. Nintendo is certainly hoping their long-awaited follow-up, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, will get the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> off to a speedy start, but the game has some big tires to fill.</p>
<p>Does Mario Kart World have a chance of matching up to the Mario Kart 8 behemoth? I recently had the chance to go hands-on with Mario Kart World at a Switch 2 preview event (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here are my general thoughts on the new hardware</a>) and you can drift on down for my early impressions…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>During the Switch 2 preview event, journalists initially had the chance to go hands-on with Mario Kart World’s traditional Grand Prix races, then later could come back to try the new Knockout Mode, in which a field of players race through six interconnected courses in hopes of being the last one standing. Admittedly, my reaction after playing through a handful of Grand Prix Cups was somewhat muted. This was partly due to the fact that Nintendo had set these introductory Grand Prix races to 50cc, so they felt quite pokey, but the action itself was also very familiar.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 8’s anti-gravity gimmick, in which karts could cling to surfaces and course designs were often mind-bending knots, seems to have been largely removed, but many courses still have elevated sections that provide a similar experience. Even without the anti-gravity mechanic, Mario Kart World feels very similar to MK8 in terms of controls, track design, and the way you interact with other racers. Of course, that’s not a <em>bad </em>thing, Mario Kart 8 is a great game, but the feeling of “newness” I was hoping for from MK World wasn’t necessarily coming through during my early minutes with the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Granted, Mario Kart World does offer some core gameplay differences. The field of racers has doubled in size to 24, which doesn’t change the feel of the action <em>that</em> much, although there can be times when things get frantic on a level not seen before. And yes, that means you’re going to be on the receiving end of more items than ever, which may not be great news depending on your personal Mario Kart tastes (I think items are half the fun). On that topic, there are some new items, including some useful seeming ones like the new Gold Shell that leaves behind a trail of coins, as well as a few somewhat odd additions, like food items that mainly serve to change the costume your character is wearing (<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much like Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, playing dress-up seems to be a big focus of MK World).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Players can now also grind on rails and wall jump, although I didn’t encounter a ton of chances to utilize those skills during my hands-on time (admittedly, my eyes probably just weren’t trained to look for those opportunities yet). One of the things that stood out most to me, was that karts no longer plunge into the deep when encountering water, but instead bob along the surface with some decent water effects and physics being on display. It seems like Nintendo may have added a touch of Wave Race to Mario Kart World, in much the same way they mixed a sprinkle of F-Zero seasoning into Mario Kart 8.</p>
<p>Another thing that’s changed is the way Grand Prix Cups progress. Rather than the usual four races of three laps each, you now start with a standard three-lap race, then drive to the three subsequent races, passing through “intermission” transitional courses before taking on a single lap of the next main course. It’s all a bit confusing at first, but you’ll catch on soon enough, and the new approach could result in a much wider array of Gran Prix layouts. While Nintendo hasn't revealed anything like this yet, I could envision a mode where players are given the option to plot out their own Grand Prix Cups.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario Kart World’s course design is a mix of old and new, with classics like the SNES’ Koopa Troopa Beach and the N64’s Choco Mountain interspersed with new creations like the dusty desert Mario Bros. Circuit, animal-filled Faraway Oasis, and odd mashup of classic Donkey Kong girders and rocket launch site that is DK Spaceport. Many of the older tracks have been altered in fairly significant ways in order to fit into the game’s new interconnected world, but it's a bit of a double-edged sword. There's a certain consistency between many courses enforced by the connected world, and while I didn’t encounter any bad tracks, some blend into each other a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Mario Kart World looks fairly nice visually, with characters having a new level of pop and personality, although it would be a stretch to say the game looks <em>that</em> much better than Mario Kart 8 (to be fair, that game still looks great a decade on). Even with double the mayhem on screen, the game maintained a silky smooth 60fps and, apparently, there will even be a 120fps mode in the full game, which I would’ve loved to try.</p>
<p>At this point in my impressions, perhaps you have the sense that, while I had fun with Mario Kart World, I wasn’t completely blown away by the experience. In fact, that was more or less the case after I finished playing Grand Prix. Thankfully, after returning to play several rounds of Knockout Mode, I think I began to see more clearly what Nintendo is attempting to do with Mario Kart World and my feelings about the game improved considerably.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld7-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Knockout Mode is essentially Mario Kart Battle Royale, with players racing through six seamlessly connected courses, with the bottom four racers being eliminated each time you pass a finish line. The goal is to be one of the last four standing and ultimately win that final race. The Knockout demo was thankfully played on 100cc, and battling with 24 other human players, with your position in the race always being important, delivered a level of intensity rarely seen in past Mario Kart games. The smooth transition from one single-lap race to the next also brought the interconnectedness of the world to the forefront.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFmariokartworld8-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of which, while waiting for other players to connect to Knockout Mode, I got to try out Free Roam, which gave me a greater appreciation of what Nintendo has achieved with Mario Kart World’s map. While you can fully explore the nooks and crannies of whatever course you start on, if you continue driving, you’ll seamlessly transition from one course and biome to the next. During one Free Roam session I started in the icy tundra, transitioned to a jungle area, and eventually wound up in Bowser’s volcanic domain. There wasn’t actually a lot to <em>do </em>while driving around, but hopefully Nintendo reveals more Free Roam activities. Regardless, it’s genuinely impressive how everything ties together.</p>
<p>Knockout Mode and Free Roam are experiences you simply can’t have in Mario Kart 8. Are they inspiring enough to <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justify Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</a>? That remains to be seen, but I’m excited to see what other things Nintendo might do with their new asphalt amusement park both now and in the future.</p>

<h2><strong>Current Thoughts on Mario Kart World</strong></h2>
<p>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times. That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. Look for more Wccftech coverage of the game closer to launch.</p>

Reverent Seers use Catalysts to attack or cast spells, making them the first class with support capabilities. Rune Pillars are their signature mechanic. They can summon supportive runes for healing, shielding, and <a title="Genres > Stealth [80 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>. They also have offensive runes that continuously attack, blind, or bind enemies, shifting the course of battle. A well-timed death prevention spell can turn the tide in an instant.</li></ul></li><li><strong>New Scenes and Areas</strong><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Thanks to the tireless efforts of the Mistchasers, a vast new region north of Brandrgarde has been uncovered. The Ember Iris, which flourishes in abundance, is the signature feature of <a title="Games > Lake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lake">Lake</a> Iris. However, the mysterious ancient arrays and seal gates are what truly capture the Gylden Hunters’ attention. The Forge, where <a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter Smith Vronn once toiled tirelessly, is now home only to artisans and laborers who have become the Corroded, alongside its eternally burning furnace fires.</li><li>With the addition of new areas, Brandrgarde has become too large, so we’ve split the entire fortress into two maps. Each time you explore, you’ll be placed in one of these maps at random.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Solo Mode</strong> – Solo mode shares the same maps as trio mode, but we’ve redesigned monster placement for a smoother experience. Balancing classes for solo play is particularly challenging, and we welcome your feedback during testing.</li><li><strong>New Monsters</strong> – This test introduces several new monsters, including the Warden, Prison Guard, Nightwatcher, and Penitent. We’ve also completed the second phase of Otto, the Flesheater. Good luck taking them on! Additionally, if you’re lucky enough to find a Dried Flower Knot while exploring the fortress, you can unlock the Einherjar mode challenge against Otto, the Flesheater. This mode offers better rewards, but we strongly advise Gylden Hunters to prepare well in advance.</li><li><strong>Camp</strong> – Although the camp scene and its NPCs are not yet complete, we are moving forward with testing the camp system first. Using various resources gathered during your Brandrgarde explorations, you can upgrade different features in your camp to gain benefits such as increased healing from the Springhorn, expanded Warehouse capacity, a higher Gylden Jar limit, and more. Additionally, the Warehouse has been upgraded to an account-shared storage, making it easier for Gylden Hunters to experience multiple classes.</li><li><strong>Optimizations and Adjustments</strong><ul><li><strong>Class Balance</strong><ul><li>To address the disadvantages of melee classes in PvE, we’ve added extra PvE damage bonus/damage reduction attributes for melee classes. We’ve also improved overall dodge performance and reduced performance differences caused by dodge animation variations across classes.</li><li>Next week, we’ll publish a separate detailed announcement regarding class balance changes for PvP. Some classes and builds will be buffed with new abilities, while certain overpowered skills and traits will be specifically nerfed. As always, we’ll continue making swift balance adjustments based on your feedback throughout this test.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Progression Adjustments</strong><ul><li>This test will introduce legendary accessories, providing higher equipment progression goals. As we’re currently developing female character models for all classes, the tight 3D pipeline schedule has delayed the completion of the other legendary equipment. We’ll complete the female character models and remaining legendary equipment as soon as possible.</li><li>We’ve removed fixed affixes from some equipment and expanded the variety of available randomly generated affixes. Equipment now has a chance to spawn with affixes higher than Lv. 1, offering more powerful rare equipment and allowing for more complex build customization.</li><li>We’ve also removed attribute growth from level progression to reduce the imbalance created by large attribute gaps between new and veteran players.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Core Quality Improvements</strong><ul><li>We’ve optimized input buffering overall, added support for multi-directional dodging, and fixed issues that led to damage loss and animation hitching. We’ve also enhanced basic character models, improved basic animations, such as walking and running, optimized lighting effects in certain scenes, and increased texture resolution in some areas.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Performance Optimizations</strong><ul><li>The minimum supported graphics card requirements have been lowered to: NVIDIA GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT, with plans to expand device support for additional devices in the future. We’ve also focused on optimizing issues like crashes from memory leaks and frame rate instability under certain conditions.

To celebrate this feat, EA Sports released a video congratulating Ovechkin and offering in-game rewards in NHL 25.</p>

<p>Starting today, players can log into Hockey Ultimate Team to receive a Milestones Ovechkin item. Ovechkin HUT Moments challenges will grant tokens to upgrade the item. Additionally, EA Sports is adding an "895 Ovechkin" HUT item that features special art and a 99 overall rating.

</article><p>Alexander Ovechkin first appeared in an EA Sports NHL game in 2006 with NHL 07, where he also served as the cover athlete. Since then, he has appeared in every entry and was the cover athlete of NHL 21 and NHL 94 Rewind, making him one of only three players to be featured on the cover of EA Sports' NHL franchise multiple times. He was also the cover athlete of NHL 2K10 in the now-defunct NHL 2K series.</p>



<p>Alexander Ovechkin was selected first overall by the Washington Capitals in 2004. However, due to the 2004/2005 NHL lockout, Ovechkin didn't make his NHL debut until 2005. In the time since, Ovechkin has been elected to 13 All-Star teams, was named an All-Decade First-Team member for both the 2000s and 2010s, and won the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year in 2006, as well as three Hart Memorial Trophies for Most Valuable Player. In 2018, Ovechkin led the Capitals to the franchise's first and only Stanley Cup, where he also took home the Conn Smythe Trophy for the Stanley Cup Final's Most Valuable Player.</p>

<p>NHL 25 arrived on October 4, 2024, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>

The date was revealed via a community ARG campaign that saw thousands of fans decipher a series of fragmented codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gameplay reveal presentation airs this Saturday, April 12, starting at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET. It will be broadcast on Bungie’s Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok accounts.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZUv1-qR1Aw" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>First </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/playstation-showcase/2023/05/24/bungie-is-revitalizing-its-old-shooter-series-marathon"><span><span><span><span>announced</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> in 2023, this reimagining of the original Marathon series, one of Bungie’s earliest shooter franchises from the ‘90s, puts players in the roles of cybernetic mercenaries called Runners. The game unfolds in a lost colony on the dangerous planet Tau Ceti IV, and Runners are specially designed to survive the world’s harsh conditions and search for lost artifacts and other treasures.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>That premise translates to team-based matches where players must work together to salvage and extract the most loot (such as weapons and gear) while preventing the opposing team from doing so. Bungie hasn’t divulged many more details up to this point, so we expect Saturday’s showcase to provide a deeper dive into everything Marathon offers.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Marathon has no release window but will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at launch.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-prince-review.1157868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not entirely convinced Dogubomb didn’t develop Blue Prince as a personal gift to me, specifically. This exceedingly clever puzzler mixes together a shortlist of my top game genres and concepts: First-person puzzling with a straightforward facade that hides a seemingly bottomless pit of secrets, roguelite runs that perfectly balance permanent improvements with the growth of your own skills, drafting mechanics that capitalize on the best parts of deckbuilders without the baggage that comes with actually being one, and even tile-based map building reminiscent of my favorite board game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/carcassonne-board-game-buying-guide"><u>Carcassone</u></a>. Even if there are things in that pile of Tom Stuff that don’t excite you as much as they do me, the combination comes together <em>beautifully</em>. I’m still rabidly peeling back the layers of this onion after dozens of hours, but I’m already certain Blue Prince has secured its place as an all-time puzzle great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Simon, a teenage boy who has inherited the stately mansion of his well-respected and somewhat eccentric great uncle, but may only claim that inheritance if he can figure out how to navigate the ever-shifting halls of the estate in order to find a hidden 46th room. It’s a fairly simple setup at the start (apart from the whole M.C. Escher shifting house thing), and while there are plenty of helpful tips scattered around for you to find, you are largely just set loose to see what you can piece together for yourself. It’s a great foundation, because while you don’t always know what the next step may be, your goals <em>are </em>always clear enough that I never felt like I was just wandering around in the dark.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tom's Top 10 First-Person Puzzle Games</h3><p>My favorite first-person puzzle games!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You probably <em>will </em>feel like you are wandering around in circles from time to time, though. The meat of Blue Prince is the drafting mechanic you use to explore the house: You start each day with a limited number of “steps” that are spent whenever you go through a door, and each time you open a new one you are given three options for which of the mansion’s many unique rooms will be on the other side. That means you are filling out the nine-by-five room floorplan differently every single time, connecting doorways and trying not to hit dead ends as you find helpful items and invaluable clues along the way. It may sound like nothing too outside the box, but it’s a real delight to slowly gain mastery over this system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some rooms are just simple hallways, while others play more varied roles that are split into colored categories based on type. For example, purple bedrooms often give you additional steps when entered, yellow shops can sell helpful items if you’ve picked up enough coins to buy them, and red rooms have negative effects (like obscuring your draft options) that could throw a wrench in your plans. Certain rooms may only appear when specific conditions are met, too, such as when you are drafting on the edges of the house or once you get deep enough in. It was fun to figure out which should be my go-to rooms early on in order to set myself up for success later, gathering items like keys to unlock doors or gems that can be spent to draft special rooms, and then using that prep work to make targeted dives toward a room or lead I was eager to hunt down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a real delight to slowly gain mastery over the drafting system.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual “puzzles” take on a variety of different forms within those rooms, but all of them are as entertaining as they are devilish to solve. Some have very straightforward math or logic problems, there are a few literal puzzle boxes to find, and others require a slightly more complicated combination of button pushes or lever pulls to solve whatever that room is doing. But fully self-contained challenges like that are side dishes to what Blue Prince truly has to offer, and the most interesting stuff feels closer to incredible first-person puzzle games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/22/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review"><u>Return of the Obra Dinn</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/30/outer-wilds-review"><u>Outer Wilds</u></a>. It asks you to really look at the world around you, take notes on what you find, and then use that knowledge to make connections where you can – and it does so in that expert way where something can feel completely cryptic at the outset and then brilliantly achievable when you finally crack it. That might mean looking through documents to find the combination to a safe, decoding why certain objects are where they are, or using the function of a specific room to get past an obstacle somewhere else.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That last part can lead to the only real point of frustration I found with Blue Prince, however, which is that the best-laid floorplans of house mice and men can come crashing down with a few bad draws. Don’t get me wrong, there are very real and effective ways to help mitigate the randomness of which rooms are offered to you – both in terms of learning what to prioritize and when you should or shouldn’t take risks, as well as in permanent upgrades I won’t spoil that can make future runs more consistent. But, plain and simple, sometimes you will need a room that lets you turn left, do everything in your power to set yourself up to get it (including collecting dice that let you reroll the rooms you draw), and still be as stuck as Zoolander when you’re ultimately given your options. Those bad breaks are infrequent, but it still stings when an otherwise-good run ends because you just never saw the room you were looking for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">(Tangentially, I also <em>really</em> wish you could save and quit mid-run without having to cut your progress short by ending your current day entirely, or at the very least that opening the menu stopped the in-game clock from ticking. Runs can often stretch over an hour, which makes dipping in and out of Blue Prince a hard proposition – though this is only really a problem since I was playing on a desktop PC, as consoles and even the Steam Deck would let you suspend it if you need to go do something else.)</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There is <em>so much</em> to discover that any given run is rarely a waste of time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, any pain from that randomness is mitigated by the fact that there is just <em>so much</em> to discover here that a given run is rarely a waste of time. You may not have been able to draft that specific combination of rooms you were after or reach that certain square you wanted to, but odds are you still entered some new rooms along the way, and doing so almost always added to the growing list of mysteries I have jotted down across a pile of handwritten notes. “Beating” Blue Prince took me about 15 hours, and getting to that 46th room is absolutely a satisfying puzzle to solve on its own, but I also have far more goals now than I did when I first set out. There are safes to open, doors to unlock, books and letters to read, clues to decipher, and <em>loads</em> of lore to uncover. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s impressive how all of these optional puzzles are woven into and around the path of the “main” one – some are hiding in plain sight from the first minute, just waiting for you to realize they are important, while others drop an unassuming string of crumbs in your way that lead down a deep and unexpected rabbit hole when followed. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blue Prince Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Blue Prince was an incredibly difficult game to talk about with friends who were also playing because the randomness of the drafting mechanic, combined with your own personal sense of curiosity, can send two players down very different paths. One time when I was around five hours in, I excitedly mentioned I’d unlocked something to a friend who had already played 40, only to learn they hadn’t even found that thing yet. And yet, this fractal abode doesn’t frustrate by randomly withholding things either, because clues can often be found in multiple forms or places; Once again, you’re always making progress toward <em>something</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you do get deeper, Blue Prince’s initially light-touch story also begins to shift more directly into the spotlight. Discovering more about both your character’s great uncle and the larger history of their family starts off as a little fun set dressing, but it eventually becomes as rich and compelling a reason to keep playing as any puzzle. The worldbuilding here is doled out with a patience I’m not used to seeing, with tons to learn about your relatives, the manor, and the nation it’s located in, but none of that is ever forced down your throat. That made anything I could glean about important historical events or complex geopolitics feel like a win that would almost always help me solve future mysteries, not just some “lore” to read about in books or letters and then move on from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still avoiding spoilers like laser tripwires in a Mission Impossible trap, that story and its themes smartly tie into your actions in a way few games are able to pull off so successfully. Piecing together the messy history of an extended and sometimes estranged family is rarely a linear process - Simon wanders through the house he has suddenly inherited finding bits of information told from conflicting points of view, and often in the entirely wrong order. Trying to make all of the right connections as he goes from a boy simply solving a fun puzzle so he can win a prize to one who understands the real reward this mansion holds reflected my own journey with Blue Prince, which is the sort of subtle brilliance you don’t see in many games.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Blue Prince is the kind of puzzle game that dug deep into my brain and didn’t let go. Its complex mysteries weave brilliantly into the careful decision making of how to lay out the mansion’s rooms on each randomized run, leaving me building floorplans in my sleep almost every night after I played it. The story that slowly emerges within this fascinating place is also a compelling one, and it had me hungrily hunting for clues and combinations for many hours after I reached the credits while also poetically tying into the mechanics that lead you to them. Hitting a dead end you did everything in your power to avoid can frustrate from time to time, but this sprawling estate has so much to uncover that the randomness never stalled my progress for too long. If The Witness, Portal, and Myst are already emblazoned on the Mount Rushmore of first-person puzzle games, I wouldn’t be surprised to see Blue Prince carved alongside them soon enough.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it’s a premium piece from <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Joel%27s+Jacket+From+The+Last+of+Us&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-04-07+09%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-07+17%3A29%3A54&amp;fnarticle_id=6530658&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fhuckberry.com%2Fstore%2Fflint-and-tinder%2Fcategory%2Fp%2F55166-flannel-lined-waxed-trucker-jacket&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-joels-jacket-from-the-last-of-us%2F1100-6530658%2F%3Fftag%3DGSS-05-10aac1i&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Flint and Tinder</a> that’s available for $298.

According to the manufacturer, its weather-resistant Martexin sailcloth ages like leather or denim--meaning it’ll pick up a unique patina based on your wear patterns. It’s also designed to be soft and wearable right away, so you won’t have to worry about “breaking in” your new jacket.</p><p>Along with its waxed and weather-resistant Martexin 7 oz. sailcloth, the jacket is insulated for added warmth, features a body and sleeves lined with a striped blanket fabric, and comes with an interior pocket to hold your phone.</p><p>Four different colors are available, but stick with the standard Field Tan if you want the same one as Joel. You’ll also find seven different sizes and two different fits (classic or tall). Free shipping and returns are included for addresses within the US.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471929-mixcollage-07-apr-2025-10-20-am-3702.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471929" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471929-mixcollage-07-apr-2025-10-20-am-3702.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471929"></a><figcaption>Flint and Tinder Flannel-Lined Waxed Trucker Jacket</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471929-mixcollage-07-apr-2025-10-20-am-3702.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471930-55166_flint_and_tinder_flannel-l%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471931-55166_fnt_flannel_lined_waxed_tr%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471932-55166_fnt_flannel_lined_waxed_tr.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471933-55166_flint_and_tinder_flannel-l.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471930,1300-4471931,1300-4471932,1300-4471933" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4471930-55166_flint_and_tinder_flannel-l%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4471931-55166_fnt_flannel_lined_waxed_tr%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4471932-55166_fnt_flannel_lined_waxed_tr.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4471933-55166_flint_and_tinder_flannel-l.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471930-55166_flint_and_tinder_flannel-l%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471931-55166_fnt_flannel_lined_waxed_tr%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471932-55166_fnt_flannel_lined_waxed_tr.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4471933-55166_flint_and_tinder_flannel-l.jpg"></figure><p>If you're curious how Season 2 is shaping up ahead of its premier on April 13, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351">GameSpot's The Last of Us Season 2 review</a>. Reviewer Mark Delany praises the first batch of episodes as a worthy follow-up to Season 1 and a great adaptation of the video game, saying, "Like its first season, The Last of Us Season 2 is a heart-wrenching examination of the ever-shifting distance between right and wrong, and as a whole, it's well on its way to becoming the best video game adaptation there is."</p><p>Though you’re cutting it close for a rewatch, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DSGGQXLG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Season 1 4K Steelbook</a> is currently on sale for $40.79 (was $50.55). Along with a 4K version of the film and a gorgeous steelbook, it includes over two hours of bonus content.</p><p>You’ll also find some nice discounts on action figures, board games, and even The Last of Us video games. One of the most unique discounts is for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Us-Adventure-Cooperative-Themeborne/dp/B0DHWHG14R?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Escape the Dark Board Game</a>. The cooperative horror game has you and up to four other players attempting to reach Jackson while fending off infected and FEDRA agents. It’s close to its lowest-ever price and makes for an excellent way to kick off your watch party on Sunday.</p><p>We’ve rounded up our favorite The Last of Us deals below--consider checking them out if you want something to do in your fancy new jacket.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re a few years into a supposed artificial intelligence revolution, which could and should have been about reducing mundane tasks and freeing everyone up to do more interesting things with their time. Instead, thanks to the bloodthirsty nature of modern capitalism and an ideological crusade being waged by the tech industry, we’re now facing a world where many people’s livelihoods–like video game developers–are under direct threat.</p><p>These tumultuous times are of course being reported on everywhere you look, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including on this very website</a>, but one area I’ve been curious about recently aren’t the broader moral and legal battles, but what the struggle looks like for the average dev who is now having to encounter AI in their workplace.</p><p>For this piece, I spoke with a number of people working in the video game industry or very close to it, including artists, game designers, and software developers. I asked them to tell their stories about their daily interactions and struggles with&nbsp;artificial intelligence in the workplace, and what it means for the jobs they've been trained and hired to do.</p><p>Each person’s name and workplace has been changed to protect their identity.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[He] can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Bradley </strong>is a veteran artist who works at a AAA video game studio. They describe the company as having been founded relatively recently, with investment coming from traditional AAA executives who “want to make money, and they are trying to figure out what game to make for that”.&nbsp;</p><p>They say their project’s art direction has been largely fuelled by AI prompts and generated imagery, all driven by their head Art Director, who is himself an experienced video game artist, but who now “can’t even write a fucking email without using Chat GPT”.&nbsp;</p><p>“In my interview with the company I was very clear that I do not like AI-generated content”, Bradley says, and adds that the team initially said that was fine, the tech was only being used for pitching purposes. But Bradley says the reality has proven vastly different, and that the studio has made increasing use of AI-generated imagery in their team's art pipeline.</p><p>“I have no idea how he ended up as an art director when he can’t visualise what he wants in his head unless can see some end results”, Bradley says. Rather than beginning with sketches and ideas, then iterating on those to produce a more finalised image or vision, Bradley says his boss will just keep prompting an AI for images until he finds one he likes, and then the art team will have to backwards engineer the whole thing to make it work.</p><p>“He doesn't know that the important thing isn't just the end result, it's the journey and the questions you answer along the way”. Bradley says that the studio’s management have become so enamoured with the technology that without a reliance on AI-generated imagery for presentations and pitches they would not be at the stage they are now, which is dealing with publishers and investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Bradley says they’ve threatened to quit if further attempts are made to use AI in the art pipeline. While the art team continues to resist the use of AI in creating actual concept pieces and assets for the game, it’s a different story when it comes to pitching the project to those publishers and investors.</p><p>“They’re finding it difficult to get funding because the game is being treated as a car salesman’s pitch, using AI-generated imagery to sell it without any actual substance or meat to back the vision up. The whole game is resting on a prompt ‘what if a game was…’, but with no idea if that would be fun, or how to make it fun. It’s madness”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Mitch </strong>has been working in software for over seven years. Having previously been employed in the defense industry, their last job was writing developer tools for a small tech startup creating an app. The company was built with some initial interest in artificial intelligence, though Mitch says this was met with “varying levels of scepticism” by employees.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was the most opposed”, Mitch says, “to the point where I felt it was a detriment. One team member who only ended up working there for a few months was very positive on it. The CEO was sceptical but felt like it could be a massive benefit if used correctly, and the other team members saw it as a fun toy that could occasionally be useful. So it was pretty broad across the board”.</p><p>Some at the company were uneasy with the technology early on, when the team initially had just a small AI plugin through which users could chat with the app. “On the way to the airport with a co-worker we talked about the introduction of these AI-generated plugins”, Mitch says. “Both of us felt incredibly uneasy with them. Despite [my coworker] finding AI to be a fun toy, he was worried that it wasn't what he had initially signed up for, and I had more or less the same sentiment. It didn't really boil over into anything at this point since the feature didn't go anywhere, but it was still notable”.</p><p>A few months later, things started to change. Mitch says the first signs of a deepening reliance on AI came when the company’s CEO was found to be rewriting parts of their app so that it would be easier for AI models to understand and help with. “Then”, Mitch says, “I had a meeting with the CEO where he told me he noticed I wasn't using the Chat GPT account the company had given me. I wasn't really aware the company was tracking that”.</p><p>“Anyway, he told me that I would need to start using Chat GPT to speed up my development process. Furthermore, he said I should start using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claude</a>, another AI tool, to just wholesale create new features for the app. He walked me through setting up the accounts and had me write one with Claude while I was on call with him. I’m still not entirely sure why he did that, but I think it may have been him trying to convince himself that it would work.”</p><p>Mitch describes this increasing reliance on AI to be not just “incredibly boring”, but ultimately pointless. “Sure, it was faster, but it had a completely different development rhythm”, they say. “In terms of software quality, I would say the code created by the AI was worse than code written by a human–though not drastically so–and was difficult to work with since most of it hadn’t been written by the people whose job it was to oversee it”.&nbsp;</p><p>“One thing to note is that just the thought of using AI to generate code was so demotivating that I think it would counteract any of the speed gains that the tool would provide, and on top of that would produce worse code than I didn’t understand. And that’s not even mentioning the ethical concerns of a tool built on plagiarism.”</p><p>Mitch says that over the 18 months they worked with the company, its CEO had transformed from someone mildly positive about AI to emphasising to workers that “AI was the future”. “In particular, he was of the belief that developers who are able to use AI to accelerate their process are going to win out in the future. I have seen this sentiment in other places worded as ‘an AI won't replace you, but a programmer who knows how to use AI will’. He didn’t believe that 18 months ago, but he absolutely believes it now”.&nbsp;</p><p>The AI’s poor code and a personal dislike of the technology meant that Mitch soon simply began ignoring their CEO’s instructions to use Chat GPT and Claude. A few months later, the entire company went bust. &nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Francis </strong>is both a consultant and artist in the video game industry, and so has worked alongside art teams as well as working with agencies, studios and publishers about their creative processes. “This means I have had some truly wild conversations about AI in a professional context that make me want to walk into the sea”, they say.</p><p>Since AI-generated imagery first blew up a few years ago, Francis has found that discussions both with consulting clients and potential employers for their own art has “shifted”. They believe that most employers and outsiders they speak to don’t see themselves as part of what Francis calls an ‘AI will replace artists!’ crowd, but are more like a ‘if we use AI it’ll make an artist’s life easier’ crowd, who think using AI in art will protect their artists, not displace them.</p><p>“What follows from these discussions is me explaining why, usually over hours rather than minutes, that these tools have no place in a professional game development pipeline or production and actually hinder the development of visuals”, Francis says. “I also find myself explaining to them how the iteration and 'idea' phase of a project is where the best stuff happens, how exploring things through artistic labor is where your best ideas come to fruition, and why would we want an AI (that we don't even own) to do that for us with art that isn't ours to use?”</p><p>“I am yet to have a team or gamerunner push back on me once I actually explain how these AI art generators work and how they don't contribute in a helpful way to a project, but I have a sense of dread that it is only a matter of time until that changes, especially given that I've gone the majority of my career with no mention of them to every second conversation having it mentioned.”</p><p>This all sounds <em>slightly </em>more optimistic than what other people I spoke with expressed, but Francis also added that a close family member is “neck-deep in the technology side of the AI industry”, and that “while conversation with them mostly gives me the desire to purchase cigarettes for the first time in a very long time, it also gives me insight into how these people feel when they say they are 'helping' my industry and 'innovating' to make artists' lives better.”</p><p>Francis says their understanding of the AI-pusher’s outlook is that they see the entire game-making process as a problem, one that AI tech companies alone can solve. “When I’m told 'Think of how much time you could be spending instead on making the actual game!', those who have drank the AI Kool-Aid don't understand that all this brainstorming and iteration <em>is </em>making the game, it’s a crucial everyday part of game development (and human interaction) and is not a problem to be solved.”</p><p>“My experience here is unfortunately not singular”, Francis says. “I have had many discussions with other game developers who interact with AI engineers and savants who believe our industry pipelines need 'fixing' by them and them alone. The only other similar experience I can think of as a comparison is a snake oil salesman insisting that their magic tonic will fix all of my problems that don't exist but they insist that I have.”</p><p>Francis believes that there’s a common thread running through both their lines of work: that those selling AI tools and those advocating for their use, whatever their best intentions, think that AI is solving a huge problem games industry workers are facing. “The only issue I am facing as a professional art director in games is that I just want them to leave me and my art teams alone so we can make cool art. There is no problem to be solved here”.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/robot-kick-female-employee-out-office-2229371365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drawlab19</a></figcaption></figure><figure><blockquote><p>It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Ricky </strong>is a senior game designer who says they were often asked to use AI on their last project, initially with the goal of saving time on basic tasks. One example they shared was being encouraged to use Chat GPT to do things like “generate outlines of existing games and their systems so that we could use them as references and discussion points. The issue? [The outlines] were often wrong, and I'd spend more time fixing them than if I'd just done it the old-fashioned way”.</p><p>Since the AI was generating responses for games Ricky was already familiar with, they could easily see that those responses were fundamentally incorrect. ”When I say they were wrong”, Ricky says, ” I mean they were talking about systems that didn't exist, items that didn't exist, and outlines of enemies that had incorrect explanations of their behaviour”.</p><p>“There were more superfluous issues as well -- the whole thing read like marketing speak. There were buzzwords everywhere, it wasn't concise, and if I were to try and fix these issues using different prompts, or continuing my conversation with [the AI], well, then I'm just spending time prompt-engineering instead of just writing the fucking thing myself. It was a huge waste of time, and really felt like an affront to my own expertise, which is... why I was hired”.</p><p>Ricky says they were also asked to use Chat GPT as an “idea generator”, to help with tasks like “coming up with a bunch of interesting puzzles” or “creating ideas for enemies”, supposedly to both save time and provide inspirational starting points.&nbsp;</p><p>“It really weighed on the creativity of my role, and again, spat in the face of my expertise”, they say. “It wasn't just this though; the tool itself lacks the intent, context, and limitations of what we're doing. It doesn't have other aspects of the project, influences, references, or personal experiences in the back of its mind, because it doesn't have a mind. Whenever we design something for a game, it's drawn from somewhere, influenced by other things, and filtered through our own experiences as a human. These AI ideas lose ALL of that, turning it into an omega-corporate ‘back of the box’ list of ideas and features”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Sally </strong>is an animator and 3D artist whose most recent video game work was as part of an indie studio working on a VR game. They say that AI tools made deep inroads into life at the studio, beginning with the game’s creative directors and lead designers “playing around with Midjourney” before quickly deciding that they wouldn’t need to hire concept artists, then moving on to declaring that they wouldn’t need to pay <em>anyone at all</em> to create the game’s 2D assets, because those could just be generated by Midjourney then edited in Photoshop.&nbsp;</p><p>Sally began voicing their concerns directly with management when AI moved into the game’s voice work, as bosses began toying with new AI-generated lines trained on work previously performed by voice actors. “I raised the concern that we shouldn't be doing any of this without consent from those actors”, Sally says, “and was met with a very aggressive shutdown response which was that ‘it wasn't going to ship’ and would only be used as an internal tool, so it shouldn't be an issue at all”.</p><p>“This is pretty awful for the voice actors because there’s not really anything they can do if a studio decides to do something like this. [Studios] already have a bunch of their voice work, and often voice actors will just send the entire recording of their lines over at once. So a studio will have multiple takes of each line, and sometimes different variations of the same line, which is kind of a perfect example for something you could feed through AI”.</p><p>Sally was recently laid off from the studio, along with a few of their coworkers, and says that as far as they’re aware the studio’s plan for its next game is to use AI-generated animations trained on motion capture to replace the role of a human animator. “I think the last thing I want to add is just how frustrating it is having AI-generated art in a game that’s about to ship, alongside all the hard work that we human artists put into it. All because one of the directors wanted to cut down on ‘wasting time’ or ‘hiring one other person’”.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>[AI] has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Audrey </strong>is a veteran concept artist who has worked both as a freelancer and in-house at studios in the video game industry. With qualifications in both art and game design, they say that over the last few years the emergence of AI tech in the art world “has been an overwhelmingly negative and demoralizing force in my own personal workplace, no question about it”.</p><p>“My own use of AI in my current job has been minimal and against my own wishes and ethics”, they say. “Once in a blue moon I have been given a task that necessitated using AI to make very VERY quick concepts. And when I say ‘necessitated’, I would be told explicitly to use AI and make a ton of images to pick from, and I could then ‘make them look good later’. Depressing doesn’t begin to cover it”.</p><p>Audrey says that their work deadlines are “being completely fucked up as well”, as they will usually need to completely redraw AI-generated images that colleagues in other departments have relied on as placeholder art, which then shifts their own workflow and priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey says their team’s overall response to AI tech has been “mixed”. “Only a few specific people higher up like to use AI and will use it regularly, while the majority of the team is neutral or completely against using it”, they say. “My own personal opinion was quite vocal. I tried to be clear about my stance on using AI, and so did the rest of the art team. I gave multiple reasons for our company to stop or minimize using it; I’d ask about replacing images that were AI placeholders or if there was a way we could use art already made instead, all of which had mixed results”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Alfie </strong>is an experienced 2D artist in the video game industry. They recently interviewed at a startup games studio with millions in funding, and came away deeply affected by AI without even working there.</p><p>“This corporate, tech-backed startup near me were looking to hire an artist”, they say. “I went through their entire recruitment process, which took around five weeks, including a trip in person to visit them for several hours. I even took part in a brainstorming session for about an hour, where I ended up coming up with a production plan with some basic schedules. After around three weeks of not hearing anything back from them, they finally got in touch to say they wouldn’t be progressing with my application”.</p><p>Alfie wonders if the studio might have simply been using them for some free art and production consultation. “They never hired anyone for the artist position, and are using AI-generated art for their games”, they say. “There are zero artists on their team”.</p><p>Alfie has since joined a new studio, which <em>had </em>been experimenting with AI-generated imagery a few years back but abandoned its use entirely after finding the results neither accurate nor specific enough for in-game purposes. This studio changed course entirely, and Alfie’s hiring was part of a heavy investment in human art.</p><p>“I guess they realised that AI imagery can't solve all of your problems, and they realise just how precious real human artists are”, Alfie says. “A human artist will research the material properly, with all the nuances of human emotion and logic, and ultimately produce art assets that are historically accurate, game specific and have soul”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion...</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Douglas </strong>is a voice actor whose jobs include recording lines for indie video games, and says their experiences discussing AI with potential employers "feels like screaming into a void". "I've gotten through to small indie teams", they say, "and some publishers have been empathetic and understanding when I try steering them away from AI, since it hurts already-struggling independent artists and actors. But it's always the larger corporations that are eerily silent and flat out seem to ignore anyone who wants to talk about the subject".</p><p>As an example, Douglas says Audible has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239903/amazon-audible-audiobook-narrators-ai-generated-voice-clones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begun trialling a system where actors can submit their recordings to an AI program</a> that will duplicate their voice, then sell it to book authors for their audiobooks. Those actors will then receive a small percentage of any income the AI 'voice' generates, but Douglas can easily see that becoming problematic for the market, with existing (and upcoming) voice actors able to be easily replaced by anyone looking for a "quick and easy" solution.</p><p>I asked Douglas how they and their peers are feeling about this, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-voice-actor-strike-genshin-impact-destiny-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and other challenges being presented by AI in the voice acting space</a>, and their response was blunt. "Myself and a lot of my fellow voice actors are in the same boat", they say. "None of us feel like submitting our voice to an AI is worth the benefit, because it will destroy a lot of the human emotion we put into our work to help bring a story to life".</p><p>"A lot of us worked tirelessly to make even a fraction of a living doing something we genuinely love, and we're afraid of that being taken away from us, so it's looking like we have no other choice but to look for mundane work and give up our passion".</p><hr><p>These are just some people’s personal experiences, a small snapshot of how AI is affecting the games industry. While <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveys and numbers</a> can provide some sense of scale, individual experiences can highlight the precise ways AI is encroaching into people’s workplaces and lives, how they feel about it, and how they’re responding.</p><p>As grim as some of these responses feel, I hope there’s at least some small solace to be taken from the fact that so many artists remain firm in their resistance to AI technology that devalues their work, and are championing human creators in the face of it.</p><hr><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.
