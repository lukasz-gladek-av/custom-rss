Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Weapons Live, Lights Out</strong> – <em>Blindfire</em> is an online multiplayer first-person shooter. Set in a shadowy underworld, the ultra-wealthy bet on illicit bloodsports beneath a neon skyline. For contestants lured by the promise of untold riches and unimaginable glory, it’s kill or be killed.</li><li><strong>Every Kill Counts</strong> – Brave the arena alone or team up in matches of up to eight players. In Bodycount mode, score the most points over five rapid-fire rounds. Be the last person standing when the lights come on and earn your place in the winner’s showcase.</li><li><strong>Danger Lurks in the Dark</strong> – Light is a rarity in close-quarter arenas riddled with traps for intense firefights. Players must decide where and when to fire at the risk of exposing their position. Hone your senses with the room-scanning Echo mechanic to help you navigate the arena and locate your opponents.</li><li><strong>Revenge Under the Blacklights</strong> – When defeated, spectators gain access to the arena’s cutting-edge night vision cameras. Blacklight reveals the vibrant hues of hidden street art and transforms the slick designs of contestants’ outfits. The eliminated spectators can assume control of traps in the arena to influence the outcome of the match and exact revenge.</li><li><strong>Light Them Up</strong> – The pitch-black battlefields of <em>Blindfire</em> turn the first-person shooter genre on its head. Stalk the shadows as the tension builds, then run for cover as the shots start flying in a volley of muzzle flashes. Think you’ve got what it takes to eliminate the competition in <em>Blindfire</em>? Then grab your weapon and LIGHT THEM UP.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>PlayStation 5 Early Access Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="BLINDFIRE - PlayStation Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kNgKTcssaR4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The show doesn’t directly follow the plot of the novels, but does reunite the cast of the 2010 live-action adaptation to voice their movie characters in the series. <em>Kotaku</em>’s Kenneth Shepard called it a  “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407">hilarious blend of the [franchise’s] quick wit and well-measured pop culture references</a></span>.” But sadly, the series won’t be getting a second season. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20</a></span>, to mark the one-year anniversary of the premiere of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em>, series creator O’Malley tweeted that it was “an honor to work with all of the cast &amp; staff around the world”  and called the series “a one of a kind miracle.” The creator also confirmed that Netflix had recently passed on a second season of the animated adaption. </p><p>“Anyway, we were recently informed that the show will not return,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said O’Malley</a></span>. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” </p><p>“Sorry to all Matthew fans and Gideon fans, I know you will suffer the most,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added O’Malley in a follow-up</a></span> to the tweet confirming the news that there would be no second season. </p><p>While some fans were upset with the Netflix show and how much it deviated from the original graphic novels, many others were happy to get a new story featuring these characters. For now, it seems that’s the end of this chapter of the franchise, despite a post-credits scene included in the final episode of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While no one associated with the episode explicitly tells us what happens that makes it so bloody, the descriptions we have gotten may be enough to give us a hint. Executive producer Dave Wilson says, “Pac-Man is Joe Pesci and the swordsman is Guy Pearce in <em>Memento.” </em>Seeing how Pesci almost exclusively plays homicidal hotheads, and Guy Pearce strangles a man to death in <em>Memento</em>, the 10-minute <em>Pac-Man</em> episode may just live up to its bloody hype if that comparison holds true. </p><p>As surprised as you may feel about a violent <em>Pac-Man</em> story, the people behind it point out how the original game isn’t all that innocent. JT Petty, teleplay writer of the <em>Pac-Man</em> episode, describes the game as essentially “eating pills in a labyrinth while you’re being chased by ghosts,” in a world where the ghosts’ eyes return to the center of the game to regenerate and repeat the destructive cycle. </p><p>When you look at <em>Pac-Man</em> that way, you can see how there could be a darker side to it; a darker side we’ll have our still-attached-to-our-heads eyes glued to when the episode releases in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-have-made-their-own-battle-format-that-bans-ex-monsters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Don't bring an EX to a NOEX fight.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon TCG Pocket continues to be ridiculously popular, but in the early days of the game there are only a limited number of ways to engage with other players. Trading still hasn't been released yet, and battling only has one regular format that lets you start a match with a friend, or a random player. So in order to spice things up, the community is coming up with its own workarounds, including a brand new battle format that's been very well-received so far: NOEX.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"NOEX" is a battle format with one simple rule: no EX Pokemon allowed. EX Pokemon, if you're unfamiliar, are ultra-powerful monsters that are very difficult to defeat, but which award two points upon destruction as opposed to just one. Due to their sheer power, most good meta decks in Pocket are built around at least one EX card, and the end result is that you tend to run into a lot of the same decks over and over when you engage in random battles. For the last month or so, for instance, I've been playing a deck that revolves around Pikachu EX, and have been fighting a lot of Mewtwo EX, Charizard EX, and Starmie EX.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But in NOEX, all those cards are banned, which forces players to build decks around other Pokemon for some interesting combos. For this article, I engaged in a couple of NOEX battles myself. In one match I faced a Butterfree/Dugtrio stall deck that I'd never seen before that decimated my army of Nidoran, and in another I barely scraped out a win against a wacky Dragonite/Weezing combo thanks to a lucky final draw. It's a fun format if you want to shake things up a bit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, NOEX exists on an honor system. There's no way to officially create your own battle formats in Pocket just yet, so players have created this by word-of-mouth. If you want to join a NOEX battle, simply select "Private Match" under battles, and use "NOEX" as the password. But you're essentially on your honor to use a deck with no EX Pokemon, as there's nothing in the system to stop you. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvrqsl/ah_yeah_thats_the_kind_of_opener_you_want_to_see/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players are already complaining about opponents bringing EX Pokemon to a NOEX fight</a> and ruining their fun - an unfortunate hazard of a community-created format.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/screenshot-2024-11-20-143838-1732135159067.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: /u/Boomerhands420 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/">Reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, it sounds like NOEX is otherwise going pretty well. Community members are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gvryhu/noex_format_is_insanely_fun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">praising it on Reddit</a>, and while my personal experience is limited, the speed with which I was able to get into matches with others who were respecting the format indicates this might have legs. It also sounds like some players are suggesting other types of formats that can be done in the same way, such as only allowing a single EX card per deck, or no decks considered by the community to be "S-tier."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully, it won't be long before we start to see new features creep in that will hopefully eliminate the need for the community to invent stuff to do. We've already learned that there's a "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-is-getting-more-booster-packs-before-2025">major update</a>" coming in the near future that will include trading, and new booster packs on the way will hopefully spice up the meta a bit as well. Given how <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-made-120-million-in-3-weeks">wildly popular TCG Pocket is</a>, the updates can't come fast enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-hunters-review-the-night-will-always-win.1041219/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vampire-hunters-review-night-will-always-win<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With every earthquake comes aftershocks. At this point, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> hasn’t just made its mark on the world, it’s still a primary point of the gaming culture space, not just unfettered by new releases, but also a point of influence for many a copycat to “improve” the formula. Everything always needs X to improve on, it needs X to provide Y, in the palatable form of Z! <em>Vampire Hunters</em>, if anything else, is one of many such cases.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Brazilian developers Gamecraft Studios, a team that also dabbles in assisting development with other devs and games, like 2023’s <em>BIT.TRIP ReRunner</em>. <em>Vampire Hunters</em> has toured the circuit as an Early Access title for some time before kicking into gear with a 1.0 release at the end of October. The result is ideas on top of ideas.</p>

<p>It’s a first-person shooter, relying on some boomer shooter-esque inclinations, while never fully going all the way. You’re in an arena, almost perfectly equipped for some old-school, 90s <em>Unreal Tournament</em> action, and set spawn points will release an endless barrage of increasingly difficult monsters to defeat within an allotted time. As time goes on, you’ll also completely fill your screen with up to 12 weapons, each of which is an extension of your God-given power to completely decimate the battlefield.</p>



<p>The structure is more encroaching than your usual <em>Survivors</em>-type shenanigans. The maps are very tight, both in their designs, and their chokepoints, with it teaching you these basic facets almost immediately. Not only that, but every map has different objectives in order to “complete” the map, whether it’s closing off spawn points, collecting items, or destroying bigger bosses and their minions.</p>

<p>“Tight” is probably the only way one can describe it. Tunnel vision is an almost inevitable effect of the game, especially as the screen fills with monsters, bullets, effects, triggers, health bars, warning icons, damage indicators, and so much more. As a result, the game relays more of its influence from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/serious-sam-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Serious Sam</em></a> – where walking back and never letting go of the fire button is a primary function of its core gameplay loop – and as such, calling it a “boomer shooter” seems almost counter-intuitive to what a boomer shooter actually is.</p>

<p>That isn’t to say <em>Vampire Hunters</em> or indeed, even <em>Serious Sam</em>, fail to exhibit certain qualities of the memetic genre, but in <em>Vampire Hunters</em>’ case, the pacing is there, yet the speed isn’t. You can make the body count rise to the thousands in low-polygon gibbing glory, but it’s never to the same tune of progression. Progression is defined by time here, not by how you execute it, so many cases of victory will be made by playing the game like <em>Snake</em>.</p>



<p>This isn’t new for <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and their ilk however, the constant backpedaling and kiting, so <em>Vampire Hunters</em> rides or dies on how it executes it all at a peak. The result is a mixed bag, where on the one hand, it excels in the chaos, the invigorating colorful steam of bullets, bombs, and bodies being presented wonderfully. On the other hand, the feedback of certain items, and the conveying of information in regards to progression, is obfuscated for no other reason than to seemingly imply complexity that isn’t there.</p>

<p>It’s all so singular in its craft, less about creating a zone for which death is certainly instantaneous for any monster that dares to breach the 12ft gap between you and the enemy. Instead, you’re constantly proactive, removing the privilege of going AFK in favor of making you feel more in control with the damage you deal. As a game following the <em>Survivors</em>-like formula, it easily does the most to make every action an opportunistic one, as you watch damage counters rise, and the timer tick by.</p>

<p>This is best accentuated by its “Classic Mode”, a more innately basic iteration of its FPS gameplay that removes the crafted arenas in favor of a long, seemingly endless hallway. It’s a firing range on an escalator, one which provides endless runner-esque mechanics in the form of a damaging mist that will envelop you if you lag too far behind. It relies a lot more on pacing, yet introduces a lot more confusing elements like manual weapon combination and an engineering stat, neither of which are explained adequately at any point.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you choose Classic mode or not, <em>Vampire Hunters</em> is a numbers game in its most generic sense, one which it manages to elevate with the mechanic of reloading. Whether it’s manually or automatic, even with 12 weapons strapped to your person, the amount of legitimate tactical intervention that spawns from when and where to reload is honestly staggering. Weapons waver between heavy beasts and quick-fire repellent, although you’d be hard-pressed to figure out which is which based on sight.</p>

<p>While it may be a result of how much more zoomed in the action is, <em>Vampire Hunters</em>’ aesthetic and visual design still leaves a lot to be desired. Its crusty nature, and overall inability to truly commit to a direction that isn’t just “low-poly” leaves a lot of the action undefined in the wake of more focused destruction. You can tell what weapons have brought you to your destination in games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Army of Ruin</em>, and <em>Slime 3K</em>, but here, a revolver looks the same as a rifle, which looks the same as a machine gun, which looks the same as a minigun.</p>

<p>It’s strange because while I can certainly class <em>Vampire Hunters</em> as an addictive experience, one that is proactive, consistently engaging, and rewarding – more so than most other <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones on the market – I struggle to call it an objectively good experience. So much of it is left to interpretation, or an upcoming Steam guide where stuff is answered for you, despite the fact that so much of it is smoke and mirrors. It’s not that there isn’t depth, but the word is merely an excuse for why the game doesn't explain itself.</p>

<h2><em>Vampire Hunters </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>Vampire Hunters</em> is a video game, a minimal hardline for what an FPS, a game adjacent to <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its kin, and a game inheriting certain boomer shooter aesthetics should provide. Its quality isn’t necessarily defined by what it does right or wrong, but by how it exemplifies the averages one must attain before being a part of the discussion for what constitutes being a good game. So many moving parts to contribute to a core that is, ultimately, formless.</p>

<p>As it stands, this is an experience. An experience without cause, but not without merit.</p>

            <p>Two theme parks are being planned based on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>. Mojang are partnering with Merlin Entertainments to open the destinations, including rides, hotel rooms and shops, in the UK and US in 2026 and 2027. Merlin are the operator of existing theme parks and attractions including Alton Towers, Legoland, Sea Life, and Madame Tussauds.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Minecraft parks will be opened as part of an existing theme park or as new city centre attractions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/19/minecraft-theme-park-deal-uk-us-merlin-entertainments">according to The Guardian</a>. Mojang and Merlin also have plans to expand to other countries and territories.
</p>
<p>These attractions won't be the first time Mincraft has crossed in the real world. Earlier this year, Mojang partnered with Supply + Demand to launch <a href="https://www.minecraftexperience.com/">Minecraft Experience: Villager Rescue</a>, an "immersive, interactive Minecraft quest" in Plano, Texas. The partnership with Merlin seems an order of magnitude more ambitious, however.
</p>
<p>Minecraft is shaping up to have a busy few years, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-looks-expensively-naff">a live action movie on the way</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">a Netflix animated series. It could also be a big few years for UK theme parks, with </a><a href="https://universalukproject.co.uk/">Universal planning a potential park as well</a>.
</p><p>The biggest news for Minecraft is obviously that we just named it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the best PC game ever</a>. Yes, I will be taking my son to the Minecraft theme park, even if it just turns out to be a shed full of cardboard boxes. I can't resist.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/superstore-3000-review-shoppers-delight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the far future, we’ll commute on trains full of aliens, fly around in zippy little spaceships, and hang out with robot buddies, but <i>where</i> will we get a haircut or catch a movie? That’s the question at the heart of <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/superstore-3000" rel="nofollow"><i>Superstore 3000</i></a>, a new tile-placing game from Space Cowboys. Distributor Asmodee sent along a copy for me to check out, so read on for my thoughts in TechRaptor’s <i>Superstore 3000</i> review!</p>

<h2>The Mall of Tomorrow… Today!</h2>

<p>I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, in a little town called King of Prussia. Funny name for a town, but that’s not what made it famous - that honor goes to the King of Prussia Mall, a sprawling complex full of all the staples, from Cinnabon to Hot Topic. Living walking distance from one of the largest malls in America, my friends and I truly lived the mall rat life. So when I got the chance to check out <i>Superstore 3000</i>, I knew they’d have me on theme alone.</p>

<p>But what is the theme of <i>Superstore 3000</i>? In the game, designed by Rodrigo Rego, you and up to three other opponents are vying to create the most attractive mall in the galaxy. To do so, you’ll draft mall store tiles from an automatic store creator, place them onto your play space to create as a growing, sprawling, and potentially spiraling out of control mall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-mall-building-taller.jpg?itok=VVYzrva8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-mall-building-taller.jpg?itok=pC_-T6v9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build your mall up into the sky to score points, unlock more resources, and give your shoppers what they're looking for.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Gameplay Basics of <i>Superstore 3000</i></h2>

<p>The reason you’ll be drafting and laying down tiles is simple - you want to attract customers to your mall, and you want them to find what they’re looking for a remain satisfied customers. Each turn, you’ll draft one of four different colored tiles which all correspond to a type of store - except for the red tiles, which are entrances that’ll be placed with two little customer tokens.</p>

<p>Those customers know what they want, and they’re coming to get it. If placed within three spaces of the kind of store they’re looking for, you’ll move them to that store and they’ll remain there as a satisfied customer. At the end of the game, these happy shoppers will be the key to your scoring success.</p>

<p>One of the aspects of the game I really like is that you have to juggle money and your stores. The store on the bottom of the automatic dispenser is free, but any store tile above it costs money. You start with a little bit of money, but can also get money instead of taking a store tile. This creates a sense of urgency as you try to figure out exactly what to do that will be most beneficial. This is all complicated by the fact that as soon as you draw a tile, you have to immediately place it on your board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-man-wants-clothing.jpg?itok=UAVmsI6E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-man-wants-clothing.jpg?itok=yL4yhcM9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The shopper on this tile is looking for a clothing store, as soon as the clothing store tile is placed, he'll move there be counted as satisfied.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you’ll only be able to build in a vertical line going up, above your main entrance - but you’ll soon be scoring special agendas to let you put parking garages on your first floor (which can be built upon) and even big, audaciously shaped special features like a big, round aquarium, a long bowling alley, a zig-zagging space floating attraction, and more!</p>

<p>This is where the real fun of the game comes in, you’ll find it sometimes difficult to lay the tiles out in a way that makes cohesive sense in your mall… but that’s not the point! We’re in the far-flung future, and in this future the zanier the better!</p>

<p>My only wish from the gameplay was that there was a bit more to these special tiles. I would love tiles that let you break the rules a bit more, and right now these are simply meant to take up space, branch your mall out in fun directions, and look very cool on the board. But it would have been nice to see some effects that changed how we drafted tiles, placed our shoppers, etc.</p>

<h2>Light but Intuitive Competition</h2>

<p>The game isn’t the most cutthroat new game on the market, but it does involve a little bit of friendly competition. You’ll be competing against the other players at the table for the stores as they show up on the automatic store dispenser. But you’ll <i>also</i> be competing for the specialty tiles I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Not only do these tiles open up new avenues for you to build out from your base mall, but they’re also worth valuably points at the end of the game. Because they’re achieved by a specific objective, you may find yourself naturally racing against your opponents to fulfill the pre-requisites to get that special tile.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-tornado-simulator-attraction.jpg?itok=CZ_7C-_L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-tornado-simulator-attraction.jpg?itok=zsODIoyr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Attractions add spice to the game in <em>Superstore 3000</em>, like this tornado simulator attraction!</figcaption></figure><p>That’s why I like this game’s approach to competition - it’s what I would call light, but still intuitive. You don’t need to puzzle out how you can best your opponent, it’ll be quite clear what they’re going for. And it’s up to you to decide if it’s more valuable to try to stop them by drafting tiles they need, or whether you’d be better served worrying about your own board.</p>

<p>This intrinsic push and pull is a hallmark of a lot of lighter-weight games that encourage competition, and you’ll find it put to perfect use here.</p>

<h2>Retro Futurism - Take Me Back!</h2>

<p>Before I get into my final thoughts of the game, I <i>have</i> to talk about the artwork by Ryan Goldsberry, which absolutely exudes a sort of bubbly, over-the-top (and yet somehow still refined) design. This game could have featured snarling aliens and realistic robots, or it could have looked like a kid’s cartoon. But instead, much to my delight, the artist took a retro-futuristic approach.</p>

<p>Think <i>Jetsons </i>here when we talk about the artwork, and as you can see from the photos it’s all a vision of the far future as seen through the lens of a 1960s illustrative style. I love it, I think it perfectly fits a game about a mall in the future, and it helps the game stand out amongst its peers. It’s absolutely an art style I wish would truly have a resurgence, and maybe we will see more hand-drawn, personality-first artwork as the world slides into AI image generation drudgery.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-shopping-figurines.jpg?itok=xhAiEia5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-shopping-figurines.jpg?itok=UQ3YZjLo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everything from the construction to the illustration of the shopper meeples just screams retro-futurism in Superstore 3000</figcaption></figure><h2>Superstore 3000 - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can maybe tell by now, I’m very high on <i>Superstore 3000</i>. I think the gameplay is fun, light, and evocative. I think the artwork is bold, bright, and full of personality. And even though it’s not the deepest or most complex game in the world, there’s a lot of fun to be had here against your fellow players. I do wish it could support more players, which might be my only real mark against it.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a pretty rough review for another tile laying game, where I felt like everything the game had you doing was a bit predictable. And that the central puzzle of laying the tiles wasn’t very engaging. With <i>Superstore 3000</i>, I couldn’t feel more differently. Here, you’re hoping and praying for that one specific tile, you have a lot more agency over what you’re picking, and you need to balance spending money with getting tiles that could be useful.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a fun but light gaming experience with friends, and you like tile-placing games where you have to think on your feet to score points and achieve goals, <i>Superstore 3000</i> is definitely for you.</p>

        <p>Based on anonymous sources and datamining</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Valve said <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-want-to-make-another-steam-controller-happen">that they want to make a new Steam Controller</a> back in 2022, but such a thing might be getting closer to production, according to dataminer Brad Lynch.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Codename for Steam Controller 2 is 'Ibex'. Separate product from Deckard’s “Roy” controller(s)," Lynch <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316">tweeted</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/11/19/24300757/valve-steam-controller-2-roy-deckard-leak">The Verge</a>. "Both are being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now. That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization".
</p>
<p>Deckard is reportedly the codename for a standalone VR headset from Valve. They have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-latest-patent-filing-is-for-a-new-vr-headset">occasional and dull patent filings</a> in recent years that could be for such a headset. The "Roy" controllers are reportedly new motion controls designed for use with the new VR headset.
</p>
<p>In another <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1857153531897131182">tweet</a>, Lynch says that the Roy controllers will "have at least: DPAD, Bumpers, Grip Buttons, Triggers, ABXY, system button, and some sort of strap".
</p>
<p>"I am confident in this info based on datamining AND sources who wished not to be named," Lynch writes.
</p>
<p>None of this is hard proof that any of this is actually happening. Valve have not announced any new hardware, other than last week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time">limited edition white Steam Deck</a>. 
</p>
<p>It's possible I'm just posting this because I want it to be true. I've been using a Valve Index for four years and I've started to long for something with higher resolution screens. I can't bring myself to buy a Meta product, however, so I'm really hoping Valve eventually deliver.
</p>
<p>A Steam Controller 2 is less immediately appealing, but I'd still be curious to see Valve take another swing at any of their past hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’s worth and estimated $10 billion and he was apparently biding his time. </p><p>Last week on November 15, six months after JimmyBLLT sent their original tweet, Niel appeared at the Lidl on rue Sainte in Marseille. “I’m waiting for you,” he wrote in a quote-tweet of the original post.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-jrpg-completionism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a perfectly reasonable JRPG with a <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-perfect-length" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct length</a>. Unlike its spiritual predecessor <em>Persona 5</em>, which <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/15221" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overstays its welcome</a> by about 20 hours, <em>Metaphor</em> wraps up in <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/129956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65-70 for the main story</a> — long by the standards of games generally but right in the sweet spot for sprawling JRPGs. But I can’t just “finish” a JRPG; I am a prisoner to these games, I have been since childhood. So my final playtime was well over 100 hours, pointlessly grinding and optimizing. I need to learn to stop.</p><p>What I am describing is primarily a “me” problem, although you may share it. To both my detriment and benefit, I cannot live an unoptimized life when the optimized one is clearly and directly in my line of sight. Sometimes this compulsion bears fruit and I come out of a fugue state having learned the best multi-ply Japanese cookware set. Other times I get caught in a gameplay sinkhole and cannot do anything until I beat a game, truly beat it, totally and completely.</p><p>JRPGs bring out this behavior in me more than any other subgenre. They are often meant to be a grand investment of your time, something you slowly whittle away at for a few hours every night after work, or consume uninterrupted in your teen years like a seagull swallowing a large fish in one gulp. These games are replete with secrets, often not signposted clearly, and god help you if you miss them and you have to reload an old save. Older JRPGs, particularly the ancient and unreasonable ones, can instill a sense of paranoia in you. This is particularly felt if you have ever saved yourself into a corner before an unreasonably strong boss with little or no way to improve your position.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Some fights in JRPGs and tactical RPGs punish you if you don't over-prepare. If you know you know. Credit: SquareEnix/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzCGAgmc9ns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jasonsgroovemachine</a></figcaption></figure><p>In a classic JRPG&nbsp; there are almost always one to four grueling super bosses whose difficulty will far outstrip the main boss. There are hidden items and ultimate weapons, often with elaborate quests, that may or may not be useful by the end of the game. Modern Ubisoft-coded open world games attempt to ape this mystique superficially, but they always feel like Potemkin objectives — a marker for a marker’s sake, a quest for a quest’s sake. (Ironically, I felt this false accomplishment strongest this year in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>).</p><p>This is partially why playing the <em>Persona </em>games have been torture for me since <em>Persona 3</em>. The calendared <a href="https://aftermath.site/persona-tokimeki-memorial-coming-of-age" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schooldays</a> with their various events and quizzes invite a specific, optimized route with little room for deviation. I cannot help but be tied to a guide while playing those games, it is in my nature and the game’s. This rigorous structure sucks the joy away and turns the entire thing into homework for me. To <em>Metaphor’s </em>immense credit, the developers have pulled the guts out of that series and retooled it so that you can easily maximize your social links <a href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-guides-travellers-voices-gallica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without ever looking at a guide</a>.The sheer mercy in that act alone, along with the fact that they don’t do anything terribly tone deaf or egregious, makes it a radical improvement over that team’s previous outings. Maybe it is a recognition that such a brutally narrow schedule was unnecessary in 2024, or maybe the designers realized they were getting too old for this too.</p><p>And yet, despite that, I still spent 146 hours according to Steam (some of this was screen idling or involved reloading old saves to maximize the final days) pummeling this game into the pavement, grinding well beyond the threshold of being able to beat the secret dragon bosses handily. <em>Metaphor </em>makes it simple to grind enemies below your pay grade — small fry enemies can be easily wiped out in the dungeon without having to engage in combat, which makes the entire loop feel like you’re playing a game in an emulator with frameskip on. It also makes the question of money trivial by making the Merchant Archetype a money printer – simply grinding weak foes in dungeons trivializes any financial woes. But <em>Metaphor</em> also has a deep job class system — a succulent time sink for each and every one of your characters.</p><figure><figcaption>If you are old like me you remember that they occasionally would sell PC games in Trapezoids. </figcaption></figure><p>I remember a summer in middle school playing <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>for the second time. The first time had been on PlayStation, a rental from Blockbuster Video that I had returned many weeks late and stopped right before the last boss on the third disk. The second was on PC, in my bedroom with crisp, Voodoo 2 accelerated graphics. I had the family’s hand-me-down TV going in the background with DVDs on a loop (a TV and a computer in your room was an extravagance at the time). I did not see the end of <em>FFVII</em> until each and every character was at level 99. By the time I had completed it, I had forgotten why I was doing it except that I had chosen to do it. I got no reward from it, no special ending with all the characters telling me what a good job I did. I don’t think I felt more satisfied having done it. The light of that game had long gone away, and nothing had remained except the impulse to see the number go up until it couldn’t any more.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Final Fantasy Tactics How To Learn Ultima (Limberry Castle Gate)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kF7AijdBwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The easiest way to learn Ultima in Final Fantasy Tactics is to have Ramza be attacked by the assassins at Limberry Castle Gate while he is a squire. It isn't a particularly good skill and I never used it after I got it. </figcaption></figure></div><p>I remember doing lesser versions of this countless times. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> for the GBA consumed a summer. <em>Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King </em>consumed a semester. <em>Disgaea </em>felt like it was designed in a lab specifically to fuck with me. Recently I replayed the original <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on my MiSTer and power leveled my jobs far beyond what was required, going out of my way to save scum Limberry Castle Gate until Ramza learned Ultima despite Ultima not being that good a spell. I have had never touched <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> because I have lived the MMO lifestyle and I know precisely how badly it would fuck my life up.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also why I have such a deep respect for shorter JRPGs like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, <em>Live-A-Live</em> and <em>SaGa Frontier </em>– games that are either so brief that they can’t trap you in a grinding loop or introduce multiple characters and storylines to interrupt the temptation of linear progression to level 99. One of the strongest choices a game can make is to decouple or mess with the attachment players have towards their digital selves, <em>Nier Automata </em>being the best example. We are all going to die one day, some of us sooner than others. Trite though it is to say, it’s true that the journey is the important part, and most of us will never return to these over-optimized selves. Maybe we should let go and delete our save files, dumping those personas into the ocean. I don’t want to say that the completionist path is time wasted, I can only speak for myself, but I can think of several uses for my time that would have made me feel more fulfilled.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LIVE A LIVE - Launch Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0oOta9Lfts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Games like <em>Live A Live</em> and <em>SaGa Frontier</em> prevent you from falling into this trap by being shorter games with multiple, selectable characters that can be played in any order. The former is my favorite retro remake of all time.</figcaption></figure></div><p><em>Metaphor </em>is ultimately a far more reasonable game than the ones that I let suck me in before. And as I approached the end, after I had beaten the super bosses, I did loosen up a little bit. I did not maximize all my Archetypes, although I did spend some time seeing how hard I could hit the last boss by throwing money at him. I am older, I am thinking about having children, and I do not have the kind of time that I used to have. I am learning to take things easy, to be a little less optimized and at a lower level. One day I will figure out how to play these games normally, though I guess that what I’m describing is far more common an affliction than any of us would like to admit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-patch-anytime-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a short and sweet post on X by CD Projekt Red on the official Cyberpunk 2077 X account, they confirmed that there are no plans for a PS5 Pro patch. For many, this comes as a huge disappointment, especially since the game has come such a long way from how it was when it was first released. When Cyberpunk 2077 was first released, the game was incredibly buggy and wasn't performing the way many had expected from CD Projekt Red. After all, this is a company that made award-winning games like The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. However, since that time, the game has improved significantly, with a smoother performance, stunning graphics, and a great story for many to get lost in.</p>
<p>With the release of the PS5 Pro, many huge titles on PlayStation have been confirmed to be getting a PS5 Pro patch, which will enhance the game to work with the new hardware within the PS5 Pro to provide frame rate boosts and better-looking graphics. To celebrate the PS5 Pro, Sony has proudly announced that there are at least 40 or 50 games that will get the PS5 Pro patch on launch. However, there has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/">an updated list</a> since then that confirms over 80 games will be getting the PS5 Pro patch when the console launches or when the game is set to release.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red confirmed that there will be no PS5 patch anytime soon after a user named <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NextGenNero reached out on X</a> to ask whether it will be getting one. They stated, "We currently have no plans for the PS5 Pro patch," which led to a lot of fans of the game being disappointed by the news.</p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 has no plans for getting a PS5 Pro patch, games such as Silent Hill 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Alan Wake 2 have been confirmed to get patches to supposedly enhance the game on the new expensive version of the PlayStation 5. However, these games, in particular, have had mixed results, as confirmed by tests by Digital Foundry. That being said, they have tested some other top games on the PS5 Pro and given the new patches a whirl, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-ps5-pro-hands-on-preview-is-it-worth-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some games have performed as expected</a>, providing improved frame rates and better graphics.</p>
<p>Whether CD Projekt Red is just waiting it out and plans to do a PS5 Pro patch once audiences have had a chance to experiment with games that are enhanced for the Pro, or they just don't plan to do a patch at all remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-res-arcana-duo-two-player-board-game-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a> is releasing <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> at the end of the week. The global tabletop publisher known for producing many beloved titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>River of Gold</em></a> has announced a unique spin-off of Sand Castle Games' competitive board game series, one designed for two players.</p>

<h2>The <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page listing, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is a standalone installment in the <em>Res Arcana</em> series. Like the main series, players take on the roles of powerful magicians caught in an elaborate game of mystic supremacy. A visual trademark of the series is the detailed artwork provided by Julien Delval.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/res-arcana-duo-board-set-up.jpg?itok=dPuX4Fa1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/res-arcana-duo-board-set-up.jpg?itok=r9HzZtpP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, a game of <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is framed as a wizard's duel. Each player chooses a Mage (Druid, Alchemist, Necromancer, etc.) and gets a deck of unique artifact cards. Using these artifacts helps you claim Monuments and Places of Power, providing resources that fuel the art of magic. Make your moves wisely and you can conquer your enemies.</p>

<p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> contains a new set of game pieces, cards, and mechanics. These include a new set of Mages, Artifacts, Monuments, and Places of Power designed for the spin-off's one-on-one format.</p>

<p>If you own the base game of <em>Res Arcana</em>, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> can function as an expansion. In addition, the <em>Lux et Tenebrae</em> and <em>Perlae Imperil </em>expansions can be used with the game to provide a more robust tabletop experience.</p>

<p>A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>4 New Mage Cards</li>
	<li>16 Artifact Cards</li>
	<li>7 Monument Cards</li>
	<li>2 Double-Sided Place of Power Tiles</li>
	<li>5 Magic Item Tiles</li>
	<li>1 Starting Player Tile</li>
	<li>5 x5 Essence Chips</li>
	<li>60 Essence Tokens</li>
	<li>1 Storing/Sorting Tray</li>
	<li>1 Rule Booklet</li>
</ul><p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is available right now for pre-order at an MSRP of $24.99. The game will ship to players on November 22, 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> is making changes to how it handles mods in order to address server stability issues. Come the next big update in December, mods "will be prohibited from public online sessions," according to an update from the game director.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We wanted to make a game that was moddable from the start (this is why our game pack files are not encrypted, for example). It's always a pleasure for me, as a developer, to see what our community can create. Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity," writes Dmitriy Grigorenko <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/114-mod-support-a-message-from-the-game-director">on the Focus Home Interactive forums</a> (also shared <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957">on Steam</a>).
</p>
<p>"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players. Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don’t have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods.
</p>
<p>"This is why, starting with our next big update in December, mods will be prohibited from public online sessions. That means that you will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed."
</p>
<p>The update goes on to explain that mods will "still be allowed in private Operations lobbies". Grigorenko also says they'll release some of their own tools to make it easier for people to make mods.
</p>
<p>I'm not clear on what kind of mods people were taking into public servers, but it's a Warhammer 40,000 game, so naturally <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000spacemarine2/mods/?BH=2">Nexus Mods</a> has several pages of cosmetic re-paints of your soldiers. It also sounds as if a lot of players are hacking at the UI, blood effects and FOV options.
</p>
<p>Brendan had a lot of fun with his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a>, finding it a spectacular jaunt and "pure ambrosia" for 40K fans.

The final mission, called Here Lies the Abyss, ends with a big decision between leaving Hawke or a Grey Warden ally in the spirit realm called the Fade to fight a demon as the rest of the team escapes. Depending on choices made in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, that ally can potentially be <em>Origins</em> party member Alistair, <em>Origins </em>villain Loghain, or Stroud, a supporting character from <em>Dragon Age II</em>. The person who stays behind is presumed dead, but according to <em>The Veilguard</em>’s art book, BioWare considered bringing whoever you chose back as an ally. </p><p>One piece of concept art in the book shows someone—a pretty generic character who I would not immediately recognize as Hawke or any of the potential Grey Wardens—in what looks like the Fade. The character has glowing yellow eyes and a wolf approaching them, and the caption reads: “What if we return to the Fade and rescue whoever was left behind? How would their time in that alien landscape change them, and what insights could they offer into Solas’s plans?”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-recommend-id="image://9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-format="png" data-width="650" data-height="366" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-recommend-id="image://9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-format="png" data-width="650" data-height="366" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this had come to pass, anyone who’d left Hawke in the Fade back in <em>Inquisition </em>would get two old heroes showing up in their <em>Veilguard </em>playthrough. The Inquisitor’s role changed throughout development, as evidenced by early concept art of players working for the <em>Inquisition</em> protagonist, but they always seemed to be part of the story. Hawke, however, doesn’t appear at all in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and is only mentioned in passing a few times so as to keep their fate in <em>Inquisition </em>ambiguous. This is in line with BioWare’s previous messaging that <em>The Veilguard </em>would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112">write around old choices</a></span> instead of contradicting them, but now we get to add a potential Hawke appearance to the pile of interesting concepts that didn’t make it into the game.

While the update details various adjustments, such as new inclusions for Fortnite Crew subscribers, the thing that’s likely to affect most battle royale fans is the slight increase in cost for the Battle Pass. Fortnite has long offered its standard pass for 950 V-Bucks, but starting December 1, the price will increase by 50, bringing the total asking number to 1,000 V-Bucks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has reached out to Epic Games for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/03/fortnitechapter4seasonoggameplaytrailer-ign-blogroll-1699018654708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Fortnite Battle Pass V-Bucks price increase arrives in December.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a small increase in price but still undeniably notable considering Epic hasn’t altered the cost of the Fortnite Battle Pass in the past. The studio does clarify that the real-world cost of its popular digital currency will remain unchanged (you can pick up 1,000 V-Bucks on the Epic Games Store for $8.99 right now), and you’ll still be able to earn chunks of V-Bucks by reaching certain Battle Pass levels, too. While any increase in price may be worrying for fans, Epic adds that the price of its 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle is going down from 1,850 to 1,800. IGN has reached out to Epic for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These tiny but fundamental changes arrive ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-confirms-og-experience-returns-in-december-but-this-time-its-here-to-stay"><u>highly anticipated launch of Fortnite OG: Chapter 1 – Season 1</u></a> on December 6. Part of the shift to allow players to enjoy the classic battle royale experience will see the $12.99 Fortnite Crew deal sweetened to include even more goodies. The bundle currently grants subscribers the standard Fortnite Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, Crew Pack outfit styles, and Rocket League’s Premium Rocket Pass. Starting December 1, it will be expanded to include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass without asking subscribers for a penny more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an enticing offer that will no doubt keep players investing their time in Epic’s gaming ecosystem, especially considering that earning XP in any one of the related games will progress all of their battle passes simultaneously. A Crew subscription will also grant access to any additional passes that arrive in the future, including the new, yet-to-be-detailed Fortnite OG Pass.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The catch with the Fortnite Crew upgrade is that new subscribers who sign up after December 1 will no longer be able to unlock premium rewards from the passes after their subscription is no longer active. It means that if you sign up for Crew and then cancel shortly after, you’ll only be able to claim rewards for the remainder of your billing period. Players are currently able to cancel Crew and still reap the benefits of the remaining Battle Pass as long as it’s live, and this won’t be changing for those who are currently subscribed and remain subscribed after the changes take effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic is making major changes as it looks to the future with the permanent nostalgia-fueled Fortnite OG mode. The company is currently in the midst of Chapter 5: Season 5, which will conclude when Chapter 6: Season 1 kicks off next month. Details on its theme and exact contents remain under wraps, so while we wait for more information, be sure to check out the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-limited-edition-fortnite-dualsense-controller"><u>Fortnite-themed PlayStation 5 DualSense controller</u></a> that released earlier this month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

                <p>In the NFL, when players pull off something special on the field, fans occasionally refer to it as a "video-game move." But Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley took that to another level earlier this season when he evaded a defender by jumping over him while looking the other way. EA couldn't resist adding that no-look hurdle to the latest update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a>, but Barkley is the only player who can use it and it's not easy to pull off.</p><p>As part of the notes for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/title-update-november-20-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the new Madden NFL 25 update</a>, EA explained that the development team immediately decided to put Barkley's "once-in-a-lifetime move" in the game by combing through hours of motion-capture footage. From there, they determined which animations could be modified to recreate Barkley's leap, with some additional help from "animator magic" to complete the move.</p><p>While that move would be incredibly useful for any player, the developers have put some restrictions on it beyond limiting to Barkley's in-game avatar. In order to perform a Saquon spin hurdle, the defender has to approach the front of the player at a 45-degree angle. The move also requires very precise timing, as well as close proximity between the player and the defender. So it's possible, but it may not be the guaranteed outcome of every play under those circumstances.</p><p>Later this month, Amazon's Prime Video will debut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-trailer-for-its-in-the-game-shares-the-history-of-madden-nfl/1100-6527695/" data-ref-id="1100-6527695">It's in the Game</a>, a four-part documentary series about the history and development of the Madden NFL games.

            <p>
Five years after announcing the feature was on the way, Microsoft has finally launched the ability for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to play "select" games they already own outside the Xbox Game Pass library via cloud streaming.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft originally announced the feature back in 2019, with the goal of launching it alongside Xbox Cloud Gaming (then known as Project xCloud) the following year. It was then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-will-let-game-pass-subscribers-bring-their-own-games-to-xbox-cloud-gaming-later-in-2022">re-announced for launch in 2022</a>, but again failed to materialise, with The Verge later reporting its arrival had been "complicated by having to prepare key infrastructure for thousands of games" .
</p>

However, word <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-will-reportedly-let-players-stream-any-game-in-their-library-from-november">began circulating last month</a> that the long-in-the-works feature was finally almost here - and those reports have now been proven true. Microsoft has announced Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members can use Xbox Cloud Gaming to stream games they own starting today - albeit only if they appear on its 50-strong list of currently compatible titles.

That's not, admittedly, a huge number of games when you consider the size of the Xbox catalogue, but it's a pretty solid list, mixing blockbuster titles old and new with acclaimed indie games. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, Warhammer 4K: Space Marine 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> all feature, as do Balatro, Hades, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, Dredge, Phasmophobia, The Plucky Squire. The full list, as it currently stands, is available at the bottom of this story, and Microsoft adds its "library of cloud-playable titles will continue to grow, as we work with our partners around the world". 
</p><p>
It also notes it'll only be possible to stream games through TVs and browsers on supported devices such as tablets, smartphones, and Meta Quest headsets to begin with, but says the feature will expand to Xbox consoles and the Xbox app on Windows sometime next year.

Just what it will mean for gamers around the world, however, may not be clear for some time. </p><h2 id="h164656"><a id=""></a>A History Of Streaming</h2><p>For about 20 years now, companies have been trying (and mostly failing) to let gamers stream console and PC titles via the internet without having to download anything. As early as 2005, a service called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Cluster</a></span> was  offering this. Perhaps you’ve heard of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnLive</a></span>, which let players stream games from big publishers starting around 2009. (Both services are now defunct.) </p><p>However, things didn’t start heating up in the video game streaming space until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 and the arrival of Sony’s PlayStation Now service</a></span>. That was the first time one of the bigger players really got involved. In the decade since, Xbox has started offering more ways to stream games, Sony has expanded its offerings, and Amazon, Google, and Nvidia have hopped into the streaming wars, too. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">Google’s Stadia service famously flopped</a></span> and is no longer around.) </p><p>Through all of this, streaming games has never felt like it was really a <em>thing</em>. It was an option, sure, but I rarely met anyone who used these services. It seemed like a neat idea, but not something anyone was really using.</p><p> That’s changed recently, however, as I now know more people who stream games on their phones and other devices. This shift has happened as Xbox has ramped up its cloud streaming offerings alongside Sony and the other tech giants. </p><h2 id="h164657"><a id=""></a>Xbox and PlayStation expand their streaming services</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376">On November 19</a></span>, Sony announced that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015">PS Portal</a></span> handheld device would now be able to stream some games without a console. Xbox has been letting players do that for a few years now, letting you stream Game Pass titles on your phone or browser. But on November 20, the day after Sony’s announcement, Xbox declared it was also going to start letting people stream games they own on supported devices. </p><p>Game streaming is now a part of many different video game ecosystems. You can stream Xbox titles on your phone, and PlayStation games on your PC. Some publishers have even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725">released streaming-only games on the Nintendo Switch</a></span> to get around the aging console’s weaker specs. It’s clear that cloud streaming is no longer an oddball experiment, but instead a key part of multiple company strategies moving forward. </p><p> “Our biggest growth in Xbox players is on PC and cloud,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> in a recent interview</a></span>. </p><p>“The console space isn’t growing, across all of them.

A lot of people, both inside and outside these tech companies, seem to expect cloud streaming to become more and more popular in the coming years.</p><p>In 2024, more people are playing games via the cloud. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in February that at least 10 percent</a></span> of all hours spent on Xbox are now via players streaming games on their phones or other devices. It makes sense that as games get bigger, consoles get more expensive, and phones get better, a lot of people might decide to just stream the latest <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> instead of spending money on a new console, downloading the game, and playing it in one spot. </p><p>Anecdotally, a lot of younger people I know stream games on their phones and prefer it over playing with a controller or keyboard on their TV or PC. That might send a shiver down your spine, but the reality is that this is our future. I don’t think offline games are going away, but it’s clear that as console sales stagnate, cloud gaming looks like a potential goldmine to big game companies, publishers, and tech giants, if they can make the tech work and keep their costs reasonable.</p><p>Today, I know plenty of people who stream games via Xbox cloud or their PS Portal. I’ve now started streaming some games to my phone when I’m lazy and just want to do some grinding in an RPG or online game. It’s easier than ever and works better than it once did, too.

<p>With the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro here, players have been eagerly awaiting details on what games will be getting PS5 Pro improvements, and how they’ll be implemented. One game that won’t be getting any sort of PS5 Pro upgrade, however, is Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fan on social media</a>, the game’s official account confirmed that players shouldn’t expect an update for the game.</p>



<p>“We currently have no plans for PS5 Pro patch,” the post reads. </p>

<p>The reveal shouldn’t come as a surprise as CD Projekt Red has moved on to work on the next installment in The Witcher franchise as well as a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Still, the news wasn’t met without its fair share of disappointment.</p>



<p>“Please reconsider this decision,” <a href="https://x.com/ThatGuyNamedTre/status/1859264991620206790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one fan said</a>. “The demand for a Pro patch is high and would give everyone an excuse to do another playthrough.”</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/RightChandMan/status/1859315618752741738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>: “Really hope this gets reconsidered! It’s one of the best modern games and it deserves a pro patch.”</p>

                <p>A lot of big games are getting patches to take advantage of the PS5 Pro's power, but CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077 is not among them. The Polish developer confirmed this on social media in response to a question from a fan.</p><p>"We currently have no plans for [a] PS5 Pro patch," <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio said</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). The wording here leaves the door open for these plans to change at some point down the line, but for now, no one should expect a PS5 Pro patch.</p><p>CD Projekt Red did not go into any further detail as to why it won't release a PS5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077. However, it might have something to do with how there is<a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1795474940520550428" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> no one at CD Projekt Red working on Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and that's been the case for months now. These staffers have moved on to other projects, including the next Cyberpunk and Witcher games.</p><p>When the PS5 Pro launched in early November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5758">a number of high-profile games were patched to support the console</a>, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Hogwarts Legacy, and Spider-Man 2. However, some PS5 Pro users reported that for games like Silent Hill 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, the PS5 Pro patches <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-owners-say-some-games-look-worse-after-upgrades/1100-6527847/" data-ref-id="1100-6527847">actually made these games look worse.</a> For its part, EA <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1858635462577172846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the issues with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and said its teams were investigating the issue.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is available now, priced at $700 USD. It's still early days, but Sony reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-huge-price-didnt-negatively-impact-sales-sony-says/1100-6527685/" data-ref-id="1100-6527685">the system's price tag didn't negatively impact sales.</a> In other PlayStation news, the next wave of the 30th-anniversary limited-edition slim PS5 model goes on sale via PlayStation Direct on November 21, starting at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-hate-that-i-care-about-these-anti-trans-bathroom-bills.1041126/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/bathroom-bill-nancy-mace<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Trans people using the bathroom has been… well, I was going to write “a going concern since I came out in the early 2000s,” but that’s not entirely the case. It was very much a concern for <em>me</em> back then, particularly following the <a href="https://www.deanspade.net/2016/12/16/interview-about-drugs-and-sex-and-bathrooms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2002 arrest</a> of one of my friends in Grand Central, and it’s always been an issue in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/grimm-v-gloucester-county-school-board" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schools</a> and other spaces where, like so much of today’s anti-trans panic, concern about children can be invoked as cover. But, at the risk of sounding very very old, I am kind of astonished by the level to which it has now become <em>a thing</em>.</p><p>I’m sure I don’t need to tell you that this is <a href="https://19thnews.org/2024/11/lgbtq-trans-issues-trump-second-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a great time to be trans in America</a>. I’ve always struggled to articulate how I feel about this–there’s a confusing way in which I tend not to panic about the new slates of bans and laws, because I came out at a time when many of the things they outlaw weren’t legal anyway. But I always follow this up with: it didn’t matter so much what the law said, because even if medical care or hormones or document changes weren’t protected by law, in my experience, no one in power knew or cared enough to actually <em>stop</em> you from doing them. Insurance wouldn’t cover <a href="https://x.com/rcmacleod/status/1507171607747481609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormones</a> or surgery, but there could be ways around this. The letter I got from my doctor to change the gender marker on my documents was artfully vague enough to work. You could be fired or discriminated against–I was once rejected from a job in the very last phase after a background check revealed what it clearly revealed, and there was no recourse for this but to feel shitty about it–and the world was still the world, but as much as legal and medical neglect made things harder (and as much as I will never forgive Barney Frank for <a href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/06/10-years-later-firestorm-over-gay-only-enda-vote-still-remembered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ENDA in 2007</a>), I’ve always a little bit thought they made it easier, too. “Visibility was a mistake,” I sometimes joke crassly, even as the world spins–or, <em>was</em> spinning–forward into a level of protection and acceptance I honestly never thought possible, and, as much as I like to pretend I am a jaded old man, sometimes brings me to tears.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a long-winded way to introduce how messed up I feel about the latest turn in anti-trans bathroom laws, in which South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace is trying to introduce the “<a href="https://mace.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-nancy-maces-resolution-protect-womens-private-spaces-united-states-capitol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Protect Women’s Private Spaces Act</a>,” which would ban trans women–<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/nancy-mace-defends-anti-trans-bathroom-bill-says-absolutely-targets-sa-rcna180805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specifically</a>, and I cannot believe I am writing this, incoming Representative Sarah McBride–from bathrooms in the Capitol. Today, Mace announced that she’s “<a href="https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1859260706144539077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling down</a>” on this to extend the ban to all federal facilities; journalist Erin Reed <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erininthemorning.bsky.social/post/3lbfe65yshs24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that this would include “bathrooms in DCA and Dulles airports, national park bathrooms, museum bathrooms, and all federal building bathrooms.” <a href="https://x.com/RepNancyMace/status/1859263432123633697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Screenshots</a> of the proposal would seem to include trans men in these bans, though of course–<em>of course</em>–it is trans women that Mace seems most concerned with.</p><p>As a trans man, it’s always hard for me to know what to say about this kind of thing. I have been on hormones for a little over 21 years; bathrooms are still a source of stress for me, but not nearly as much as they used to be, and at a distinctly different level than people who present to the world differently than I do. On a practical level, these kinds of bans are unlikely to affect me personally all that much. It’s hard for me to think about this without bringing complicated ideas about “passing” into the mix, a concept that has never been important to me but which I cannot pretend I do not benefit from. (My joke about this is usually, it isn’t so much that I “pass” as it is that no one knows what a trans man looks like; I move through the world generally assuming everyone knows I’m trans and am shocked when they don’t, though obviously that is a simplistic summary.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For other people, it’s hard to say what these bans would mean if they go into law. (Well, except for McBride I guess? Which is, I must again stress, mind-blowing.) Are regular people going to police bathrooms in this way? Is anyone going to take time out of their one and only life to enforce this? Part of me wants to not take these kinds of things seriously because it lends them legitimacy, but at the same time, they aren’t Tinkerbell; they don’t go away if I just ignore them.</p><p>For me–the only perspective from which I can confidently speak–these bans do what they are clearly intended to do, which is make me feel shitty and like I don’t belong. As unlikely as <a href="https://www.aclufl.org/en/know-your-rights/know-your-rights-floridas-public-restroom-changing-facility-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a>’s trans bathroom bans are to affect me, they–along with <a href="https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/gov-desantis-signs-slate-of-extreme-anti-lgbtq-bills-enacting-a-record-shattering-number-of-discriminatory-measures-into-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> laws–have stopped me from visiting my aging parents who live in the state, which has become a regular, painful argument between us. The idea that I would feel unwelcome in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-road-goes-ever-on-and-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national parks</a>–in, not to get religious but to get religious, places on this earth that belong to me as much as any other person in this world by virtue of being born into the world in the first place–is upsetting to me in a way that’s embarrassing because it means I care what Nancy Mace does, it means that she has the ability to affect me, and I do not want to give her that.&nbsp;</p><p>This is how these people <em>want</em> trans people to feel, and I don’t want to let them win by feeling those ways. But hardening my heart against it <em>also</em> does what they want it to. It separates me from my emotions, it cuts off my connection to a core human part of myself and to part of being alive that–let’s get religious again–I believe God put me on this earth to experience in its fullness. I’m in that <a href="https://mckitterick.tumblr.com/post/181377996055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tumblr meme</a> camp of “you cannot kill me in a way that matters” when it comes to these people, again because of my faith, but that doesn’t mean they can’t do their best to really fuck me up anyway. And I don’t want to give them the power to fuck me up! But then… well, here we are.</p><p>Who knows what will actually come of this garbage, which we can only hope is performative hate that will fizzle out before being replaced by whatever new horror. I do not care about this bill, but I also care about it a lot, more than I want to, and I hate that. I hate that I’m writing this, and that you’re reading it, but I also hate the idea that we <em>wouldn’t</em> write and read about it. What–sorry–a shit show.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Microsoft smoothly launch a videogame challenge 2024</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>I've been looking forward to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> since it was announced, but I might wait a while longer before trying to play it. It launched yesterday and currently sits at "overwhelmingly negative" Steam reviews due to long loading times caused by server issues.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In response to the issues, developers Asobo posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuMd7udCyFM&amp;ab_channel=MicrosoftFlightSimulator">video message discussing the launch issues</a>.
</p>
<p>"We knew the excitement was high for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, but frankly we completely underestimated how high and it really has overwhelmed our infrastructure," says Jorg Neumann, head of Flight Simulator.
</p>
<p>Asobo CEO Sebastian Wloch then explained that the issue was due to the number of players trying to access the game.
</p>
<p>"In Flight Sim 2024, there are a few new systems in the sim," Wloch says. "People have noticed in the career mode there's all sorts of missions, and when players at the very beginning when they start, they're asking a server for some data, and that server is going to cache it in a database. It's a pretty big database and there is a cache, and that cache is currently getting saturated.
</p>
<p>"It's a cache that has been thoroughly tested during the whole Tech Alpha. We've done load tests simulating 200,000 users, and tonight it's just completely overwhelmed."
</p>
<p>Wloch explained that they've had some temporary success with attempted fixes so far, but that soon the "cache collapsed again". They're continuing to investigate in search of a permanent fix.
</p>
<p>In an update <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2537590/view/4456969803786092545">posted to Steam about the launch issues</a>, the developers said that the problems are now "solved" and players should steadily be able to join the game. "We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience," says the post.
</p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 expands on the foundation built by the 2020 release, adding more detail to its simulation of the earth, and adding various kinds of aviation careers which add structure to your time in the skies. Edwin spoke to Neumann prior to the game's launch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-machine-learning-ai-and-how-much-of-your-data-it-might-need">about its machine learning tech and data streaming</a>. 
</p>
<p>We'll have a review of Flight Simualtor 2024 soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
