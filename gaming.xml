            <p>An astonishingly rare Xbox console given to a UK charity shop is expected to sell for thousands at an upcoming auction.</p>
<p>The lime green original Xbox console – designed to commemorate the 2003 release of the movie Hulk – is a limited edition original given out as a cinema scratchcard prize.</p>
<p>While 50 Hulk editions were made, just 36 were claimed, 16 of which are considered missing, lost, or scrapped.</p>

<p>"This one really caught my eye," tester Paul Smith told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ce440j9gdl5o">BBC</a>. "I'm a games enthusiast myself, but the rare green colour combined with the Hulk and Pepsi logo really stood out."</p>
<p>With eight days to go on the auction, the console has already attracted over 20  bids and is expected to fetch up to £9000. It appears to include all the original cables, five original Xbox games – Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, what I think is Bilbo's The Hobbit, and one other game I can't quite make out – and the original controller.</p>
<p>"This Green Hulk/Pepsi Xbox was a special promotional Xbox made to commemorate the release of the Universal Pictures movie Hulk in 2003 for the UK release," explains the item description. "The console featured a jewel on top with a promotional image of the Incredible Hulk's eye and the Pepsi logo. These special editions were only available by having a winning scratch card when you purchased a popcorn and Pepsi meal in participating UK UCI Multiplex cinemas.</p>
<p>"We believe there are only 36 of these consoles were ever won and only around 20 that have been found. We believe only 50 were made. but like we mentioned, only 36 were won.</p>
<p>"In the USA, a green Xbox was created for the brand Mountain Dew, they made 5000 of those and they are highly sought after, so this is even rarer."</p>
<p>The auction advises that there are no other such consoles on eBay and "none have been sold in the past", "so these are rare, the likelihood of finding another is slim, so a rare chance to own this item".</p>
<p>All proceeds go to the British Heart Foundation charity.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24173526/wallace-and-gromit-short-penguin-vengeance-most-fowl-release-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="xsMfUq">I always breathe a sigh of relief after the announcement of a new Aardman Animation project. The studio behind some of the most imaginative stop-motion projects of the last 50 years has never been a household name or box-office titan like Walt Disney Animation, but founders Peter Lord and David Sproxton’s quirky claymation company remains just as vital to the art. So you can imagine how loudly I yelled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RmT094XH9g">“cheeeeeeese!”</a> when Netflix announced a new outing for Aardman’s unofficial mascots, Wallace and Gromit. </p>
<p id="bPuQVd">Due out “this winter” (but positioned as a 2025 release in Netflix’s news release), <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl</em> picks back up the well-mannered bumbling inventor Wallace and his vigilant dog Gromit standing on the edge of our current techpocalypse. Wallace, it seems, is fully Silicon Valley-pilled, and “Gromit’s concern that Wallace is becoming too dependent on his inventions proves justified,” per a synopsis. The tipping point: Wallace’s invention of an AI “smart” gnome that goes rogue. But there’s another familiar face pulling the strings: Feathers McGraw. </p>
<p id="cmXdJN">Introduced in the 1993 Oscar-winning short <em>The Wrong Trousers</em> — one of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/26/21152552/wallace-and-gromit-best-chase-scene-wrong-trousers-aardman-streaming-amazon">the all-time great chase movies</a>? — Feathers is a silent criminal mastermind known to masquerade as a chicken using a red rubber glove worn as a hat. He has appeared in blink-and-you’ll-miss-it cameos in other Wallace and Gromit shorts, the pair’s lone feature film, <em>The Curse of the Wererabbit</em>, and even the woefully under-discussed 2003 video game <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit in Project Zoo</em>, but <em>Vengeance Most Fowl</em> is expected to give the penguin his true sequel moment, as seen in a brief teaser for the film.</p>

<p id="BTvQlS">While the distinctly British output from Aardman has struggled to connect with American  audiences — films like <em>The Pirates! Band of Misfits</em>, <em>Shaun the Sheep</em>, and <em>Early Man</em> were hits around the world and blips in the States — the streaming era has been kind to the studio. Along with producing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23924148/chicken-run-dawn-of-the-nugget-netflix-preview-animation-mission-impossible">last year’s sequel to <em>Chicken Run</em></a> for Netflix, the studio also collaborated with Disney for the first time in 2023, producing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23713171/star-wars-visions-season-2-show-interview">a segment for the <em>Star Wars: Visions </em>anthology series</a>. And last December, Aardman even produced a Wallace and Gromit VR game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJuoDhPDfE">for Meta Quest</a>, reminding us there is no place these two can’t go.</p>
<p id="TdgZDI">A new Wallace and Gromit short on Netflix is a no-brainer, and a sign of respect: if <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23900570/wes-anderson-roald-dahl-netflix-short-films-order-to-stream">Wes Anderson could do it</a>, obviously so can Aardman.</p>
<p id="UMSYgW"><em>Wallace &amp; Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl</em> is once again directed by longtime Aardman creative Nick Park. Actor Ben Whitehead returns as the voice of Wallace, after taking over Peter Sallis starting with <em>The Curse of the Were-Rabbit</em>. The short is set for this winter, teeing it up right up for Oscar season.</p>

  <p id="iLXjk0">I first saw <em>Hit Man</em>, the new Richard Linklater movie now streaming on Netflix, at an early morning press screening at the London Film Festival. The film played really well and the audience was into it, but I was still shocked when one late scene drew huge peals of laughter from the audience and an actual applause break at its climax. An applause break! At 9:30 in the morning! From film critics! <em>British </em>film critics! (Something you may not know about British people: We don’t applaud in movie theaters. Ever.)</p>
<p id="h35hmd">Just as surprising: the content of the scene that drew that response. Given the movie’s premise — a professor poses as a contract killer to help the police arrest people for soliciting murder, but gets lost in the role — you might guess the audience was hooting at a Tarantino-esque slapstick bloodbath. But the scene was, in fact, the most cleverly conceived and delightfully played piece of pure romantic comedy I’d seen in years.</p>

</p>
<p id="Hqc0Cp">As a filmmaker, Linklater is fluent in genre conventions, but he often finds his own space in the cracks between them. In that sense, <em>Hit Man</em> is true to form. Written by Linklater and its star (and frequent Linklater collaborator, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23068332/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> heavy) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24046802/hit-man-netflix-trailer-glen-powell-comedy">Glen Powell</a>, it’s an easygoing movie that doesn’t break a sweat as it flits between comedy, romance, suspense, philosophical musing, and a quiet tinge of noirish darkness. Under a straightforward, pleasing exterior, the movie is elusive and prone to shape-shifting — a bit like its main character.</p>
<p id="X6MFy7">That character is Gary Johnson (Powell), a placid, nerdy professor of philosophy and psychology with a talent for electronics. That talent leads him into a side hustle running recording equipment for the New Orleans police department, and helping with a sting operation where a cop named Jasper (<em>The Walking Dead</em>’s Austin Amelio, in venal mode) poses as an assassin to catch people in the act of soliciting murder. When Jasper gets suspended and Gary is parachuted into the sting at the last minute, he discovers a new talent for role-play. He takes to being a fake hitman like a duckling takes to water.</p>
<p id="dbfWuo">Gary, student of human nature that he is, pours himself into researching his marks and constructing identities that will work for each of them. Contract killers are a myth anyway, he reasons, so why not lean into the fiction and play into the expectations formed by decades of cinematic assassins? Powell has a lot of fun donning wigs and voices to imitate a comical range of stereotypical killers. At one point, he does an absolutely uncanny impression of Christian Bale in <em>American Psycho</em>.</p>

<p id="IpgFPx">Up to this point, <em>Hit Man</em> is a <a href="https://time.com/6313456/hit-man/">more-or-less true story</a>. There was a real Gary Johnson, in Houston, Texas, a mild-mannered cat-lover who moonlighted for the police as a fake hitman in the 1990s and 2000s. For the movie, Powell and Linklater adapted a <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">2001 Texas Monthly article</a> about the real Johnson, who might not have donned so many disguises, but certainly got the arrests.</p>
<p id="GrDnY6">It’s a good yarn about a resonant character — the unassuming everyman who can take on another identity to slip into a netherworld. In the process of fictionalizing this story, Powell and Linklater spin it out in two directions: a philosophical inquiry into the mutability of the self, and a light romantic thriller. Gary adopts the role of cucumber-cool hitman “Ron” to meet Madison Masters (Adria Arjona), a wife who wants her abusive husband killed. He’s smitten — but is it with Madison, or with Ron, the super-smooth, confident, uninhibited version of himself he has invented for her?</p>
<p id="lMcu9W">For its first half, <em>Hit Man</em> ambles along pleasantly in a typical Linklater mode: the anecdotal shaggy-dog story that takes plenty of time to muse about its own implications. (Quite literally: Gary quotes Nietzsche and ponders questions of identity and morality with his college class. Also, his cats are named Ego and Id.) </p>

<p id="FAss8L">The stakes for a hitman movie where real hitmen don’t exist seem pretty low, but the dual-identity setup with Gary/Ron and Madison is a classical Hollywood comedy gambit, like something out of a 1940s Preston Sturges movie. It kicks the movie into an uptempo second half that is more constructed, plotty, and commercial than Linklater’s usual extremely chill work. It’s easy to imagine it done in a more heightened, screwball mode — maybe something like Jonathan Demme’s quirky, snowballing 1980s comedies <em>Something Wild</em> and <em>Married to the Mob</em>.</p>
<p id="yPWiUr">That isn’t Linklater’s vibe, though, and that isn’t this movie. Powell and Arjona make a powerfully sexy, charming pair, and Powell and Linklater find clever ways to enmesh the characters’ simmering romance in a tightening web of compromise, danger, and deceit without tipping into the crime movie clichés the movie is spoofing.</p>
<p id="7Zbi1w">The payoff is that perfect rom-com moment, the one that drew applause from a crowd of sleepy London critics. It’s a spectacularly conceived, written, and performed scene that plays out on two levels simultaneously: one in the fiery, hard-bitten dialogue, one in the flashing eyes, frantic gestures, and crackling chemistry of the two leads. In this moment, <em>Hit Man </em>joyously (and pointedly) unites the thrill of connection with the thrill of danger, and operates harmoniously as two films at once — the same way Gary is perhaps becoming two people at once.</p>

<p id="OmEcYj">It’s such a satisfying scene that it more than makes up for some slackness in the script elsewhere. Arjona’s part is underwritten, and as willing as Powell and Linklater are to ponder the big questions, they gloss over some of the moral implications of the storyline: Gary’s arguable gaslighting, Madison’s culpability and agency, and whether the police operation was wholesale entrapment in the first place.</p>
<p id="cnvK5l">There’s a darker side to this story and these characters, strongly hinted at by one surprisingly cruel late turn in the plot. Powell and Linklater nod to that darkness, but ultimately decide not to go there. Just as Gary can decide to turn himself into Ron, they can decide to steer this slippery movie into a sunnier place. <em>Hit Man </em>could have been a lot of different movies, and part of the joy of the film is in how playfully it gestures toward all those different potential versions of itself. But ultimately, that one perfect scene defines it as a great romantic comedy with a delicious bite. </p>

Moll and Lora were exclusive to the Mothra Tamagotchi, and until rhubarb_pie’s post, were just NPC nurses who would heal your little guy whenever it got sick—unless you used a “battery glitch” to play as them. Rhubarb_pie discovered how to unlock them naturally through gameplay.<br></p><p>“The way to get them is extremely obscure so I am not at all surprised they were never found until now,” they wrote in a post in the “Tamatown Forum” Discord. “Looking at it now, this looks like a bad schoolyard video game urban legend. But it is real.” In order to do it, you’ll need to raise a character called “Mothra Leo” with no “care mistakes” (like allowing its hunger or happiness bar to hit zero and ignore their calls for attention/help for more than 15 minutes), keep it to a specific weight, and wait about 80 hours. When Mother Leo dies, it will lay an egg that contains the twins Moll and Lora.<br></p><p>Rhubarb_pie described the process as “absolutely brutal,” saying that it took “about three weeks” IRL to successfully birth the twins. But the prospect of discovering new playable characters has the Discord incredibly excited, even if it’ll take some serious work to unlock them. Rhubarb pie wrote: “This pretty much blows open all other Tama devices for possible other extremely-well-hidden secrets,” they said. “I think this is the first time there’s been an actual raisable character that is completely undocumented, its existence not even hinted at. Something Tama fans always thought was possible, whispered about in hushed tones, but dared not dream of…”<br></p><p>The post also mentions another “undocumented secret character” they unearthed while digging through Mothra Tamagotchi’s source code: a Mothra grave, or the in-game sprite that pops up after a Mothra dies.

<p>As spotted by users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1da1tgx/what_the_hell_it_on_my_ps_store_page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Reddit</a>, New World: Aeternum appeared to show up on the PlayStation Store today, signaling a release on consoles.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the game will be releasing in mid-October on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. </p>



<p>Amazon Games’ New World is an open world MMORPG that launched in 2021. In 2023, the game eventually <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-season-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pivoted to a seasonal model</a>. Aeternum is the name of the central location that players explore in New World. The existing New World title is only available on PC.</p>



<p>New World: Aeternum’s appearance on the PlayStation Store included a sponsored promo image.  This gave fans a small glimpse of the potential art design. </p>



<p>Fans also reported today that Amazon quickly removed its brief appearance on the PlayStation Store. So, fans speculate that it slipped ahead of a major reveal at Summer Game Fest. </p>



<p>The Summer Game Fest event begins today, June 7, 2024, starting at 5 pm EST / 2 pm PT / 10 pm GMT. It will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">2 hours of gameplay showcases</a>. </p>



<p>A new report surfaced this week suggesting that a trailer for Summer Game Fest costs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-trailer-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$250,000 for one minute</a>. However, it would be an ideal place for Amazon Games to invest in a big reveal like New World: Aeternum coming to consoles.</p>



<p>At this time, Amazon Games has not officially confirmed anything about New World: Aeternum.</p>

Make your way through the mission, completing the first three major encounters where you can use a Rally Banner.

Hang a left and you'll move into a small dark alcove. Look up for a light on the wall--it marks a hole you can slip through. Jump up (you can use the door frame on your left for a boost) to get to the ledge, duck into the hole, and follow it into the darkness until you emerge on the other side into a small room that houses the prismatic chest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Lost_City">The Lost City</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Grace">Facet of Grace</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314404-destiny2facetofgracebluepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314404" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314404-destiny2facetofgracebluepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314404"></a><figcaption>Head toward the blue building to find the Prismatic chest in the area beyond.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314404-destiny2facetofgracebluepath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Go past Micah-10 and drop down into the Lost City. When you leave the Tower, turn right and cross the big gap to the blue building with orange lines on the rooftop. You'll find a path that goes around the blue building, with another building in front of you. Move around to the side to find an opening to go into the building, and the Prismatic chest inside. As you get close, you'll see a message noting that Omens have appeared, and some Dread enemies will spawn. Clear them--particularly the Weaver with the orange life bar. When it's dead, you'll see a message noting that a second Omen has arrived. You need to hunt it down and kill it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4314406-destiny2facetofgraceyellowpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314406" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4314406-destiny2facetofgraceyellowpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314406"></a><figcaption>Find the second Omen enemy by following the platforms marked in yellow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4314406-destiny2facetofgraceyellowpath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cross back to the area in front of the Tower entrance and go straight across to the platforms that are marked yellow. Kill all the enemies and the Weaver to trigger a third Omen spawning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314407-destiny2facetofgraceredpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314407" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314407-destiny2facetofgraceredpath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314407"></a><figcaption>The last Omen is down this red path.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314407-destiny2facetofgraceredpath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Return to the main area near the Tower and now cross to the red platform. Follow the path to one more set of enemies and one last Weaver. With the last one dead, you'll see a new message, noting the arrival of The One Foretold. Go back to the main area again and you'll find out what that is: a Tormentor.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, kill everything here. Doing enough damage to the Tormentor will trigger a shield generated by Bound enemies, so you'll need Transcendence to clear them out. Keep going until the Tormentor is dead and it drops a Prismatic key, and then return to the blue path to find the chest and open it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Mending___Outskirts__The_Lost_City">Facet of Mending - Outskirts, The Lost City</h3><p dir="ltr">This chest has a bit of a run-up to find it, involving locating several lost Ghosts hidden in the area. First, load into the Tower transmat zone and head toward the Lost City. You want to jump over the rooftops and move all the way to the west; you're backtracking through the first area you crossed when you came through the portal during the campaign. When you hit the Outskirts area, you'll find a mess of Hive attacking you as you walk through a small garden courtyard ringed by buildings and shops. The exit will be on your right, but don't leave through that archway yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, listen for the notification sound your Ghost makes when there's something scannable nearby. If you pull your Ghost out and you're near what you're looking for, the Ghost will turn toward the object you're searching for. The first one is up on the arm holding a sign that attaches to the wall in an alley to the left of the exit archway. Hop up on top of it and use the Activate button to pick up your first Ghost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314402-20240606171900_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314402-20240606171900_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314402"></a><figcaption>The first Ghost shell is out of the way on top of these sign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314402-20240606171900_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Continue through the Outskirts. Next, you'll reach the edge of this area. Crossing the big gap ahead are four square platforms. Instead of crossing them, go to the edge and look down to find scaffolds and a staircase. Drop down and you'll find the next Ghost on a box next to the stairs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314403-destiny2ghostshell2lostcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314403" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314403-destiny2ghostshell2lostcity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314403"></a><figcaption>Drop down to this scaffold and look for the Ghost shell on a crate under the stairs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314403-destiny2ghostshell2lostcity.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cross the gap to continue. You'll enter a new building and drop down. When you get through and go back outside, turn around and face the door you just passed through. There's an awning above the door that you can jump up onto, where another Ghost waits.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314401-20240606172255_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314401-20240606172255_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314401"></a><figcaption>Jump up on this awning to find the Ghost shell waiting on a box.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314401-20240606172255_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Keep following the path and you'll find another Ghost just beneath the big tree you pass through. Head to the amber-colored metallic piece of architecture you pass beneath. Hop up onto it to find the Ghost nestled against the ring.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314400-20240606172426_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314400-20240606172426_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314400"></a><figcaption>The final Ghost shell is under the orange ring stuck in the tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314400-20240606172426_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the other side of the big tree, you'll see a Pyramid tech structure with a pressure plate in the middle and the Ghosts you just found ringed around it. Stand on the plate to summon a mess of Dread enemies. You'll fight four different waves as the plate charges up, culminating with a Subjugator. Once you damage it enough, Bound Dread enemies will appear, so you'll need to stand on the nearby Prismatic well to charge up Transcendence and break their shields and make the Subjugator vulnerable again. Repeat that process one more time when the Subjugator becomes invulnerable again, and when it dies, it'll drop a key to the Prismatic chest next to the big Ghost.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Landing">The Landing</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Justice">Facet of Justice</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314409-20240605230942_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314409" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314409-20240605230942_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314409"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314409-20240605230942_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This Prismatic chest is hidden in the crystal cave area you passed through during the campaign. From The Landing transmat zone, head to the left and make your way along the cliff to the caves, then follow the path until you find a round side room with two floors and a big Solar crystal at the top.</p><p dir="ltr">When you pick up the crystal, Hive runes will appear around the room. You'll also have three runes beneath the crystal. Each of the runes around the room corresponds to a pedestal where you can place the crystal, so your goal here is to place the crystal in each of the pedestals in the order they appear vertically, from top to bottom.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314410-destiny2facetofjustice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314410" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314410-destiny2facetofjustice.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314410"></a><figcaption>You'll need to remember the three runes stacked beneath the crystals, identify where they are around the room, and place the crystal in each corresponding location to unlock the chest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314410-destiny2facetofjustice.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trouble is, if you jump into the center of the room so you can see the runes, they'll disappear and Dread enemies will spawn to attack you. To see where you need to take the crystal, you need to look through the opening near where the crystal appears and count the pedestals to find the corresponding one. Shadow Thralls will appear to bother you as you do so, but they're not too big of a deal.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time you place the crystal, you'll have to fight a bunch of enemies, culminating in a couple of Ogres and Dread enemies. As usual, some Bound forces will appear to lend shields to the bosses, so you'll need to use Transcendence to clear them out in order to finish everything off. Grab the key when you're done to open the Prismatic chest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Refraction">The Refraction</h2><h3 id="Facet_of_Awakening___Memory__Refractions_of_Light">Facet of Awakening - Memory: Refractions of Light</h3><p>Unlike many of the other Prismatic chests, the Memory of Light chests require you to earn five Vestiges of Light items from around the Pale Heart. You can find these by venturing into Cysts as part of the Alone in the Dark quest you get from Micah-10, and from the Light Offering chests you find in areas where Overthrow events are taking place. When you get five Vestiges of Light, they'll combine to become a Memory item, which will unlock a new search area on the map of the Pale Heart in the Director. Head to that area and look around to find the Prismatic chest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314426-20240606002215_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314426" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314426-20240606002215_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314426"></a><figcaption>Climb up to find the Prismatic chest on the branches and vines above.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314426-20240606002215_1.jpg"></figure><p>The search zone for Refractions of Light will take you to The Refraction.

How you open the chest isn't immediately obvious, though; the puzzle you need to solve is hidden nearby.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314411-20240606160731_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314411" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314411-20240606160731_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314411"></a><figcaption>You can jump through the holes in this wall to find the generators you need to charge up to unlock the Prismatic chest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314411-20240606160731_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Just past the chest on the side of the hallway is a wall of panels, some of which have fallen off to open holes through the wall. Find a hole big enough to pass through and you'll find several pieces of Fallen technology, including a computer terminal and two generators. If you interact with the terminal, you can summon a Scorch Cannon--use it to blast the terminals to break the ice locking you out from using them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314412-20240606160721_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314412-20240606160721_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314412"></a><figcaption>Use this terminal to call a Scorch Cannon, which can destroy the ice and release the energy orbs you need to charge up the generators.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314412-20240606160721_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trick here is to find orbs of energy to fully charge the generators. The energy orbs you need to find are also stuck in piles of ice, scattered around the nearby area. You'll need to hike around to find them a bit. One is just on the other side of the Prismatic chest, but you'll have to jump off the walkway and explore the side area to find it at the end of the room, on a platform. The others are down the halls in both directions away from the chest and in side rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll find two Solar orbs, three Arc orbs, and two Void orbs. Each orb provides a different amount of energy to the generator, which is measured by green units that light up on the generator when you dunk them. Your goal here is to charge each generator fully, which is 10 units, without going over.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to solve the puzzle on your own, skip this next bit. If not, you'll want to know that <span data-embed-type="spoiler">Arc orbs provide two power units, Solar orbs provide three units, and Void orbs provide four units. Therefore, you want to plug in two Solar and two Arcs in one generator, and two Void and one Arc in the other generator.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Once both generators are fully charged, you'll need to fight a bunch of Dread enemies, including a Subjugator, to get the key and open the chest.</p><h3 id="Facet_of_Honor___Memory__Divisive_Darkness">Facet of Honor - Memory: Divisive Darkness</h3><p>Like the Memories of Light, Memories of Darkness require you to gather five Vestiges of Darkness in order to create a memory item that unlocks a search area in the Pale Heart. You can get Vestiges of Darkness by solving and opening corrupted chests in Overthrow areas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314428-20240607001925_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314428" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314428-20240607001925_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314428"></a><figcaption>Corrupted chests look like this, and solving them will get you a Vestige of Darkness.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314428-20240607001925_1.jpg"></figure><p>To find the chest for the Divisive Darkness memory, make your way to frozen mountain in The Divide. You'll need to climb all the way up to the top of the mountain. When you hit the peak, look off the side of the structures at the edge of the cliff on the right when you're facing the path into the facility. The Prismatic chest is waiting for you near the nice view.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314429-20240606174529_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314429" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314429-20240606174529_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314429"></a><figcaption>Drop down over the edge of the buildings at the top of the mountain in The Divide to find this chest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314429-20240606174529_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Transgression">The Transgression</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Facet_of_Defiance">Facet of Defiance</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314396-20240606231549_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314396" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314396-20240606231549_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314396"></a><figcaption>Look for the cave on the north side of The Transgression.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314396-20240606231549_1.jpg"></figure><p>Start at the transmat zone in The Impasse and head east into The Transgression. Keep moving forward until you reach a valley with a statue of a Guardian in the center with a spike going through their chest. From the statue, turn left and you'll see a cave ahead with an orange glow. If you head in, you'll find the air is toxic and you'll take damage. This mechanic shows up all through the campaign, so you'll be familiar with it. You need to stand next to and shoot the Darkness seed near the entrance to the cave to gain a buff that protects you from the toxic air, and keep refreshing it while you're in the cave whenever the timer runs out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314398" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314398"></a><figcaption>Seek out and destroy these Eyes of Suffering to drop the shields on the enemies so you can take them out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4314398-20240606231908_1.jpg"></figure><p>Push all the way to the back of the cave to find the Prismatic chest. Find the triangular splinter object in the middle of the room and activate it. Enemies with invulnerable shields will spawn in. Avoid them since they're invulnerable, and instead, look for the round Taken Acolyte Eyes scattered throughout. You need to find the eyes, which are a bit hidden, and destroy them all to make the enemies become vulnerable so you can kill them.</p><p>Repeat the process of finding and killing the Eyes three times. Each time, more shielded enemies will spawn, making the sprint to find the Eyes a little more frantic each time. When they're all dead, a bunch of Dread enemies will appear, along with a Tormentor. You'll need to use Transcendence to make the Tormentor vulnerable, but once that happens, you can take it down to get your Prismatic chest key.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape guide hub</a> for tons more information about everything to find in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe is a satirical take on our own, asking what things would be like if we took spreading managed democracy and the values that come with that lifestyle to the extreme. However, Super Earth has just revealed an in-universe fact that’s more harrowing than hilarious. </p> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">When you play a mission in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, your squad has a set number of reinforcements. It’s pretty standard because we all know that at least a few of our soldiers are going to be killed, churned up by the endless onslaught of Terminids and Automatons. What you might not consider is how much those deaths cost. Not how much the bill Super Earth foots is, but the bill the poor Helldiver’s family pays to see whatever’s left of their loved one. </p>
 <h2 id="h-dead-helldivers-are-just-another-revenue-stream-for-the-relentless-super-earth" data-injectable="false">Dead Helldivers are just another revenue stream for the relentless Super Earth</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">Following perhaps the most impactful event in <em>Helldivers 2</em> history, the collapse of Meridia into a black hole, <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798363487258710165" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Earth put out a message</a> commemorating those brave soldiers who had lost their lives fighting to make this happen. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The Terminid Supercolony could not have been destroyed without the brave sacrifice of many, many Helldivers.</p><p>In their honor, this personalized memorandum has been issued to their designated next-of-kin. We will always remember [Helldiver Name]. <a href="https://t.co/fHLljtbKTo">pic.twitter.com/fHLljtbKTo</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798363487258710165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">The message is perfect because it’s filled with sections with options that are obviously meant to be chosen from instead of sent in this form. The point that stuck out to me is the customary fee for a Helldiver corpse, helmet, or limb that’s usually charged. This is most likely because every body on Meridia was ionized when the black hole was created. </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">In this one and only case, Super Earth is waiving the transportation fee so families can see the scraps of their loved one return from the front lines. The rest of the time, these families are charged for this service, though, meaning your spouse might get a fair pay packet for fighting for Super Earth, but all your savings will need to be spent bringing pieces of them back from a hostile alien world just to bury them. </p>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">This is incredibly dystopian and fits the <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe incredibly well, but it just stood out to me as something we can point to that shows how capitalism really has gone too far in this universe. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charging Helldivers for new equipment by using a currency they can only earn from battling aliens</a> for Super Earth is one thing, but it feels like you’re taking the piss with an already captive market when you start charging for repatiration. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false">I couldn’t tell you how much delivering a Helldiver’s had across the galaxy costs, but I looked it up, and repatriation to the UK is about £3,600 and that’s without space travel, so it’s probably a lot more. Considering that Super Earth potentially <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-may-have-been-given-an-impossible-major-order-to-boost-recruitment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set Helldivers an impossible objective to boost recruitment numbers</a>, this all feels a lot like a tactic to boost income instead of spreading more democracy. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-adds-five-classic-mega-man-games.892386/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-mega-man<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has added five classic&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and they're available to enjoy right now if you're a subscriber.</p>
<p>The first five numbered&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games for the Game Boy, which were originally released between 1991 and 1994, are now on Nintendo Switch Online as part of a basic subscription, so you won't even need the Expansion Pack to enjoy them.</p>
<p>What's more, these games aren't available as part of any of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Legacy Collection&nbsp;</em>compilations. They were available on the Nintendo 3DS eShop, but since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wii-u-and-nintendo-3ds-eshops-are-being-discontinued">that service has been discontinued</a>, Nintendo Switch Online is pretty much the only (entirely legal) way to enjoy them on modern hardware.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-classic-mega-man-game-boy.jpg?itok=NznUuzOx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-classic-mega-man-game-boy.jpg?itok=-xWi1eNc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Five - count 'em, five - classic&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games are now available with Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption></figure><p>The Game Boy&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>titles generally offer stages, bosses, and enemies that also feature in the main NES&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>series, although&nbsp;<em>Mega Man 5&nbsp;</em>features a set of original bosses.</p>
<p>Four of the Game Boy titles were developed by Minakuchi Engineering, which also worked on the SNES version of&nbsp;<em>Mega Man X3</em>, as well as the Game Boy version of&nbsp;<em>Bionic Commando</em>, another Capcom platformer.</p>
<p><em>Mega Man 2</em>, on the other hand, was given to&nbsp;<em>Sokoban&nbsp;</em>publisher Thinking Rabbit, although Capcom would return to Minakuchi for the following three games in the Game Boy series after&nbsp;<em>Mega Man 2</em>'s quality didn't quite come up to par for the studio.</p>
<p>In any case, if you're already a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber, you can give all five games a try right now, and if you've never played a&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game before, they'll certainly make for an interesting introduction to the series.</p>

<p>These&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>games are part of a long list of Game Boy titles available on Nintendo Switch Online. That list also includes classics like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-launch"><em>Super Mario World</em></a>, Capcom's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-zelda-july"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Oracle&nbsp;</em>games</a>, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can also enjoy SNES and NES games if you're a subscriber, and if you fork out for the Expansion Pack, you'll also get access to a range of Sega Genesis, Game Boy Advance, and N64 titles.</p>
<p>You can grab a Nintendo Switch Online subscription right now via the Nintendo eShop.</p>

    <p><span>Firefly and Jade join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Farewell, Penacony,” will launch on June 19, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [162 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-888606"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update introduces the highly anticipated Stellaron Hunter, Firefly, as well as a significant figure from the IPC, Jade. Additionally, under the guidance of Mr. Screwllum, the new update in the Simulated Universe, “Divergent Universe” will be unveiled as well.</p><p>With the abrupt termination of the Charmony Festival, The Family’s reputation is in tatters, with numerous delicate issues urgently demanding attention. In response, aside from the Oak Family, the major lineages are preparing their strategies to address the aftermath. In the Version 2.3 Trailblaze Mission, the Express Crew will be invited aboard the Radiant Feldspar, soaring into the skies above Penacony to witness crucial Family discussions firsthand.</p><p>Meanwhile, aboard the Radiant Feldspar, a new project within the Simulated Universe, “Divergent Universe” will be conducted under the guidance of Mr. Screwllum, utilizing technology from his home planet to bring gameplay improvements. For instance, the “Arithmetic Mapping” function in the Divergent Universe testing removes character download limitations. If a character’s level is below the current Equilibrium Level Cap, it will automatically increase to meet the cap. The update also introduces the “Equation” feature, where combining buffs from two different Paths grants corresponding combat abilities once the required amount is achieved. Additionally, when facing defeat in the Divergent Universe, Trailblazers can now restart challenges without needing to force-stop the game. With the new Restart Challenge option, players can regroup and give it another shot, allowing for more strategy and playability, as well as providing a richer, more fun gaming experience.</p><p>In Version 2.3, Origami Birds will also make their way onto the Radiant Feldspar, bringing a new mini-game. In this arcade challenge, Trailblazers must achieve eliminations within a set number of moves to boost the birds’ Combat Power. During the “Origami Bird Clash” event, Trailblazers can not only participate in Story Challenges, but also freely battle friends from across the universe!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Aside from gameplay updates, the 5-star character Firefly will also join the team as a playable character, fighting alongside the Trailblazers. Firefly is a member of the Stellaron Hunters, originating from the long-destroyed world of Glamoth. Once a prosperous and expansive empire, Glamoth was annihilated by the Swarm. Firefly, a young girl encased in mechanical armor known as “SAM,” was created as a weapon and suffers from Entropy Loss Syndrome due to genetic modification. Driven by the quest to find meaning in life and to defy fate, she joined the Stellaron Hunters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_888611"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As a 5-star Fire-Type character, Firefly possesses an immense power. After using her Technique, she can summon her SAM armor and leap into the air, moving freely, with SAM attacking all enemies within a set range to enter battle. Each wave of enemies can have Fire Weakness forced upon units without Fire Weakness, lasting for a set number of turns. In the heat of battle, SAM will be operating in two forms. In the initial form, using her Skill consumes HP but simultaneously replenishes her Ultimate energy. The less HP Firefly has, the less damage she sustains. Furthermore, when activating her Ultimate, SAM transforms into its second battle form — the dazzling Complete Combustion state! Alongside more potent Basic Attacks and Skills, her Speed and Weakness Break efficiency are also heightened. The Break DMG dealt by SAM is increased until the countdown for Complete Combustion ends. An aspect worth mentioning is that this state provides players with an immersive perspective from within Sam’s mech, showcasing Firefly’s unwavering gaze and embodying the fiery spirit capable of setting the seas ablaze.</p><p>Another Quantum-Type 5-star character, Jade, is set to make her distinguished debut. As a senior manager in the IPC Strategic Investment Department and one of the Ten Stonehearts, she is recognized by her Cornerstone, “Jade of Credit.” Cold and elegant, Jade is a skilled moneylender with a keen understanding of the human heart. Her personal hobby, “Bonajade Exchange,” highlights her patience in waiting for high-value acquisitions through accepting pawning of assets and her ability to extract value from seemingly destitute clients.</p><p>Jade’s Skill allows her to forge a binding agreement with a single ally, making them her “Debt Collector” and bestowing upon them enhancement. Each attack launched by Jade or her Debt Collector accumulates Charges for Jade. Once fully charged, Jade unleashes a follow-up attack against all enemies. Her Ultimate, however, enforces the terms of the agreement with unyielding precision, dealing damage to all enemies while also enhancing her follow-up attack.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the limited 5-star characters — Ruan Mei and Argenti — will make their appearances in the Warps during the first and second halves of Version 2.3, respectively. Their formidable strength ensures they will remain powerful allies in your future adventures. Finally, please stay tuned for the upcoming Summer Game Fest 2024. At this grand mid-year gaming carnival, Honkai: Star Rail will make an appearance alongside numerous top-tier global games, giving players an exclusive preview of the next chapter in the galactic adventure.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [20,281 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

<p>A Civilization VII banner has appeared on the 2K Games website ahead of its Summer Game Fest announcement.</p>



<p>The information that Civilization VII would be announced at Summer Game Fest was provided to content creators and media earlier this week. The <a href="https://www.2k.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> does direct users to a trailer and wishlist, which are currently not live.</p>



<p>In mid-May, 2K Games announced it would announce the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-announcement-soon-june-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next iteration of one of its ‘biggest and most beloved’ franchises</a> during Summer Game Fest. Many speculated that the series could be Marfia, Bioshock, or Borderlands, but those rumors have seemingly been squashed. </p>



<p>In 2016, it was reported that the Civilization series had sold over 33 million copies, with over 1 billion hours played. However, more recent numbers are yet to be provided, but sales are expected to be well over 50 million.</p>



<p>What do you think of Civilization VII? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge concurrent player numbers on Steam, and is currently the eighth most-played game on Valve’s platform all-time with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents. Player numbers have declined since that peak, however, with Steam concurrents hovering around the 10,000 mark in recent weeks.</p><p>A console release would certainly provide a boost, and a confirmation seems imminent after the official New World X/Twitter account teased “an exciting announcement” for Summer Game Fest, which kicks off today, June 7, at 2pm Pacific / 5pm Eastern / 10pm UK.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— New World (@playnewworld) <a href="https://twitter.com/playnewworld/status/1798784534584152243?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Questions remain, however. The PlayStation Store insert is for a game called New World Aeternum, whereas the Steam version is simply called New World. Perhaps the console version is a different game entirely, or Aeternum is the name of a new expansion that will replace the original name across all versions.</p><p>Or, New World Aeternum may mark a new beginning for the MMO, similar to Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn. Fans are also wondering whether New World is also set for Xbox Series X and S, given the insert was spotted on the PlayStation Store.</p><p><em>Image credit: OMG_R3A11Y / Reddit.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Anyone who's got kids will be aware of the worries about them being drawn into TikTok and other addictive phone apps. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">Board games</a> offer the perfect antidote. They’re enthralling, face-to-face, and social, and most of them don’t involve using a screen at all. But when it comes to picking out titles for them to play, the marketplace is absolutely dominated by mass-market producers who favor glossy advertising over great gameplay.</p><p>Delving into the hobby market is the obvious answer, but here you have the opposite problem: dozens of worthy titles that look about as exciting as a brown box with a glum man on the cover. Fortunately, more and more designers and publishers are discovering the importance of serving the kids’ market and the last few years have seen a glut of great-looking, fast-playing games. Below are our picks for the best -- but also check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">best family board games</a> for ideas that are fun for everyone, regardless of age.</p><h3>TLDR: Best Board Games for Kids</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/E3EjX" target="_blank">The Color Monster</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/P25py" target="_blank">Dragomino</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jBj42" target="_blank">Animal Upon Animal Junior</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdd37?_ga=657280166.1701788289" target="_blank">First Orchard</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/8BBPq?_ga=657280166.1701788289" target="_blank">Outfoxed</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/rwbNX" target="_blank">Unlock!

The Color Monster, based on a <a href="https://zdcs.link/y2rDP" target="_blank">popular children’s book</a>, achieves this but also helps with emotional development. On your turn, you roll a die and move to land on a color space, then talk about the emotion that’s associated with that color. Afterwards, there’s a simple memory element to place the emotion in the correct jar as a step toward a cooperative win. Adults have to take turns too, of course, making this a wonderful platform for sharing your feelings and experiences with your kids.</p><h3>Dragomino</h3><div id="155418"><p><h3>Dragonimo</h3></p></div><p>Children’s versions of popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family board games</a> often aren’t worth the time over their bigger siblings but Dragomino, a spin-off of <a href="https://zdcs.link/n6wxD" target="_blank">Kingdomino</a>, does something special. Your goal is to build a map in traditional domino-style, winning dragon eggs if your piece placement matches the ends of one or more adjacent dominos. So it’s possible for a good placement to get you several eggs, which may contain baby dragons for your victory tally. It’s a very simple framework yet it makes basic strategy play accessible to preschool children, an impressive and unusual achievement.  It's a great <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-5-year-olds">board game for 5 year olds</a> if that's what you're looking for.</p><h3>Animal Upon Animal Junior</h3><p>Once kids have developed a little dexterity, at around age three, the wonderful world of stacking games opens up. Animal Upon Animal is a great place to start and is fine fun for adults too. A die roll decides who gets to choose an animal shape and who will stack it. Cause the pile to fall, and you must take some of the toppled animals: first to clear their pieces wins. It's the shapes that really make this game, a brilliant set of designs that open up a myriad of stacking options that reward clever play.</p><h2>First Orchard</h2><div id="201799"><p><h3>HABA First Orchard</h3></p></div><p>This is a super-simple cooperative race game against a cute wooden raven that’s so straightforward that even very small kids can play it by themselves. On your turn, you roll a die and either take a brightly-coloured wooden fruit of the corresponding colour or advance the raven if its icon comes up. Your goal is to pick all the fruit before the raven reaches the end of its track, which is short to make for a quick game. The rules are easy, the components are gorgeous, and it’s cooperative so it doesn’t feel too bad when you loose. Best of all, there’s one really simple strategic choice to make to increase your chances of winning in a largely random game, and it’s a lovely moment when your kids finally figure it out.
</p><h2>Outfoxed</h2><div id="161850"><p><h3>Outfoxed</h3></p></div><p>Kids love working things out based on simple clues, it makes them feel super-smart, and Outfoxed lets them play as chicken detectives, trying to identify which of sixteen dastardly fox culprits stole the pie! There’s an exciting push your luck dice roll mechanic to either turn over suspect cards or get a clue, but if you fail the roll, the fox piece moves instead, and you’ll lose if he gets away. Clues come in the form of inserting tokens into a neat widget that tells you whether the suspect has a particular item of clothing or other identifying feature, so it’s a Guess Who style race to flip over the suspect cards and eliminate them to find the truth before the criminal escapes.
</p><h2>Board Games for Elementary School-Age Kids</h2><h3>Unlock! Kids: Detective Stories</h3><div id="196147"><p><h3>Unlock! Kids: Detective Stories</h3></p></div><p>Escape Rooms are very popular at the moment, especially with kids, and there’s a burgeoning genre of board games that essentially provide the same kinds of puzzles in a one-shot box. The Unlock series is one of the more popular, and it now includes this fantastic entry aimed at younger players. The puzzles are simpler, there’s no timed element and no “failure” - you just keep trying until you get the answer. And the three scenarios, set across a farm, a funfair and a haunted house, are written to draw in young imaginations. It’s a great series of challenges that will fill kids with a real sense of accomplishment once they’ve solved all the riddles and made it out.</p><h3>Kids Chronicles: Quest for the Moon Stones</h3><div id="196146"><p><h3>Kids Chronicles: Quest for the Moon Stones</h3></p></div><p>This is an app-driven game, so you’ll need a screen to play, which might be a little controversial if you’re trying to steer the kids away from electronic devices. But the app is excellent and is incorporated seamlessly into a cooperative experience that will see the players working together to come up with a plan to find the legendary moon stones, so it can be a good incentive to encourage kids to get involved. It’s a junior version of the very adult Chronicles of Crime series. Players have to scan 3d scenes on the phone, identifying characters and objects they can use as clues, which will propel them through an unfolding narrative. It’s a simple mystery, but it’s very engaging for kids, especially given the great writing, graphics and sound of the app element.</p><h3>Valley of the Vikings</h3><div id="155419"><p><h3>Valley of the Vikings</h3></p></div><p>Dexterity meets tactical puzzling in this bizarre yet entertaining bowling game. The aim is to push a large ball into a group of colored barrels. For each barrel you knock over, the corresponding player piece is advanced down a pier track toward the water. What you’re trying to do is dunk other players in the sea while keeping yours dry. The tactics come from the fact that your reward when another player goes swimming depends on the icon above your own space. So, sometimes you want to advance your own piece after all, sometimes not, and sometimes a clumsy ball flick leaves you with no choice in the matter.</p><h3>Andor the Family Fantasy Game</h3><div id="155420"><p><h3>Andor</h3></p></div><p>Adventure games tend toward the longer and more complex end of the spectrum, and that’s a shame because it’s a theme that kids really dig. Andor aims to redress that with a straightforward yet fun and varied quest framework. Players choose a class and try and complete random missions while a dragon slowly makes its way toward the capital city. If it gets there before you’ve delved into the dungeon and rescued the cute wolf cubs therein, it’s game over. You can push it back by battling its minions, but that diverts efforts from those all-important quests, giving players a basic priority balancing strategy to work with.</p><h2>Kittin</h2><div id="201800"><p><h3>Alley Cat Games Kittin</h3></p></div><p>Children of this age tend to love dexterity games, not least because their fast reflexes and nimble fingers mean they can compete and win against clumsy adults, and Kittin (it comes in a tin, geddit?) is a fast, simple stacking game with a theme that’s guaranteed to appeal. You flip a card off a stack showing a pile of cats, and then you’ve got to grab the correct pieces and be first to stack them in an identical shape to win the card. Three cards wins the game, but be careful: if you get the arrangement wrong or your stack falls, you’re out of the round. The cutesy, irregularly shaped wooden cats make this harder than it sounds, and as a bonus that eight player capacity makes it great for sleepovers. For extra tweenage cachet there’s a <a href="https://www.alleycatgames.com/product-page/pusheen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pusheen branded version</a> coming soon.</p><h2>Board Games for Middle School-Age Kids</h2><h3>My Lil’ Everdell</h3><div id="196148"><p><h3>My Lil’ Everdell</h3></p></div><p>The original Everdell won a lot of acclaim thanks to its combination of rich worker placement strategy and incredibly cute artwork featuring anthropomorphic animals. That latter aspect has clear family appeal, so the rules and strategies have been simplified, and the cute art made even more cute for this slimmed-down family version. Players send their friends out into the meadow to pick up resources, which they can then spend to recruit other cards into their burgeoning community. Some give instant bonuses, others permanent round-by-round extras. Between them, they allow players to construct basic engines and build an ongoing strategy. It’s a fantastic introduction to the wider world of worker placement and engine games, offered in incredibly appealing clothes.</p><h3>Horrified</h3><div id="155421"><p><h3>Horrified: Universal Monsters</h3></p></div><p>Don’t be fooled by the theme: this is based on classic Universal monster movies of the ’50s and is even less scary than they were. So it’s a great way for kids to face their fears as they work together to overcome some hokey horror foes. Players must move around the town and collect items necessary to defeat the selection of monsters they’ve chosen to face. There are six to pick from, each with different powers and requirements to defeat. But beware, as you’re not the only targets: you’ll also need to protect wandering villagers and guide them to safety. And when the kids are done, this is a pretty <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">good horror board game</a> for adults, too.</p><h3>Zombie Kidz: Evolution</h3><div id="155426"><p><h3>Zombie Kidz Evolution</h3></p></div><p>At first, this seems too simple for this age bracket. Players move their characters over the school map, eliminating zombies. If they can meet and lock the gates against the zombie horde before being overrun, they win. But as each scenario is passed, the real magic of the game unfolds. This is a "legacy" style game for kids, where each game adds to a growing narrative. Your choices also make your copy unique with pens and stickers and unlockable envelopes of new rules and other content. It's a wild ride of imaginative customization that children will love.</p><p>That's all we have right now for kids, but if you want to keep climbing through the years, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-teens">best board games for teens</a>.</p><h2>When Is The Best Time to Buy Board Games in 2024?</h2><p>If you love board games, it can unfortunately be a rather expensive hobby.

            <p>Good news, Mega Man mega fans – five Game Boy Mega Man games have just joined the Nintendo Switch Online library.</p>
<p>In a Nintendo Online Switch update published to YouTube this morning, Nintendo confirmed that "the original five Game Boy Mega Man titles" are now playable to those with an NSO subscription: Mega Man: Dr Wily's Revenge, Mega Man 2, Mega Man 3, Mega Man 4, and – yes, you've guessed it – Mega Man 5.</p>

<p>Mega Man's first titular outing popped up on a Nintendo-flavoured console in 1987, but Mega Man: Dr Wily's Revenge – a handheld remake of Mega Man 1 and 2 – didn't debut on Game Boy until 1991.</p>
<p>The remake of Mega Man 2 and 3 was sold as Mega Man 2 on Game Boy in the same year, while Mega Man 3 bundled together Mega Man 3 and 4 in 1992.</p>
<p>The pattern continues with Mega Man 4 and Mega Man 5 being sold together as Mega Man 4 in 1993, although 1994's Mega Man 5 was exactly that – just Mega Man 5.</p>
<p>Last month, as Game Boy passed its 35th birthday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-game-boy-classic-added-to-nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo added the legendary Super Mario Land, Breakout puzzle clone Alleyway, and Baseball.</a></p>

			<p>The Unreal Engine 5.4 is capable of producing some impressive visuals, but they can take a toll on performance, even on powerful GPUs.</p>
<p>In a new video showcasing the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/9VpwR/scans-abandoned-manor-ruins-in-a-dark-wood">Abandoned Manor Tech Demo</a> by SCANS, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> shows how beautiful the demo looks at 4K native resolution and hardware Lumen, which is enabled as part of Epic settings. Unfortunately, at these settings, even the RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 30 FPS in certain scenarios. Performance is definitely more acceptable at 1440p resolution, as even at Epic settings, the RTX 4080 can run the demo at above 60 frames per second most of the time, even hitting the 80 FPS mark in certain scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.4 Abandoned Manor Tech Demo - A Glimpse Into Next-Gen Graphics | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VrinSa-1unk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.4 is the latest version of the game development engine by Epic. Released <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-out-now-60fps-performance-improvements-shader-compliation/">last month</a>, it introduced a variety of improvements, including the new Nanite Adaptive Tessellation option, Heterogenous Volumes, which can produce realistic and dynamic smoke and clouds, improved Temporal Super Resolution upscaling, easier implementation of AI and machine learning tools, performance and shared compilation improvements and much more.</p>
<p><em>“With many developers targeting 60 Hz experiences, we’ve invested significant effort into improving rendering performance in UE 5.4. This includes refactoring the systems to enable a greater degree of parallelization, as well as adding GPU instance culling to hardware ray tracing, which also now benefits from additional primitive types and an optimized Path Tracer. Further optimizations have been made to shader compilation, resulting in a notable improvement in project cook times.”</em></p>
<p>Additional information on the Unreal Engine 5.4 can be found on its official website.</p>

<p data-characters="193" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fortnite</em> is well known for hosting a bunch of different game modes these days, but fans of the game are begging Epic to bring back the ultra-popular <em>Imposters</em> mode which was based on <em>Among Us</em>. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">With Battle Royale, <em>LEGO Fortnite</em>, <em>Rocket Racing</em>, and <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, Epic Games has served up a smorgasbord of ways to play the game, in an attempt to keep as many gamers as possible inside their ecosystem at all times. For <em>Fortnite</em> fans, however, it’s the <em>Among Us</em>-inspired <em>Imposters</em> that they want to see. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">Added in August 2021, we were able to enjoy it for a full year until Epic removed it in 2022. Two years on, we haven’t heard anything about it since, and want that to change.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption><em>Imposters</em> was all about trickery. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">“I don’t know why they ever removed it,” wrote HypixL on Reddit. “It was fun and really good for grinding XP if you missed most of the season.” Alexfrizzell agreed, stating: “I was devastated when they removed it. I know it was quite glitchy at times but it was still really fun, sometimes the glitches made it even more fun.”</p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Some even enjoyed it more than the original, with Sto_Nerd stating that their “friend group never got into <em>Among Us</em> but we all loved <em>Imposters,</em>” while The Cartel100 simply stated that it was “way better than <em>Among Us</em>.”</p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="false">Despite the love for the mode, Epic has been silent about it ever since vaulting it in August 2022. There’s been no talk of a return, even amongst leakers, which makes it seem like it may have been removed for good. For me though, I agree with the commentors about—I liked <em>Imposters</em> even more than <em>Among Us</em>, and with so many other modes now in the game, it would be the perfect next addition to <em>Fortnite</em>‘s growing roster. </p>

		<p>What a week it’s been! I’ve put myself through the wringer by racing in an open-water triathlon in the midst of a hailstorm, so I’m pretty weary right now. What that does mean is I’ve had a good dose of time to sit and relax, and Fabledom has been at the top of the relaxation charts. Alongside that, I’m checking out Star Wars Hunters, and I’ve been ambling my way through various bits on PC as well as making a start on the new Elder Scrolls Online chapter.</p>

<p>Tuffcub has been playing Destiny 2. Obvs. And that’s even more true with The Final Shape finally dropping this week. His thoughts on it will be along soon.</p>
<p>Aran has been playing #Blud for review but can’t say any more than that until the 17th. He’s also been playing SteamWorld Dig, saying, “I’m enjoying it. Just digging away, finding resources and completing some little platforming sections.”</p>
<p>Gamoc has played some Dredge (excellent), some Fallout New Vegas (excellent), some Xdefiant (fine), some Stranded: Alien Dawn (good), and some The Walking Dead Saints and Sinners (excellent). He also got Warhammer 40k Rogue Trader, saing, “It is fantastic, but has crashed on me three times so far in 16 hours.”</p>


<p>Nick P has played a bit of Killer Klowns, Dead by Daylight and got the plat on Stellar Blade. Meanwhile Ade has also been playing all the XDefiant, and is “absolutely loving it! And it’s free!” He didn’t just indulge in a bit of Ubisoft shooting either, as he also played Tails of Iron 2 for preview. He tells us, “So far, it’s looking every bit as good as its brilliant predecessor.”</p>
<p>Steve rattled through Immortals of Aveum, telling us “I enjoyed it for the most part although it started crashing on me towards the end. A perfectly fun mid-tier game that unfortunately cost AAA dollars to make. Alongside this I have been playing the chilled-out and meditative Hauntii which is 87% vibes and 13% knowing what you’re supposed to be doing! My kids and I have been working through the fantastic Lorelei and the Lazer Eyes for review (coming soon) and I can highly recommend that one. Finally I dug out the 3DS for a train journey and restarted Mario 3D Land which I don’t think I ever finished originally.”</p>
<p>Now then, what about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p>Hayley Atwell - known for her role as Peggy Carter in numerous Marvel projects - is set to voice Lara Croft in Netflix's upcoming Tomb Raider animation. While this has been known for a while now, we hadn't heard how the actress sounds in her new part. Until now.</p>
<p>In a sizzle reel shared by Netflix to promote the various animated shows on the streaming service, we finally hear Atwell's Lara speak. The show is set to take place after the events of the Tomb Raider Survivor trilogy, which comprised Tomb Raider (2013), Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider. </p>
<p>These games rebooted the Tomb Raider series, and served as an origin story for Lara. As such, this Lara was less assured than the Lara we were first introduced to back in the 90s. However, judging by the most recent Netflix trailer, Atwell is bringing back some of that iconic confidence to the character. You can check it out for yourself below, at around the 40 seconds mark.</p>

"More than 25 years after her first appearance, Lara Croft (voiced by Hayley Atwell) continues to explore ancient mysteries and uncover lost truths across breathtaking and dangerous destinations," Netflix teases.</p>

            <p>
Tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase marks the beginning of a weekend of announcements, filling the typical June slot the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">now-dead E3</a> used to fill.
</p>
<p>
But how much does a trailer in Geoff Keighley's showcase actually cost?
</p>
<p>
One industry insider told <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">Esquire</a>, as part of a report on Summer Game Fest, "Geoff's a black hole of information". Yet trailer costs have been revealed, and since corroborated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">Kotaku</a>.

<p>
Want a one minute trailer in the showcase? That'll be $250k in Keighley's pocket.
</p>
<p>
One and a half minutes jumps to $350k, two minutes is $450k, and two and a half minutes is $550k. A document obtained by Kotaku adds this money also includes a set number of social media posts.
</p>
<p>
Using these costs and last year's showcase, Esquire estimates Keighley made $9.65m. What's more, Keighley is the only person listed on his company's most recent LLC filings with the California Secretary of State, so it's unclear how many people work as part of Summer Game Fest.
</p>
<p>
As one PR professional said: "The current pricing tiers make Summer Game Fest an unattainable goal for most indie developers and publishers."
</p>
<p>
Yet Kotaku confirmed through a number of indie publishers and developers some "free slots" are provided to smaller, non-AAA games and studios. This is part of "earned editorial placements" that provide free airtime for certain projects.
</p>
<p>
However, these placements are also likely reserved for the biggest reveals from companies like Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo. Which begs the question: who exactly is paying these prices?
</p>
<p>
That's not all. Summer Game Fest continues after the showcase as a physical event. A biz dev partner badge for a day's access costs $500 - after approval. A private meeting cabana costs $50,000 for three days, including space for six people, table service, free parking, and six entry badges, or $20,000 per day. 
</p>
<p>
A "full hands-on pod" can also be purchased, including four large HDTVs and more, with publishers and developers able to spend more on custom venues and spaces.
</p>
<p>
On the flip side, one PR professional told Esquire that for "general brand awareness, the impact [of the showcase] is pretty huge", though this "depends on the placement and trailer length". "Longer slots perform better and seem to drive more coverage, whereas short trailers don't capture quite the same attention," they said.
</p>
<p>
Another marketing professional added fans can buy tickets to the showcases, suggesting revenue here could be used to lower the cost of entry for smaller clients. 
</p>
<p>
In a Twitch stream earlier this week ahead of the showcase, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-kingdom-hearts-and-more-wont-be-at-summer-game-fest">Keighley set expectations by specifying certain games that will and won't appear</a>. He described 2024 as a "lighter year" and said his excitement was an 8/10, which seems a little mean spirited to the developers spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to take part.

</p>
<p>
A big reason for the "lighter year", of course, are the thousands of layoffs that have rocked the games industry - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">layoffs have surpassed 10,000 for 2024 already</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-will-never-represent-our-industry-in-the-way-it-needs-so-what-next">Keighley was criticised after The Game Awards</a> last year for not acknowledging the layoffs or state of the industry. He did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-speeches-were-too-short-geoff-keighley-admits">admit afterwards that speeches were too short</a>, though there's no danger of a "please wrap it up" at Summer Game Fest.


</p>
<p>
Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest has spawned a number of other showcases</a> geared specifically towards indie games and minorities. We've got a list of all the showcases to check out, including not only events by Keighley, Microsoft and Ubisoft, but the Access-Ability showcase, Wholesome Direct, Women-Led Game Showcase and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, BioWare <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the official new title for the upcoming installment in the roleplaying game franchise. The studio decided to drop the previous title (<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dreadwolf</a>) to place a bigger emphasis on the player character and his seven companions rather than on the villain of the story.</p>
<p>The focus on companions appears clear everywhere in Dragon Age: The Veilguard.<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Speaking to IGN</a>, BioWare General Manager Gary McKay detailed the new companions' ability wheel players will encounter in combat.</p>
<p><em>As an RPG, strategy in combat is important as you bring two companions to every fight. Each companion brings unique powers and abilities that have a direct impact on how you choose to take down the enemies at hand. To add another layer to that strategic element, we’re introducing a new ability wheel where you can pause the action and set up your next move – whether it’s your companions’ abilities or your own.</em></p>
<p><em>The ability wheel opens up a huge amount of strategic possibilities, giving players the ability to control the flow of combat and link powerful combinations of abilities between players and their companions that can quickly turn the tide of any battle. We think we’ve found an exciting balance between fun, fluidity, and strategy for every encounter.</em></p>
<p>There's a couple of notable tidbits here. First, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is reducing the party size from four to three, explaining why the game will have fewer available companions than Inquisition (seven instead of nine). Secondly, while not outright confirmed, the ability wheel appears to corroborate the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor </a>that players would not be able to directly control party members. It sounds like it will be very similar to Mass Effect, which also featured a party of three characters with two companions that could be issued orders.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard will also remove any limitations on companion romances, pivoting from the previous franchise entry, where companions had gender and/or race preferences (and some of them, like Varric and Cole, could not be romanced at all).</p>
<p><em>We spent a lot of time making our companions feel authentic based on their own unique experiences within this larger fantasy world, which in turn makes the relationships you form with them feel even more meaningful. We’ve tapped into Dragon Age’s deep lore and explored its most iconic factions to bring each of the seven companions and their stories to life. As you accompany your companions to unravel their backstory and earn their loyalty and friendship, you’ll visit more regions of Thedas across a deeper variety of biomes than any Dragon Age before it.</em></p>
<p><em>I won’t spoil next week’s reveal but I can say we’ve created a story where you can impact the world and the companions that surround you. Player agency is important to the Dragon Age: The Veilguard experience and allows each player to form unique personal connections with their companions of choice. And, yes, you can romance the companions you want</em>.</p>
<p>The game will be finally revealed with a 15-minute video from the opening scenes on Tuesday, June 11, at 8 AM Pacific Time. Rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggest</a> it will be released within 2024, and the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confident of its success.</a></p>

<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree’s game size and pre-load details have seemingly been revealed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a post by a prominent gaming news source, <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798320557706076525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree will take up more than 16.502 GB on your console and PC to run. This post matches <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-file-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our earlier report</a> on the game size, which stated players would need more than 61GB of free space on their devices to run the DLC plus the game.</p>



<p>According to the post, Shadow of Erdtree’s pre-load date has been set as June 19, 2 days ahead of the June 21 release.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Regarding the Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree is FromSoftware’s largest expansion to date. The DLC includes a brand new story set in the Land of Shadow, where dark new secrets await to be revealed. Players can explore a new but similarly dense map with new weapons, equipment, weapon skills, and magic to try out. Furthermore, the players will come across new and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-previews-tease-new-enemies-difficulty-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even more deadly enemies</a> and boss encounters this time around, so all that grinding in the base game will be for nothing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is available for pre-order now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC. Pre-ordering the expansion will fetch you a Bonus Gesture for the game. Also, there are 3 editions of the game that players can purchase. </p>



<p>First up is the Shadow of the Erdtree edition, which includes the base game and the expansion. Then we have the deluxe edition, which includes an Elden Ring Digital Artbook &amp; Original Soundtrack and Shadow of the Erdtree Digital Artbook &amp; Original Soundtrack, on top of the base game and DLC. Lastly, we have the Shadow of the Erdtree Premium Bundle, which includes the DLC, its Digital Artbook and Original Soundtrack, but does not come with the base game. &nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The real enthusiasts can also go for the Collector Edition, which includes a 46cm statue of one of the boss characters in the DLC, “Messmer the Impaler”. You also received the Shadow of the Erdtree Digital Artbook and Original Soundtrack. However, the base game isn’t included in this edition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What do you think about Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree’s game size, and have you pre-ordered the DLC? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Microsoft has revealed the latest library update for Xbox Game Pass, which will include Octopath Traveler and Octopath Traveler II. Both of these are available now. Additionally, the update will introduce The Callisto Protocol, Isonzo, Depersonalization, and Still Wakes the Deep to the collection through June.</p>
<p><iframe title="STILL WAKES THE DEEP - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GFUCpvNnrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<ul>
<li>Octopath Traveler (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 6th</li>
<li>Octopath Traveler II (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 6th</li>
<li>Depersonalization (PC) – June 12th</li>
<li>Isonzo (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13th</li>
<li>The Callisto Protocol (Cloud, Console, and PC) – June 13th</li>
<li>Still Wakes the Deep (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – June 18th</li>
</ul>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler Review, </a>Stefan said, <em>“Octopath Traveler is a wonderful collection of adventures and stories, but the quirk of storytelling that lends it its name is both its greatest strength and weakness. While the turn-based combat and ‘breaking’ enemies makes practically every battle engaging, the eight tales this game tells don’t really feel like they need to be told together. It’s a little unbalanced because of this, but this remains a charming, beguiling JRPG.”</em></p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/17/octopath-traveler-2-review/">Octopath Traveler II Review</a>, Reuben wrote, <em>“Octopath Traveler II manages to improve on almost every aspect of its predecessor, whether they needed it or not. The exploration is deeper with more nooks and crannies to nose your way through. The combat is far more intricate, giving greater options to build your party and skillset, and a large degree of player choice. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and the sound design is phenomenal once again. Honestly, Octopath Traveler II has basically negated the need to play the first title, and I cannot think of higher praise.”</em></p>

<p>Microsoft has also confirmed the games that will be leaving the Xbox Game Pass library this month. They are Bramble: The Mountain King, High on Life, Rune Factory 4 Special Spacelines from the Far Out, and The Bookwalker. All of these titles will be removed on June 15th.</p>

            <p>Silent Hill 2's original creators "didn't want to make the same thing again" when it came to Silent Hill 2 Remake, causing Remake developer Bloober Team to push back on some of their suggestions.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202406/6918">Famitsu</a>, Silent Hill 2 Remake producer Motoi Okamoto – who joined Konami in 2019 to revive the dormant horror series – discussed how Konami and the original developers worked alongside Bloober to find the right "balance" between remaking and reimagining the revered game.</p>

<p>"The Japanese staff who worked on the original version said, 'I want to change this'. But on the other hand, Bloober Team had a lot of opinions like, 'No, I don't want to change this!'" Okamoto said, as translated by Google.</p>
<p>"Although opinions sometimes clash, in the end, we managed to get it right," Okamoto added. "If you watch the trailer, you'll see that it has been reborn in a modern style while retaining the good points of the original version."</p>
<p>Acknowledging that "game creators don't want to make the same thing they created again", Okamoto said: "They don't want people to enjoy the same thing. So, I think there were a lot of parts that they wanted to change drastically in the remake".</p>
<p>"But in the end, thanks to the opinions of Bloober Team – who are big fans of the original [game]– the remake is highly faithful to the original."</p>
<p>Okamoto did assure players, however, that the long walk in through the forest at the beginning of the game "will appear almost unchanged", and as the remake didn't want to use "gamer-like user interfaces", the team removed the UI map in favour of giving James a physical map that he carries with him instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">Bloober Team says it is "very confident" and "excited" about Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. In the studio's annual report to shareholders earlier this year, the team expressed its excitement about the highly anticipated remake, stating that it was "very confident about the final result", and acknowledged the success of Silent Hill 2 Remake will be "the most important test" the studio has faced.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 Remake is set to release on PC via Steam and PS5 on 8th October, 2024</a>. It was one of gaming's worst-kept secrets <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-is-back-but-is-it-too-much-too-soon">before it was formally revealed back in October 2022</a>.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-short-but-sweet-new-trailer/">Black Myth Wukong</a> PC system requirements were leaked online today, confirming how 4K resolution will require 32 GB of RAM</p>
<p>As shared on X/Twitter by <a href="https://x.com/ignusthewise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lunatic Ignus</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ZFeetyou30399/status/1798999945141452906/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ZFeetyou30399</a>, the game will require a Core i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, GeForce GTX 1060 or RX 580 GPU for 1080p low, and a Core i7-9700 or Ryzen 5 5500, RTX 4070 or RX 7800 XT for 4K resolution, no ray tracing. With ray tracing on, Game Science recommends a&nbsp; Core i5-9400 or&nbsp; Ryzen 5 1600 CPU, RTX 3060 GPU for 1080p low, Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU, RTX 4060 GPU for 1080p high, and an Intel Core i7-9700 or AMD Ryzen 5 5500 CPU an RTX 4080 Super for 4K resolution. Interestingly enough, the developer doesn't list any AMD GPU option for ray tracing. As mentioned above, 32 GB of RAM will also be required for 4K resolution with both ray tracing on and off.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong is setting out to be one of the most interesting action role-playing games releasing this year. Rooted in Chinese mythology, the game will feature a unique take on the popular Journey to the West tale, giving players to set out as the Destined One to uncover the obscured truth beneath the veil of a glorious legend from the past, taking on all sorts of enemies in Soulslike fashion.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on August 20th.</p>

BioWare boss Gary McKay has shared fresh details of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, including word on its romance and combat, just a day after the game was announced to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week">changed its name from Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Ahead of a full 15 minutes of gameplay footage set to debut next week, McKay answered questions from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay">IGN</a> on some of its core mechanics and characters.
</p>
<p>
"I won't spoil next week's reveal but I can say we've created a story where you can impact the world and the companions that surround you," McKay said, emphasising the game's name change as being a reflection of the importance of your allies - the Dawnguard themselves.

<p>
"Player agency is important to the Dragon Age: The Veilguard experience and allows each player to form unique personal connections with their companions of choice. And, yes, you can romance the companions you want!"
</p>
<p>
This certainly sounds as if romance won't be locked to only specific characters, as it was in Inquisition, and will be more akin to Dragon Age 2, or Baldur's Gate 3.
</p>
<p>
Seven companions is the "right number for the story we're telling," McKay continued. "As you accompany your companions to unravel their backstory and earn their loyalty and friendship, you'll visit more regions of Thedas across a deeper variety of biomes than any Dragon Age before."
</p>
<p>
As for combat, BioWare veterans may also be pleased to hear of an ability wheel that lets you freeze time and plan future actions.
</p>
<p>
"As an RPG, strategy in combat is important as you bring two companions to every fight. Each companion brings unique powers and abilities that have a direct impact on how you choose to take down the enemies at hand. To add another layer to that strategic element, we're introducing a new ability wheel where you can pause the action and set up your next move – whether it's your companions' abilities or your own.
</p>
<p>
"The ability wheel opens up a huge amount of strategic possibilities, giving players the ability to control the flow of combat and link powerful combinations of abilities between players and their companions."
</p>
<p>
BioWare has said we'll get our first look at 15 minutes of gameplay for Dragon Age: The Veilguard next week, on Tuesday 11th June at 4pm UK time, as the ever-busy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">not-E3 / Summer Game Fest week</a> continues.

            <p>
The release date for Sonic x Shadow Generations has leaked ahead of a possible announcement this weekend during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest</a>.
</p>
<p>
The leak comes courtesy of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/sonic-x-shadow-generations-on-pense-connaitre-la-date-de-sortie-du-nouveau-titre-de-sega-52416">Dealabs</a>, which confirms the release date as 25th October 2024. Additionally, the game will cost $49.99 and will be released across PS5, Xbox One/Series X/S, Switch, and PC.
</p>
<p>
The box art for the game has also leaked, thanks to X account Arsène Lupin. Unsurprisingly, it features Shadow alongside both classic and modern Sonic.

And lastly, there are screenshots of the game, showing both Sonics as well as Shadow sprouting some nasty looking wings.

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-officially-announced">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> was announced at the PlayStation State of Play in February.

</p>
<p>
It's a remastered version of the 2011 game, but also with the inclusion of brand new levels based on Shadow the Hedgehog. 
</p>
<p>
From what's leaked so far, it doesn't look like Shadow will be seen in classic chibi form, nor will he wield guns. But perhaps a full announcement is due imminently to show more?
</p>
<p>
The game's release is part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">Sega's Year of Shadow</a>, with a number of events and releases leading up to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jim-carrey-returns-as-dr-robotnik-in-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a> in December that's loosely based on the events of Sonic Adventure 2.

The AI-based Auto SR feature will automatically upscale game resolutions and improve frame rates, and Microsoft is now detailing exactly how it’s different to DLSS, XeSS, and FSR.</p><p>Auto SR will be integrated into Windows 11, and available on Copilot Plus devices that have a dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU). It’s designed to work with existing games with no manual configurations required and no need for game developers to change how their games are rendered. </p><p>“Auto SR is different from super resolution technologies like AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution, Intel XeSS, and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution built into games,” says the DirectX team <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/autosr/">in a blog post</a>. “These approaches require games to alter their rendering, for example, by using jitter and MIP bias to add finer details. In contrast, Auto SR tackles the task of enhancing games without the extra information to improve games as they exist today.”</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s example of Auto SR upscaling a game at 720p (right) and improving the frame rate.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Auto SR uses larger on-device AI models combined with the NPU on Copilot Plus devices to apply AI enhancements to game visuals, all while rendering a game at a lower resolution to improve frame rates. Microsoft is offloading the work directly to the NPU here so it’s not even hitting the GPU to get upscaling working. “This strategic shift not only improves framerates but also enhances the energy efficiency of each frame rendered, significantly boosting the overall gaming experience,” says the DirectX team.</p><p>There is a slight latency tradeoff, though. “While running our large model, Auto SR introduces a single frame of latency on average as it uses AI to significantly boost your game’s visuals,” admits Microsoft. We’ll have to test this fully to see if that single frame is noticeable, and which games it impacts more than others.</p><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs are launching later this month.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>At launch on June 18th, Microsoft is only automatically enhancing 11 games that have been tested to improve visual quality, framerates, or a combination of both. <em>Borderlands 3</em>, <em>Control</em> (DX11), <em>Dark Souls III</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil 3</em>, <em>Sekiro Shadows Die Twice</em>, <em>Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts 2</em> and <em>The Witcher 3</em>, are all on the launch list that have been verified by Microsoft.</p><p>That list will grow over time, and it’s easy to toggle the Auto SR feature on or off and adjust settings for individual games. Microsoft says you can also “explore this feature on additional untested games,” and force the setting on. “There may be some quirks and we can’t guarantee it will apply or improve your experience,” warns Microsoft.</p><p>The first set of Copilot Plus PCs are set to launch on June 18th with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips, so it won’t be long until we see how well Microsoft’s Auto SR works in reality. The feature will also eventually be available on new AMD- and Intel-powered Copilot Plus PCs, although it sounds like these machines <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24173080/intel-amd-nvidia-copilot-plus-pc-ai-exclusivity-qualcomm-2024">won’t have Copilot Plus AI features</a> until a post-launch update ships.</p><p>Microsoft is now working on Auto SR improvements, including support for HDR and multiple-monitor configurations. “As we continue to explore Auto SR capabilities, we look forward to exploring bringing Auto SR to more devices and a broader selection of x64 emulated games,” says the DirectX team.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The upcoming Astro Bot for PS5 from Team Asobi will receive three different editions, and pre-orders kick off today.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several rumors</a>, Sony and Team Asobi officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new Astro game for PS5 last week. Alongside the announcement, we also received an action-packed trailer for the title featuring PlayStation cameos and references aplenty. On the official PlayStation Blog, developer Team Asobi has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/astro-bot-pre-order-begins-june-7-features-parappa-lovestruck-lyricist-outfit-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed</a> the three different editions of the game, including the physical standard edition, the digital standard edition, and the digital deluxe edition - all of which will come with the following content for those who pre-order:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Astro Lovestruck Lyricist outfit</li>
<li>The Glorious Graffiti Dual Speeder paint color</li>
<li>2 Astro Avatars</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from the content mentioned above, the standard physical edition of the game will come with a physical insert poster. Those who purchase the digital standard edition will have to do with this poster. We've included a sneak peek of the poster below:</p>

<li>10 Astro Avatars</li>
</ul>
<p>The developer mentions that the outfits and the Dual Speeder paint colors will become available while playing as players unlock their respective buildings on the crash site.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is launching on September 6 for PlayStation 5. We've included some additional details alongside last week's announcement trailer below:</p>

<p><em>"In this brand-new game, you will explore 6 galaxies and over 80 levels in search of Astro’s scattered crew. Hold on tight to your Dual Speeder and dive down to each unique planet, from lush forests, sandy beaches, hot volcanoes to more surprising locations such as a gigantic hourglass or the canopy of a singing tree!</em></p>
<p><em>To get help on his mission, Astro can use over 15 new abilities offering unique play styles. As you would expect from an Astro game, these take full advantage of the DualSense controller, its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers so you can feel every little step along the journey."</em></p>

What they have instead is, well… it’s not quite what they expected.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced">Sony’s State of Play showcase in May</a> the company revealed a brand new <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> for PS5, and the announcement sparked excitement from PlayStation gamers across the internet. Now, Sony has announced pre-order details for Team Asobi’s game as well as the various outfits set to hit the eye-catching platformer — and, you guessed it, one of the outfits is Bloodborne.</p><p>As detailed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/astro-bot-pre-order-begins-june-7-features-parappa-lovestruck-lyricist-outfit-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the Astro Bot Digital Deluxe Edition includes an early unlock for Astro’s Yharnam Tourist outfit, which is the one that’s caused a bit of a fuss across social media and forums today.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Botborne <a href="https://t.co/xNu7EO4nTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xNu7EO4nTS</a></p>— PlayStation AU (@PlayStationAU) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationAU/status/1798973843618623549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Most of the reaction is light-hearted, with plenty of jokes about Astro Bot now being the Bloodborne remake fans have been waiting for, a few perhaps wishful thinkers suggesting the skin is a sign of better things to come, and more than a few accusations that Sony is trolling Bloodborne fans hard. You have to imagine Sony knew what sort of reaction this outfit would spark, and it’s sure to drive plenty of Deluxe Edition sales as a result. Either way, we have a confirmed Sony acknowledgement that still Bloodborne exists, so there is that.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">thanks Playstation very cool <a href="https://t.co/OQcT0xBZiE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/OQcT0xBZiE</a></p>— Is Bloodborne on PC (@isbbonpc) <a href="https://twitter.com/isbbonpc/status/1799005755057856775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sony's messed up for this 😆<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AstroBot?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#AstroBot</a> <a href="https://t.co/6sZ5v1k7Ji" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6sZ5v1k7Ji</a></p>— Shinobi602 (@shinobi602) <a href="https://twitter.com/shinobi602/status/1798843237358281095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s your crumb you sad freaks <a href="https://t.co/Mrs0vs3GRh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Mrs0vs3GRh</a> <a href="https://t.co/VrEiQSqRI3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/VrEiQSqRI3</a></p>— Barrett Courtney (@SadBoyBarrett) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadBoyBarrett/status/1798848308687028516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light">— GermanStrands (@GermanStrands) <a href="https://twitter.com/GermanStrands/status/1798839730651763107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">IT'S OFFICAL!

But it is early access to something new for Bloodborne, so…</p><p>Meanwhile, the wait for an actual new Bloodborne game continues. In February, Bloodborne director Hidetaka Miyazaki, while promoting upcoming Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftwares-miyazaki-responds-to-calls-for-bloodborne-remake-on-ps5">told IGN</a> it wasn’t his place to talk about the possibility of a Bloodborne remake.</p><p>"We simply don't own the IP at FromSoftware,” Miyazaki explained. “For me personally, it was a great project, and I have a lot of great memories for that game, but we're not at liberty to speak to it." No promises, no hints of anything in the works, and to hear Miyazaki tell it, the decision isn't even really up to FromSoftware — it's entirely on Sony, which owns Bloodborne.</p><p>Bloodborne fans have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/a-bloodborne-remake-is-sorely-needed-and-heres-why"><u>desperate for a remake</u></a> for years now. We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review"><u>gave the game a 9.1/10 when it first launched</u></a>, but despite critical acclaim and incredible sales success, Bloodborne has remained relegated to PlayStation 4 exclusivity. There's no dedicated PS5 version, nor is it available on PS5 or other consoles. With other FromSoftware games such as Demon's Souls and the original Dark Souls getting a remake and numerous ports, respectively, hope has been kept alive. For now, FromSoftware fans will have to be content with… an Astro Bot skin.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p data-characters="233" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every season, Sledgehammer adds a new event to <em>MW3</em>, with the Critical Countdown event tasking players with collecting DNA Samples. Unfortunately, these in-game additions are making it impossible to see, and players are sick of them. </p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Every time you get a kill, a DNA string appears, floating in the air where their body is, just like a dog tag in Kill Confirmed. Unlike Kill Confirmed, however, this isn’t confined to one mode and happens in every multiplayer match type, meaning there’s no escape from them. </p> <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, these floating <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-dna-samples-for-mw3-and-warzone-critical-countdown-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DNA Samples</a> are causing issues, making it impossible for players to aim and block sightlines, and fans are not happy about it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You need DNA samples to unlock rewards. Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true">“For the love of God, never put objects like DNA strands in the game ever again,” wrote ermor666 on Reddit. “The DNA strands are some of the most annoying and obstructive items I have ever seen in <em>CoD. </em>Not only do they hover in the middle of a downed enemy, they give off an annoying bloom effect. It can completely block your line of sight.”</p>
 <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="306" data-injectable="false">This was echoed by other players too, with EL-SIN-NOMBRE-666 stating that “the obstruction of your line of sight is the thing that bothers me. The devs wouldn’t even have to finish a match to see it’s a disadvantage. I’ll never understand why they thought it was a good idea.”</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">TheEpicRedCape said they just wished that when you “collected all you need for one color, that color would stop spawning,” as even if you complete the challenge and collect them all, they still drop regardless. </p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">I can definitely see where these <em>MW3</em> players are coming from, as I found them annoying to play around this week too. I didn’t mind them so much on bigger maps, but when I jumped into Small Map Moshpit, the narrow lanes and congested areas meant you would see them everywhere, and on a map like Shipment it made seeing opponents almost impossible. </p> <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="false">With the event set to run until June 26, lets hope that Sledgehammer listen to the community and make a change. </p>

            <p>
Something titled New World: Aeternum has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/newworldgame/comments/1da1tgx/what_the_hell_it_on_my_ps_store_page/?share_id=chcOPXupFj2x9wY_zKenR">spotted</a> on the PlayStation Store, setting tongues wagging ahead of an expected announcement tonight. 
</p>
<p>
Developed by Amazon Games, New World originally launched for PC in 2021, and is still yet to arrive on consoles. The advert for New World: Aeternum on PlayStation consoles certainly suggests this may soon change.
</p>
<p>
An MMORPG set in a fictional version of 1600s America, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-real-buzz-about-amazons-new-world-mmo">New World initially arrived with something of a buzz</a>, and had nearly a million concurrent players soon after launch. Things have calmed down since, with more modest players in the double digit thousands over the past couple of years - something a console launch now could revive.

<p>
The addition of a subtitle, Aeternum, suggests this isn't the same version of New World that exists on PC currently. Whether this is merely a subtitle for a console version (and whether it also arrives on Xbox) remains to be seen.

But it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-worlds-first-expansion-will-add-mounts-and-extended-story">been a while since the last New World expansion</a>, and New World's social media has been teasing something big being announced tonight during the Summer Game Fest show. It may be we see Aeternum announced as an update for the base game on PC too - as well as a fresh jumping off point for new players on consoles.

<p>In my eternal quest to describe games concisely enough that you don’t feel robbed of time you could have just watched a trailer with, I am compelled to use many of the same words and word combinations ad nauseam. So, when a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> tower defence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bella-wants-blood">Bella Wants Blood</a> comes along and uses some odd nouns, I get all excited. Here, that’s because I get to recklessly spaff out terms like ‘Blood Gutters’, ‘The Rattler’, and your friend and mine, ‘The Stabber’. Barely an atom quivers in Bella Wants Blood that hasn’t been stylised or made odd and alluring in some way.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In yet another win for the language economy, Bella Wants Blood is both a title and a broad overview of just what the hell is going on here, anyway. Bella is an ever-hungry monstrosity, and I imagine my nose would start bleeding more profusely for every additional fact I knew about her. You’ll carve her out a network of Blood Gutters, down which interlope a gribbly menagerie of skittering buglets. Bella does not like chewing, only supping, and so grows impatient for every creature she’s forced to masticate. To prevent her eventually turning those insidious incisors in your direction, you’ll want to set up your Stabbers and Rattlers, your Slingers and Lookers, to slow, debuff, shoot, and shank the bugs before they reach her gaping maw. You pick upgrade paths and encounters from a map between stages, and try to get as far as possible in a single run.</p>

<p>So, yes, it’s a tower defence game, but with every element lent such rich fictive snippets and art that it feels horrifically alive in a way many others don’t. The result is that Bella is terrifying. I genuinely do not want to displease her. She feels like a survival horror monster banging on the door outside, only she’s here in the room with me. I try to keep her happy. I unwrap each gift gratefully and treasure the nasty trinket within. It’s like Christmas morning but the Rubik's Cube your got in your stocking was accidentally the scary square from Hellraiser. Now there are spikes where no spikes were previously, and quivering flesh arranged like cheese and pineapple skewers along the mantlepiece. I hate it here and I’m not yet ready to leave.
