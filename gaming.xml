                <p>Gaming industry veteran Hideo Kojima has commented on the semi-recent trend of remote working in the video game business, saying it might not be the ideal way to work but forcing people back to the office isn't a good option either.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jun/19/were-all-connected-but-its-not-the-connection-i-imagined-hideo-kojima-on-death-stranding-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a>, Kojima said remote work is "almost like a fast food chain" in that people are "just concentrating on one thing instead of the whole project." The publication further reported that Kojima said working remotely as opposed to being in an office together with colleagues can be inefficient for a variety of reasons, including the lack of back-and-forth with people working at a desk next to each other.</p><p>"Only 1% of yourself is on show during [online] meetings," he said. "This is not like building a team. Think about football. You hire someone, he comes to your squad--but you can't play together remotely. So that person doesn't change the way they played before; they won't fit in."</p><p>However, Kojima said he acknowledges that "you can't force people back to the office, you can only persuade them."</p><p>For Kojima Productions specifically, Kojima said "not everyone came back" to the office to work on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach but the "main members" did.</p><p>Beyond the people working on the game, Kojima said he encountered some challenges with the cast for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. He said it was "quite difficult" to communicate to the actors how they should perform in a particular scene, adding that this was "almost impossible" to do over Zoom.</p><p>Kojima previously said the original Death Stranding, which was released in 2019, was made based on the theme of, "We're in danger of being divided and isolated, so let's connect."</p><p>Then the COVID pandemic began in 2020. Having lived through the pandemic, Kojima said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-how-kojimas-experience-with-covid-impacted-the-game/1100-6531399/" data-ref-id="1100-6531399">changed his way of thinking when it comes to connection.</a></p><p>"After actually experiencing that, I felt that maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much. That feeling is foreshadowed in lots of different scenes and settings [in Death Stranding 2]. I think there are portions that players will only understand once they reach the end of the game. What I felt during the pandemic is quite strongly reflected within this title," he said of Death Stranding 2.</p><p>Many video game development studios embraced remote working during the pandemic, and some companies even used it as a selling point to hire new staff. Now, however, some companies are pulling back and asking people to return to the office--if not for a full week, at least partially. Mega-publisher EA, for example, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-full-return-to-office-effectively-ending-remote-work/1100-6531579/" data-ref-id="1100-6531579">effectively ended remote working, which has upset some staffers.</a> Rockstar Games, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">required people to return to the office to finish GTA 6, which also prompted a backlash.</a></p><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out now on PS5. If you're just getting started with the game, be sure to read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a> and consult our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-guides-hub/1100-6532611/" data-ref-id="1100-6532611">Death Stranding 2 guides hub</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-tips-beginners-guide/2900-6684/" data-ref-id="2900-6684">help yourself get off to a good start.</a></p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-to-be-the-first-person-to-make-a-game-in-space/1100-6532868/" data-ref-id="1100-6532868">Kojima's plans to make a game in space</a>, he and his team are working on multiple upcoming new games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint.</a></p>

It’s been nearly eight years since <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, and now we know what that team has been up to, as Nintendo has officially revealed that the developers of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> are the same team that made<em> Odyssey</em>.</p><p>Nintendo has a good track record of retaining and training up talent. Developers that worked on early entries in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663707/kirby-interview-gdc-2023-kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo"><em>Kirby</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24112724/super-mario-bros-wonder-interview-nintendo-switch"><em>Mario</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24115898/tears-of-the-kingdom-physics-gameplay-design-gdc-2024"><em>Zelda</em></a> franchises have stuck around to work on or lead the development of subsequent titles. The result has been relative consistency across Nintendo first-party titles, which has allowed the company to weather the last two years a bit better than its competitors. <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was one of the top five bestselling games for the original Switch, so <em>Bananza</em> is in more than capable hands.</p><p>According to <em>The Verge</em>’s Cameron Faulkner, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is its own game with a unique identity. But <em>Odyssey</em>’s development team has added a bit of Mario’s 3D platforming DNA to Donkey Kong’s first 3D platformer since <em>Donkey Kong 64</em>. And while the mystery of <em>Bananza</em>’s developer has been solved, a new one has taken its place: will there also be a 3D <em>Mario </em>game coming soon to the Switch 2, or is it just <em>Bananza</em> for now?</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/695726/donkey-kong-bananza-developers-super-mario-odyssey]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-more-popular-than-ever-thanks-to-a-dedicated-fan-community.1232976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> earned a major accolade with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/eas-infamous-defense-of-lootboxes-wins-a-guinness-world-record-for-most-downvoted-comment-on-reddit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Guinness World Record</a>, but it’s likely not an award publisher Electronic Arts is proud of, since it’s for posting the most downvoted comment on Reddit. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7cff0b/comment/dppum98/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">An EA community manager posted the comment on Reddit in November 2017</a>, the month of the game’s turbulent launch, defending the decision to lock key characters — like Darth Vader — behind hours of grinding, unless a player pays up. It’s to give players “a sense of pride and accomplishment,” the community manager said. And that anger was on top of the response to <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em>'s loot box system, <a href="https://battlefront.fandom.com/wiki/Loot_Crates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were described by critics as "pay-to-win."</a></p><p>Controversy around the loot box system had even government regulators involved; both Belgian and Dutch gambling commissions investigated the game, and lawmakers in the U.S., Singapore, and the U.K. all looked into the game’s use of microtransactions and loot boxes. EA ended up pulling microtransactions before release, and later overhauled its monetization system. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/30/16952396/star-wars-battlefront-2-sales-loot-boxes-returning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The company blamed the gaffe</a> for EA not reaching its 10 million copies sales goals for <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em>.</p><p>Despite the launch issues, <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> has had a dedicated, passionate fanbase. It’s been five years since EA published its final update for the game, but thanks to an effort from the <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> community, the game is seeing more players than ever. The daily concurrent player totals on Steam increased dramatically on Star Wars Day, May 4th, and continued to boost from there, <a href="https://kyber.gg/news/battlefront-resurgence-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likely due to the May 24 “Resurgence Day” event</a> put on by Kyber, a team that hosts dedicated <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> servers and mod support.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there have been some dips since then, interest in the game has, overall, grown. <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> reached a new all-time concurrent player peak — 35,892 players — on June 22, with a consistent 20,000 people online at any given time. And these numbers are just for Steam; the game is available on consoles and Windows PC on EA’s proprietary launcher, but concurrent player numbers are not easily available there. Mat Piscatella, from analyst group Circana, posted to BlueSky on June 10 that <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> was in the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrazmyc6ek2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top 15 most-played games on both PlayStation and Xbox during the last week of May</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>EA did not respond to Aftermath’s request for comment.</p><p>Kyber community and project manager Ethan Clark told Aftermath that the team feels a sense of “pride” and “accomplishment” to see the game’s playerbase grow. Clark said, “It was incredibly hard to watch as the game burst into flames when it launched in 2017. So many talented people poured their hearts and souls into <em>Battlefront 2</em>, only for it to stand at the centre of perhaps one of the most damaging controversies in gaming. I think enough time has passed for people to look beyond the game's previous flaws and see it for what it is now — a genuinely great game, which many now consider a timeless classic.”</p><p>Clark said that previously players had to coordinate online at specific peak times to be able to get enough people to fill lobbies, but “now, you can find a full lobby in any game mode, at any time of day, on any platform.” Not only that, but there’s a big population of lower level players playing <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> for the first time.&nbsp;</p><p>Clark said that Resurgence Day, <a href="https://kyber.gg/news/battlefront-resurgence-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during which players logged into <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> en masse on May 24</a>, took six months of planning to get set up. ("Resurgence Day is more than just a day of gaming; it's a statement," <a href="https://kyber.gg/news/battlefront-resurgence-day-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyber wrote on its website</a>.) The player base was actively declining, he said, but the game’s presence on social media was growing. “The main goal was to incentivise content creators to return and flood social media with brand-new <em>Battlefront</em> videos, memes, and events. We only needed a handful of creators to find success before more of them naturally turned their attention towards the game, starting a cycle of growth which we could begin to turn into a movement,” Clark said.</p><p>The date, May 24, was chosen a week prior. “Based on the combination of data available to us — and the gut feeling many of us shared — it was pretty clear that the natural boost caused by other Star Wars content and events would peak the following weekend,” Clark said. “Using that knowledge, we worked nonstop all week, doing our best to help the content and mod creation communities fire on all cylinders, pumping out viral content, sharing exclusive news, and keeping players engaged throughout.”</p><p>The Resurgence Day event occurring near Star Wars Day, <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> returning to theaters, Darth Vader returning to <em>Fortnite</em> alongside a big Star Wars event, <a href="https://www.jedinews.com/gaming/articles/steam-2025-summer-sale-star-wars-battlefront-ii-just-4-3-49/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive price cut making the game just $4</a>, and the end of the second season of <em>Andor</em> made for the perfect storm of interest in playing a Star Wars video game. Even Dallas Mavericks player Kyrie Irving got in on the action <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1lgog43/kyrie_fucking_irving_is_streaming_battlefront/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by streaming <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em> to fans</a>.</p><p>Clark’s not taking credit for the massive surge, but noted that without the social media push, the new audiences may not have stuck around as long. He said he knows the resurgence can’t last forever, but Kyber will continue to demonstrate that “just because <em>Battlefront 2'</em>s live service was cancelled doesn't mean the game must come to an end.” Modders keep adding new content, and Kyber is working to bring that to the multiplayer game “in a way that’s safe and accessible.”&nbsp;<br>The group also hopes that EA has noticed the effort. “Our one hope is that someone, with the power to make things happen, has received and understood that gamers want more <em>Star Wars Battlefront</em>,” Clark said.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-dot-esports-escapist-sale"><h3>Gamurs Has Been Selling Off Sites</h3></a><p>In June, the network sold both Dot Esports and The Escapist</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city"><h3>Congratulations To Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s (Second) Gamer Mayor</h3></a><p>"Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/star-wars-battlefront-2-kyber-resurgence-day]]></content:encoded>

</article>
<p><strong>Here's a look at all of Timmy Turner's abilities in Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Elemental Wall </strong>– Summons a random elemental wall of Fire, Lightning, or Ice that deals damage and knocks enemies backward with a satisfying poof.</li><li><strong>Mushroom Rain</strong> – Opens a sparkly portal that drops enchanted mushrooms from the sky. Each one smacks enemies for damage and randomly applies poison, burn, or freeze them.</li><li><strong>Vacuum Ball </strong>– A vacuum that slowly siphons energy from enemies as it pulls them inward, dealing damage with each tick. Enemies below 20% HP are instantly absorbed into the swirling core, forming the Vacuum Ball. Once charged, it can be hurled at enemies, dealing attack damage.</li><li><strong>Piñata’s Revenge</strong> – A totally cursed piñata taunts nearby enemies into attacking it. While it’s up, your hits grant random buffs, and enemy hits cause random debuffs. After a few seconds… KABOOM. Candy and damage for everyone in range.</li><li><strong>A Really Dangerous Weapon</strong> – Drops a magical cannon that fires a barrage of magical cannonballs. Hits enemies with rapid-fire blasts of damage. Nobody's quite sure where Timmy got it. Definitely not approved by Da Rules.</li><li><strong>Scepter Beam</strong> – Unleashes a crackling elemental ray that cycles between Fire, Lightning, and Ice. Each second brings a new element and a fresh debuff. Zapping enemies restores mana.</li><li><strong>Spiky Ball</strong> – Summons a giant, glittery spiked ball that bounces three times before exploding. Or press skill button again to blow it up early. Each bounce deals damage. Each explosion? Spectacular. Just don’t ask who tested it.</li></ul><p>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store sometime this Fall.</p><hr><p><em>What character do you want to see revealed for Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny?

            <p>
July and the sizzle of summer are finally upon us. And as ever, a new calendar month means a fresh batch of Xbox Game Pass titles, which this time include the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-ii">Little Nightmares 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has so far announced a grand total of nine titles joining the various tiers of its subscription service this month, with the first of those arriving today, 1st July. You can see everything coming - plus when, on what platform, and to what Game Pass tier - below:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Little Nightmares 2</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July</li>
<li><strong>Rise of the Tomb Raider</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) - available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 1st July</li>
<li><strong>Legend of Mana</strong> (Console) – available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July</li>
<li><strong>Trials of Mana</strong> (Console) – available with Game Pass Standard from 2nd July</li>
<li><strong>Ultimate Chicken Horse</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 3rd July</li>
<li><strong>The Ascent</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 8th July</li>
<li><strong>Minami Lane</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 9th July</li>
<li><strong>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass from 11th July</li>
<li><strong>High On Life</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC) – available with Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard from 15th July</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's a decent line-up, then, although Activision's long-awaited Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake will undoubtedly be the headline act for many people. But adorably sinister horror sequel Little Nightmares 2 is well worth your time if you're in the mood for some macabre chills, and that double-whammy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s Mana series should keep fantasy RPG fans occupied. Beyond that, there's a spot of tomb raiding, some wholesome street-management action in Miami Lane, visually striking cyberpunk action in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
As for departures, six games are leaving Xbox Game Pass on 15th July, so if you've been meaning to check out any of the following, you've only got a couple of weeks to do so:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flock</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Mafia Definitive Edition</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Magical Delicacy</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>Tchia</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>The Callisto Protocol</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><strong>The Case of the Golden Idol</strong> (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>
To keep playing the above titles after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to buy them - but subscribers do at least get a 20 percent discount. And for everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Eurogamer's handy Xbox Game Pass guide</a>.

		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> Patch 8.0 arriving last week, adding <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/space-marine-2-endless-siege-mode-is-coming-in-junes-free-update/">the big new Siege Mode to the game</a>, Saber Interactive has now teased a little of what they have planned for the game’s anniversary. Update 10.0 will arrive in September, and it’s planned as “a large-scale update”, heralding the start of a second year of both free and paid DLC content.</p>
<p>But first some bad news. With the scope of what the 10.0 update will bring, Saber has decided that Update 9.0 will only bring balancing changes and no new content, so the new PvP mode that was planned for 9.0 has been postponed and rolled into 10.0 as well.</p>


<p>This new game mode (while they won’t go into specifics) will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new mode-specific map</li>
<li>Chaos vs. Chaos PvP</li>
<li>Playable controlled Helbrutes</li>
</ul>
<p>With how Chaos-centric this new mode is, new Chaos armours will be added to the game.</p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new melee weapon: the Power Axe. This will have new moves, execution animations and more.</p>


<p>And finally, a new class is being introduced for both PvE and PvP in the form of the Techmarine. More details on this class will come in the next community update post.</p>
<p>With the arrival of update 10.0, Space Marine 2 will be heading into its second year, and given the huge success of the game, Saber is committing to a second year of both free and DLC content – this means there will be a new yearly season pass for those who need more Space Marine customisation options. The core of the content will be freely available to all, though, and so we can expect to see more new&nbsp;PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and even more beyond that.</p>
<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this the recently released modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-was-developed-by-the-super-mario-odyssey-team.1232949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed the development team behind&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>in a rare moment of transparency, and one of the studio's biggest successes on the original Switch was created by the same team.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-donkey-kong-bananza-is-being-made-by-the-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer report</a>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>was created by the same team who worked on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, which, at <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_4e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, had sold over 29 million units. It's safe to say, then, that&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>is in safe hands, opposable gorilla thumbs and all.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of what we thought of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>back in 2017, it's one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10" rel="nofollow">few games</a> to which we awarded a full 10 out of 10 score, with our very own Andrew <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review-pure-joy" rel="nofollow">calling it</a> "one of the best&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games ever made". It's hard to disagree with him on that score, quite literally.</p>

<p>The game will see Donkey Kong setting out to recover the "Banandium Gems" from the evil VoidCo., which seeks to exploit them in order to reach the planet's core, which is said to grant wishes.</p>

<p>He'll have assistance from a younger version of Pauline, who can sing in order to assist DK in various ways. She's also part of&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s two-player mode; she can throw out damaging explosions if a second player is controlling her.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to destroy much of&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em>'s scenery, which you'll need to do in order to uncover secrets and defeat enemies, as well as to open up your options for exploration.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza&nbsp;</em>when it launches exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-2785804.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on July 17th.</p>

            <p>If you like getting Warhammered and having a scrap as a space marine, then here's some good news. Following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2s-siege-mode-is-out-letting-you-fight-endless-waves-of-tyranids-and-the-other-less-good-enemy">siege mode</a> last week, developers Saber Interactive have confirmed that it'll be getting second year of free and paid updates.</p>
<p>Hey, it's something to help quench your bloodlust while you wait for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-revealed-with-titus-back-as-lead">Space Marine 3</a> to become more than a glint in the eye of a dev working on a big gun to be wielded by a big lad in big armour.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Saber have confirmed this extra year of "both free and DLC content included in a new yearly season pass" in their latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225">community update</a>, outlining that you can expect it to include "new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and ...more".</p>
<p>Before that kicks off, the game'll be getting the "large-scale" 10.0 update in September, to commemorate the one-year anniversary of its release. That update'll include the a new PvP mode that was originally set to be added in the next patch, 9.0, which'll now solely be about balancing tweaks. The new mode'll be Chaos vs Chaos on a new map, and will let players take control of the Hellbrute.</p>
<p>As for gear, 10.0 is bringing new Chaos armours for you to rock while you take on that new mode, as well as a Power Axe you'll be able to slap baddies up with if you prefer to swap your guns for melee mashing. There'll also be a new class, the Techmarine, which Saber are keeping their cards close to their chest on for now, but we can safely assume will love a good wrench.</p>
<p>There'll be more info on the 10.0 update's contents coming in the studio's community updates over the next couple of months, because woe betide the dev team that spunks all of its update deet reveals at once.

That’s been one of the big questions on fans’ minds ever since the Switch 2 title was revealed, fueled by the fact that Nintendo seemingly refused to say which studio or internal team was behind it. Now we finally know. Nintendo has confirmed the game that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-screenshots-diddy-dixie-modes-1851784739&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-screenshots-diddy-dixie-modes-1851784739">walks, talks, and quacks</a></span> like <em>Super Mario Odyssey </em>was indeed made by the <em>Mario Odyssey </em>team.

The studio is “based in Tokyo,” implying Nintendo EPD Tokyo. But teams at Nintendo can be fluid, with veterans moving between projects and reshuffling groups of developers as things move through various points in production. </p><p>Who exactly is leading <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>? Like, what are their actual names? <em>Mario Odyssey</em> was produced by Koichi Hayashida, director on <em>Mario 3D Land </em>and <em>Mario Galaxy </em>2, and Yoshiaki Koizumi, whose Nintendo credits date back to the original<em> Super Smash Bros</em> (he also led <em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</em>), and it was the directorial debut of Kenta Motokura, who also came from<em> 3D Land</em> and <em>Galaxy 2</em>. Is the same squad leading on <em>Bananza</em>? <em>VGC</em> asked and Nintendo wouldn’t say. <br></p><p>There are two reasons why this caginess matters. The first is that games are made by people, not monolithic corporations, and it’s always worth reminding everyone of that whenever possible. Nintendo was content to lean into the star power of its homegrown talent for years, making it even odder now that it tries to keep those kinds details temporarily under wraps (they will eventually come out in the credits, after all).</p><p>The second is that if the <em>Mario Odyssey </em>team is making <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, than who is making the next 3D <em>Mario</em>? There are three obvious possibilities here. The first is that Nintendo EPD Tokyo is somehow splitting its time and working on both. Another option is that a different internal team has taken the reigns of Mario for his 3D debut on Switch 2. The last and least appealing possibility is that we’re effectively getting a launch window 3D <em>Donkey Kong</em>  <em>instead</em> of a launch window<em> </em>3D<em> Mario </em>game, with the true successor to <em>Odyssey</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnlG8G3yAM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SnlG8G3yAM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potentially many years off</a></span>. <br></p><p>For now at least, some initial evidence and rumors point to the first option. “<em>DK Bananza</em> is being developed by a new team that was spun off from the <em>Odyssey</em> team,” YouTuber and game dev interviewer KiwiTalkz <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1935076156115747054&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1935076156115747054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed last week</a></span>. “There are a lot of younger devs in the<em> Odyssey</em> team that grew up playing the <em>DKC</em> games and wanted to make one.” He added that to his knowledge, a new <em>3D Mario</em> is still “on the way.” </p><p>The younger spin-off team theory, reiterated by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1940034830663557249&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Andy_VGC/status/1940034830663557249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em>’s Andy Robinson</a></span>, suggests the best of both worlds: a triumphant return for 3D Donkey Kong under growing talent and as others from <em>Mario Odyssey</em> continue working on the next <em>3D Mario</em>. But everything remains speculation until <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is finally out, or Nintendo stops acting like game credits are state secrets. One of those is happening no matter what on July 17. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-3d-mario-odyssey-donkey-kong-bananza-director-1851785403]]></content:encoded>

<p>The "Strange Tales of Modern Science" mission, meanwhile, has players investigating a nearby "man of science" who claims he created artificial life near Braithwaite Manor. "Bring the strange experiment to life by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight," reads a line from the mission's description.</p><p>Then there is the "Strange Tales of The Bayou" mission that has players seeking "something unholy" in the swamps of Lagras. Finally, the "Strange Tales of the Wilderness" mission involves meeting up with a scientist who is conducting "strange research" on people in Tall Trees. "When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202" data-ratio="0.54190476190476" data-width="2100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524202"></a><figcaption>Strange indeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4524202-screenshot2025-07-01at10.20.05am.png"></figure><p>These new missions pay out 3X gold, RDO$, and XP through August 4.</p><p>Red Dead Online did not become the kind of phenomenon that GTA Online did for GTA 5, with fans saying Rockstar did not support the online mode as much as they would have liked to see.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> is out and as you can imagine, people are having a good time making their way through the free-to-play RPG. However, they've been confronted with what may be the most peculiar Atlus villain of all time: The Subway Slammer.</p>
<p>The Subway Slammer is a major antagonist in P5X's initial chapter. He's basically just a guy who shoulder charges women on the subway. No one does anything about it, leaving him to continue tormenting innocent people.</p>
<p>This may all sound a little random, but it's very much based on reality. Men who intentionally ram into people (usually women) in a manner they can then claim is an accident are dubbed "Butsukari otoko", or bumping man". It's a real, weird, horrible thing!</p>

<figcaption>It's the Subway Slammer!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CU2-2hfX_8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The community reaction to the Subway Slammer is mixed. Some are genuinely underwhelmed by what is a relatively inconsequential villain compared to other antagonists in the series. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyxunc2m">Lillie on BlueSky</a>, in reaction to the Subway Slammer's dialogue, wrote: "this looks like something someone would edit onto the textbox just as a joke".</p>
<p>Others find the absurdity of the Subway Slammer hilarious it seems. <a href="https://x.com/EXILEDpepsii/status/1939423712501272627">Memes are flooding online spaces</a>, with folks placing the Subway Slammer well above other antagonists from other properties.</p>
<p>Now you might think that people making memes about a Subway Slammer are a little bit out of line right? Persona games have featured themes of real-world problems, and the Subway Slammer is no different! <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/crime/%27bumping-men%27-are-a-uniquely-japanese-class-of-criminals-that-are-hard-to-deal-with">According to Japan Today</a>, "the severity of the bump - or in some cases even a punch - can vary quite a bit as does the purpose, whether releasing some sort of aggression, as a form of molestation, or in an attempt to claim the victim damaged an item of theirs".</p>

</span></p><p>The problem is you can't necessarily blame people for finding the depiction in P5X ridiculous, in part due to how it is portrayed. Yes, the Subway Slammer does hurt people, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heat--end.bsky.social/post/3lstcbyzjes2m">but he also states</a>: "the whole Subway is mine for the Slammin'", which let's just say doesn't have the degree of seriousness one would expect. These people aren't making light of real people doing real crimes, it's likely many of them didn't even know about 'bumping men' before they played P5X, but it's hard to take a guy called the Subway Slammer seriously.</p>
<p>This whole thing goes even deeper too. According to P5X writer Yusuke Nitta, the Subway Slammer is a creation of the game's previous writer, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/">kept anonymous in a now-deleted Tweet by Nitta</a>. Nitta stated the writer behind the Subway Slammer was like "the lord of the palace", and assured fans the story will get "more and more interesting from now on".</p>
<p>So the mastermind behind the Subway Slammer is out of a job, but his legacy shall remain forever seared into the hearts and minds of Persona fans. What he's doing these days remains a mystery, but if you ever find yourself catching a train, keep your head on a swivel. You never know if the Subway Slammer is lurking nearby…</p>

		<p>Rockstar Games has released brand new mission content for Red Dead Online with this pack of content called Strange Tales of the West. Now, according to the trailer this is volume one of Strange Tales of the West. We get a small glimpse of what to expect in Red Dead Online’s new content and you can take a gander yourself right now.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Pcg9NVGMxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer for Red Dead Online: Strange Tales of the West you will come up against zombies, alligators, a cult that worships a blood red sun, and robots that look a bit like the Cybermen from Doctor Who. Full details of each mission can be read below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Strange Tales of the Plague – There are stories of a malady spreading among the people of Armadillo, turning them into shambling undead. It’ll fall on you to retrieve several of these diseased corpses for scientific examination, if you can avoid infection and fend off attacks from a resurgent cell of nearby cultists.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of Modern Science – A nearby man of science claims he’s created artificial life that stalks the grounds of Braithwaite Manor, killing those curious or unfortunate enough to stumble upon it. Bring the strange experiment to light by discovering its secrets and destroying any automata that put up a fight.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Bayou – Something unholy lurks in the swamps of Lagras. Explore at your own risk, be wary of ambushes by Swamp Folk who call those wetlands home, and bring the swamp creature back for Theodore.</li>
<li>Strange Tales of the Wilderness – Investigate reports of a missing scientist last seen conducting strange research on a crew of murderers in Tall Trees. When the operation goes sideways, you’ll need to use your survival skills to find weapons, craft items, and hunt for food, all while tracking down the scientist and his captors.</li>
</ul>
<p>To start the Strange Tales of the West content in Red Dead Online you can visit any post office or your camp lockbox and picking up four telegrams from Theodore Levin. On completion of each mission you will get triple gold, RDO$, and experience points up until August 4th.</p>

<p>The release of this new content for Red Dead Online is a surprise as in 2022 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/08/red-dead-online-support-cut-back-as-rockstar-focuses-on-gta6/">Red Dead Online support was cut back as Rockstar moved focus to GTA 6.&nbsp;</a>The sign that support is once again up and running for Red Dead Online would suggest there is a dedicated team working on Red Dead again, and it may even point to more Red Dead news in the future.</p>

<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1400d0d0b7f88/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> developer Monolith Soft has recently reported an impressive 19% profit increase for the financial year ending March 2025.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Game Biz</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/xenoblade-dev-monolith-soft-sees-19-profit-increase/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the company recorded profits of 487 million yen during the last financial year, which is up from 409 million yen the year prior. During this period, of course, Monolith developed and released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a> for the Switch, meaning that every core Xenoblade title is now available on one system.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82xlpzhs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h10LJgMQyAc" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Monolith is also known for its extensive contributions to other Nintendo properties, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the increase, this isn't the best performance from Monolith Soft – far from it. According to the graph below, the company's highest performance came in 2021, during which it achieved nearly 1,200 million yen in profit.</p>
<figure><a title="Monolith Profits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5decb45064c45/monolith-profits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/408174">Monolight Soft / Game Biz</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of healthy numbers, reports have also been circulating to suggest that <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/01/nintendo-has-now-sold-over-5-million-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-worldwide/">Nintendo has now sold 5 million Switch 2 consoles</a> since its launch. These come via updated figures on Nintendo's official investor site, but this has since been removed. It isn't completely clear whether what the figure represents, but it's likely to be projected sales that Nintendo had mistakenly posted on its site.</p>

Both Dot Esports and The Escapist have recently been sold to "a private investor" according to press releases, though it's not apparent whether both have been sold to the same investor.</p><p>Gamurs announced the sale of Dot Esports on <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-announces-sale-of-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 13</a>, writing that the site had been sold to "a private investor." Gamurs CEO Riad Chikhani wrote that "This sale allows Dot to chart its next chapter under new ownership while enabling GAMURS to double down on our mission—serving the Gen Z audience with cutting-edge content, product innovation, and world-class brand experiences.” Gamurs bought Dot Esports in <a href="https://medium.com/@GAMURS/gamurs-acquires-dot-esports-c2fb17b2fbd0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2016</a>. </p><p>The company likewise announced the sale of The Escapist on <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-announces-sale-of-the-escapist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">June 24</a>, also noting a "private investor," with Chikhani writing, “This transition gives the brand a fresh opportunity to evolve independently, while we concentrate our efforts on building the next generation of digital media experiences for Gen Z audiences.”</p><p>Gamurs bought The Escapist in <a href="https://gamurs.group/blog/gamurs-group-acquires-6-new-gaming--esports-publications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2022</a>, alongside five other sites, from the Enthusiast Gaming network.

Following this, several of its sites began <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updating less frequently</a>, with site PC Invasion redirecting to Prima Games. Following the layoffs in September 2024, Gamurs cited effects from Google's "Helpful Content" update and, in a memo to staff at the time seen by Aftermath, said that the company would be "refocus[ing] our energy into engaging more directly, and forming more meaningful, long-term relationships with our audiences."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-battlefront-2-kyber-resurgence-day"><h3>Star Wars Battlefront 2 Is More Popular Than Ever Thanks To A Dedicated Fan Community</h3></a><p>How Star Wars Battlefront 2’s custom server and mod community supported the game’s player surge</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city"><h3>Congratulations To Zohran Mamdani, NYC’s (Second) Gamer Mayor</h3></a><p>"Unfortunately, our first gamer mayor – at least, in terms of policy – is Eric Adams"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/gamurs-dot-esports-escapist-sale]]></content:encoded>
