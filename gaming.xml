            <p>15 minutes of Astro Bot has once again leaked online, giving us a premature peek at what to expect when the game releases on 6th September.</p>
<p>In news unlikely to surprise you, the video has already been removed from YouTube (although you can still find copies of it if you're prepared to go looking), but eagle-eyed fans nonetheless managed to get a peek at the main hub, as well as a sneaky glimpse at some of the bots we can expect.</p>
<p><strong>If you'd prefer to keep everything a surprise, head back to the </strong><a href="http://eurogamer.net/"><strong>main page</strong></a><strong> now. For those excited and happy for a little head's up, read on…</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eu3tyg/15_minutes_of_astro_bot_gameplay_has_leaked_on/">u/brolt0001</a>, there wasn't much gameplay on display, but "where you see the different worlds is nice", and there's a "main hub", where "all the bots are gathered in one place doing their own thing".</p>
<p>Fans who managed to watch the video before it was pulled mentioned special bot appearances from Trico, Machine, Leon Kennedy, Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter and Raiden, Gray Fox, and Psycho Mantis from Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eu3tyg/comment/liip8ob/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Others</a> spotted Gravity Rush's Kat and Raven, Octodad, Sly Cooper, Dante, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, Persona 5's Joker, Infamous' Cole, Spyro, Pyramid Head, and the cat from Stray.</p>
<p>The leak comes just weeks after another video - this time an eight-minute snippet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-eight-minutes-of-astro-bot">leaked from ChinaJoy</a>.</p>
<p>Did you see the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-unveils-adorable-astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-complete-with-playful-pair-of-eyes">DualSense controller inspired by Astro Bot</a>? The controller itself boasts all the features you would expect from a DualSense, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. These will all come into play when Astro Bot releases next month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has updated the PC requirements for its upcoming Star Wars adventure, Star Wars Outlaws, and released a new teaser showing off what kind of performance PC players can expect when the game releases on 30th August.</p>
<p>Taking up a modest 65GB, the settings shouldn't be too punishing for those looking only to meet the minimum standards – although you will need to have DLSS or FSR – but those pushing for the "ultra" experience will need a decent rig.</p>
<p>Check out the details below:</p>

<p>The new teaser also shows off the "advanced graphics" options, which lets you tweak granular details such as the fog blur, scatter density, and microdetail and particle quality.</p>
<p>Here's the minimum, recommended, enthusiast, and ultra settings breakdown:
</p>

<p>Last month, Ubisoft raised eyebrows when it issued a vaguely-worded apology for "some elements" in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' promotional materials that had "caused concern" among some fans.
</p>
<p>Fans widely attributed the statement as referring to the ongoing backlash towards the game's inclusion of historical figure Yasuke as a Black samurai and its dual protagonist.</p>
<p>Ubisoft creative director Julian Gerighty then acknowledged online criticism of Star Wars Outlaws - specifically, the aesthetic appearance of main character Kay Vess - by stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bad-faith-discourse-not-worth-engaging-with-ubisofts-star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-says">"bad-faith" debates are "not worth engaging with"</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re passionate about gaming, you’re in luck: the gaming market is expanding rapidly, bringing an ever-<br>growing array of exciting titles. However, the cost of keeping up with the latest games can be steep, especially<br>with rising inflation and prices. Fortunately, there are several strategies to help you enjoy your favorite hobby<br>without breaking the bank. Here’s how you can make the most of your gaming experience while staying budget-<br>friendly.</p>



<h2 id="h-shop-for-games-online">Shop for games online</h2>



<p>One of the most effective ways to save money on games is by shopping online. Digital platforms often offer<br>promotions and discounts that are harder to find in physical stores. Online shopping provides access to seasonal<br>sales, special offers, and exclusive deals that can significantly reduce the cost of new games. Subscribing to<br>gaming newsletters can also keep you informed about the latest deals and discounts. However, be mindful of<br>the SPAM folder in your email, as some offers might end up there. Regularly checking this folder ensures you<br>don’t miss out on any valuable deals.</p>



<h2 id="h-compare-prices-and-choose-the-best-deals">Compare prices and choose the best deals</h2>



<p><a href="https://gg.deals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GG.deals</a> platform offers various features designed to help users navigate the complex digital game market and<br>discover exceptional deals. GG.deals functions as more than just a website; it acts as a comprehensive tool for<br>tracking game prices, comparing offers, and receiving discount notifications, all while ensuring that all data<br>comes from legitimate sources. The platform’s “Offers” section highlights top discounts. It facilitates the<br>exploration of deals across major digital distribution platforms and stores, including Steam, Uplay, Battle.net,<br>and Origin, as well as console games for platforms like PS5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch. Users can easily<br>search for specific titles to find the lowest current prices, access price history, and view game information,<br>including DLC details. GG.deals also monitors prices for subscription services like Humble Bundle and Xbox<br>Game Pass, making it an invaluable resource for both new and seasoned gamers. The platform’s features<br>extend to price histories, statistical insights, and community reviews, providing users with a wealth of<br>information to make informed purchasing decisions. Moreover, GG.deals fosters a vibrant gaming community<br>where users share recommendations and experiences, further enhancing the platform’s appeal. With<br>continuous improvements and innovative features, including a new Deal Rating system and an “Ending Soon”<br>section for time-sensitive deals, GG.deals stands out as a dynamic and indispensable tool for gamers seeking to<br>save money while exploring the vast gaming landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-gaming-subscriptions">Consider gaming subscriptions</h2>



<div><p>Subscription services can be a fantastic way to access a large library of games for a fixed monthly fee. Services<br>like Xbox Game Pass and Humble Choice offer a wide range of titles at a fraction of the cost of purchasing<br>games individually.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass provides access to a vast library of games for both Xbox and PC, including many of the latest<br>releases. Humble Choice offers a selection of downloadable games each month along with discounts on<br>additional purchases through Humble Bundle. These subscriptions can be particularly cost-effective for avid<br>gamers who want to explore a diverse range of games without a significant financial commitment.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-take-advantage-of-free-games">Take advantage of free games</h2>



<p>Many platforms offer free games as part of promotions or subscriptions, which can help keep costs down. Epic<br>Games Store provides new free games every week, while Amazon Prime Gaming offers additional games and in-game bonuses as part of an Amazon Prime subscription. Occasionally, Steam also runs promotions offering free games. Keeping an eye on these offers is a smart way to expand your game library without spending extra money.</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-giftcards">Consider giftcards</h2>



<p>Another budget-friendly approach is to ask for games as gifts. Consider requesting digital gift cards for<br>platforms like Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, or EA App during special occasions. Gift cards give you the<br>flexibility to choose the games you want and avoid the risk of receiving titles that might not be to your taste.<br>Gaming is a fantastic way to escape reality and immerse yourself in new worlds.

            <p>Vampire Survivors' free Darkasso update is now available on Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>"It's been a while since we added a new major feature, so we tried not to spoil the contents of this patch immediately," Poncle teased in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/4361257526921495473?l=english">patch notes</a>. "Hope it worked to keep the contents a bit of a surprise."</p>

<p>New additions include nine new extra achievements, a new challenge stage and relic, two new "special character skins", and five new Arcanas to spice up your experience.</p>
<p>"Just like the original 22 Arcanas, the new ones introduced in this patch are to be considered experimental and subject to change," the team explained.</p>
<p>"Please post your feedback and comments on the effects of the new 5 cards so that we can keep improving them over time and also influence the design of the future ones."</p>
<p>There's also a breakdown of the new Arcana cards and skins, but Poncle popped all of that stuff behind spoiler tags, so I won't be sharing it here, either. However, I can tell you that the skins are special because as well as changing how things look, they also revise your stats and weapons…</p>
<p>"These two unlocks require quite a bit of effort, so if that's not your thing, please remember that the Secrets-Cast Spell menu (and some googling) are there to help you," Poncle said.</p>
<p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-minimalist-survival-action-hits-ps4-and-ps5-later-this-month">Vampire Survivors is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a> on 29th August.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors' PlayStation release will include all free content released so far - adding up to over 40 playable characters and 80 weapons – and all four of its paid DLCs (Legacy of Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meetings, and Operation Guns) will be available for purchase on PS5 and PS4 at launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent video uploaded by Watchful Wolf, the ‘founder’ of the H2M ‘Modern Warfare 2 Remastered’ mod, the reasoning for Activision’s cease and desist order was outlined. In the last week, this highly anticipated multiplayer mod went from sitting atop a hype train to derailing suddenly as Activision Blizzard ordered the project be shut down under threat of legal action.</p>



<p>As it turns out, Activision’s reasons for closing down the project were nothing short of selfish and somewhat ridiculous.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-protecting-sales">Protecting Sales</h2>



<p>In the video uploaded to YouTube – which you can see below – Watchful Wolf breaks down the cease and desist order the team received ahead of the launch of H2M, the Modern Warfare 2 mod. This would have been a masterful recreation of Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer <strong>built in </strong>COD 4 Remastered, but Activision wanted none of the smoke.</p>



<p>Here’s what Watchful Wolf said was the reason behind the C&amp;D:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining and how close it is to Black Ops 6, releasing and kind of the marketing and the beta stuff like that, they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to explain that no matter what game they used to build this project, Activision would have clamped down regardless as the company doesn’t want anything disrupting sales of Black Ops 6, which is due to be released on October 25.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="What happened and what's next...?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhHQ76SgPUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>H2M picked up a huge amount of hype in a short period, and for a while, top creators were making videos while playing the game. This drove the anticipation of the mod and pushed up sales for COD 4 Remastered on Steam, which was a prerequisite for getting hold of the H2M mod.</p>



<p>Even though Activision ordered the shutdown of the project and the team bowed to those demands, <strong>someone </strong>managed to leak H2M online, so it’s still playable in a sense.</p>



<p>Were you looking forward to playing H2M?</p>

            <p>JDM: Rise Of The Scorpion is a free prologue for JDM: Japanese Drift Master, a racing game about - who could guess - drift racing in Japan. It's got an open world set in rural towns to burn rubber around as well as several story missions to play. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364930/JDM_Rise_of_the_Scorpion/">download it from Steam now</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Does "prologue" just mean this is a demo? Well, it's certainly designed to demonstrate the world and driving of the full game, but its story is also acting as an actual prologue, telling a separate story about a different protagonist than Japanese Drift Master proper. In Rise Of The Scorpion you play as "rebellious high schooler Hatori", who seems like an idiot jerk and I turned against him within just a few brief manga pages. Big "villain of the main game" vibes.
</p>
<p>There's plenty to like about Rise Of The Scorpion otherwise. Its setting around the fictional Haikama Lake is lovely, peppered by small towns and back roads. It's a very different ambiance than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/night-runners-prologue-demo-is-a-stylish-throwback-to-playstation-racing-classics">the urban permadark of Tokyo-set Night Runners Prologue</a>, another recent racing game demo.
</p>
<p>The bucolic beauty matters because though I've seen every Fast and the Furious movie, and subjected myself to Tokyo Drift <em>twice</em>, to my great shame I've never mastered the art of drifting in video game cars. I'm so bad at drifting that in four attempts I couldn't even finish the first mission in Rise Of The Scorpion. I instead had fun playing it as JPM: Japanese Parking Master, and pulling up outside kissas and sushi restaurants in different spots where I could admire the trees, vending machines, the overhead electricity cables.
</p>
<p>If I'd got further, perhaps I'd have seen more of the game's systems, which include cars that can be modded, a day/night cycle, and weather.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364930/view/4334237198185367692">there are a bunch of driving assists</a>, switched off on startup, that might have helped me. I'll give it another go and hopefully get good enough to be able to make progress when the full game releases, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">via Steam</a>, sometime later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've got a real soft spot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a>, a rhythm game about tooting along to music that works perfectly with the mouse. I'm also a huge fan of Beat Saber, a rhythm game in which you slice at blocks that whizz towards you in VR.
</p>
<p>You can see where this is going. Trombone Champ: Unflattened transports that 2022 tooting into 2024 virtual reality.

<p>This is a no brainer: yes, I will hold my hands in front of me as if holding a trombone, and parp most virtually. Unflattened seems to add a lot more than the shift in perspective, however. You can customise your trombone by spraypainting it different colours, there are collectible cards, there's a narrative mode, and there are 50 tracks to play.
</p>
<p>The VR port is being handled by Flat2VR Studios, who previously made a VR version of FlatOut, among others. It's due to be released this autumn for all the primary VR headsets, including via Steam.
</p>
<p>Hopefully it also includes mod support. Most of my love of Trombone Champ is born from what the community has done with it, whether the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">running jokes and growing ambition of Gloomhonk's custom tracks</a> or the good-spirited competition of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">Trombone Champ championships</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>GTA: San Andreas is one of the most popular video games of all time. It was released in 2004 by Rockstar Games, but even today, it remains a top-tier title enjoyed by thousands of gamers worldwide. It’s a sandbox title that can be explored at will, and there are hundreds of hours of content wrapped up in the game. That’s why we’ve assembled a guide highlighting the best San Andreas cheats and codes, so you can push that concept further than ever.</p>



<p>If you’ve been looking for the top cheat codes for San Andreas, look no further than this page. We’ve listed the best cheats for GTA San Andreas below for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-cheats-on-san-andreas">How to Use Cheats on San Andreas</h2>



<p>Using San Andreas cheat codes is simple. If you’re playing on a console with a controller, you simply press the buttons in the order that they’re written when playing the game. If you’ve done it right, you’ll see a message pop up saying ‘Cheat Activated’. If you’re playing on a PC with a keyboard, you’ll have to type in the corresponding letters and numbers to activate the cheat code.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-turn-off-cheats-in-san-andreas">How to Turn Off Cheats in San Andreas</h3>



<p>Turning off San Andreas codes couldn’t be easier – you just need to re-enter the code that you’ve just typed or tapped in, and that’s it. If you’re successful, you’ll see the message ‘Cheat Deactivated’ appear.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-san-andreas-cheats-safe">Are San Andreas Cheats Safe?</h2>



<p>If you cheat in GTA San Andreas and then save the game, you’ll be given a warning about the potential corruption of your save file. However, as someone who has cheated thousands of times in GTA San Andreas over twenty years, I can say that I’ve never had any issues with my game when using cheats.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean that you won’t have issues, of course – but it’s unlikely.</p>

<p>Even though there are still eight days left in the Esports World Cup schedule, Team Falcons has earned so many Club Championship points that no other organisation can knock them off the top spot. To that end, the Esports World Cup Foundation has announced that ‘no matter what happens now’, Team Falcons has won the $7 million grand prize in the Club Championship.</p>



<p>Presently, the organisation sits on a whopping 4160 CC points, with Team Liquid sitting in second place with 1760. It’s such an immense gulf that fans knew what was going to happen from a very early stage, but not everyone is happy for Team Falcons’ victory.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-host-with-the-most">The Host With The Most</h2>



<p>Team Falcons is playing on home turf, given that the organisation hails from Saudi Arabia. The team’s chairman, Mossad Aldossary, was just competing in the EA FC portion of the EWC but failed to qualify for the playoffs. From the outset, Team Falcons busied itself with assembling a roster in more games than any other organisation, which gave it a serious advantage right off the bat.</p>



<p>As we approach the final week of the tournament, the organisation has <strong>won </strong>the Call of Duty Warzone and Free Fire tournaments and wound up placing high in the Apex Legends and ML:BB events. It also scraped points in Dota 2, ML:BB Women, Overwatch 2, and Fortnite.</p>



<p>Now, the Esports World Cup Foundation has confirmed that no matter what, Team Falcons is the unequivocal winner of the EWC:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many fans have taken to social media to claim that Team Falcons ‘bought the win’, signing some of the best players in their respective games and fielding an overwhelming number of rosters that few organisations could compete against.</p>



<p>This means that Team Falcons will lift the first Club Championship trophy and walk away with a massive $7 million prize, on top of what it earned in the various games it competed in.</p>



<p>Speaking on stream, Chairman Mossad Aldossary said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I want to thank everyone – all of our fans, all our supporters, all of our employees, everyone that worked hard. Now, finally, we can say it’s home – it’s home, it’s home, it’s home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He did stress that he and his organisation did it for the ‘Saudi people’, and that the trophy ‘won’t leave the country’. Some might call it patriotic, but others are suggesting it was nothing short of predictable.</p>



<p>What’s incredible is that there are still so many games yet to wrap up at the event:</p>



<ul>
<li>Modern Warfare 3</li>



<li>EA FC</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>PUBG</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>ESL R1</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you surprised that Team Falcons won the Club Championship? Let us know.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>'s Realms servers have been down for most of the past four days. Mojang's official account for reporting service status updates noted that "intermittent failures or slowdowns" began on August 13th, and despite similarly intermittent reports of uptime in the days since, the servers remain inaccessible to most players today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Realms is a paid subscription service that grants access to a private multiplayer server for Minecraft's multiplatform Bedrock Edition. It lets between three and 10 players (depending on subscription tier) join the same Minecraft world, with the owner able to install mods from Minecraft's paid marketplace.
</p>
<p>"You may experience intermittent failures or slowdowns connecting to Realms. We are actively working to resolve this," the Mojang Status account <a href="https://x.com/MojangStatus">tweeted on Tuesday</a>.
</p>
<p>By Wednesday, the service was said to be "up and running", albeit with some latency issues, according to the official account. Players in the replies disagreed, with hundreds noting that they were still unable to play. There were further statements that the team was continuing to work on the issues until yesterday, when Realms was declared to be "back up and running globally. It has been running healthy for more than the last hour. You should be able to see, manage, and play on your Realms again. Thank you again for patience as we worked through the issues."
</p>
<p>Within hours, another tweet noted that connectivity issues and latency had since increased again. That brings us up until this morning, around eleven hours ago, when Mojang confirmed they were "still hard at work to restore the service globally."
</p>
<p>I tried to connect a couple of hours ago to my own Realms account and it's still down for me.
</p>
<p>The connection issues seemingly began with the release of Minecraft update 1.21.20, which amended how Realms invite links work, as well as aiming to fix several Realms bugs and Minecraft bugs more generally, <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/29110275666957-Minecraft-1-21-20-Bedrock">as per the patch notes</a>. A second update, 1.21.21 was released the following day <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/29279683879949-Minecraft-1-21-21-Bedrock">solely to improve "reliability of connecting to Realms."</a> I guess it didn't work.
</p>
<p>Minecraft is a true marvel, but the infrastructure that surrounds the Bedrock edition often feels like it's held together by sticky tape and greed. I hate every second I have to spend managing my Realms account, and yet it's a price I'm willing to pay so I can play Minecraft cross-platform with my kid. I'm less willing to pay the price of £6.69 a month for a Realms server that doesn't work for days at a time, however.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[All About Dragon Age: The Veilguard Character Creation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-about-dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creation.955950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Whenever there’s a new RPG on the horizon, there’s usually one question on everyone’s mind. Does it offer character creation? Most of us want to play as a character we design, not a fully-voiced protagonist that no one relates to. With that said, here’s an overview of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creation!</p>



<h2 id="h-character-creator-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Character Creator in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>



<p>In Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the first step in your journey is character creation. You will have an opportunity to design your protagonist from the ground up, selecting their defining features and traits, including skin tone, scars, tattoos, hairstyles, beards, eye color, and so much more. But such choices are purely cosmetic and don’t alter gameplay. The most important decisions you’ll make during character creation include the race, faction, and class of your main character.</p>



<h3 id="h-race">Race</h3>



<p>Like in Dragon Age: Inquisition, Dragon Age: The Veilguard features four distinct races to select from, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dwarf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Qunari</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Human is the most basic race in all of fantasy lore, essentially a stock character selection for those who don’t feel too adventurous. Elves are the oppressed race of Thedas and, as such, will endure unique dialogue from others who look down upon the people. Dwarves, the iconic fantasy race, are short and stocky craftsmen and merchants. They have no connection to the Fade, however, and as such, cannot become mages. Lastly, the Qunari are unique to the world of Thedas. They’re horned giants who follow their religion strictly, while many take on the role of mercenaries across the land.</p>



<h3 id="h-faction">Faction</h3>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-factions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six unique factions</a>, all of which serve as origins for our main character, and do influence the world and story in the game. These six include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Antivan Crows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grey Wardens</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lords of Fortune</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mourn Watch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shadow Dragons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veil Jumpers</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-class">Class</h3>



<p>Lastly, you will choose your class, which affects your overall playstyle in combat encounters. There are three to select from:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rogue</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-the-main-character-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-voiced">Is The Main Character in Dragon Age: The Veilguard Voiced?</h2>



<p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s voice actors</a>, we do know that Dragon Age: The Veilguard features a fully-voiced protagonist. During character creation, you can select from one of four voices: two male and two female. </p>



<p>As the character does have a voice, we fully suspect that voice will play an integral role in the game’s cutscenes and stories. For those who were hoping for a silent protagonist, maybe next time, unfortunately.</p>
