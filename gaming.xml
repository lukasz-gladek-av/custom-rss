            <p>Julian Gerighty, a long-time key cog at Massive Entertainment, has announced that he's departing the Ubisoft-owned studio after 12 years to go and work on Battlefield at EA. His departure swiftly follows Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">revealing earlier this week</a> that they're planning to lay off staff at Massive, with a voluntary redundancy process late last year reportedly having not resulted in enough departures to stave off this bloodletting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the publishers have opted to take the opportunity of Gerighty's departure to reassure folks that The Division series is just fine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"While we’ll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we’ll continue to bring the world he’s been part of creating to our players for years to come,” Ubisoft wrote in <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">said statement</a>. "For our players, don’t worry, Agents. Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p>
<p>"It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure," Gerighty wrote in his own <a href="https://x.com/jgerighty/status/2012156450039033939">departure tweet</a>. "The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on."</p>
<p>According to Ubisoft, veteran Division developers Yannick Banchereau and Mathias Karlson remain creative directors on The Division 2 and The Division 3 respectively, while The Division creative director Magnus Jansen is now helming The Division 2's extraction mode Survivors.</p>
<p>The Division 3 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced back in 2023</a>, but word in had had gone pretty quiet until <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-says-producer/">Gerighty recently said</a> in an appearance that the New Game+ Showcase that he reckoned it'll "have as big an impact" as the first Division game.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-definitive-edition-looks-like-it-may-be-thing-assuming-this-poster-in-japans-the-real-deal">a poster</a> spotted at a Ubisoft-run esports event in Japan earlier this week prompted speculation that a definitive edition of that first entry into the Clancy-filled series might be about to be revealed. As of writing, no such announcement's been forthcoming.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-banter-references-gta-pokemon-67-2000660614</link>
            <guid>1408414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Deadpool, Marvel’s merc with a mouth who loves to spout off meta jokes and wink at the camera, is the kind of gimmick character that can come together like a spectacular, fourth-wall-breaking fireworks show or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>be so grating and obnoxious</span></a><span> that he can push you away from a project entirely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, Wade Wilson can’t just hijack the whole game with his antics; he has to synergize with the established dynamics of other heroes’ tool kits and banter. As such, developer NetEase has found a ton of really smart and funny ways to slot Deadpool into the game that are additive, rather than disruptive. And yes, he drops a fair amount of fun pop culture references to media both in and out of the Marvel universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool’s in-game abilities and behavior </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>include numerous nods to his tendency to break the fourth wall</span></a><span>, with comic-book-style panels and pop-ups often appearing around him, </span><a href="https://x.com/HoshizoraTTV/status/2012008202855203157"><span>in-character ability descriptions</span></a><span> that you can swap to the straightforward, “emotionless” descriptions written by the NetEase team for clarity’s sake if you prefer, and even the ability to have conversations with announcer Galacta.</span></p>

    <p><span>His banter with </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ other heroes is full of nods to pretty much every facet of the Marvel multimedia franchise. He makes references to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8EaW9rnSJNc"><i><span>Rivals</span></i><span> community leakers</span></a><span> and memes as well as to the MCU’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>fumbling multiverse saga</span></a><span>, and there’s also an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/waHFQEfGY-c"><span>“It’s Morbin’ Time!” line</span></a><span> referencing the notorious Sony</span> <span>flop </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-twitch-movie-morbing-time-nintendo-switch-1848987370"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-is-desperate-to-make-avengers-doomsday-the-biggest-event-of-2026-2000659295"><span>pretentious and self-important as Marvel has become</span></a><span> in the past 20 years as its movies have shifted pop culture, Deadpool does usually act as a reminder that someone in the writing room is paying attention to the criticism people have been levying at the franchise for years now. Even </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>taking shots at the MCU from the inside</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>But it’s not all Marvel references. It’s fitting that in a video game Deadpool would borrow lines from series like </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Super Mario</span></i><span>. There’s some stuff from other media as well, like </span><i><span>Spongebob Squarepants</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, voice actor Alejandro Saab ad-libbed several of these lines and “can’t believe” that NetEase kept them in the game. Oh, and you’ll also find some memes like “67” and “Hawk Tuah” in the mix. The “67” one is </span><a href="https://x.com/nerdyomniman/status/2011606344210792595"><span>pretty clever, at least</span></a><span>, and can’t be spammed like the one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-soldier-76-6-7-emote-season-20-release-date-2000651668"><span>another hero shooter</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY KEPT ALL OF THIS! HAHAHAHAHA I love my job 🤣 <a href="https://t.co/IYABRuTEZq">https://t.co/IYABRuTEZq</a></p> <p>— Alejandro Saab | DEADPOOL | Marvel Rivals (@KaggyFilms) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaggyFilms/status/2011962195064525201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Deadpool launches today as part of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ sixth season.</span></p>

                <p>The Italian Competition Authority is investigating Activision Blizzard over claims that the mobile games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile engage in "misleading and aggressive practices."</p><p><a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The watchdog said</a> the games are structured in such a way to encourage people to "play more often, extend their gaming sessions, and take up promoted offers" through "the possible use of deceptive user-interface design."</p><p>"Examples include repeated prompts, both during and outside gameplay, urging users not to miss out on rewards--also through in-app messages and push notifications--as well as to purchase time-limited items before they become unavailable," the group said.</p><p>"These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers--including minors--leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved."</p><p>The group further claims that the parental controls in Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile default to options "that offer a lower level of protection for minors," including allowing in-game purchases, social features, and "unlimited play time."</p><p>The Italian Competition Authority also said it wants to look into how Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile go about collecting personal data. "It seems that consumers--including minors--are led to select all consent options, including consent to profiling for commercial purposes, in the belief that they are faced with a mandatory choice," the group said.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment. The company and its franchises are now owned by Microsoft following the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout.</p>

            <p>Senior producer for The Division series Julian Gerighty has announced his departure from Ubisoft, heading over to Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">In a statement posted to social media</a>, the official Massive Entertainment account posted its fond farewells to Gerighty. It reads: "Today we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a> franchise is heading off on to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios. While we will miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come.</p>
<p>"Julian, your legacy is part of this studio and remember: once an Agent, always an Agent."</p>

<p>This post ends with a short paragraph reassuring fans of The Division that the series will be left in good hands now that Gerighty is leaving, concluding: "Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/i/status/2012156450039033939">Gerighty himself posted a personal update</a>, stating: "It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division"</p>
<p>This news comes only a few months after <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487">Massive Entertainment had to curb rumours that Gerighty was leaving the company</a>, and just one week after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">he took part in an interview during the New Game + showcase</a>. During this interview he described The Division 3 as "a monster", and shared his belief it would have: "as big of an impact as The Division 1".</p>
<p>Despite this peculiar timing, it does appear as if both Massive Entertainment and Julian are leaving on good terms. Which is nice, we should all be so lucky. The Division 3, the project he is leaving behind, still hasn't got a release date are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quietly-confirms-its-working-on-the-division-3">remains a bit of a mystery over at Ubisoft and Massive</a>. One wonders if we'll be seeing it soon...</p>

<p>While the free ver. 3.0 update arrived a little earlier than expected for <em>all</em> users (Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2), yesterday marked the big release of Nintendo's latest paid Switch 2 upgrade. This one includes a resolution bump, the new Megaphone item, Mouse Mode integration, and beefed-up online capabilities to make the most of GameChat.</p>
<p>It's something of a slight package, considering there's no free path between the two (it'll only set you back £4.19 / $4.99 to upgrade, but still), and that was our Alex's biggest gripe in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">6/10 review</a>. "It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features," he wrote, "but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196240 @ 1768582806 -->
<p>But of course, this is Animal Crossing: New Horizons that we're talking about, perhaps <em>the</em> defining game of the Switch generation, so we want to hear what you think too.</p>
<p>Whether you've spent the whole day getting to grips with the latest addition to the NS2E lineup, or you're just diving in for the first time, you can tell us what you make of the upgrade in the following poll. And don't worry if you want to change your mind later on, you can come back whenever and do exactly that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On the onset of this year's edition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CES</strong>, NVIDIA took advantage of one of the key tech shows of the year to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">introduce NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a> which, in its early iteration, left pretty much everyone <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stunned</strong>, delivering in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>Quality mode better than native resolution quality in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/this-really-puts-a-nail-in-amd-fsr-redstones-coffin-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nvidia-dlss-4-5-performance-mode-stuns-with-image-quality-close-to-native-4k/"><strong> close to native resolution image quality in Performance mode in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></strong></a></p>



<p>The impressive image quality, however, comes at a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">performance cost</strong> on previous-generation <strong>RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs</strong>, as older-generation cards lack <strong>FP8 support</strong>, which NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 leverages to deliver its stunning results. However, the performance hit may not be as severe as expected on some older GPUs, such as the RTX 3080.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmark PC</strong></a> compares <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em> running at 4K, 1440p, and 1090p resolutions at Ultra Settings and with ray tracing with Ultra Performance mode at 4K resolution, Balanced mode at 1440p resolution, and Quality mode at 1080p resolution using the following presets:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DLSS 3 - Preset E</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4 - Preset K</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4.5 - Preset L for Ultra Performance and Preset M for everything else</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The results are, as YouTube user darknuance_ix put it, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"not bad at all."</em> While the <strong>performance hit is noticeable</strong>, it's, on average, <strong>lower than expected</strong> - in the <strong>8, 12 FPS range at all resolutions</strong> from NVIDIA DLSS 3 to DLSS 4.5. </p>



<p>As such, the latest version of the upscaler powered by the 2nd-generation Transformer model may still be a viable option for those still rocking RTX 20 and 30 series cards, who also have the option of setting a lower base resolution and still enjoy excellent image quality to offset the performance loss, although how effective this will be will obviously vary depending on the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gryphline-announces-arknights-endfield-pc-beta-test-system-requirements-revealed/">After multiple beta tests</a>, publisher <strong>Gryphline</strong> and developer <strong>Mountain Contour's</strong> action RPG and factory management game, <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, is finally due to launch globally next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> and over <strong>35 million players are pre-registered</strong> and ready for its arrival.</p>



<p>The news came along with a new launch trailer that you can see below, which, based on its comments, is more than successful at getting players hyped up for next week's launch. While the release date was initially revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a></strong> with a live performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xm45NwWOlo">from <strong>One Republic</strong> performing the song featured in the trailer below,</a> at the time of that performance, the game only had 30 million players pre-registered.</p>



<p>This means the game received another <strong>5 million</strong> pre-registrations over the holiday period, which also unlocked the final tier of community rewards for players, <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us#milestone">per the game's official website</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the hype trailer above, Gryphline and Mountain Contour also released two more trailers. An Operator story trailer titled "<em>The Five: Sparks that Shatter the Darkness</em>," and a gameplay trailer that shows off a bit of the action and environments players can expect when they jump into the free-to-play action RPG next week. Here's the story trailer:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After Arknights: Endfield's last beta test, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto not only got a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming action RPG, but he also got to speak with the game's lead designer and producer. In his preview, Kai wrote, "<em>Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition</em>."</p>

            <guid>1408375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kathleen Kennedy, who helped produce and create films like <em>Jurassic Park, E.T., </em>and <em>Indiana Jones,</em> is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dave-filoni-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy-2000706230">officially stepping down</a> from her role as Lucasfilm president after holding the position since George Lucas left following the Disney deal in 2012. And in a new interview with Kennedy, the longtime producer and filmmaker shared some updates on various<em> Star Wars</em> projects, and the one <em>Star Wars</em> project that left her with regrets.</p> <p>On January 15, after announcing her departure from Lucasfilm, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/kathleen-kennedy-exit-interview-1236665253/"><em>Deadline</em> posted a lengthy interview</a> with the outgoing producer and president covering a whole lot of ground. Depressingly, Kennedy seems to be excited about AI and wants to work with the tech to make new stuff. She also told the outlet that she’s been planning this exit for a few years now and hand-picked her successors, <em>Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni and veteran ILM manager Lynwen Brennan. And while she’ll still be around producing future <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, including Ryan Gosling’s <em>Starfight</em>er and the upcoming <em>Mandalorian and Grogu</em> flick, it’s clear from this interview that Kennedy was tired of Disney not wanting to take more risks on projects like <em>Andor</em>.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy and an update on the Ben Solo movie</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest news to come out of this interview is Kennedy sharing the status of various<em> Star Wars</em> movie projects and<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/kathleen-kennedy-clarifies-lucasfilm-exit-star-wars-future-1236304421/"> confirming that the previously announced <em>Star Wars </em>trilogy</a> being led by screenwriter Simon Kinberg is still happening, at least for now.</p>

 <p>“<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-ashoka-trailer-rey-new-jedi-order-1850313084#:~:text=Plus%20two%20more,%2C%20%5Band%5D%20Ashoka.%E2%80%9D">[James] Mangold’s is really on the back burner</a>, as is Soderbergh’s [Ben Solo film],” Kennedy told the outlet. “I think the ones by Taika and Donald [Glover] are still somewhat alive. That’s going to really be up to the new team to figure out. Dave, I know that Dave [Filoni] and Lynwen [Brennan] are very much on board with what Simon [Kinnberg]’s doing, and that would be a new trilogy. In the timeline of things, that takes you well into 2030 plus. So that’s really what’s up next.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-trilogy-skywalker-saga-episode-10-11-12-kinbe-1851692144">It was previously reported that this new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy</a> wouldn’t be connected to the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, but it is also possible that things have changed. Kennedy makes it clear in this interview that putting together <em>Star Wars</em> movies takes many years of dedication, and a lot of directors and filmmakers aren’t willing to commit to such an undertaking. That likely explains the large number of canceled and delayed <em>Star Wars</em> movies over the last seven years or so. As for the status of Kinberg’s first film in this new trilogy, it doesn’t sound close to filming at all.</p>

 <p>“[Kinberg is] working right now.,” said Kennedy. “He wrote something that we read in August, and it was very good, but not there. We’ve pretty much upended the story, and then spent a great deal of time on the treatment, which he finished literally about four weeks ago. And it’s a very detailed treatment, like 70 pages. And so he is expected to give us something in March.”</p>

 <p>I wouldn’t get too excited about this trilogy yet. Remember that Rian Johnson, who directed <em>The Last Jedi,</em> was tapped to direct a new trilogy of films after his 2017 <em>Star Wars</em> movie was a big hit. But according to Kennedy, the negative firestorm online scared him away, and he got distracted with <em>Knives Out</em> and its sequels. So who knows if this new trilogy will happen anytime soon or ever.</p>

 <h2>Regrets and concerns about studios being too afraid of risk</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kennedy called the script for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628">Ben Solo movie</a>, whose existence was leaked publicly by Adam Driver last year and got fans very excited, “great.” And it could still happen, according to her. “Anything’s a possibility if somebody’s willing to take a risk.” However, that seems unlikely as the longtime Lucasfilm boss explained that, at the moment, Disney and other big studios aren’t interested in taking bold swings and big risks.</p> <p>“Right now we’re in an era where companies are so risk-averse, and I get it,” said Kennedy. “I hear all the conversations. They’ve got Wall Street to please, and I get it, but I also believe that that’s what contributes to things disappearing, ultimately. I just think you have to take those chances. Everything I just reeled off to you is taking a bit of a chance because none of those filmmakers are just walking in trying to do the same old, same old. I’m excited by that, but the studio’s nervous about that, and that’s kind of where it sits at the moment.”</p> <p>And as for whether she has any regrets from her time as president of Lucasfilm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-solo-1826489974">Kennedy listed the 2018 <em>Solo</em> spin-off movie</a> as the only one because, according to her, they tried to replace Harrison Ford, and that was always going to be a nearly impossible challenge.</p> <p>“We were so excited about that idea,” said Kennedy. “And then when you’re into something, and you realize fundamentally, conceptually, you cannot replace Han Solo, at least right now. As wonderful as Alden Ehrenreich was, and he really was good, and is a wonderful actor, we put him in an impossible situation. And once you’re in it and once you’re committed, you’ve got to carry on. I think I have a bit of regret about that, but not about the moviemaking and filmmaking. I don’t have regrets about that. I just think that conceptually, we did it too soon.”</p>

		<p>Clawing its way to the number one spot as our most wanted video game of 2026, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> has carved up the competition as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man">Spider-Man</a> developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, prepares to show us more of this hugely anticipated PlayStation exclusive.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s release schedule having looked a little light in terms of first party blockbusters, the company is no doubt hoping that lighting will strike twice following the mammoth commercial success of its web-slinging Spider-Man series. However, instead of taking that tried and tested open world formula fuelling these games and applying it to a different superhero, Insomniac is going for a change in not only genre, but tone as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Marvel’s Wolverine looks set to be the grittiest, most mature game the studio has worked on since the Resistance trilogy on PlayStation 3. It makes sense, really: to try and sanitise a comic book character so steeped in violence and bloodshed would be absurd, but that’s not to say Wolverine won’t be as visually rich or character-driven as the recent trio of Spider-Man adventures.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>We’ve yet to see a full combat demo though it’s hard to imagine Insomniac passing up the opportunity to craft another clever, layered web of gameplay mechanics which embodies what the lead character is best known for. We’re expecting acrobatic lunges, spinning claws, and some rather gnarly takedowns as teased in Sony’s most recent trailer.</p>

<p>Part of what made Marvel’s Spider-Man such a big hit was its refusal to cart out yet another adaptation of his origin story. While Wolverine’s own past has been explored numerous times in movies (without mentioning the myriad comic book arcs over the years) there’s plenty there for gamers to sink their claws into without it being overly familiar. From what we’ve seen and heard, it appears as though Marvel’s Wolverine will visit various flashpoints in the character’s life, including his escape from Weapon X, his pursuit of a quiet life in Canada, and a trip to Madripoor.</p>
<p>We also know who will play Wolverine in this upcoming video game adaptation with Liam McIntyre lending his gravelly voice to the X-Men legend. Speaking of X-Men, what we’re perhaps most excited for is seeing how other famous faces make their way into the game with Mystique and Omega Red due to make an appearance. If Sony is going all-in on creating a Marvel gaming universe, it will also be interesting to see how this game links back to Spider-Man.</p>
<p>There’s no launch date for Marvel’s Wolverine just yet though we’re expecting it to land sometime in the second half of 2026, perhaps even looking to capitalise on the snowballing excitement surrounding Avenger’s Doomsday and its December theatrical release.</p>
<p><em>And so end our countdown of the hottest games coming this year. Be sure to check out our other</em><em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a> entries for the full list.</em></p>

            <p>According to long-time Bethesda developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> co-lead designer Kurt Kuhlmann, he was originally told he'd be leading the charge on basting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">great turkey</a> that is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. That didn't end up coming to pass and, having left Bethesda back in 2023, the developer's now spilled the beans as to the sort of story he envisioned the follow-up to The Elder Scrolls 6 telling.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to Kuhlmann in a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Todd Howard verbally promised him this role in the aftermath Skyrim's release. At that point, a return to the Elder Scrolls was pencilled in to be next up once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> was out of the door - the studio instead ended up taking lengthy detours to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen. And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead." Kuhlmann recalled. "So, Todd said, 'Well, we want you to have an important role in the project.' But what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point." While he does cite it as a factor in his decision to leave Bethesda for his current gig, alongside changes in the likes of communication process during development that the company's growth in size over time has brought about, the developer said with hindsight that he reckons he might not have enjoyed being lead on the game.</p>
<p>As for the direction he might have taken its story in had he been in charge of shaping that, Kuhlmann pointed to The Empire Strikes Back. As Skyrim's events heavily foreshadow, the Thalmor-led Aldmeri Dominion - lead by elven supremacists seeking control over all of Tamriel - would be making more strides towards that goal. Rather than being an all-powerful "chosen one" directly standing up to this enemy, the player would instead have more lowkey role, with the ending involving them keeping hope for an eventual victory in a future Elder Scrolls entry by succeeding in a task like keeping a handy heir alive.</p><p>However, that last part is something the developer's not sure would have worked or gotten the thumbs up, since it leans into unhappy ending or cliffhanger territory, with the pace of game releases nowadays making ending on such notes for a game this size a potentially unpopular choice.</p>
<p>All in all, the broad strokes Kuhlmann outlines for his story are the sort of path I've long seen Skyrim as pointing the series' narrative in, minus perhaps the protagonist's power being limited to 'person who can't use world-shattering abilities to destroy the bad right now'. Whether that would have made for a great Elder Scrolls game is something we'll likely never know unless the dev has just accidentally revealed what happens to be Bethesda's current plan too.</p>
<p>My money's very much on an adventure which revolves around that mudcrab merchant from Morrowind taking over Tamriel by buying up all of its prominent beverage-making businesses and then somehow tanking the stocks in every other industry on the Imperial City exchange. Some tale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-in-the-summerset-isles-would-be-cool-or-so-recently-unearthed-daggerfall-era-dev-dd-notes-have-convinced-me">set in the Summerset Isles</a> would also probably be cool.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Julian Gerighty, executive producer on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancy-s-the-division"><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division</span></i></a><span>, has parted ways with Ubisoft after almost 27 years with the company—and only three months after the French conglomerate denied rumors about the executive’s exit.</span></p> <p><span>The departure was announced by Ubisoft studio Massive Entertainment earlier today. In the announcement, the company wishes Gerighty good luck on his new “adventure” at Battlefield Studios. Moreover, Massive tells fans not to worry, as “our teams who built this world with Julian are still here,” focused on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2"><i><span>The Division 2</span></i></a><span>, extraction game mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors,</span></i><span> mobile title</span><i><span> The Division Resurgence</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856"><span>https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856</span></a></p> <p><span>Rumors about Gerighty leaving Ubisoft began back in mid-October of last year after </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/veteran-creative-lead-julian-gerighty-has-left-ubisoft-after-almost-27-years.1328146/"><span>people took notice of</span></a><span> his LinkedIn profile no longer showing his executive producer role as Gerighty’s current job. The next day, Massive </span><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487"><span>issued a statement</span></a><span> via social media acknowledging the rumors, and saying they were “far from true.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Julian is still with us as Executive Producer for </span><i><span>The Division</span></i><span> franchise, leading the creative vision for </span><i><span>TCTD2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Survivors</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>TCTD3</span></i><span>.&nbsp; We can’t wait to share what’s ahead,” read Massive’s post.</span></p> <p><span>As of now, it’s unclear who will be succeeding Gerighty in his previous role. According to an </span><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence"><span>update about the upcoming projects</span></a><span> issued in August, Magnus Jansén was appointed as creative director for </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>, but the update didn’t provide leadership details about </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>. Regarding the upcoming mainline entry, during last week’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489"><span>New Game+ Showcase</span></a><span>, Gerighty said </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> is “shaping up to be a monster.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Gerighty’s departure is happening mere days after the announcement of a Realism Mode for </span><i><span>The Division 2,</span></i><span> slated to launch in March of this year, as well as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368"><span>round of layoffs</span></a><span> at both Massive and Ubisoft Stockholm, which is expected to impact 55 employees. Moreover, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><span>marketing for “</span><i><span>The Division: Definitive Edition</span></i><span>” recently appeared in Japan</span></a><span>, suggesting the loot shooter could be getting a remaster or a package including both games.</span></p>

Or both? Or skip them entirely in favor of the five-color <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-coming-soon">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> one arriving in March?

The big draw is likely to be Cream of the Crop, which, to my knowledge, hasn’t been reprinted in a long, long time (maybe ever).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s going for a decent chunk of change (around $24 and upwards), but therein lies the rub - as soon as these decks hit shelves, that price will plummet. So while you’re getting some value, it’ll be gone as quickly as you can say Timeless Lotus - another card which will likely see the same result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect the deck to offer around $130 in value, but that’ll drop to around $100 within a fortnight it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say it won’t be fun to play, but as an investment, I’d only recommend buying it if you need specific cards or just want to play with it (imagine that!).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blight Curse</h2></div><div id="228491"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a rainbow of colors to the dreariness of -1/-1 counters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGZOw?object_uuid=c8ae574d-516c-4b95-83a5-b472607b2d84&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Blight Curse</u></a> is a little bit spooky in truth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Auntie Ool is all about Blighting creatures to trigger opponents to lose life or to give you card advantage, but the backup commander, The Reaper, King No More is a 3/3 scarecrow that turns your opponents’ cards into yours if you kill them with -1/-1 counters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, I’d be leaning into the sheer chaos of The Reaper, but one of the biggest draws here is the Necroskitter. It essentially mimics The Reaper’s ability, bringing creatures to your side of the board, and is worth around $30. Will that drop? Yes, for sure, from the moment this deck hits shelves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other decent reprints here include Tree of Perdition, Chimil, the Inner Sun, and Midnight Banshee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, the reprint value is likely to be around $130 again, but you’re losing a chunk of that with Necroskitter. And yet, I still think this is the better deck of the two.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Which One Should You Pick?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, a caveat: I’ve put links on this page to pick these up, because, well, that’s my job, but if you give it a few weeks, I reckon the pricing will settle down as more decks are printed. You shouldn’t be paying too much over the odds for these decks. Keep an eye on TCGplayer as well, as the market price on these should come down comfortably post release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that said, I think each inhabits a unique design space for Magic: The Gathering. I’ve been buying precons to upgrade, take apart, or just play out of the box for a few years, and both of these are pretty unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m particularly excited about Blight Curse as a way to slowly grind an opponent’s game plan to a halt, potentially flipping cards to your side of the field, while Dance of the Elements, while exciting, is likely to lead to some wild plays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The choice is yours, of course, but I really don’t think you can go wrong with either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 16, 2026 3:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In a sign it really has hit the big time, viral multiplayer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> smash Steal A Brainrot - which was the first game on the platform to surpass 25m concurrent players following its launch last year - has announced it's getting its first celebrity concert, with Bruno Mars set to make a "pop up" appearance to promote his new single this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Steal A Brainrot, in which players battle to acquire Brainrots (these, Wikipedia informs this old and bewildered writer, are voxel characters based on the Italian brainrot meme), has become a big enough success since its release last May that its developer, Spyder Games, is already embroiled in legal battles as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robloxs-steal-a-brainrot-creator-sues-copycat-fortnite-creative-game-stealing-brainrots">attempts to quash copycat games</a>. And Bruno Mars' people have clearly noted its success; the musician will be performing his new single I Just Might, alongside older hit Locked Out of Heaven, in-game this Saturday, 17th January.
</p>
<p>
This, according to Spyder Games, makes him the "first-ever artist to 'pop up'" in Steal A Brainrot, and his appearance will be accompanied by the opportunity for players to "finally" collect Bruno-themed traits and a limited-edition in-game Bruno Brainrot. You can <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/5740888218927704">register to be notified about the event</a>, should you be desperate to catch it, over on the Roblox website.
</p>
<p>
Away from Steal A Brainrot, Roblox has, of course, routinely found itself making headlines for all the wrong reasons, with the hugely popular platform frequently being accused of failing to safeguard its predominantly young userbase from harmful content and sexual predators. Last year, for instance, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">US state of Louisiana sued Roblox</a>, alleging the company "endangers the safety of" and facilitates "the sexual exploitation of [the state's] children", citing the availability of "highly inappropriate" mini-games including Escape to Epstein Island, Public Bathroom Simulator, and Diddy Party. Over 20 lawsuits accusing the company of enabling sexual exploitation were filed in US federal court last year, including submissions by Kentucky and Texas.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, for its part, has taken steps it claims will improve child safety amid continued criticism of its platform, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adds-facial-age-checks-to-curb-concerns-around-online-safety-in-worlds-most-popular-game-for-children">rolling out facial age verification around the world</a> earlier this year.

            <guid>1408309</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, series producer on <strong>The Division</strong> at <strong>Ubisoft</strong> and <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong>, has left the French company to join <strong>EA </strong>and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, Massive <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">announced this morning</a>. Despite the fact that Gerighty's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">return to The Division and his appointment as the series lead were supposed to be votes of confidence in Ubisoft's favour for <strong>The Division 3</strong></a>, now that he's leaving, Ubisoft doesn't want The Division players to be concerned.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">short post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Ubisoft Massive account, which says of Gerighty, "<em>Once an Agent, always an Agent.</em>" </p>



<p>"<em>Today, we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the Tom Clancy's The Division franchise is heading off to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios</em>," the statement reads. "<em>While we'll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>After thanking Gerighty, the post continues by addressing players, saying, "<em><strong>For our players, don't worry, Agents.</strong> Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For Gerighty's part, on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, he wrote, "<em>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division and Godspeed!</em>"</p>

<p>The messages from Massive and from Gerighty are meant to try and calm any concerns players might have about his departure, but it's doubtful they've succeeded. Several of the comments under Massive's announcement are players sharing concerns for the future of The Division franchise and, most importantly, The Division 3, and you can't exactly blame them.</p>



<p>Not only does this news come days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Ubisoft laid off 55 developers</strong> from Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, but it also arrives at a time when, for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">all the recent talk about The Division 3 (talk that was coming from Gerighty)</a>, we've still not seen anything from the game as we come up on three years since its official announcement.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2 will be seven years old</a> this coming <strong>March 12, 2026</strong>, and players have wanted nothing more than a proper sequel for at least the last four years, and outside of The Division, Ubisoft doesn't exactly seem to be in a particularly strong place.</p>



<p>The company is currently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">a battle with the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> after suddenly shuttering the <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> studio, three weeks after the majority of the branch voted to unionize</a>. It also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">recently laid off staff at its <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong> team</a>, and the company is still seemingly in the midst of a restructuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">following the establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Gerighty's departure is also the second time in the span of a year that the series lead for one of the company's major franchises left shortly after layoff announcements, the first having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté</strong>, leaving amidst layoffs and restructuring due to Vantage Studios being established</a>. A departure that was also marked by Ubisoft seemingly trying to spin it as Côté choosing to leave, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">when in actuality, Ubisoft asked him to "<em>step aside</em>."</a> </p>



<p>When you look at the broader picture of the current state of Ubisoft, if you're a fan of The Division, it's pretty impossible for you not to be concerned about where the franchise will go from here. Yes, Gerighty is just one person, and it's not as if his sole contributions to the franchise were what made it the third-person shooter you love, but you have to wonder what it says about the state of a company when it has lost yet another veteran developer in a lead role on one of its major franchises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>sales have passed yet another big milestone, developer and publisher Bandai Namco has announced, and the milestone feels appropriate given the anniversary the game is about to celebrate.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, sales of the latest entry in the long-running flight combat series have reached seven million, which means another million players have picked up <em>Ace Combat 7 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fcc05c9-9918-40b4-b1f3-9a72e7aec374" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since last year</a>. Let the franchise's popularity never be understated!</p><p>As well as this game in particular crossing a new sales barrier, the <em>Ace Combat </em>series as a whole has now passed 21 million sales, Bandai Namco says. That's not too shabby at all, although the series did technically begin way back in 1995.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>sales have reached a new milestone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To celebrate the new sales achievement, Bandai Namco says you can now listen to music from both <em>Ace Combat X </em>and <em>X2 </em>on streaming services, so if you're a fan of the series' soundtracks, then fill your boots.</p><p><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>is, as the name suggests, the seventh mainline installment in the <em>Ace Combat </em>series of combat-oriented flight sims (although it's not really a realistic sim along <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator </em>lines).</p><p>The series melds air combat (which is also the name of the very first game in the franchise) with melodramatic storylines, so if you think traditional flight sims are a touch dry, then this might be the franchise for you.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco will no doubt be pleased with <em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s sales achievement, because there's an eighth game on the way; <em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during last year's Game Awards ceremony</a>, and it's set for release this year.</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to catch up with the series, you can check out <em>Ace Combat 7 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502500/ACE_COMBAT_7_SKIES_UNKNOWN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA05636_00-AC7STANDARDED000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/brvm8rnwlxh1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> (and on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility).

<h2 id="How_To_Unlock_Zelda_Furniture">How To Unlock Zelda Furniture</h2><p>Much like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-how-to-get-the-new-sanrio-villagers-and-furniture-in-new-horizons/1100-6488995/" data-ref-id="1100-6488995">Sanrio furniture</a> that was added as part of the game's 1.9.0 update, the new line of Zelda furniture is locked behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-all-new-amiibos-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0/1100-6537444/" data-ref-id="1100-6537444">Amiibo</a>. Fortunately, every Zelda Amiibo released so far is compatible with the game, and you only need one of them to unlock the entire set.</p><p>Once you've got a Zelda Amiibo handy, head over to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-resident-services-unl/1100-6474995/" data-ref-id="1100-6474995">Resident Services</a> building and use the Nook Stop terminal. Select <strong>Invite a Camper</strong> from the list of options and scan the figure when prompted. If you're unable to invite a camper because one is already visiting your campsite, you can instead head to the Roost on the second floor of the museum and use the Amiibo phone to invite the character to the cafe.</p><p>After you've scanned the figure, the Zelda furniture will automatically become available to purchase through the Nook Shopping service, which you can access either via the Nook Stop terminal or the Nook Shopping app on your Nook Phone. The entire set of furniture will be listed under the Promotional tab, where you can also find the aforementioned Sanrio items (if you've unlocked them) as well as the newly added Lego furniture.</p><h2 id="All_The_Zelda_Furniture">All The Zelda Furniture</h2><p>The 3.0 update has added 28 Zelda-themed items in total, ranging from decorations to clothing, wallpaper, and other accessories. You can see the full list below:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4636066-img_7850.jpeg"

On top of a brand-new island facility, a hotel run by Kapp'n's family, the update has added a wealth of items to collect, including Splatoon-themed furniture. However, you won't find it in your catalog right away.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-how-to-get-the-new-sanrio-villagers-and-furniture-in-new-horizons/1100-6488995/" data-ref-id="1100-6488995">Sanrio crossover items</a> that were introduced in the game's 1.9.0 update, the Splatoon items are locked behind Amiibo, which means you'll first need to scan a compatible figure before you can purchase the new furniture in the game. Fortunately, it's very simple. Here's a rundown on how to get the new Splatoon furniture.

Fortunately, the game is compatible with every Splatoon Amiibo released so far, and you only need one of them to unlock the whole set.</p><p>To scan a Splatoon Amiibo, you need to head to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-resident-services-unl/1100-6474995/" data-ref-id="1100-6474995">Resident Services</a> building and use the Nook Stop terminal. Select <strong>Invite a Camper</strong> from the list of options and tap your figure when prompted. If you're unable to invite a camper because there's already one in your campsite, you can head to Brewster's cafe, the Roost, and use the Amiibo phone to invite the character there instead.</p><p>After you've scanned the figure, the Splatoon furniture will automatically become available to purchase through the Nook Shopping service, which is accessible either via the Nook Stop terminal or the Nook Shopping app on your Nook Phone. The entire set will be listed under the Promotional tab, where you can also find the aforementioned Zelda items (if you've unlocked them) as well as the newly added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-lego-furniture-items-guide/1100-6537449/" data-ref-id="1100-6537449">Lego furniture</a>.</p><h2 id="All_The_Splatoon_Furniture">All The Splatoon Furniture</h2><p>There are 28 Splatoon-themed items in total, including clothing, headgear, wallpaper, and other accessories.

            <p>It's the end of an era. After five years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' risqué but incredibly popular "adult only" island has been deleted by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The island in question was created by @churip_ccc, and was frequently visited by streamers and Japanese players. It featured a number of adult-oriented jokes, such as a "free information center" which greets players as they land. While this may sound safe enough at first glance, these centres are used in Japan to guide patrons to the likes of brothels and strip clubs.</p>

<p>This island also boasted a red-light district, and "love hotel" with multiple copies of Michaelangelo's Statue of David with strategically placed foliage to emphasise his, ahem, manhood. There were also adult shops selling schoolgirl-inspired cosplays and toys, vending machines for "natural herbs", smoking areas, areas designed to look like casinos... You get the idea.</p>
<p>As for the islands' residents, well, they clearly had a penchant for some more mature activities. For example, Blathers - the wise owl who has a distaste for insects and bugs - had a room on this island that was littered with used tissues alongside numerous images of Isabelle adorning the walls.</p>

<p>But, now this Animal Crossing: New Horizons destination is no more, with <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc">@churip_ccc</a> <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">announcing</a> their adult-themed creation would no longer be available for visits via Dream Islands, as it has been deleted by Nintendo. They don't seem bitter about it, though. Rather, the creator has both apologised to and thanked the company for "turning a blind eye for more than five years" (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>As for when their island got deleted, it apparently happened just before this week's big Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update">which added a new Resort Hotel down on the pier among other things</a>.</p>
