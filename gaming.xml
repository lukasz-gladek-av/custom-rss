          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Witcher IV – Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>"It's not woke," Cockle said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>. "There's nothing woke about it. [Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome."</p><p>We're not exactly sure how Cockle might define "woke." It's a term often thrown around without any specific meaning, after all.</p><p>After a trilogy of games star starred Geralt, Cockle said, "We've seen the end of Geralt's journey," adding that he celebrates Ciri and the fact that she's the protagonist of The Witcher 4.</p><p>"If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue," Cockle said about choosing Ciri as the protagonist. "There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it."</p><p>"If you think it's woke, read the damn books--they're good, first of all.

            <p>
Worried the impending arrival of $80 games might price you out of your favourite hobby? Well if Borderlands 4 follows suit, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has suggested the community should just suck it up and deal with it. "If you're a real fan," he recently told a potential purchaser, "you'll find a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Pitchford made the proclamation on social media after a <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">Borderlands fan opined</a>, "Randy, [Borderlands 4] better not be $80. Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay $80 and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."
</p>
<p>
But Pitchford begged to differ. "Not my call," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">insisted</a>, before dismissing pricing concerns. "If you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlour in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
The response from Borderlands fans on social media was, unsurprisingly, swift, strong, and overwhelmingly negative. "Thanks, now I won't buy the Game even if it costs $70", one person <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1924852589121687964">wrote</a>, while another <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1924850023625318758">added</a>, "That has to be one of the worst CEO replies from recent memory." Another <a href="https://x.com/RaistlinJustice/status/1924787599610122325">called</a> Pitchford's comment "elitist [and] out of touch"; "Rich person says just find the money," another <a href="https://x.com/Obey1Cannoli/status/1924818949494944151">wrote</a>, with plenty more using <a href="https://x.com/FergusMcburgs/status/1924823182374285777">considerably stronger language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of this means Borderlands 4 <em>will</em> cost $80 dollars when it eventually arrives, but the industry certainly seems to be heading in that direction. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">got the ball rolling earlier this year</a>, when it announced a $79.99 USD price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">quick to follow</a>, confirming some Xbox game prices would rise to $79.99 at the end of 2025 - presumably in time for this year's Call of Duty.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two has relayed a more cautious approach to price increases, with CEO Strauss Zelnick recently reiterating the company's stance on variable, game-by-game pricing. While some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">speculated next year's GTA 6 might reach as much as $100</a>, one of the only confirmed prices on Take-Two's upcoming roster is Mafia: The Old Country, which costs $50. Borderlands 4 pricing details are yet to be shared.
</p>
<p>
But while customers might balk at the rising cost of games, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">recently suggested the move was inevitable</a>. "I think it was going to happen sooner or later," he explained in the wake of Mario Kart World's price reveal, "maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, that's set to launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>.

            <p>
Right, anyone in need of something that's just generally quite pleasant? I've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> ever since, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">it was revealed</a>, honestly. It's suitably strange, as per usual with the cult game maker's works, this time putting you in the position of a teenager who is constantly t-posing. There's also sandwich-making giraffes and other strange inhabitants, and you can now take a look at it yourself in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727290/to_a_T_Demo/">demo that's dropped on Steam today</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo doesn't sound particularly long, as you just get to play through its first episode. Still, sounds like enough time to get to do things like brushing your teeth, something I genuinely couldn't tell you whether that's been in a game before or not. There is also a "very cute dog"! All very nondescript stuff, but I trust Takahashi to deliver on the weirdness. Plus, your save data in the demo carries through to the full game, always a neat feature.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, a couple of songs from the game have been released too. There's <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=wy7WY8G6Do3_GdCrsmPyWg">Perfect Shape by PREP</a>, an upbeat track that wants to make sure you know you're the perfect shape (aww, thanks!). And there's the slightly chiller <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=sqwwoGAmx850yjYtNIG8aQ">Giraffe Song</a>, performed by Rebecca Sugar, i.e. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a> contributor and Steven Universe creator. Honestly, both have already hooked me, some incredibly strong earworms here that I don't think have been heard in a game since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>'s theme song. Cripes, now I'm going to be singing that to myself for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Not long to wait for the full thing now either, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">as it's due out next week on May 28th</a>.

            <p>I recently stumbled on <a href="https://dominoclub.itch.io/erostasis">Erostasis</a>, a brilliant and filthy cybernetic microgame in which you are a wiry meatpuppet created to, aha, satisfy the urges of an exceedingly backed-up bionic starship. Over the course of a very busy 20 minutes or so, you visit various self-aware ship systems and play out their kinks. The writing is clattery, theory-drenched and sensual, set to moaning electronica. The visuals are a gunky collage of seeming porno and industrial stock footage. It’s glorious. Probably don’t play it where members of the public can see.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I were to choose <em>a polar opposite of that game</em> it might be new metroidvania Mio: Memories In Orbit, which also takes place on a living ship and is as elegant and videogamey and serenely sexless as Erostasis is subversive and debauched. I really like the looks of Mio, too, for wholly different reasons, and I’m tickled pink that publishers Focus Entertainment have managed to email me about it while I’m still recovering from my Erostasis experience. </p><!--more-->

<p>Created by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116580/Shady_Part_of_Me/">Shady Part Of Me</a> developers Douze Dixièmes, Memories In Orbit casts you as a delicate but powerful android exploring an enormous, artisanal space ark whose AI caretakers have ceased functioning. Over the course of presumably many centuries, the vessel's innards have exploded into a wilderness of cosmic vegetation.</p>
<p>The visuals take inspiration from “comics, paintings and anime”, and are set to “lo-fi beats and choral melodies”. They remind me a teeny bit of Biblical beat ‘em up El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. There’s a similar, faerie frailty to the setting, with warmly painted architecture and machinery bleaching or darkening to pencil strokes in the backdrop. Mio herself moves and fights with the aid of golden tendrils emerging from her skull. These are very much not the kinds of tendrils you encounter in Erostasis, a game in which it is generally difficult to tell one body part from another.</p>
<p>Its uncommonly artful art direction aside, Mio seems pretty routine for a metroidvania. There are abilities and modifiers to acquire, new areas or shortcuts to access with those abilities, friendly robots to repair for lore and upgrades, a bestiary of 30 enemy units, and 15 bossfights. The trailer suggests that you’ll do a lot of chaining together moves to overcome sequences of obstacles and build a combo. Again, all quite familiar, but persuasively executed.</p>
<p>Mio: Memories In Orbit launches this year, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/">the Steam page</a>. It and Erostasis join last year's seedy sarcophagus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultros">Ultros</a> in the pantheon of games set on living starships. I am fervently hoping that we’re in the middle of some kind of floral fleshcruiser renaissance. I'm trying to work out which format or genre I'd like next. Maybe a bioship life sim? Where you have to worry about cellular mitosis and deep space photosynthesis, rather than managing a crew?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, developer Arrowhead Studios brought the fight to Super Earth, as the Illuminate are touching down on the Helldivers' home turf. Everyone is joining in the fight, from the player-led Helldivers to some fresh reinforcements in the SEAF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Short for Super Earth Armed Force, the SEAF soldiers are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-finally-brings-the-illuminate-invasion-to-the-streets-of-super-earth">populating battles taking place on Super Earth</a>, helping the Helldivers hold out against the oncoming Illuminate forces. These troops can be ordered around using several commands, and will assist the Helldivers in defending the home of Managed Democracy. In turn, Helldivers 2 players already love their new NPC helpers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As seen in the new trailer for the Heart of Democracy update, SEAF soldiers are subject to roughly the same dire circumstances and thin survival odds as the Helldivers. Today's trailer has more than a few shots of SEAF soldiers getting absolutely routed by the invasion forces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the new SEAF pals are garnering both the sympathy and adoration of Helldivers, provoking the need to defend their newfound backup. Refrains of "PROTECT THE LIL UNS," a Warhammer 40K: Darktide reference, are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr4o3b/comment/mtapr7k/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already picking up steam</a> in the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Aah look at them, they are so cute," wrote <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr0ftf/seaf_reacts_to_se_salute_this_is_beautiful/mt9mhhk/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one r/Helldivers user</a>, responding to the SEAF soldiers' reactions to the Super Earth salute. "Protect them at all cost helldiver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others draw comparisons to the Clone Troopers from Star Wars, especially the NPC allies you'd see in the classic campaigns of games like Star War: Battlefront. "Fired an EAT into a harvesters leg that was attacking a squad and one yelled out 'Glad the helldiver's on our side!'" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1kr4o3b/comment/mtakaer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user noted</a>, as it reminded them of the lines you'd hear in Star Wars: Battlefront calling out similar actions.

Honestly, having an NPC pal around to push those bunker buttons <em>would </em>be useful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, the Helldivers will absolutely need the help on Super Earth, as the new update seems quite chaotic. It's the culmination of a long series of events, stretching back to a really bad bug hive and a black hole, and it's been really fascinating to see it all come together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not too long ago, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-ceo-says-youll-sht-your-pants-over-whats-coming-down-the-pipe">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani declared</a> Helldivers 2 players would "shit [their] pants" when they found out what was coming down the pipe. You don't need to give me any unnecessary information, but I do feel like the scope of this update is living up to expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2's Heart of Democracy update, and the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth, is currently underway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blades-of-fire-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I always look forward to it when a studio steps out of its comfort zone to create something unexpected. Blades of Fire, a 3D action-RPG from developer MercurySteam, best known for the stellar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Dread</a> and its action-packed take on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/29/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-review">Castlevania</a> during the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, does just that. Combining its past successes to give you control of a blacksmith who crafts his own weapons of destruction seemed like a promising concept. Unfortunately, the superb crafting portions of this lengthy fantasy adventure are overshadowed by an uneven story and combat that lacks real depth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Aran, a commoner who gains access to a legendary forging hammer that sets him on a quest to stop the queen who is leading the kingdom into ruin. The three pillars of Blades of Fire are its satisfying but simple combat, enjoyable weapon crafting system, and emotionally unimpactful story. While very uneven, those were at least enough to keep me relatively entertained for the 55 hours it took me to reach the first round of credits. However, there’s only an unsatisfactory conclusion to find there, and it was the postgame scavenger hunt necessary to find the “true” ending that really drained what little enthusiasm I had left by the end.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blades of Fire Review Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with the good, the crafting system stands as the tallest of the three pillars holding up Blades of Fire. Through the hammer Aran receives at the beginning of his journey, he can build the powerful weapons necessary to vanquish all that stand in his path. Initially you can only craft a singular weapon, a heavy polearm called the Hyssop that deals devastating strikes but uses a lot of stamina with each swing. However, after Aran vanquishes enough of a given enemy type, you will unlock a blueprint for the weapon they brandished against him. Dismantling 60 skeletons unlocks the claymore they would clumsily swing, while taking down just five spearmen from the queen’s transformed army grants access to a long spear that deals either piercing damage from afar or slashing damage in circular strikes. Finding and taking down each new enemy to expand your arsenal made for an enjoyable loop, and  encouraged me to take down the stronger optional enemies whenever they appeared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interacting with a forger anvil, which function as both rest points and a fast travel system, can then transport you to a mystical forge that lets you create those weapons. When you do, you can adjust several aspects of them: For example, the Twin Mallets are limited to customizing the size and shape of the head and handle, where larger weapons like the Glaive also have options for adding a pommel. These choices modify that weapon in small but noticeable ways, tweaking weight, balance, and damage to your liking, as well as altering Aran’s maximum stamina and how much stamina it costs to dodge while using it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While confusing at first, forging became my favorite part.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The final part of forging a weapon is the actual forging itself. Crafting weapons in most games ends after selecting your materials, but Blades of Fire has you actually striking the heated metal to match the weapon's shape. This system, while underexplained and confusing at first thanks to the lack of detailed tutorial, quickly became my favorite part of the journey. A weapon’s steel appears as bars similar to those on an audio visualizer, and some will shrink while others grow as you strike. The better you do, the longer a weapon will last before you need to sunset it to be recycled for parts or traded in to an ally for specific and often rarer materials. It took me half a dozen weapons before I figured out the proper technique for managing the strength, tilt, and width of each of my strikes, but once I did, I found myself confidently crafting weapons with the maximum rating every time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who end up not enjoying the crafting, there is an option to skip the process after the first time, but the maximum number of times you can repair it will be limited to the best results you’ve created manually. This smartly expedited my return trips to the forge, as I’d often hold off replacing weapons until they were all beyond repair, turning what would be a lengthy process into a short trip that got me back in the action sooner. Blades of Fire even gives you the option to name your weapon before setting out, which I initially reserved primarily for punny names like Captain Falchion or Let me Axe You something – but eventually as I saw them reach their final forms with the best materials and enhancements, giving them names suitable of their legacy like Gae Bolg or Masamune. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though there are 35 different weapons to wield and each vary between their speed, range, and other properties, combat unfortunately boils down to just eight attacks. These are performed by pressing the button on your controller that matches the part of an enemy you want to strike: So triangle/Y will strike at an enemy’s head, Circle/B will strike on the right, and so on. There are also charged attacks that deal higher damage and mutilate enemies if fatal, resulting in more gruesome deaths. It is disappointing, though, that mutilating an enemy's head with either a blunt weapon or piercing weapon has the same animation, and seeing them fall off the same way got old after the first dozen times. There are also no combinations of attacks that offer any real benefit, so alternating left and right strikes is virtually the same as mindlessly spamming a single direction. If it wasn’t for the use of parries and perfect dodges that offer a small window of opportunity to retaliate safely, combat would have felt even more bland than it already does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Choosing the directions of your attacks carefully becomes more necessary later on as enemies start to have different levels of resistance on each body part, and some like elementals can even move these weak points mid-combat. To its credit, Blades of Fire does have a large variety of enemies to fight – unfortunately, nearly every one of them is humanoid. That means that even though they all have their own unique quirks and attack patterns, I was rarely impressed by anything new that was thrown at me. Outside of bosses, which can be hulking behemoths that shake things up more substantially, one of the few interesting regular enemy types were the trolls: they have constant health regeneration and two health bars, requiring you to drain one bar and then mutilate a limb with a charged attack before you can attempt to finish them off. But a mechanic like that is the exception rather than the rule, and the predictability of every enemy’s clearly telegraphed attacks meant fights often just came down to my parry timing. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It has one of the most disappointing endings I've seen in a while.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do fall in combat, the powers of the legendary hammer mean Aran doesn’t stay dead for long. However, his temporary deaths come with the penalty of dropping your equipped weapon at that location, similar to how you drop souls, blood echoes, and other currencies in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">Bloodborne</a>. Thankfully, Blades of Fire is much more forgiving, as any weapon dropped in a location turns to stone and remains in the world permanently until Aran retrieves it. This was a welcome change to the formula as the potential of permanently losing a weapon you’ve invested heavily into after consecutive deaths would have been extremely frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last and certainly least, the most disappointing pillar of Blades of Fire is its story, characters, and world exploration. Aran’s quest to stop the queen does keep a decent pace, but it never surprised or wowed me and many moments that seemed like they <em>should </em>be impactful are hindered by an uneven delivery. At one point after killing a major boss, he simply fell to his knee and sat there until I struck him once more – it felt like it was set up for more, but there was no dialogue and no flair. Just this previously important character falling to the ground in anticlimatic fashion. Blades of Fire also has one of the most disappointing endings I've seen in a while, rolling credits with little resolution and then immediately sending you off on a scavenger hunt that is too long for its own good if you want to find out what’s actually going on. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Action/Adventure RPGs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are generally one-note stereotypes, and often have dialogue that further enforces their simplistic nature. Aran regularly remarks that he’s not smart enough to solve the puzzles without the aid of Adso, a young scribe who accompanies him on the journey, though Adso doesn’t offer much advice outside of stating the obvious. Adso is the brains to Aran’s brawn, deciphering codices you find, reading ancient languages to reveal paths or secrets, and magically sealing coffins during fights occasionally. Adso also makes regular remarks about Aran’s size when climbing ladders, which ends up feeling like an out of place attempt at humor as Aran rarely responds or finds opportunities to tease back. They are written as if they’ve known each other for a long time despite meeting for the first time in the opening hours, which makes moments like these unearned and shoehorned in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the cast are Glinda the Master Forger, a cranky witch of the woods type that lives in a house on top of a flying beetle, and Arwen, an impatient and hardheaded young girl that is only involved in the final dozen hours and yet conveniently turns out to be super important. As time went on, the uncanny parallels between these characters and those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/12/god-of-war-review">God of War</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a> became more and more distracting. Aran is just a less wise and somehow less charismatic Kratos, Adso deciphers ancient languages and takes note of enemies and other elements of the world similar to Atreus, Glinda fills in the role of Freya, and Arwen is essentially a less prominent Angrboða. You even fight a giant snake at one point, and explore places that strongly resemble areas like the temple resting above the Lake of Nine. Different games using similar character archetypes or tropes isn’t anything new or wrong on its own, but it does start to feel derivative to a fault here - especially when Blades of Fire doesn’t come off so hot in such a direct comparison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the only way it’s put in a bad light, as a lackluster map system often makes exploring for secrets very cumbersome and confusing. There are a ton of little hidden paths to find that lead to cool optional collectibles like shrines for upgrading your weapon customization options, chests with items that increase your healing flasks, gems to up your maximum health or stamina, and different dyes to customize Aran’s outfits. But many locations have multiple levels of elevation, and apart from staring at the one-dimensional map while hoping that you are reading it correctly, you don’t really have a way of knowing which level you are on until you either reach the correct destination or the wrong one. You can leave markers on the map that create a streak of color in the world as guidepoints, which at least help by adding distance and elevation cues to the compass at the top of the screen, but that’s only a half measure. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Blades of Fire’s blacksmithing burns bright, but it doesn’t forge a sharp enough edge to put its customizable weapons to good use. The combat is serviceable but overly simplistic, and the mediocre story often failed to evoke any kind of emotion in me at all, positive or negative, as it just goes through the motions from start to finish. The unintuitive map also frequently left me&nbsp;running in circles, making what could have been a fun hunt for secrets feel more like a chore. And when those pain points are compounded by unflattering comparisons to the games it so clearly took inspiration from, Blades of Fire just can’t cut it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can avoid the shipping costs by picking up your games at your local GameStop store (if stock is available).</p><h2><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=GameStop%27s+Biggest+Sale+Of+The+Year+Includes+AAA+Games+For+%2415&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-05-20+09%3A53%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-20+09%3A53%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6531678&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Flinks%2Fshop-select-software-for-only-15%2Fnew%3Fview%3Dnew%26pmax%3D16&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgamestops-biggest-sale-of-the-year-includes-aaa-games-for-15%2F1100-6531678%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$15 Games</a></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4497732-mixcollage-20-may-2025-09-23-am-195.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497732" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4497732-mixcollage-20-may-2025-09-23-am-195.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497732"></a><figcaption>Persona 5 Tactica and Dragon Age: The Veilguard</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4497732-mixcollage-20-may-2025-09-23-am-195.jpg"></figure><p>Most of the games in the $15 catalog are a few years old, but this is a great opportunity to pick up something you may have missed at launch.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Though the map gives a good general idea of what the actual GTA 6 map might look like, there's still plenty of speculation involved. Clicking on one of the various city icons makes clear when a location's inclusion on the map is based on a leak or on a real-life Florida location that is not yet confirmed to be present in GTA 6. Most of the map locations can be found in Vice City or the Leonida Keys regions, with the central and more northern parts of Leonida relatively empty so far.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an ambitious project and one that looks to be gaining some traction in the community. Users on Reddit have volunteered to help translate the map, which is currently available in English and German, into other languages like Spanish and Portuguese. No doubt the map will continue to be fleshed out ahead of the game's official map reveal, but in the meantime, here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-all-main-locations-from-vice-city-and-beyond/2900-6538/" data-ref-id="2900-6538">main GTA 6 locations we know so far</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rockstar recently revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">second trailer for GTA 6</a> and confirmed footage in the trailer was captured on a base PlayStation 5 and included both cutscenes and gameplay. The trailer came shortly after Rockstar announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">GTA 6 had been delayed</a> and will release May 26, 2026 instead of in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">While the delay was disappointing for fans, the CEO of Take-Two, Rockstar's parent company, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-suggests-no-more-delays-says-recent-push-is-less-than-6-months/1100-6531629/" data-ref-id="1100-6531629">another GTA 6 delay is unlikely</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">delay was necessary</a> to support the development team "in their search for perfection."</p>

            <p>Lost in Cult is launching a new label to release premium physical games, beginning with three British games: Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow and Thank Goodness You're Here.</p>
<p>Known as Editions, the new line of physical games will be limited in quantity and include interview booklets, art cards and more for collectability and display, with a new game added each month on PS5 and Switch.</p>
<p>Editions will cost £59.99 and ship worldwide. Three games are available now at launch, with more planned every month from July into 2026.</p>

<p>A major reason for the label is game preservation, with Lost in Cult partnering with DoesItPlay? to ensure each game's playability for the future: every game is complete on disc or cart, is playable without the internet, and includes all primary content at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Plus, in addition to the limited edition versions, all releases will be available as a standard edition through online and brick-and-mortar stores. Museums and archive groups will also receive copies.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult is aiming for shipping within six months of the release of each Edition, though is hoping for within three months. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> are also in the works.</p>

<p>"We're being bold," said Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown. "I can unashamedly say we set out to create a new standard for physical games. And this is a multi-faceted mission. Our Editions are designed to preserve not just the game, but the story and artistry behind its creation. At the same time, our retail releases ensure no one is locked out of owning great games physically, giving everyone a chance to play their favourites for the decades to come, internet connection willing or not."</p>
<p>Said Sam Barlow, Immortality creator: "The most common request we've had since releasing Immortality has been for a physical edition, but we always knew that if we did do it, we'd need to do it right - and so, working with Lost In Cult on this amazing new series was a no brainer!"</p>
<p>Lost in Cult is known for its premium game packages, including its Design Works books and Lock-On gaming journals.</p>
<p>Each game in the Editions lineup will come with a slipcase and poster of custom artwork, an authenticity card with printed signature from the game's director, art cards, and a 40-page booklet from Edge Magazine alumni Chris Schilling.</p>

<p>The company is carefully curating its selection of games, focusing on those that have pushed the medium as an art form. The first three have all been recognised by BAFTA.</p>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here won Best British Game at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">this year's awards</a>. It will be available through Editions on PS5 (1500 copies) and Switch (3000 copies).</p>
<p>Immortality won Best Narrative in 2023 and was nominated for multiple other awards. It will be available on PS5 (1500 copies).</p>
<p>Lastly, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow was long-listed by BAFTA in 2023 for Samantha Béart's performance. It will be available on Switch (3000 copies).</p>
<p>You can check out more details on Editions on the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">Lost in Cult website</a>.</p>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thank-goodness-youre-here-review">five star review from Eurogamer</a>: "Developer Coal Supper's relentlessly inventive absurdist comedy might, by necessity, keep a tight rein on players, but this is an impeccably constructed masterclass in gag-telling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortality-review-an-ingenious-hollywood-mystery-made-less-profound-by-the-invitation-to-solve-it">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review-an-adventure-game-with-depth">The Excavation of Hob's Barrow</a> were also very well-received.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is further bolstered by rising incomes among consumers, high enthusiasm among developers, and robust support from regional governments. This raises the questions—what's driving growth in the region, and where is this emerging industry headed next?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about the inner workings of the Chinese games industry, Game Developer spoke with several experts like China Independent Game Alliance (CIGA) founder Simon Zhu, Li Shen, former Tencent Games China and Epic Games China chief technology officer, and Siyuan Xia, the co-founder of Chengdu-based Leenzee Technology and director of soulslike action-roleplaying game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Single-player game development is becoming sustainable in China">Single-player game development is becoming sustainable in China</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dungeons-of-hinterberg-publisher-curve-games-acquired-by-nazara-technologies" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dungeons of Hinterberg publisher Curve Games acquired by Nazara Technologies</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chinese developers have historically been reluctant to work on single-player games. The challenges of premium single-player production are immense, and the popularity of free-to-play titles makes those kinds of games a better business prospect. Zhu gave us a brief history lesson on how free-to-play offerings became the norm for many decades. "If you recall, 1995 was a landmark year that saw the birth of The Legend of Sword and Fairy series," notes Zhu. The franchise, which combined elements of Chinese mythology and wuxia (Chinese martial arts), was a huge hit for nearly a decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unfortunately, even with the series' popularity, piracy was so rampant back then that the single-player market could not truly flourish. It wasn't until the online game boom in the 2000s that China's video games market and history truly began—which was then dominated by free-to-play games. We had to wait until March 2015 when the PlayStation officially entered the Chinese market for single-player console games to be formally introduced to gamers. Even then, single-player games still occupied a small niche until Steam's emergence significantly expanded access."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios and publishers also have to contend with the disparity in gauging the success of a single-player title compared to a free-to-play offering. "The fate of the former is often determined on launch day—(making those projects riskier ventures)—while the latter has more room for recovery if issues arise on the first day," Xia tells us. It all boils down to how each team adapts, just as how the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team had adjusted to a new development cycle to make the overall rhythm and work process more manageable.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/voice-actor-union-hits-back-after-fortnite-debuts-controversial-ai-powered-darth-vader" target="_self" data-discover="true">Voice actor union strikes back after Fortnite debuts controversial AI-powered Darth Vader</a></p><p>Image via Lenzee/505 Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experts are indeed well aware of the opportunities brought about by breakthrough titles opening doors to a wider audience, though these are uncharted waters for many studios in the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen (who now heads his own investment company, Re³ Lab) also adds that Chinese players and developers have always had interest in single-player games, but it wasn't until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sold millions of units globally that publishers became more willing to invest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other single-player offerings, such as S-Game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phantom Blade: Zero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Leenzee's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, also hope to capitalize on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, while set during the fall of the Ming Dynasty, even shows a glimpse into the culture and history of the Bronze Age Ancient Kingdom of Shu given that the studio is just an hour away from the archaeological site of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/china-sanxingdui-relics-exhibition-nationalism-palace-museum-hong-kong/index.html">Sanxingdui</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/trump-administration-cuts-funding-for-the-strong-museum-of-play" target="_self" data-discover="true">Trump administration cuts funding for the Strong Museum of Play</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games wear their cultural identity proudly on their sleeves, and Xia emphasizes its importance. "I believe Chinese games are gradually forming a distinctive identity in global markets. Cultural outreach isn't an overnight phenomenon but a long-term evolution fueled by collective efforts. For our part, we aspire to contribute foundational work through our endeavors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen echoes this sentiment as well. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was hailed as 'China's first AAA breakthrough' and I believe this instilled pride not just in the developers, but across the industry as well. Many view their work as challenging the Western-dominated games landscape and elevating Asian cultural representation. This collective mission drives innovation and a deeper exploration of local/regional narratives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, there's also a balancing act between highlighting cultural uniqueness and navigating geopolitical sensitivities, as Shen points out. "Look at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phantom Blade: Zero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for instance," says Shen. "It garnered nine million views on Bilibili (essentially China's own version of YouTube), but it required rebranding for Western audiences."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges and opportunities in a fluctuating market">Challenges and opportunities in a fluctuating market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experts we spoke with agreed that Chinese game developers benefit from unique comparative advantages—and struggle with some disadvantages. "Chinese companies, owing to their experience in making online free-to-play games, are global frontrunners in commercial design and operations, excelling at creating monetization models, balancing numerical values, and guiding user behavior," says Zhu. "Sadly, game design and overall quality may fall short, particularly in narrative and script writing. The industry still suffers from limited experience in game design, insufficient market insight, and inadequate industry exchange."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen agrees that China has achieved world-class capabilities, particularly when it comes to mobile game platforms and substantially profitable products in the domestic market. "Unfortunately, increasing production costs and market competition raise the barrier to entry for commercial games," says Shen. "This has made some developers grow increasingly conservative in genre selection, prioritizing production polish over innovative differentiation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu also shares the stark differences between Western and Chinese industries, particularly when holding events and expos. "To give you an example: The Game Developers Conference (GDC) in the United States has long been established as a key platform for industry exchanges and B2B meetings. The event hosts approximately 1,000 sessions, with an access pass that costs around 10,000 RMB (approximately $1,350), yet it manages to draw attendees from across the globe, fostering an excellent environment for communication and networking."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In contrast, the events I organize in China offer tickets at about 500 RMB (approximately 70 USD), which already includes a one-day access to the WePlay Expo. Despite this, we still face challenges in ticket sales and in engaging local speakers, some of whom are hesitant to share their expertise. I believe that this is due to the general public's understanding of the games industry and culture, especially since China's video game history and cultural integration only span around 20 years. The disparity with overseas markets is notable, but it also indicates substantial growth potential."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crunch culture, too, remains a controversial topic in China. "Long hours are common especially during project deadlines," says Shen. "Some studios adopt a 9-9-6 schedule–i.e. 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While labor reforms are underway, intense competition and a culture of 'dedication' [to your work] tend to normalize overtime as well."</span></p><p>Image via CIGA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While government guidelines do exist, enforcement remains inconsistent as it depends on each company or organization. "Our company, Leenzee, does not encourage overtime since we view that as inefficient and counterproductive," notes Xia. "In spite of this, some team members still voluntarily stay late. For them, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the first Chinese-developed single-player game that they've worked on, and there's an emotional attachment to it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In CIGA, we have consistently eschewed the practice of crunch or overtime, even going so far as to avoid rigid clock-in/clock-out times," explains Zhu. "The reality is that crunch, feeling compelled to stay until the boss leaves, or project pressures that lead to mandated overtime—these are all outdated formalities. They do not enhance inefficiency or quality. Instead, they only lead to increased stress and dissatisfaction among team members. Knowing how much the younger generation values work-life balance, I'm optimistic that outdated practices wane as the attitudes of newer generations continue to shift and the work environment evolves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a period of growth for Chinese game development, one might think there were fewer layoffs going around. That's not true, says Zhu. "I'm based in Shanghai, the city that's at the forefront of the industry," he says. "In the last two years, numerous companies have experienced layoffs, including the termination of entire projects, teams, or subsidiaries. The approach differs from company to company, with some offering compensation to affected employees."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen points out that unlike many other game development communities, China benefits from a strong social safety net reinforced by unemployment insurance and state-backed retraining programs. "Though specifics depend on regional policies," he clarified, noting it's not a perfect solution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Local governments are investing in game development">Local governments are investing in game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regional policies that often play a huge role in supporting game development in China. Most games that are set to be published in the country require a license from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), with key steps that include content review (i.e. cultural sensitivity or historical accuracy) and technical compliance. However, each regional administrative district may have additional programs in place to aid companies and studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Sichuan Provincial Government has been highly supportive of our work," says Xia. "Since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> takes place in Chengdu and parts of Sichuan Province, the government even helped us locate more cultural heritage locations available for digital preservation through our scanning process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Depending on the regional policies, the initiatives might include tax breaks for cultural projects or grants for technology/R&amp;D," adds Shen. "Also, games recognized as key to 'digital cultural industries' have mandates to integrate traditional themes, and there might even be state-backed campaigns to export games globally as cultural ambassadors."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu, meanwhile, gestured to the 'tech park' we were in, one of several in the city that was built by Shanghai's administrative government. "This entire complex is home to several tech companies, both large conglomerates and startups, and most only pay a small expense for rent," says Zhu. Zhu also adds that local governments across the country have policies that help address game incubation, operations, local releases, and international distribution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's no denying that China is the largest video games market in the world. While challenges, such as a lack of experience in making single-player games and a reluctance to risk on day-one launch revenue, do exist, experts remain hopeful. Developers, project leads, experts, and the government all contribute toward a collective effort to drive the expansion and global reach of the Chinese games industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Rising incomes and increased demand for high-quality content will continue to drive growth," says Shen, arguing that there's a brighter future ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu, meanwhile, remains steadfast in CIGA's support of the indie games community. "We know that the development of this sector in the country remains a long-term endeavor," notes Zhu. "Transformative change may not be achieved within a single lifetime, but this undertaking demands continued dedication and resilience."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have a saying in China: 'When everybody adds fuel, the flames rise high'—it's the equivalent of saying that 'there is strength in numbers,'" posits Xia. "Our team hopes that, through our efforts, we can contribute further to the games industry, making it easier for future creators and allowing for more interesting works to emerge."</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 set in the Ultra Quality mode via the NVIDIA App can deliver better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality, as highlighted by a new comparison video.</p>
<p>The comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, STALKER 2 and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running at 1440p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS 4 in DLAA, Ultra Quality Mode, and Quality Mode side by side, highlighting how Ultra Quality Mode, which can be used in any supported game by using the DLSS Override - Super Resolution option and setting it to 77% input resolution, delivers better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality that is definitely hard to notice in motion in all the game featured in the comparison. The fact that Ultra Quality mode seems to work so well makes it baffling that it isn't an official option available in games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS 4 Ultra Quality Mode vs DLAA - Same Image Quality as DLAA but More FPS? | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UY67EY50nGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After its launch earlier this year, NVIDIA DLSS 4 has been implemented in over 125 games and apps, and the list is expanding every week with new games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-other-rtx-updates-shown-off-for-upcoming-and-existing-pc-games/">In the coming weeks</a>, F1 25, Dune: Awakening, MindsEye, and FBC: Firebreak will launch with NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, followed by the Soulslike Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, which launches on July 24th.</p>
<p>The release of NVIDIA DLSS 4 coincided with the launch of Multi Frame Generation, which is exclusive to the RTX 50 series cards, and the new AI Transformer Model, which delivers better image quality than the previous CNN model in the same modes. More information on the latest iteration of the upscaler can be found on its <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel, developer Shift Up has confirmed. In the company's latest<a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng"> investor relations presentation</a>, a chart showing how the studio plans to grow going forward confirms plans for a Stellar Blade sequel, seemingly set to release sometime before 2027.</p>
<p>The chart also confirms plans for Shift Up's next game, an action RPG currently codenamed Project Witches, and plans for Stellar Blade's "platform expansion," which, if Xbox owners want to keep pie-in-the-sky hopes, could mean an Xbox version. But it is likely just referring to the PC version that is due next month.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No Xbox version aside, a sequel is exciting news for fans of the 2024 action hit, especially if the studio is able to complete the game and release it sometime before 2027. Though that release window should be taken with a grain of salt for now, seeing as how there's always the chance for things to change or slow down development, no matter the studio or the project.</p>
<p>After being one of the most popular games in 2024, Stellar Blade will continue to be a part of the conversation with its PC launch this coming June 11, 2025. Though not for entirely positive reasons, unfortunately, as its release is currently marred by the fact that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/">not available to purchase on Steam in 130 countries</a>, despite not having any PlayStation Network sign-in requirements.</p>
<p>Shift Up has released a statement saying <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-dev-is-working-with-sony-to-resolve-pc-region-locking-claims-denuvo-doesnt-impact-frame-rates/">it is working to fix the issue as soon as possible</a>, though it's unclear if the problem will be resolved by launch.</p>

I think it might be time to stop letting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gearbox">Gearbox</a> head Randy Pitchford tweet about his own games. Just last month, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">accidentally shared</a> the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> was getting an earlier than expected release date ahead of an official announcement; he put that one down to time zones. This time his overly eager attitude towards posting hasn't revealed any information about Borderlands 4 he wasn't meant to, but it is something that could maybe, just potentially, be viewed as ever-so-slightly out of touch.

<p>
Last week, when another Twitter user expressed concern over the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> potentially being $80 (a price point hasn't been set just yet), Pitchford first noted that this is not his call. To be fair to him, I imagine this'll come down to other people at Gearbox as well as Borderlands' publisher 2K.

Then, Pitchford thought he'd follow it up with this little nugget: "If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."

Now, here's the thing. For a huge portion of people, even $60 is unthinkable for a game purchase, let alone $80. Second of all, have you seen the economy recently Randy! It's not great! The Borderlands series is more than 15 years old, a lot of your audience will be regular people with jobs struggling to make ends meet. Not exactly sure you thought through this one all that much, buddy.

Again, no idea if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not, at a recent PAX East panel (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-gamers-express-concern-about-borderlands-4-potentially-costing-80-gearbox-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">IGN</a>) Pitchford even said he doesn't know how much it'll be. I just think we could perhaps take a little more tact, especially seeing as we don't know whether $80 games will work or not yet.
