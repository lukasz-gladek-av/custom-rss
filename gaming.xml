            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dynasty-warriors-origins-the-first-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games let you smite hundreds of enemies with grandiose attacks as well as the long-running Dynasty Warriors series does, and so in a sense the latest one, Dynasty Warriors Origins, is competing with its past self. But with an enhanced combat system that rewards and incentivizes parrying and perfectly dodging enemy attacks and a more significant focus on telling the story of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms novels from a new perspective, it made a great first impression. These elements were all up my alley for a new Dynasty Warriors game, and playing it left me feeling a sense of wonder, intrigue, and a hunger for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Origins was one of those odd phenomena where the images on the screen finally matched what my younger brain had seen when playing earlier games in the series. Bases were bigger, forests were lusher, and the screen was filled with more enemies for me to slash and punch on my way to victory than ever before. The spectacle and visuals of Origins are the best they've ever been, and sure, a lot of that is thanks to the power of modern hardware, but it's also the quality of everything on display. Long gone are the barren lands and mostly identical trees of Dynasty Warriors 9's open world, the repetitive textures on buildings, or the rockfaces surrounding most levels in games before that. Origins' world and characters are full of life, and each one is detailed more than ever, from their armor to their weapons. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Dynasty Warriors Origins introduces a new overworld map mechanic to traverse between battles. This diorama-like map can be explored to find various towns or cities to purchase items, NPCs to converse with, and missions to undertake. I only got to view a small portion of the map, but I did catch a glimpse of a fast-travel button, meaning there are most likely at least enough of these areas to explore to warrant the need for such a system. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I did catch a glimpse of a fast-travel button, meaning there are most likely at least enough of these areas to explore to warrant the need for such a system. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Origins' story is told from the perspective of a new original protagonist who will be interacting with important warriors such as Liu Bei, Zhang Fei, and Lu Bu. Yes, <em>that </em>Lu Bu. Origins’ story, as the title suggests, also occurs earlier than its predecessors, so the recognizable allies and enemies all have a new youthful vibrancy in and out of combat. And that combat, by the way, felt great. Every swing of my sword or staff was responsive, and perfect parries or dodges were accompanied by flashy animations, with perfect parries giving an even more considerable advantage in turning the tides on opponents.  And combos feel better than ever when chained with special moves and other abilities meant to pre-empt enemy attacks and knock them off balance. Add that to the sounds of the yellow turban army shrieking in fear and death and the cheers of my allies as my KO counter rose into the hundreds, and it felt like the quintessential Dynasty Warriors experience I had been missing for years.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some may be surprised or caught off guard when hearing about things like perfect parries or dodges in a Dynasty Warriors game. I'm happy to report that those who want to button-mash their combos through hordes of enemies will be able to do just that on the lower difficulties, just like in the older games, but for those wanting to push themselves and challenge the harder difficulties, they'll need to make full use of these systems. Playing on Hero mode saw even regular enemies removing larger portions of my health bar, which typically only happens when facing off against named generals. I put this to the ultimate test against the man, the myth, the legend Lu Bu, who fought the entire battle atop his steed until breaking his guard. His introduction is nothing short of what veterans will expect from him; he entered the scene as if he were the game's main character, instantly deleting entire squadrons of my allies and causing them to scream in terror. Now, I don't know how he scales between all the difficulties, but on the hardest one available during my demo (Hero difficulty), I managed to trigger the second phase of his fight and reduce him to under 40% before running out of healing items against his onslaught of unblockable attacks that dented over half my health per hit. This battle alone has sold me on the combat of Dynasty Warriors Origins.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Those who want to button-mash their combos through hordes of enemies will be able to do just that on the lower difficulties, just like in the older games, but for those wanting to push themselves and challenge the harder difficulties, they'll need to make full use of perfect parries and dodges.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The only immediate downside I found with Dynasty Warriors Origins so far is the inability to play in co-op, as this series has been a staple for those wanting to play co-op online or split screen with friends and siblings. While I’m not going to completely let the developers off the hook for this, there is at least a built-in compromise: during mission preparations, you can select an allied general to accompany you, and during the mission, you can take control of them for a short period of time. This helps turn the tide in battles, especially if you are low on health or want to destroy many enemies in a shorter period. These generals are much stronger than the protagonist in the game's early hours, and while I only activated the ability twice, I learned two things. First, it was incredibly fun and gave me a great taste of other weapon types, and second, it was clear that this mechanic is meant to be one of those you activate when you need to go all-in on a fight. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You also gain access to various tactics along the way, like commanding a squadron of archers to rain arrows on enemies. These abilities are fine on their own, but if you use them at the right time or in the right conditions, they can have an even more powerful effect to devastate armies and lower opponents' morale. Morale has always been another component of Dynasty Warriors, because whichever side has the higher morale gains bonuses in combat. In Origins, this is best exemplified by the red armor plates on enemy generals that reduce the damage you deal until they are all removed. Once all the yellow and red plates are removed, they become vulnerable to powerful assault attacks that make you untargetable while dealing out significant damage to both the enemy you've broken and any unlucky enemies nearby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the customization system is back, and throughout the story, the protagonist will gain access to a handful of weapon types and skills called arts. The more you use the various weapons and arts, the more proficiency you gain to unlock new arts or upgrades for your current arts. To complement your weapons and arts, there are also several skill trees that will unlock things such as extra item slots to carry into battle, or enable the new extreme musou attacks that allow you to combine with your allies for even larger, deadlier special moves that devastate crowds and stronger enemies. Starting out, I only had access to a single sword. Still, after defeating a general, I unlocked the ability to wield their twin pikes in future missions, which will be an incentive throughout the game to challenge all the generals in a mission, not just those set as mission objectives.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dynasty Warriors Origins has the potential to be the crown jewel in the venerable series with its improved focus on combat, customization, and enhanced visuals. It's been nearly 20 years since I found myself eagerly waiting to play the newest Dynasty Warriors, but with the updates and enhancements I've seen so far in Dynasty Warriors Origins, that streak is no more. I walked away from my two-hour demo session with a renewed interest in a series I once treasured and am eager to get more time with when it releases in January. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Dynasty Warriors: Origins Preview – Looking for a Comeback]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dynasty-warriors-origins-preview-%E2%80%93-looking-for-a-comeback.1042470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>People who know me know I'm a bit of a Three Kingdoms and Dynasty Warriors nerd. Having played every Dynasty Warriors game except the first 1v1 fighting game, add to this the Three Kingdoms novels, the historical texts, playing the other games, and watching series and films. Three Kingdoms, to me, is like other people's Rome. It's that era I'm just very interested in. Also, I like Rome, too. Anyway, <a href="https://www.koeitecmoeurope.com/dw_origins/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a>.</p>
<p>I recently got to go hands-on with Dynasty Warriors: Origins in Paris, invited by Koei Tecmo. I was excited and concerned because Dynasty Warriors 9 wasn't good. The enjoyment of the series was always the uniqueness of the characters and their weapons: the camp nature of Zhang He and his Vega claws, Xiahou Dun and him being the coolest kid in the playground with his eye patch, or Guan Yu being the literal god of war with his ultra-long halberd, all on top of the 1 vs 1000 combat, which also moved too far into making even the regular soldiers feel like mere confetti.</p>
<p>9 demolished this by removing the uniqueness of its characters; it says there are over 90 characters, but with weapons and attacks shared between most of them, the uniqueness was lost, and even the combat felt boring. Dynasty Warriors: Origins wants to go back to basics, refresh the series in almost every way, and bring new people into the story, which was the Three Kingdoms period following the fall of the Han Dynasty.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Or, more accurately, Dynasty Warriors: Origins tells the story of the origins of the three kingdoms. What will likely be one of the few decisions fans question is the ending of the game at Chi Bi. Those who know the history know that Chibi was the battle that stopped the early expansion of Cao Cao, leading to the formation of the three kingdoms of Shu, Wei and Wu. With the compressed timeline of 183 AD (Yellow Turban Rebellion) to 208 AD, Omega Force intends this to be a more in-depth look at China during the period and the prominent people within it.</p>
<p>With this compressed timeline comes a narrowing focus on the areas of China you will see and battle within. From what I saw in the hands-on and heard during an interview with producer Tomohiko Sho, the lands that become Shu will not feature within the game. However, the lands in a new world map will feature new core/story battles, an upgradable weapon system, side missions, skirmishes, and more.</p>
<p>Let me start by saying the world map is nothing reminiscent of the open-world element Dynasty Warriors 9 attempted. The map here is more of an overworld that you can explore, letting you find collectables or a new currency called Pyroxene, used to create boosts, join skirmishes, side battles, or core battles, or find characters to speak to and advance the story. The four hours I could play, some from the very start, some later, introduced these elements well and alleviated any concerns I had when I heard "open world".</p>
<p>I should point out it's not entirely open. There is some linearity in that areas aren't accessible until you have progressed far enough in the story. As you move to new regions, you will also find that these have their own "peace" level. This will rise as you complete missions and skirmishes, giving you incremental bonuses for filling it up.</p>
<p>With a levelling system of your character and the nine types of weapons you can use, there will undoubtedly be an advantage to grinding here and there - though it didn't feel essential. The more you level your weapons, the more you unlock extra combos and battle arts - special attacks. As you also level your character, you'll unlock stat boosts and other perks, adding additional benefits to doing more side missions and skirmishes.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>It's worth saying that the story you find may not be historically accurate as you will be making decisions and siding with different forces in different battles, picking your way through events. As for who you are, you're a nameless hero, though what I've seen seems to imply you're some deity or spirit, mainly as you keep talking to people that others can't see. That and, in battle, you have supernatural abilities (or, I should say, abilities more than those of regular Dynasty Warriors characters). One such ability is called the "Eyes of the Sacred Bird", which allows you to see through the magic of the Yellow Turban officers and aspects of the battlefield like officer health.</p>
<p>In terms of the battlefield, if I were to make a comparison, this feels like a good mix of earlier and later Dynasty Warriors. The scale is there, with more enemies on the screen than ever before, but it also feels more like the earlier entries where the regular soldiers can be a threat to you. You can't simply ignore them. If you do, they can knock you off balance and damage you. You can still mow through them; you are a hero in Dynasty Warriors, but this feels like it has a good balance, particularly with the new additions to combat.</p>
<p>I've already mentioned the battle arts; these are new weapons in your arsenal and can be used to block power attacks from enemy officers and even groups of enemy soldiers on high morale and within the vicinity of their commander. Using these can certainly make the difference in a battle, as can the use of a well-timed parry or dodge, which helped me with my hands-on, allowing me to beat Lu Bu at Hu Lao gate, something I was told only 5% of the team have managed so far.</p>
<p>Another new feature of combat is the inclusion of strategies. You will have an entourage of guards that increases based on your actions, and you can have this unit perform actions, such as a volley of arrows or a charge. These are very useful in clearing soldiers or putting off a general. As battles progress, if conditions are met, you'll also find yourself in massive battles, part of "grand tactics", which can offer a sense of scale the series has pushed for but never fully represented. The coalition forces' charge on Hu Lao gate that I got to play was exceptional. It genuinely felt like thousands of soldiers charging in, the camera shaking, the music ramping up. It felt exhilarating.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>Earlier, I mentioned there are "a few decisions" that fans will question. The second is linked to the fact that you control the Nameless Hero. You can select a hero who also follows you in battle, which will be dictated by where you are and the decisions you make in conversations. You can control this hero in battle once a gauge has filled up. The problem for some fans is that the number of heroes you control is limited to nine. This is the smallest roster in the series' history, which could raise some eyebrows.</p>
<p>Still, having seen the direction Omega Force is taking Dynasty Warriors: Origins, I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt here, mainly due to the story-focused direction for the player-character. Of course, there's a lot I haven't seen, but what I have seen makes me want more. You will also get to try out some of the game now, with an early demo showing exactly how confident Omega Force and Koei Tecmo are with the game.</p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins <a href="https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be released</a> on January 17, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S/X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-hands-on-endgame-first-look<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every time I play Path of Exile 2 – and I’ve been lucky enough to play it a few times now – I grow more confident that it’s going to be special. I’ve now played as the Hunter, Monk, Witch, Warrior, and most recently Mercenary. You’d think that I’d be tired of doing 2+ hour sessions with each of the classes, but the inverse is true. I can’t wait to dive back in. Its beta release on December 6 can’t come soon enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m going to focus this preview on the Mercenary. While it’s not my favorite of the classes, the Mercenary is very unique in that it transforms traditional Path of Exile gameplay into what you would expect from a top-down shooter. This class, which focuses on the use of a crossbow, has you start by firing 7 rounds of bolts at any approaching enemies. You’ll then slowly unlock new skill gems that add abilities that will snipe, rapidly fire Armor Piercing Rounds, lob a grenade, freeze, set on fire, or otherwise set you up for success against the waves you’ll come across.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This transformation to a shooter is intentional, with Grinding Gear Games’ Jonathan Rogers embracing the challenge the class gave them by taking lessons from other titles in the shooter space that they then built upon. While I found that I missed the thwack of the Monk’s staff or the agility the Hunter’s bow offered I can see how the Mercenary could be an attractive option for new players who may be more familiar with other genres and entering the ARPG space for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The one reason I feel the Mercenary is held back is because of the sheer amount of reloading needed, as it happens when you swap between firing modes or run out of ammo, leading to a bit more downtime than I liked in the early game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Mercenary class starts coming together and feeling quite powerful around the graveyard section of Path of Exile 2.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, the class does start coming together and feeling quite powerful around the graveyard section of Path of Exile 2. This seems to be the point where all the classes really begin to come into their own and give players a peek at their endgame potential. By this point I had: a grenade launcher that shot three projectiles and did increased area of effect damage, a gun that fired ice that slowed and froze approaching enemies, and a fire shot that lit everything on fire that came near me, but also pushed back approaching mobs with force. These building blocks give you a chance to begin placing perks into the abilities you like the most. Especially because your passive skill tree journey will have likely unlocked a bonus or two that allow you to begin building the character you will use to continue through the campaign.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Into the Endgame</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A large focus of my preview event for Path of Exile 2 was a behind-closed-doors presentation focused on the endgame path you’ll be taken on. While I didn’t get hands-on time with it, Rogers took us through the endgame challenges, including a massive world map to be cleared and end-game activities that they think players will keep coming back to for hundreds of hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a roundtable interview, when asked about the endgame he said, “If we don’t have a good endgame going into early access, then Path of Exile 1 players are just going to say, ‘Hey this is just a worse game.’ We need that stuff to be able to actually make a POE1 player feel like, ‘Oh yeah, you know what? This is a true sequel to POE1.’” And boy does it look like they delivered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To give you a peek into what’s planned for December, the first half of the campaign, including Acts 1-3, will launch first and should take you around 25 hours to complete. The endgame awaiting you after campaign completion promises a lot of exciting new ways to power up your build. I got a small sneak peek at some of those endgame chases as part of a 2-hour presentation detailing several of the modes you’ll be able to chase.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While there are eight primary endgame modes planned at the launch of early access, you’ll be introduced to a few during the campaign. They include several sequels to popular leagues from the original Path of Exile, with more to be launched during early access. I saw the Trial of Sekhemas, which has you enter a series of rooms that each have unique challenges, like filling a blood chalice by defeating red enemies in the area. Or surviving increasingly difficult enemy spawns before a timer runs out. These floors each have several challenges like this, and at the end of each, after a boss fight, you’ll have a choice to cash in keys you’ve collected or proceed to the next level for a chance at better loot. Die, or have your “honor” reduced to zero by being hit too many times and you’ll be kicked back to the beginning. To improve your chances, there’s water you’ll collect that works as a currency to buy items during your run and help you along. Some relics can also be found or crafted. One relic teased the chance at a coveted unique item, but you’d be forced to complete this Trial with only 1hp.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are eight primary endgame modes planned at the launch of early access.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the rewards, this will also give you access to the Altar of Ascendency, where you get to pick one of three Ascendency classes at the end. In early access there will only be two Ascendency classes to start with. We got a peek at the Witch’s Infernalist Ascendency class that lets you summon a hellhound who will set everything next to it on fire once it is summoned. It also had the bonus of being the one who takes damage for you if you’re hit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">They also showed off the Witch’s Demon Form that allows you to become a winged monster who is faster, does more damage, and casts spells faster, but also takes damage as you remain in the form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind this is just the first endgame mode, which on its own seems like it would be able to provide hundreds of hours of fun challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also got a peek at another endgame system called the Temple of Chaos, which will be encountered in act 3. This Temple can be entered after you acquire a token from the trial master, and the event was called a sequel to the Ultimatum league from Path of Exile 1. You enter the Temple, and pick a modifier like Blood Globules (which are globby blood orbs that will spawn and follow you around in the sky before falling quickly to earth in an attempt to damage you). Or Shocking Turrets that make a grid of electricity occasionally shoot across the battlefield. These modifiers stack, and you’ll still need to complete the normal map challenges like trying to survive, killing everything in the room, or escorting a giant hammer across the map until it reaches its destination.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Path of Exile 2 Ranger Class</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And the final endgame activities revolved around the Ziggurat location, where you can access a world map and travel to various spots to dispel corruption. Here you can clear towers, defeat bosses, or clear Breaches. There's also the Expedition League sequel that has you plant dynamite across a map to unearth cool loot and unlock new abilities on gear. There are Delirium maps that increase difficulty and allow you to earn more passives from your passive tree. And they even teased an Uber Pinnacle boss that you'll need unique keys to access. They said that the Uber Pinnacle boss would offer a challenge for longtime players as it’s promised to be the hardest content in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rewards included a new gem system for your weapons, armor, and passive skill tree. The latter gives you the ability to socket unique gems into the tree that give you enhancements to anything unlocked in the vicinity of the socket, or additional boosts that give you the chance to further empower your build. And all of that is on top of an entirely unique Atlas skill tree which will let you unlock perks that are specifically tied to each of the endgame modes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">Buckle Up</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s so much to cover from the Path of Exile 2 preview event and I’m only scratching the surface here. Each of the modes described could have an entire video dedicated to discussing strategies and options for tackling them to get player rewards. There’s going to be an almost overwhelming amount of loot to chase across several systems to keep me entertained and I can’t wait. One note from the Grinding Gear Games team was that at the start, everything I’ve described is only half the content. The playable classes, number of story acts, enemies and bosses will all double throughout the early access period, with more league sequels also on the docket for endgame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Path of Exile 2 will be free to play, but to get in on December 6th for early access you’ll need to buy a $30 supporter key which will also give you in-game currency to spend. However, if you’ve spent $500 or more in the last 10 years of the original Path of Exile then you’ll get in for free for being a longtime supporter.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

And, if you’ve been confused where your Photo Mode images go, wonder no more: The file path is now shown in game when you take screenshots, and file names are simplified (with the date now included). You can also bind your arrow keys to input mappings now.</p><h2 id="h35608"><a id="gamepay"></a>Gameplay Changes</h2><p>As far as gameplay goes, you can now compare new rings against currently equipped rings in <em>either </em>slot, and the Glint option description is a little different. Some weapons got new icons to help differentiate them, and it’s easier to see where your companion’s Enchantments are.</p><figure id="" data-id="b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-recommend-id="image://b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-recommend-id="image://b07e770bbdeb3310b74137c04b766f87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1456" data-height="819" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Dragon Age: The Veilguard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Extended dodge also won’t get weirdly wonky for Rooks of the ‘Mage’ persuasion., Some skill text has been changed to be more clear (and accurate), and Antaam Champions do a bit more damage (as intended), and instances where enemies and companions would get stuck or in out-of-reach places have been alleviated. Speaking of fixes, that brings us to the bugs that Patch 3 aims to squash.</p><h2 id="h35609"><a id="bugs"></a>Bug Fixes</h2><p>All kinds of bug fixes are included, but not all of them will have obvious or substantial effects. The general focus is on fixing issues encountered during cutscenes, mesh and polygon interactions, and some incredibly minor balance adjustments to get some items to work as they were originally intended to.</p><p>Getting into specifics, Rook won’t suddenly change body shapes or adopt strange expressions during or after certain cutscenes. Some other cutscene issues were fixed as well, including strange, stretchy cloaks and clothing clipping through the character.

<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved strategy games. It started as real-time strategy matches against AI opponents in titles like Age of Empires, Age of Mythology, and Company of Heroes. I quickly found myself drawn to base-building and colony sim titles for the sense of progression and expansion they offer, though, and few compare to RimWorld. But then, there’s also Oxygen Not Included. They’re both exceptional, both offering countless hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of hours of gameplay. Which do you choose? Why not both? You can score two of the best colony sim games for under $35 with the new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/46465/Terraform_Titans_Duo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Terraform Titans Duo</a> bundle on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-rimworld">What is RimWorld?</h2>



<p>RimWorld is often considered the quintessential colony sim game, following in the footsteps of titles like Dwarf Fortress but offering a unique spin on the story generation mechanics. You’ll take control of a science fiction-fueled colony full of intelligent pawns that must contend with unique enemies, flora, fauna, psychology, climate, interpersonal relationships, and more.</p>



<p>After spending 1,000 hours playing the game, I can tell you that even the base version is worth every penny. But with the expansions and countless mods, you’ll easily score hundreds of hours from RimWorld if it’s your type of game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-oxygen-not-included">What is Oxygen Not Included?</h2>



<p>Also in the bundle, we have Oxygen Not Included. It’s another sci-fi colony sim game that focuses on the dynamic crew as they overcome obstacles, like alien lifeforms while harnessing the power of the asteroid they’re currently stranded on. For instance, you must consider logistics, like piping water and waste to and from the colony, to ensure no one falls ill. It’s complex and compelling in equal measures.</p>



<p>With ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’ reviews, Oxygen Not Included is a grand time for any colony sim or base-building game fan!</p>



<h2 id="h-score-them-both">Score Them Both!</h2>



<p>With this partnership between Ludeon Studios and Klei Entertainment, you can currently score both colony sim games for less than $35. Oxygen Not Included is on sale, dropping the price of the bundle to its current total. You really cannot pass this one up!</p>



<p>Let us know in the comments below if you grab the bundle! Don’t forget to stop by and share screenshots of your colony in our General Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>



<hr>



<p>Did you know it can cost up to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/it-can-cost-up-to-500000-for-a-spot-on-opening-night-live-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$500,000 for a spot on Opening Night Live 2025</a>? That’s an insane price to pay, and many indie developers can’t afford such extreme advertising costs!</p>

Like previous in-game concerts, such as those starring Travis Scott and Ariana Grande, the event is likely to be a kaleidoscopic audiovisual roller coaster. Still, by including the late Juice WRLD, who passed away in 2019, this in-game concert will also be decidedly different from any before seen in Fortnite: It will be the first to use an artist's likeness posthumously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-romulus-director-defends-use-of-a-i-in-new-movie/1100-6525952/">something that Hollywood is also grappling with as of late</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot recently spoke to Nate Nanzer, Epic's head of global partnerships, in a music-focused interview that hit on the developer-publisher's decision to bring Juice WRLD, whose real name is Jarad Anthony Higgins, to Fortnite. Nanzer told me Epic had long hoped to do something like this with the late artist and explained why the company feels now is the right time.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something that our players have been asking for for years and years and years, and we've wanted to do it, but we wanted to find the right moment," Nanzer said. "We obviously want to do it in the most respectful way possible. We worked very closely with his mom and his label, and we were able to find the right moment where it felt right, around this event, and he has new music coming out, so all the stars kind of aligned around this moment."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer mentioned that Juice WRLD himself was "a big Fortnite player," and though the Epic executive didn't say this, it stands to reason that Juice WRLD would want to be in the game if he could say so today. Still, even with the involvement of his family and his music label, for some, the inclusion of a deceased artist's likeness in this manner may always cross a line. In the movie world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robert-downey-jr-plans-to-sue-anyone-who-makes-an-ai-replica-of-him/1100-6527453/">Robert Downey Jr. recently said he plans to sue anyone who tries to create an AI replica of his likeness</a>, and that even if it were to occur after he has died, his "law firm will still be very active." Events in 2012 surely predate many of Fortnite's biggest fans, but the Juice WRLD concert also recalls the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGbrFmPBV0Y">Tupac "hologram" that once performed at Coachella</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773" data-ratio="0.6015625" data-width="896" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403773"></a><figcaption>Epic says players have begged for a Juice WRLD in-game concert, but when--if ever--is the right time for it?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4403773-screenshot2024-11-21141248.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the Fortnite world, I haven't personally seen a lot of pushback to Juice WRLD's involvement in next weekend's event. Certainly, there have been some feelings of ethics-based squeamishness, but the prevailing sentiment on places like the game's subreddit and popular Discord servers is one of excitement, perhaps owing to the often younger player pool in Fortnite. Whereas older players and onlookers may see this as a line being crossed, younger players who have already spent years growing up within Fortnite may more quickly accept this as a marvel of modern technology, and they may be excited to finally have the Fortnite Juice WRLD event Nanzer says has been one of the community's most requested.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our community loves his music. We have data [that shows he is] still extremely popular. And I would say, I can't quantify this, but when I look at Reddit threads, or Discord chats, or Twitter threads, Juice WRLD comes up over and over and over again. I mean, people have made Juice WRLD concerts in Fortnite Creative and [Unreal Engine for Fortnite]."</p><p dir="ltr">Nanzer added that he feels fans of the late artist will come out of the event with positive feelings. "We're hopeful. We know our players have been asking for it, so there's a lot of pressure to really deliver it the right way. I think people are really gonna love what we have coming, like, I think it's done in an awesome way. I think if you're a Juice WRLD fan, you're gonna feel good about it," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">As mentioned, Juice WRLD's mother, Carmela Wallace, was involved in this collaboration. Earlier this month, she shared remarks on the upcoming event, which you can read in full below.</p><p dir="ltr">"Jarad always loved to play Fortnite - it was more than just entertainment for him, it was a way to connect with others. From a young age, video games were a part of how he bonded with friends and family, and being in Fortnite is an incredible tribute to that connection. I know he would be overjoyed to see how his love for games continues to bring people together across different spaces, just like his music does.”</p><p dir="ltr">The debate over when it is or isn't acceptable to use a deceased person's likeness won't end when Fortnite Chapter 5 does next weekend, but Nanzer told me the company wants "music to permeate everything in Fortnite," which likely means this isn't the last time Fortnite will court controversy, even unintentionally, as it strives to fulfill its vision of a multimedia metaverse. In fact, there are already rumors that a future Fortnite collaboration will revolve around XXXTentacion, a musical artist who was murdered in 2018 at the age of 20.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is a tastemaker on a global scale. Much of the games industry over the past half-decade has been mired in chasing lucrative trends that Fortnite started or had massive success with. Once meant to be nothing more than a survival game, Fortnite is today an increasingly hard-to-define platform that doesn't merely feature pop culture; it shapes it. As Epic continues down this path of making the ultimate <em>everything</em> experience, it's inevitably molding what the future looks like, whether we're ready to live there or not.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Editor's note: Remarks from Mrs. Wallace were added to the body of this story shortly after publishing.</em></p>

Is it an anthology putting multiple heroes into a game of hot potato with the universe’s crises? Or could it learn a thing or two from its science fiction sibling <em>Mass Effect,</em> and commit to being a series built on choice and consequence rather than feeling burdened by it? More so than past games, <em>The Veilguard </em>positions the series to go either way, and its failings are evidence that BioWare needs to make a decision one way or another as it moves on to whatever comes next.</p><figure id="" data-id="def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-recommend-id="image://def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-recommend-id="image://def8bb1eaf0e154b8e8309de07b9ded8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Morrigan and Rook look up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>BioWare’s messaging on why it made the call to shave cross-game connectivity down to three choices and a character creator has been spotty, with the team claiming they only imported choices <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they could meaningfully represent</a></span>. <em>The Veilguard </em>gives us a new, heavily customizable protagonist in Rook, a mercenary recruited by fan-favorite party member Varric, and it takes place in the northern regions of Thedas, far removed from the events of the previous <em>Dragon Ages</em>.

Overall, we still get a flattened version of that character, one who arguably should have been the protagonist fighting against Solas, the ex-party member turned antagonist. I played my Inquisitor as a resentful atheist dragged into a holy war, but the man who bears his title in <em>The Veilguard</em> only resembles him in voice, not beliefs. In a vacuum, I don’t blame BioWare for not being able to match the very particular story I wrote in my head with a pre-defined character. But that problem could have been solved if I had been controlling him this time around.<br></p><p><em>The Veilguard </em>only imports three choices, but it doesn’t feel fully disconnected from games of the past. A lot of its narrative comes from worldbuilding we’ve watched unfold over 15 years. Multiple characters like <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ Witch of the Wilds Morrigan, <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s storyteller Varric, and <em>Inquisition</em>’s Tevinter pariah Dorian make appearances throughout the game in roles of varying importance. BioWare carefully writes around the specifics of what you might have done in previous games so each of these party members could have feasibly ended up where they have regardless of what you’ve done. The handling of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s Isabela is more questionable, as dialogue in <em>The Veilguard </em>heavily implies she was recruited during the second game, though it’s possible to play <em>II </em>without her in your party if you don’t actually get around to asking her to join. This is a very specific scenario that few players probably ever saw, but it’s an example of how, even as BioWare tries to be respectful of past choices (largely by not bringing most of them up), some paths are bound to slip through the cracks.</p><figure id="" data-id="7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-recommend-id="image://7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-recommend-id="image://7b8c7ff193f1b2e2d5cb48a4dbe64822" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Inquisitor and Rook sit at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Admittedly this is the kind of nitpicking that only the sickest of sickos like me could ever engage in because we’re the only ones who even notice, but it’s the trap BioWare has set for itself. Establishing choice, consequence, and carryover as a pillar of your studio’s ethos means that fans can spend years imagining what their decisions might mean in the future, only for the reality to not match the theories that have been spreading through the community as what seemed like huge choices end up being a mere footnote in the grand scheme of things. Some of the biggest choices in previous games ended up funneling to the same outcome, and people were inevitably upset to see that magnified tenfold in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s limited import.<br></p><p>It’s clear that BioWare has aspirations that often get gradually chipped away throughout development as time and resources restrict what’s possible. Fans have datamined <em>Veilguard </em>files that imply some decisions that weren’t imported were meant to be at one point in production, and there’s an art book full of references to choices and consequences that never made it into the final game. Ex-<em>Dragon Age </em>writer David Gaider has been dropping bombs on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwg2555s22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwg2555s22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></span> about the logistics of recognizing different decisions in sequels. The actual, realistic possibilities of reactivity in these games will likely never match the expectations. Having existed in online BioWare spaces for over a decade, I know a lot of fans want a diverging main plot in response to their decisions, but that’s often not feasible given the budget and time constraints of AAA games.</p><p>That’s the promise we imagine when we talk about choice and consequence, right? Games like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>could be, in a perfect world, digital choose-your-own-adventure books or tabletop games that react to every little thing we do with an infinite number of outcomes and branching paths. But if that isn’t feasible, what is reasonable to expect?<em> Mass Effect</em>, despite its problems and some glaring exceptions, was able to deliver on some major choices by the time <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect 3</em></a></span> rolled around thanks to its fixed perspective of protagonist Commander Shepard. <em>Dragon Age </em>has pulled off stunning moments like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nearly-brought-back-another-h-1851704334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-nearly-brought-back-another-h-1851704334">Here Lies the Abyss questline</a></span>, but none of those change the core plot. Perhaps some disappointment over this is on fans for not having more measured hopes, but I can’t help but feel like <em>Dragon Age </em>is fundamentally ill-equipped to deliver the choice and consequence that BioWare’s pedigree has conditioned people to expect.</p><figure id="" data-id="8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-recommend-id="image://8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-recommend-id="image://8935d4e5bcfa18e440635372d694d507" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hawke, Varric, and the Inquisitor speak at Skyhold." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Dragon Age </em>is, ostensibly, an anthology. It jumps around the world of Thedas and, with each new entry, gives us a new protagonist to inhabit and a different problem to solve. Meanwhile, it also imports choices from previous games as it teleports us to the other side of the universe. <em>Dragon Age </em>has always wanted to have its cake and eat it too. The stories it tells are so directly tied to the people at their center that the protagonist switch that occurs with each new game has always felt like an arbitrary choice, not one that actually serves the tales it’s telling. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s flattening of the Inquisitor<em> </em>was the most damning example, but <em>Inquisition</em>’s transition from <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s Hawke to the Inquisitor was hardly seamless. Corypheus, the antagonist of <em>Inquisition</em>, debuted in <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s <em>Legacy </em>DLC and was directly tied to the family lineage of Hawke. When the Champion of Kirkwall appeared in <em>Inquisition</em> as a customizable NPC, they were similarly flattened and also unwilling to stick around to solve the problem they’d started in the previous game. When the heroes we embody are so quickly discarded, even when they have deep personal ties to what’s going on, is it so surprising that the minutiae also falls down the chasm with them?<br></p><p>Now that <em>The Veilguard </em>has only imported three choices, none of which acknowledge the specifics of the larger world, it’s interesting to look at the game and realize that a lot of its big decisions feel more insular than those in previous games, like they might not need to be imported into the next one. Broadly, the main plot of stopping the elven gods doesn’t change no matter what you do, and even the final choice is more about deciding the flavor with which the same final event happens. Most of the variables you can alter happen within the story of <em>The Veilguard</em>, rather than the story of <em>Dragon Age </em>writ large. That isn’t to say the game isn’t gesturing toward the future; it’s just that there are fewer choices that feel like they’re being put on a shelf to be examined later, even as the game essentially wraps up most of the lingering lore threads of the past and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436">paves the way for a new conflict</a></span>.</p><p>All that being said, the final image we see in <em>The Veilguard </em>is a Marvel-esque tease indicating that the titular group “remains vigilant.” BioWare has already confirmed that it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has no DLC plans</a></span> for the game as it shifts focus to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">fifth <em>Mass Effect</em></a></span>, so whatever comes next, it sounds like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-best-companions-lucanis-taash-neve-1851688830">the party</a></span> is going to play some part in the next game.

Many of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s big decisions feel so tied to them, their relationships, and their experiences as a mercenary dragged into a leadership role, that they feel primed to serve as the face of the franchise moving forward. They’ve found alliances across all of northern Thedas, have storylines that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-harding-davrin-death-alive-survive-1851697615">don’t seem tied up yet</a></span>, and their arc in <em>The Veilguard</em> seems destined for more stories. Just because <em>Dragon Age </em>has handed off old conflicts to new heroes with each new game in the past doesn’t mean it has to keep doing so. If BioWare wants a fresh start, it’s the perfect time to try something new.<br></p><p><em>Dragon Age</em>’s biggest problem with continuity was never that carrying choices over in a meaningful way was impossible, it was that its constant expansion in scope and shifting perspective made it more difficult to craft stories that satisfactorily reflected the choices made. <em>The Veilguard </em>can serve as a new beginning. Letting it<em> </em>function as a kind of narrative starting point from which to branch out, along with letting Rook provide a consistent perspective through which we can experience the chapter or chapters to come, all approached with more forethought than we’ve seen the series demonstrate in the past, would be the best use of this game’s potential.</p><p>If we’re shedding the old to make way for something new, it’s worth examining the shortcomings of the past. I don’t know what BioWare has planned for the next <em>Dragon Age</em>, but I would love to see the studio take a leap of faith with a hero who hasn’t been sanded down into an NPC yet. <em>Dragon Age </em>has had multiple chances to find its own Commander Shepard. The best time to do it would have been when the Inquisitor was in the spotlight ten years ago. The next best time is right now. Rook spends all of <em>The Veilguard </em>learning to be a leader, and now that the training wheels are off, maybe it’s time to let one person steer the ship.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And while you might not be shocked to hear that in this harsh and painful video game world you sometimes have to kill wildlife, you might be surprised by how often it ends up being a dog at the end of your barrel. </p><p>Within the first 20 minutes of booting up <em>Stalker 2</em> on Xbox Series X I was forced to gun down a dog that attacked me in the  prologue. I didn’t think much of it, but I also don’t really mind killing <em>anything </em>in a game. Perhaps I’m a cold bastard. Perhaps its because I grew up in a rural area where animals died frequently due to coyotes, cold, and so on. Not sure. </p><p>But as I continued to play, more dogs kept getting killed. And even I, a cold-blooded monster in video games, started to feel weird about it. </p><p>Sure, the dogs in<em> Stalker 2</em> are mutated a bit, but they still growl, bark, and whimper when shot, and they look an awful lot like a dog you might have as a pet, so it still might be uncomfortable for some.</p><p>For example, right after the prologue/tutorial section wraps up, a cutscene plays in which a dog bites your character’s foot and wakes you up. Before he can shoot it, the poor animal is grabbed by a weird radioactive anomaly and spun into an explosion of blood and skin. </p><p>Then, I had to kill a few more dogs on my way to a town where I could get quests, buy and sell loot, and stash some of my stuff. I wondered if there were other enemies in the game. (There are and <em>oh god</em> they are deadly and scary.)</p><p>Once I reached town and watched a few cutscenes, I talked to a bartender and asked about work. He gave me two missions, one of which involved tracking down some stray dogs and killing them. Then, after I left the bar and explored the town, a different NPC called out to me and asked I wanted to help out with a job. The job? Killing a pack of dogs. At this point, I did start to wonder if everyone in this town hated dogs. </p><p>Leaving town to do a different quest involving a person hiding from a few different groups, I tracked down a possible location for the target. I arrived and ran into bandits who just so happened to have a bunch of wild dogs in their base. I mean, I assume they were wild strays because when I killed them after they attacked me, nobody in the base cared at all. Perhaps they’re even more coldhearted than me?</p><p>This all happened in the first 3 to 4 hours of <em>Stalker 2.</em> As I continued to play, the dog killing became a bit less common, but they are an enemy you’ll run into a lot and NPCs will ask you to kill them during (what I think are) randomly generated quests. </p><p>So if the idea of killing a dog in a video game makes you squeamish or it just sounds like a shitty experience, than I’d recommend not playing <em>Stalker 2</em>. And if you do enjoy killing dogs in games, that’s...weird, but uh, boy, this new game is for you! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's a perfect time for Iron Wolves to be thankful as Destiny 2's Iron Banner event will make its return next week. The Iron Banner usually brings along new weapons and ornaments, and this event will be no different as it introduces both a new armor set and rocket sidearm into the the loot pool. </p><p>On Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-11-21-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week In Destiny</a> announcements, the name of the armor set was revealed--Iron Intent--with pieces "worthy of Weyloran, Nirwen, and Orewig" themselves. Players will know those names as great Iron Lords, who've all had weapons and ornaments named after them throughout the years. The Iron Banner will return to the game starting on November 26, with the match type of Control for the first week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403765"></a><figcaption>The new Iron Banner armor set, Iron Inent, for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4403765-iron_banner_armor.jpg"></figure><p>The armor has a Norse-adjacent aesthetic with the Titan helmet almost looking like a hammer with the Warlock mask having studded horns. All three have intricate braiding embossing up and down the plates. Destiny has had similar ornaments before with the Valhund set, but still very different in presentation.</p><p>Along with the Iron Intent set, the announcement teased the first-ever Stasis rocket sidearm. It also revealed that it would be possible to get the weapon with the Loose Change perk with Chill Clip perks. As Iron Banner events are now two weeks long, there's plenty of time to get the perfect roll on the new weapon. The few rocket sidearms in the game have proven to be excellent, and the current Artifact has a lot of Stasis weapon-centric perks, so it should be a pretty desirable weapon. </p><p>The previous Iron Banner brought new versions of old favorites, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-claws-of-the-wolf-god-roll-guide/1100-6524666/" data-ref-id="1100-6524666">Claws of the Wolf</a> pulse rifle and Crimil's Dagger hand cannon. This will be the last time the banner is raised and Lord Saladin's sigil is lit during this episode, and if you missed out, it's a great time to make your enemies hear the howls and know fear.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Songs Of Silence Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/songs-of-silence-rules.1042356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/songs-of-silence-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Songs Of Silence</em>, man, where has this game been hiding? Last week I had never even heard of it. For the week since I have been doing nothing but playing this game.</p><p>It's a strategy game I've seen billed as everything from a 4X to an auto battler, and many other things in between (I'll take my own swing at what it is in a second). Set in a fantasy world where two races of ancient humans have battled so long they've literally split the world in two, you can play skirmish maps or fight your way through a narrative singleplayer campaign that features both sides caught in a war that threatens to destroy them both.</p><p>For all the tags and descriptors being thrown around about this game--it comes slightly out of left field, so it's difficult to precisely pin down--I'd say the overall experience is closest to playing a <em>Total War</em> campaign if you'd given the <em>Total War</em> series to an engineer and said "trim as much of this as you can while still keeping the overall vibes". Your objective in every <em>Songs of Silence</em> game, whether in the campaign or a skirmish map, is broadly the same: take and hold settlements on a strategic map, which accrue resources you then spend on upgrades, unique buildings or new units.</p><p>Leading your armies are hero units, which in RPG style are unique and can be levelled up, and who also have special abilities they can employ on the battlefield. The armies themselves, meanwhile, are made up of a wild variety of fantasy units ranging from cheap infantry through to expensive, gargantuan behemoths. See what I mean? I'm basically describing the outline of <em>Total War: Warhammer</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Songs of Silence - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yENpBzdm5PE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Only<em> Songs of Silence</em> does away with so much of <em>Total War's</em> faff. Diplomacy? Boring, so it's gone. Trade? Little more than tick-a-box, so it's gone too. All that's left is the heartbeat of Creative Assembly's series: the elastic to-and-fro of armies manoeuvring about a map that's always just slightly too big for them to hold down, and settling things on the battlefield in real-time when two of those armies clash.</p><p>Which is the point where <em>Songs of Silence</em> starts to get <em>really </em>interesting,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_battler" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> because it's an auto battler</a>. You're the one building the armies, deciding on their composition and arranging them into formation, but once a battle starts every unit will (mostly) run off and do its own thing, with the player left as a bystander. The only direct input you have on proceedings is to play cards, which is a lot more important than it sounds, because they're the lifeblood of <em>Songs of Silence</em>.</p><figure></figure><p>On the battlefield, each leader gets their own deck of cards with special abilities they can play, and as you progress through a game and level your generals up you'll earn both more and better cards. Defensive abilities, offensive abilities, spawning new units on the battlefield, slowing your opponent down–there's a ton of ways you can influence the battle, even if you're not micromanaging each unit individually.</p><p>As a serial auto-resolver in long <em>Total War</em> campaigns, this is great. Look, I appreciate all the work that goes into <em>Total War's</em> real-time battles, and in decisive moments I'll usually always take control of them and have a blast, but over the course of a sprawling campaign that could feature dozens or even <em>hundreds </em>of engagements, I just can't be bothered taking charge of <em>all </em>of them. <em>Songs of Silence's</em> brevity is a great middle ground here, as I get some involvement, but can then kick back and watch a battle unfold in what is sometimes just a matter of seconds.</p><p>Cards can also be played on the strategic map, replacing much of what other games would build into an interface full of buttons (<em>Songs of Silence's</em> screen is beautifully uncluttered as a result.). These can buff armies or, more commonly, allow you to build structures and improvements on your settlements. Wherever you play these cards, on the battlefield or the map, the act is immensely satisfying; there's a flashy animation and feel to dragging a card onto the map and seeing a big stone tower come roaring out of the ground.</p><p>This all comes together to create an intoxicating pace. You just glide through <em>Songs of Silence</em>, frictionless, from one task to the next, never stopping or needing to pause, dancing in rhythm between moving an army on the map, upgrading something then having a little fight. Management is brief, battles are short, it's like strategic tapas in a genre that's normally only interested in huge steaks.</p><figure></figure><p>Helping drive all this is the fact I could not ever take my eyes away from the screen. Just look at this game. <em>Songs of Silence</em> is <em>stunning</em>. The splash art, the character design, the illustrations punctuating the end of every battle, the card art, the animation of all your little armies zooming around, the unit design, the little sensory thrill of playing a card, it's all wonderful.</p><p>The old cliche isn't as robust as it once was--stuff like <em>Endless Legend</em> and even recent <em>Fire Emblem</em> games have helped--but strategic fantasy in video games is still too often a generic, nondescript thing, one series' elf blurring into another series' stout human infantry. Not here! This game looks like nothing else out there (well, maybe a little like <em>Banner Saga</em> if you squint), and the story it's telling, complete with fantastic voice-acting, is also one that's well-told. This game's got a <em>world</em>, and it is an interesting place to spend some time in.</p><p>I have no idea how this game flew under my radar for so long--I mean I do, games media is broken and Steam's discovery is almost useless because simply too many games are coming out--but hey, whatever, I found it eventually. <em>Songs of Silence</em> is one of the most refreshing strategy games I've played in a very long time, and an unexpected artistic triumph at that. It's ironic that it's an auto battler, a genre often derided for being so hands-off, because I've been glued to this all week long.</p><figure></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2023 sci-fi blockbuster was one of my personal top-10 games of the year but didn’t land on as many people’s lists as <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its fantasy-based sibling, however, <em>Armored Core VI</em> is a lot more straightforward with short missions and generous checkpointing that lets you focus on tough boss fights without worrying about backtracking or losing XP when you die. Plus the grim industrial vibes and anime mech drama are immaculate. </p><p>Who knows how long both games will stay on sale. The games aren’t currently discounted on the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts or Steam, though the digital discounts might be coming closer to Black Friday. So far FromSoftware hasn’t indicated if <em>Armored Core VI</em> will get its own <em>Shadow of the</em> <em>Erdtree</em>-sized expansion, but I’m still holding out hope that it eventually will. Maybe sometime in 2025.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>All in all, Helldivers 2 and Final Fantasy Rebirth VII did incredibly well, with both of them winning four awards each. Black Myth: Wukong also did reasonably well for itself, getting two awards during the ceremony.</p>

            <p>Various games in the Shiren The Wanderer (and Mystery Dungeon) series have been recommended to me over and over, but I've yet to play any of them. I likely won't play the next, either. Shiren The Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is headed to PC <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2178480/Shiren_the_Wanderer_The_Mystery_Dungeon_of_Serpentcoil_Island/">via Steam</a> soon.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Mystery Dungeon Of Serpentcoil Island is much akin to the previous games in the series. These are traditional roguelikes, in which you head into a randomised dungeon split across many floors and attempt to delve ever deeper using the resources you find along the way. It's also got some neat online features, such as the ability to rescue or be rescued by other players should you collapse on a particular floor, so that you can continue with that character.
</p>
<p>Serpentcoil switches up the setting, introduces somewhat rudimentary 3D graphics, and modernises the UI a little, but should otherwise be deeply familiar to anyone who has played previous games in the series.
</p>
<p>The last Shiren game was The Tower Of Fortune And The Dice Of Fate, which you'd be forgiven for thinking was a relatively recent game, given it launched on PC and Switch in 2020. Alas, no, it first launched on Nintendo DS in Japan in 2010, and in the west for the Vita in 2016. That makes Serpentcoil Island the first new game in the series for 14 years.
</p><p>Serpentcoil Island also launched on Switch back in January of this year, which means you can find out every detail about the game if you're so inclined. It was pretty well received, with Famitsu giving it 38 out of 40.
</p>
<p>Why won't I play it? Because I find my patience for traditional roguelikes has lessened, these days. I might have plunged into my last procedural dungeon. Whatever appetite I do have left, I'm saving for the far more ambitious and wild Caves Of Qud, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-teases-a-10-release-date-with-a-tricksy-riddle-about-beetle-moons">due a polished 1.0 release on December 5th</a>. I do continue to enjoy listening to others wax lyrical about these games though, so if you think I'm wrongheaded and I should give Shiren his due, please pen a passionate ode in the comments.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-reveals-new-stealth-gameplay-details/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has provided players with new stealth gameplay details for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The main focus of the new gameplay was Naoe, the agile shinobi. However, some skills are applicable to Yasuke the Samurai, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-new-stealth-features">Assassin’s Creed Shadows New Stealth Features</h2>



<h3 id="h-observe-and-eagle-vision">Observe and Eagle Vision</h3>



<p>With the removal of the eagle companion, players in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will have to rely on two different scouting mechanics. The first is Observe, allowing players to identify targets, tag and monitor enemies, and highlight lootable stashes, collectables, and quest objectives. Players can also examine nearby locations through a Synch Point while using the Observe skill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next is Eagle Vision, and this Assassin’s Creed Stealth mechanic identifies enemy positions and lets you tag them behind walls and other objects. Eagle Vision will also isolate any relevant sounds the enemies make and let you find hiding spots. Naoe can use these skills separately and concurrently to survey the area better.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Observe" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HIElO8_Jtec?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-hiding-crouching-and-going-prone">Hiding, Crouching and Going Prone</h3>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Features are movement mechanics, which include hiding in shadows, crouching, and going prone. During the nighttime, players will find different hiding pots covered in shadows—the best way to ambush their enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Crouching is an effective movement mechanic for indoors. If players crouch, then the sound they make decreases drastically. Also, their visibility is much lower when compared to standing. Crouching will also reduce the chance of you walking into any noisy objects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Assassin’s Creed Shadows stealth mechanic is for both Yasuke and Naoe. Players can be prone to reducing their visibility further when on rooftops, on the ground, or even underwater. When using prone as Naoe, players will be able to roll side to side or front to back by pressing the dodge buttons. There are also certain locations that you can crawl under by using prone.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Prone Assassination" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-stealth-tools">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Stealth Tools</h3>



<p>As a stealthy shinobi in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Naoe uses an array of tools to move around as sneakily as possible. Naoe has four primary tools: Smoke Bomb, Shinobi Bells, Kunai and Shuriken. The first two are great for escaping or distracting enemies, while the others are better for damaging or stunning them.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Smoke Bomb" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ-AWZISiK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-return-of-double-assassinations-nbsp">Return of Double Assassinations&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players can go on the ultimate stealth runs, thanks to the return of Double Assassinations. All you need to do is have Tanto as your primary weapon and unlock the dedicated skill to perform the Double Assassination with the Hidden Blade.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a non-lethal stealth mechanic, which is grabbing. Players can silently assassinate their enemies by grabbing them and pulling them into the shadows or bushes to get rid of them. Moreover, Naoe is the “smallest Assassin to date”, so she will be able to squeeze through tiny wall cracks and hide inside small storage spaces and boxes to surprise her enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Grab Mechanic" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5y4HB6S_Mew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-enemy-reactions">Enemy Reactions</h3>



<p>While developing Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ stealth mechanics, the developers also focused on enemy tactics. Servants are a new non-lethal enemy that will be introduced in this game. They cannot harm you but can raise alarms to reveal your location to other enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enemies will be more suspicious in the game once you have been detected. If you hide after being spotted, they will start looking for you in pairs and be more on guard moving forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another unique enemy in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a Samurai. They cannot be tackled as you would with a regular enemy, as they are much more skilled. For example, players can’t assassinate them with a smoke bomb, and Samurai are likelier to deny their assassinations. Moreover, Samurais will also slice bushes when searching for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassination Denial is also a new system, where an enemy is denoted with a white colour if they are an instant kill, a yellow colour if you need to deal some damage, and a red colour if the enemy will completely deny your assassination attempt.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Assassin's Creed Shadows - Stealth Deep Dive: Denied Assassinations" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xP0AV65Zpl8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-yasuke-s-stealth-features">Yasuke’s Stealth Features</h3>



<p>Last but not least are Yasuke’s stealth mechanics in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Yasuke is a samurai, a character that players should pick for a more aggressive approach. However, players can be stealthy if they use their bow and start picking enemies off from a distance. Yasuke can get behind enemies and deal swift finishing blows with his melee weapons.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 developer Saber Interactive has announced it's banning mods from public online sessions, blaming them for a "non-negligible" amount of server instability seen by players - even those who don't have mods installed.
</p>
<p>
"We've seen incredible community engagement since launch, and we've noticed that some players have started to create and share mods for Space Marine 2," game director Dmitriy Grigorenko wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/6681747476222836957?l=english">message to the community shared on Steam</a>. "Mods are great, and they will no doubt contribute to this game's longevity."
</p>
<p>
"However, we as developers must also ensure game stability and continuously work towards a smoother experience for all players," Grigorenko continued. "Our data shows that a non-negligible amount of recent server stability issues are related to mods, and that instability impacts even those users who don't have mods installed. We have also received user reports that their save files were corrupted after playing alongside players with mods."

<p>
As a result of the studio's findings, mods will be prohibited from all public online sessions once Space Marine 2's next major update arrives in December. "You will no longer be able to enter a public game if you have mods installed," Grigorenko emphasised. That doesn't mean the end for Space Marine 2 mods, however. Acknowledging them as "a source of fun and creativity", Grigorenko confirmed players can still use mods online in private Operations lobbies, and they'll also be permitted in custom Eternal War lobbies once launched.
</p><p>
"We will also be providing an easy entry point to our backend for games with mods installed," Grigorenkoso added, "so modders won't have to spend time hacking the game executable after each patch." Additionally, the studio intends to give modders access to some of its own tools at a later date, "so they can develop mods with greater ease".
</p>
<p>
Space Marine 2's December update also introduces the Dark Angel Chapter Pack, the Tzaangor Enlightened enemy, plus a new PvE map set on Demerium, titled Obelisk. And if that's still not enough Warhammer to fill your December, Games Workshop recently confirmed Amazon's upcoming Secret Level series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-getting-an-animated-sequel-in-amazons-new-secret-level-series">include an animated Space Marine 2 sequel</a>.
