			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> was more than an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of Croteam's first-person philosophical puzzle-solving classic. It also included a whole new expansion for players, In the Beginning.</p>
<p>The new expansion includes 18 puzzles, 16 of which were made <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858">in collaboration with a few of The Talos Principle's most dedicated fans</a> who'd been designing puzzles for years already. This is a key fact about this new expansion's development because these are some of the most challenging puzzles across the entire Talos Principle series. Who else besides the community's sickos (positive) could have designed them?</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through solving the puzzle Eclipse, which is located in the Egypt section of the In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Eclipse Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>Part of what makes this puzzle challenging is that many of the components are only necessary for you to concern yourself with if you're trying to get the Gold Star.</p>
<p>If you want a big hint without looking at the rest of this guide for the solution, know that about half the puzzle area can be ignored if you want to grab the tetromino and be on your way. Another far more cryptic hint is that pause points and having items flying in the air while paused are part of how you solve this puzzle.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you've spent long enough trying to solve this on your own and now want the solution. Keep reading to see how this puzzle can be solved.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>
<p>To start solving this puzzle, you first need to get the key to the locked door on the left side of the puzzle area.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Head towards the currently disabled barrier to the right. Grab the connector on the elevated step, connect it to the blue beam and the blue node immediately adjacent to each other, and place the connector to the left of the slightly elevated step. You should also angle it to stay connected to the node it was first connected to when you walked into the puzzle room. This will turn off the barrier, but a fan still blocks you from walking beyond the barrier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>


<ul>
<li>Turn around, and you will see a hexahedron (box) on a weighted switch to your right. Grab the box, and while standing slightly on the other side of the barrier that you've turned off, place the box on the elevated step to turn off the fan.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan off the vent and use it on the weighted switch to turn off the barrier in front of you. Grab the box off the elevated step to allow the blue beam to re-connect, turning off the barrier on the left so both are off, and you can retrieve the fan. Grab it and place it down next to the box and connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Bring the box and the fan to the starting area, placing the fan on the vent on the ground to the right of the weighted switch in front of the puzzle entrance. Place the box on the weighted switch, activating the vent. Jump onto the vent to lift yourself in the air, and you'll see the keys on the platform in front of you. Jump on the platform to grab the keys.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<h3>Phase Two</h3>
<p>Now you have the keys to unlock the door and access the recorder. But you still need the connector, which is currently trapped on the wrong side of the barrier it is keeping disabled. This is where you'll start utilizing the recorder. Getting the connector on the right side of the barrier is the easy part. After that, it all gets much more complex. Let's start with getting the connector on the right side of the barrier.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>After unlocking the door with the keys, activate the recorder and create a pause point anywhere you like. Hit play on the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Thanks to the duplicated version of the connector in the recording, you can now grab the connector without disconnecting the beams when the recording pauses. Place the connector next to the vents and weighted switch in the puzzle entrance before letting the rest of the recording play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Connector acquired. Here's where it gets trickier.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and connect it to the red beam and the red node shown in the screenshot above. Place the connector down next to the vent.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Start a new recording and grab the fan to use as a weight on the weighted switch on the left side of the puzzle area.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and connect it to the red node, which you should be able to see through a window in the wall. Leave the connector there.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the fan off the weighted switch and place it back on the vent on the floor. After you've completed those actions, create a pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the box, step on the weighted switch that activates the fans, and create another pause point.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Drop the box on the fan directly in front of the weighted switch, and once it has reached its peak height, make another pause point. You can now walk over to the recorder and stop the recording.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>As your recording begins to play, pick up the fan again, place it on the same weighted switch you placed it on in the recording, and leave it there. Once your recorded self has placed the fan back on the vent and hit the first pause point, put the box on top of the fan while keeping it paused. Grab the connector, connect it to the duplicated recording version of the connector, and place the connector on the box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With the recording still paused, head over to the left side of the puzzle room and beyond the purple barrier. Play the recording, and the blue barrier in front of you should be lifted once the box and the connector are in the air. The recording will pause again; don't unpause it until you've walked beyond the blue barrier.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>At this point, you're nearly there. The barrier shield blocking your way to the tetromino should be lifted with the box and the connector in the air, but a fan blowing impedes you from walking to it.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Un-pause the recording again, and once everything is in the air, the duplicated recorded box should line up perfectly to block the red beam keeping the fan on, allowing you to grab the tetromino and complete the puzzle. It won't block the beam continuously, though, as the box with the connector on it bounces in the air. It's best to watch the box rise, and once you see it block the beam, make a break for the tetromino.</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll want to give the red beams enough time to properly activate each node, as long-time Talos Principle players know that nodes don't always activate immediately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-releases-free-color-blindness-tool-for-developers.1164639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released a free color blindness simulation tool to help developers understand how to make their games accessible to those with three major types of color blindness.</p>

<p>The tool's name is Chroma, and it's available on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/Chroma" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> as an open-source kit. It won't cost you anything to use it, either, so if you're a developer and you want to know how to make your game better for colorblind folks, Ubisoft's got you covered.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Ubisoft's official website, Chroma's purpose is to "accurately replicate" the experience of colorblind gamers and help developers to "create accessible content to meet [those players'] needs".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness-tool-windows.jpg?itok=aumZzukO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-chroma-color-blindness-tool-windows.jpg?itok=xRgcz93m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft's Chroma color blindness tool is now free for all developers to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft's accessibility director David Tisserand says Chroma has been a "highly efficient" tool for Ubisoft when developing its own games, and that he and his team believe "accessibility is a journey, not a race", which is why they're sharing Chroma with the wider industry.</p>

<p>Since Chroma is open-source, developers are welcome to "benefit from it, provide feedback, and contribute to its future development", according to Tisserand. That's a pretty nice touch.</p>

<p>You can use Chroma on either single or dual screens, and it's hotkey-compatible as well. What's more, you can customize its overlay to make it look the way that works best for you.</p>

<p>QC product manager Jawad Shakil says Chroma was created to "mak[e] color blindness accessibility a natural part of the creative and testing process", and that the Chroma team's work is "already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-2-accessibility.jpg?itok=NMhdk-ig 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-2-accessibility.jpg?itok=kya3ULOA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games, like&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, now ship with color blindness options.</figcaption></figure><p>More and more games are including extensive accessibility options at launch. Games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-showcases-expansive-last-of-us-part-1-accessibility-features" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us Part 1</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options" rel="nofollow">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a></em>, among many others,&nbsp;are launching with options like color blindness modes and audio descriptions, and titles that don't launch with these concessions often receive them as updates.</p>

<p>Ubisoft's color blindness tool Chroma is available to download and use right now for free.</p>

            <p>The GeForce RTX 50 series – Nvidia’s hated, adored, but never ignored family of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">gaming GPUs</a> – could soon be complete, as the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti have been specced out ahead of their imminent releases. These are mostly as-expected replacements for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">RTX 4060</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-ti-review">RTX 4060 Ti</a>, with moderate performance bumps augmented by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation</a>, though the RTX 5060 Ti is getting a lowered MSRP on both its 8GB and 16GB variants.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>While there won't be a Founders Edition for any of these, partner versions of the 8GB RTX 5060 Ti will start from £349 / $379 - £40 / $20 less than the 8GB 4060 Ti. Base-price 16GB models, meanwhile, will shed £80 / $70 from the last-gen equivalent, selling at £399 / $429. Both are officially launching this Wednesday, April 16th, though an Nvidia spokesperson told digitally gathered reporters last week (myself included) that a lot of 8GB RTX 5060 Ti models might not actually go on sale until later on.</p>
<p>As for the RTX 5060, that’s sticking solely to 8GB, and will start at $299 (UK pricing TBC) when it has its own as-yet-unspecified release in May. The lack of extra VRAM over the RTX 4060 will likely keep it limited to 1080p duties, though that’s evidently not been a problem for the latter, which currently sits second on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/Steam-Hardware-Software-Survey-Welcome-to-Steam">Steam’s list of the most-used graphics cards</a>. Only after, funnily enough, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review">RTX 3060</a>. It does use newer GDDR7 memory, though, as does the RTX 5060 Ti.</p>

<p>Here be some Nvidia-provided benchmark graphs to peer over, and yes, you <em>can</em> click to make them human eye-sized. Predictably, they count MFG’s AI-generated frames in amongst the traditionally rendered ones, which trickifies the business of making core performance comparisons against previous generations. Except, that is, in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">A Plague Tale: Requiem</a>, which lacks MFG support and is thus comparable with the RTX 4060’s lowly 2x frame gen. Nvidia, you fools! Now it’s laid bare that, uh, both 5060 GPUs are about 20% faster over their 4060 counterparts, which doesn’t sound all that bad. Especially right after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-review">RTX 5070</a>, which is essentially just an RTX 4070 Super <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaOgZwk9rN8">with a new hat</a>.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/RTX-5060-official-benchmarks.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nvidia</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Frame generation remains as contentious a subject as the RTX 50 range itself, and to be honest, I’m still not sure how it’s perceived and used by the majority of ordinary players. Maybe you’d like to answer the poll below and educate me on that point. I will say that all frame gen systems – MFG, DLSS 3, FSR, the lot – work best when your PC is already churning out a healthy supply of ordinary frames, so cheaper GPUs like the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti might not be able to rely on them as much as a hulking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a>. Here’s hoping the pre-generation framerate boost over the RTX 40 series is real, though obviously we have but the one rat-dodging stealth game for data points.</p>
<p>It's also unclear whether those (otherwise very agreeable) RTX 5060 Ti price drops will actually hold. Most of the previous RTX 50 GPU launches have been marred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5070-founders-editions-will-be-a-few-weeks-late-as-punters-and-sellers-brace-for-launch-day-shortages">stock shortages and resultant gouging</a>, and as the most mainstream-friendly of the pack, the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti seem especially vulnerable to instant sellouts. It's also too early to judge the impact of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-us-tariffs-hit-pc-hardware-is-joining-the-switch-2-in-pre-order-delay-limbo">US tariffs</a>: these were mostly paused/rolled back/wussed out of last week, though a base 10% tax remains, and Nvidia’s Taiwan-made GPUs aren’t counted among exemptions. Guess those <a href="https://www.theregister.com/AMP/2025/04/09/nvidia_us_export_ban_change/">$1m Mar-a-Lago dinners</a> only go so far.</p>

Images of what looks very much like that long-rumoured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> remake or remaster have leaked online care of Virtuos Games, the Singapore-based game developer reported to be handling the project.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The pics were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">dug up</a> by enterprising Redditor Taurnil, who inspected a random element on <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/">the Virtuos Games website</a>, and wangled his way to a Wordpress folder containing a bunch of images labelled “Elder Scrolls IV” and “Oblivion”, which were uploaded just today (15th April). 
</p>
<p>
I’ve been able to retrace Taurnil’s steps and access said folder. It appears somebody has Virtuos has spotted the leak, because the images in question are no longer accessible, but the filenames are still there at the time of writing. I’ve asked Virtuos for comment.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, somebody else claims to have uploaded a few images to <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">Imgur</a> – that's one of them up there in my article header. While they seem pretty credible, there is just the daintiest smidgeon of a ghostly possibility that they’ve been faked and posted for the lulz, so handle with caution. They show a few locations, including the Imperial City at Cyrodiil and a flaming Oblivion gate, together with a formal title, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered.
</p>
<p>Is this just a remaster, then, or more of a remake? Earlier rumours have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivions-rumoured-unreal-engine-remake-has-a-new-take-on-stealth-stamina-and-blocking-say-rumours">suggested</a> that the new version of Oblivion will make fairly robust changes to the original 2007 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s stealth, stamina and blocking systems. Assuming all of this is legit, it doesn't sound like they've just bumped up the resolution.</p>
<p>
Oblivion remake gossip is currently at fever pitch, alleviated not at all by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-have-no-official-information-on-an-oblivion-remake-say-bethesda-which-isnt-a-denial-is-it">a chancy-sounding Bethesda support statement that “we have no official information on an Oblivion remake”</a>. If I were Bethesda and had an announcement trailer in the offing, I’d probably think about running it early at this stage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-oblivion-remastered-coming-to-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Oblivion Remastered started leaking online on April 15, alongside exclusive details that uncovered a Deluxe Edition and other key elements. One concern fans of the Elder Scrolls franchise had was centered around the platforms that Oblivion Remastered would be released on (whenever it is released), prompting the question, ‘Is Oblivion Remastered coming to PS5?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-the-oblivion-remake-be-on-ps5">Will The Oblivion Remake Be on PS5?</h2>



<p>It’s yet to be confirmed by Bethesda Game Studios or Microsoft, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-leak-new-images-deluxe-edition-upgrades-remastered/">per the latest leaks</a>, Oblivion Remastered will be released on PlayStation 5 as well as on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>It’s most likely coming to the Game Pass subscription service, but again, that’s not confirmed at the time of publishing.</p>



<p>Oblivion Remastered was originally thought to be an Oblivion remake, but the leaks revealed that’s not the case. It looks fantastic from what we’ve seen, but it’s not a top-to-bottom rebuild of the entire game, which means many original elements will still exist.</p>



<p>That being said, it’s supposed to be an overhaul that adjusts combat, stealth, and archery mechanics, as well as making the game feel more ‘modern’ in general.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-oblivion-remastered-coming-out">When is Oblivion Remastered Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Presently, the leading rumours have claimed that Oblivion Remastered will be released after April 21, most likely on April 24. These rumours are to be taken with a pinch of salt as they’re unconfirmed at present, but notable insiders have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remake-release-next-week-claimed/">corroborated the reports</a>.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known if Oblivion Remastered will be an all-digital product or if there will be physical copies, but in my experience, it’s a safe bet to lean towards the former. I can’t imagine this will be released in physical form. </p>



<p>Do you intend to pick up a copy of Oblivion Remastered on PS5 when it’s released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/todays-best-deals-pokmon-tcg-like-a-dragon-kiryu-statue-lepro-smart-lights-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not often that I get to write about Pokémon TCG deals and smart light bulbs in the same guide, but here we are. Amazon’s finally offering decent prices on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> sealed product, which is the closest thing we’ve had to a “normal” launch since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pull-rates-for-pokmons-new-stellar-crown-tcg-expansion-are-fantastic">Stellar Crown</a>. Meanwhile, the IGN Store just opened preorders on a legitimately good-looking Kazuma Kiryu statue, Humble dropped a train simulator bundle for $15 that somehow has $283 worth of content, and Lepro’s doing their AI lighting thing again, except now it’s even cheaper. I didn’t expect to be tempted by half this stuff. Yet here I am.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Today’s Best Deals: Pokémon TCG, Like a Dragon Kiryu Statue, Lepro Smart Lights, and More</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best part? Most of this is first-party stock. These aren’t third-party resellers or warehouse dumps. The Pokémon deals come straight from Amazon, the statue is from the IGN Store, and Lepro’s discounts are backed by coupons and Prime shipping. Even the Humble bundle supports CALM, so you can simulate locomotives and feel slightly better about your backlog at the same time.</p><div id="218684" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Add MLB.TV and Get $30 Off Your First Month of Sling</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Now through May 31, you can tack on MLB.TV and stream every single out-of-market game and get $30 off your first month of Sling TV. Get access to ESPN, TBS, FS1, and more, plus a free month of unlimited DVR.</p></div></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218700"><div id="218700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the first time I’ve seen the ETB for a reasonable price without having to buy it from someone’s backseat eBay hustle. Nine booster packs, full-art N’s Zorua promo, card sleeves, energy, dice, the works. I’ve seen this box selling for $90+ since launch, so $70.31 from Amazon is genuinely solid. Lillie’s Clefairy ex is still floating around $180 and N’s Zoroark ex has dropped to $13, which tells me the hype has deflated and we’re in “buy because it’s fun” territory again. I like it here.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Jour">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218701"><div id="218701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the low-frills version for people who just want to open packs without pretending they’re going to organize their collection. Six Journey Together boosters and none of the ETB fluff. Honestly, this is how I like to test a set when prices cool off. You still have a shot at cards like Salamence ex SIR, which tanked from $250 to around $106, or a sub-$20 N’s Reshiram. Even if you pull nothing, at least you didn’t overpay trying to win the cardboard lottery.</p></div><p id="like-a-dragon-kazuma-kiryu-statu"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Like a Dragon - Kazuma Kiryu - Statu">Like a Dragon - Kazuma Kiryu Statue</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218702"><div id="218702" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon - Kazuma Kiryu - Statue</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not usually a statue guy, but this one’s sharp. Kiryu looks like he walked straight out of Yakuza 0 mid-heat-action combo, and the 11.4-inch sculpt from Kotobukiya actually does him justice. It ships in October, which gives me time to clear desk space and justify the price. It’s not cheap, but I’ve seen statues this size with way less detail go for more. I think if you’re a Like a Dragon fan, this is an easy preorder.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-jour"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Jour">Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218703"><div id="218703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG - Scarlet &amp; Violet: Journey Together - Sleeved Booster</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I threw one of these in my cart last week just to hit the free shipping minimum. One pack, random art, decent discount. There’s no reason to expect anything big, but the price is finally low enough that I don’t feel bad if I just pull a Furret. And if you happen to land something like Articuno’s Illustration Rare (now $18.69) or Wailord (around $14.55), it’s a nice win from a $10 impulse buy.</p></div><p id="train-sim-world-5-route-remix-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle">Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218704"><div id="218704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Train Sim world 5 Route Remix Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t know how many people wake up wanting ten train simulator add-ons, but if you’re one of them, today is your day. For $15, you get Train Sim World 5’s Starter Pack plus nine routes and loco add-ons. Antelope Valley, Cajon Pass, Thameslink, Santa Fe F7—the whole diesel buffet. It’s Steam keys, it supports CALM, and the value is so off the rails (pun fully intended) that I bought it just to mess around with the Railpool BR193 Vectron. Don’t judge me.</p></div><p id="lepro-o1-ai-floor-lamp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp">Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218705"><div id="218705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro O1 AI Floor Lamp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of those “tech that doesn’t make sense until you try it” products. It’s a smart LED floor lamp with AI-generated lighting modes, music sync, voice control, app scheduling, and a vibe for every mood. It’s absurdly bright at 2300 lumens, and it looks clean in any corner setup. The AI stuff isn’t just fluff either. Say “I want relaxing light” and it’ll give you ten preset scenes. I think it’s great if you want one light to do everything without fiddling with settings for half an hour.</p></div><p id="lepro-b2-ai-smart-light-bulbs"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs">Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218706"><div id="218706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lepro B2 AI Smart Light Bulbs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the same AI bulbs as the ones in the floor lamp, but in classic 75W-equivalent LED form. They’re bright, colorful, and weirdly helpful if you’re too tired to fine-tune your lighting manually. The music sync is fun, the AI scenes work well, and the voice commands actually feel smart instead of gimmicky. I bought a set of these last month and haven’t touched the wall switch since. At $8 per bulb, it’s kind of a no-brainer.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violet-surg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surg">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218606"><div id="218606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet - Surging Sparks</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up Surging Sparks because six booster packs under $50 is lower than what Amazon has been charging recently (It's still above MSRP though) Honestly, I wanted something new to crack open. It’s part of the latest Scarlet &amp; Violet expansion, so if you’re trying to keep up with current sets or just enjoy the chaos of pulling a good card, this one’s a smart grab.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-ionos-bellibolt-ex-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Pre">Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218607"><div id="218607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one’s for the collectors who care as much about presentation as they do the pulls. Iono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection comes with six packs, a full-art promo, and a display sheet that’s more elaborate than it needs to be — in a good way. It's also a cool way to snag Journey Together packs with a fantastic promo card.</p></div><div id="218685" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Free to Play VR Sandbox Game: DigiGods on Meta Quest</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>DigiGods is a free-to-play, physics-based, VR game that allows players to create, play, and share in a sandbox environment. Safety is a top priority with  the use of AI content filtering and human moderators to ensure a safe and positive environment.</p></div></div><p id="mass-effect-merchandise"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mass Effect Merchandise">Mass Effect Merchandise</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218608"><div id="218608" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect Merchandise</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think anyone who's replayed Mass Effect more than once knows exactly why these statues are tempting. I pre-ordered Jack immediately because, well, it felt necessary. The line includes Shepard, Tali, Legion, and others, and they look good enough that I’ve already made space for them on the shelf. If you're still quoting Garrus unironically, these are for you.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-pa"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Pa"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218609"><div id="218609" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet: Paldean Fates: Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Paldean Fates is priced a double MSRP, but it's also very hard to come by in 2025. I grabbed it because the baby shiny sub-set is awesome, but if you just want to grab the single cards from this set, it might actually save you money.</p></div><p id="fellow-traveller-publisher-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle">Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218610"><div id="218610" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fellow Traveller Publisher Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay less to get fewer items, or pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charity One Tree Planted</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle has some of the better narrative indies from the last few years. I paid the $12, added the games to my backlog like I always do, and immediately booted up The Pale Beyond. It’s a strong lineup if you like character-driven games and don’t mind occasionally being emotionally wrecked by minimalist storytelling.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shr"> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218611"><div id="218611" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of this one as the all-in-one box for when you want cards <em>and</em> a bunch of gear you probably won’t use but still want around. Nine booster packs, a promo, sleeves, dice, and enough extras to make you feel like you’re doing more than just opening packs. It’s a solid option if you like having a little structure with your chaos.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-terapagos-ex-ultra-pre"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Pre"> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218612"><div id="218612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Pokémon TCG: Terapagos ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I hesitated on this one, then immediately remembered it includes 18 booster packs and a playmat. It’s definitely a big spend, but if you’ve been waiting for a premium bundle that actually justifies the price, this checks out. I picked it up more for the experience than the individual cards, and that’s the right way to approach it.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-shining-fates-collectio"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collectio">Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h2></p><div catalogid="e45a74c9-b9d4-478c-991d-5d8e613269a4" id="218613"><div id="218613" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I grabbed Shining Fates Pikachu V mostly because I never actually opened it when it first dropped, and now seemed like a good excuse. Four booster packs, a Pikachu promo, and the oversized card that ends up somewhere near your desk — standard stuff, but still a nice throwback if you missed it the first time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

In this eerie title, players will build their mansion, lure unsuspecting humans into it, and terrify them into madness, or kill them, using a variety of haunting cards.</p><p>Set in America in the 1970s, players embody a forsaken 1920s art deco mansion, once grand but now steeped in bitterness and malice after decades of abandonment. Over time, the house’s simmering hatred for humanity has manifested as a living, pulsating stone heart at its core. Fueled by this dark power, the house now lures unsuspecting humans into its twisted halls, feeding on their fear—and their very bodies—to satiate its hunger and grow ever more powerful.</p><p>In <em>Deck of Haunts</em>, players strategically construct their haunted house by day, setting deadly traps to protect their Heart room, the core of their supernatural power. By night, they must use a deck of terrifying cards to unleash spirits and <a title="Genres > Horror [594 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s that gradually drive unassuming explorers insane, or kill them.

                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, saying Nintendo is "losing their identity" with the console due to its lack of new and exciting features. Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWTzHlC_vrE&amp;ab_channel=EasyAllies">Easy Allies podcast</a>, Yoshida said, "I have to be polite," adding, "To me it was a bit [of a] mixed message from Nintendo. In a sense I think Nintendo is losing their identity, in my opinion."</p><p>Yoshida, in his decades of experience working in the video game industry, said he observed over the years that Nintendo always stood out by creating some kind of "new experience" that no one saw coming.</p><p>"But Switch 2, as we all anticipated, is a better Switch, right? It's a larger screen, more powerful processor, higher resolution, 4K 120fps. They even had their hardware person starting the stream as other platforms do," he said. "And because it's a better Switch, the core premise of the whole Switch 2 is, 'We made things better.' And that's something other companies have been doing all the time."</p><p>Yoshida did, however, praise Nintendo for the Switch 2's new mouse controls, saying the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag X Drive</a> game is "very Nintendo." But overall, Yoshida said he was "a bit disappointed" with the Switch 2 and the response from fans. People were not generally disappointed, Yoshida observed, and this suggests that all people really wanted was a "better Switch."</p><p>The Switch is the No. 2 best-selling console ever, with more than 150 million units sold. </p><p>When the Switch 2 was unveiled in January, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">Yoshida said he was surprised by the console's lack of surprises</a>, so hearing him double down on that line of thinking makes sense.</p><p>For what it's worth, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-what-the-switch-2-could-have-been-called/1100-6530565/" data-ref-id="1100-6530565">maintained from the onset</a> that the Switch 2 is "a new system with improved performance." The company said the aim is that it becomes "the new standard for Nintendo Switch," which is why the company named it Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>The Switch 2's development director, Takuhiro Dohta, went on to say that the Switch 2 is not aimed at people who prefer "high-performance hardware," but instead its ambition is to be a product that can appeal to the widest possible audience. "So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system," Dohta said.</p><p>Another Switch 2 designer, Tetsuya Sasaki, said the name "Switch 2" is "simple and easy to understand." Sasaki added that it was always the plan for the system to be a "proper successor to Switch," so keeping the same name made sense.</p><p>Yoshida left PlayStation in early 2025 after 30 years with the company. Since leaving Sony he's been very outspoken in interviews, freely speaking his mind on a range of topics.</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5. Nintendo announced a $450 price point for the console, but some fear Nintendo may <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">raise the price due to Trump's tariffs</a>. Other experts believe <a href="https://nikopartners.com/nikos-opinion-on-tariffs-video-games-and-us-china-trade/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo will not.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-leak-new-images-deluxe-edition-upgrades-remastered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Minutes ago, images were uploaded and circulated on social media showcasing alleged shots of Oblivion ‘Remastered’ – <strong>not </strong>Oblivion ‘Remake’. In the images, we see side-by-side comparisons, which help to uncover how much of an evolution the game will be. The details that have appeared online also suggest a Deluxe Edition is on the way.</p>



<p>The game is still expected to be shadowdropped by Bethesda and Virtuous next week, after April 21. That claim was recently backed up by Jeff Grubb, who has reportedly heard from separate sources that we’re just days away from the Oblivion Remastered release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-oblivion-remastered-not-remade">Oblivion Remastered, Not Remade</h2>



<p>In images that surfaced <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/#post-138553332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first on Resetera</a>, eagle-eyed gamers got a first glimpse at Oblivion Remastered. They were taken from a Virtuous website, which also let slip that the project has been in development as a collaboration between Virtuous and both Bethesda Dallas and Bethesda Rockville.</p>



<p>The site further noted that Oblivion Remastered will be released on PC, Xbox, <strong>and </strong>PlayStation 5. The latter platform was never part of the rumours, and it was believed that it would be coming <strong>only </strong>to Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>A further leak revealed cover art and an advertisement for the Deluxe Edition of Oblivion Remastered. In this special edition, players can get access to extra items, such as horse armour and exclusive weapons.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered images were just found in the Virtuous website files!</span></p></article></div>







<p>More images were later revealed on social media:</p>











<p>For several weeks, rumours have been circulating regarding the release of Oblivion Remastered, which has long been thought of as an Oblivion remake. These are the first images we’ve seen of the project, which should be in our hands or on our consoles within a week.</p>



<p>What do you think about Oblivion Remastered? Let me know in the comments if you’re going to pick a copy up.</p>

<p>A Schedule 1 player has discovered a new property in the game, and it seems like the perfect place for players to show off their wealth.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/schedule-1-new-property-discovered-for-future-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, a Schedule 1 player has discovered a brand new property within the game called The Manor. The upcoming property could be the biggest yet, sporting four bedrooms on the first floor and two large reception rooms on the ground floor. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jvy0d1/the_manor_will_be_purchasable_for_50000_in_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post</a> also features a glitched image showing the price of The Manor, which is set at $50,000; however, this could change when it is released for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-could-be-getting-the-ultimate-flex-property">Schedule 1 Could be Getting the ‘Ultimate Flex’ Property</h2>



<p>The Manor seems like the ultimate flex purchase for Schedule 1, perfect for letting the people know that your drug dealing escapades have led you to the creme de la creme of society, and you are finally earning the big bucks. The price of the Manor is the same as the game’s current most expensive property, The Warehouse. Many players are hoping that this property’s price will increase to at least $100,000 when it arrives, which will make it more of a challenge.</p>



<p>Schedule 1’s The Manor property is also the most scenic property in the game right now. It is essentially a large mansion built on top of a hill. It looks over one of the game’s regions and has forest cover. It is an excellent location for the players to relax while their drug-dealing operation runs rampant across different regions. However, players should know that the developer hasn’t officially confirmed the new property.</p>

Both games share similar elements, being live-service sci-fi shooters with a colorful art direction, but one former Concord developer wants people to not only give Bungie's project a chance when it launches later this year, but to also show some compassion for the people working on it.</p><p>"After reading the comments about Marathon being Concord 2.0 on Reddit, YouTube, and Twitch, I just wanted to share a little insight into what a 40-year-old man is feeling after dedicating a large portion of his life to making videogames," former Firewalk Studios senior VFX artist Stephan Williams wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jyr8dm/former_firewalkconcord_dev_talks_marathon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marathon subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/marathon-concord-comparisons-ex-firewalk-dev-weighs-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VG247</a>). "Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream gave me hope and excitement for what is to come for Marathon," Williams added. "I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed. It takes a lot of courage."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Williams explained that while Concord "failed to inspire players," there were lessons to be learned from that "gut-wrenching" failure. Now a senior VFX artist at Warframe studio Digital Extremes, Williams stressed that video games are meant to be fun and that people need to be kinder to the developers working on them behind the scenes.</p><p>After its big livestream, Bungie revealed quite a few details on Marathon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">from its September 23 release date</a> to a closer look at the maps players will battle each other on as they hunt down some loot. The big question surrounding the game for now is its price, as while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/">Bungie says that Marathon won't be a full-priced game</a>, it is promising a "premium" experience.

            <p>
Our first look at the long-awaited remake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion comes from a leak of screenshots and details taken from developer Virtuos' website.
</p>
<p>
A remake or remaster of Bethesda's beloved Oblivion has been expected for years, and has been the subject of numerous industry whisperings in recent weeks. Eurogamer understands Bethesda's current plan is to shadow drop the game next week on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, including via Xbox Game Pass.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of then, fans on reddit have been poking around Virtuos' website and discovered a number of images that look set to be used imminently, upon the game's announcement. These include screenshots of the game, and comparison images showcasing this new version of Oblivion versus Bethesda's original from 2006. 
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="631"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/">Oblivion images on Virtuos website</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Taurnil/">u/Taurnil</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/">oblivion</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Eurogamer has corroborated that these files - and there are more here <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">collected on imgur</a> - are currently being hosted on Virtuos' servers (for now). We've also contacted Bethesda for comment.</p>
<p>Word of an Oblivion remake or remaster first popped up back in 2020, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-bethesda-roadmap-reveals-unannounced-releases-including-dishonored-3">references to the project in a leaked internal Microsoft document</a>. A further leak in 2023, from a former employee of Virtuos, confirmed the game was in development at the studio as a full remake, and was being built using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2025, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-reportedly-set-for-imminent-reveal">the leaks have come thick and fast</a>, with an imminent reveal expected. Whispers began gathering pack back in January, however, when a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-surface-as-leaker-suggests-its-coming-in-june">Virtuos employee updated their LinkedIn profile to mention a not-so-mysterious "unannounced Unreal Engine 5 remake"</a>, with newly reworked stamina, sneaking, blocking, archery and hit reaction systems, as well as a fresh HUD.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Eurogamer's Jim Trinca called on Bethesda to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">"remake Morrowind, not Oblivion, you cowards"</a>. I fear that ship has now sailed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-running Metal Gear in Concert series will finally get a UK premiere on 1st November 2025, at London's Royal Albert Hall.
</p>
<p>
Metal Gear Solid voice talent Stefanie Joosten (Quiet) and Donna Burke (iDroid) will make special guest appearances, while the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra performs excerpts from the series' soundtrack and "iconic songs".
</p>
<p>
If you're a fan of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s stealth action series, you'll be able to listen to tracks such as Encounter and Father and Son, plus songs such as The Best is Yet to Come, Snake Eater and Heavens Divide.
</p>
<p>
For a taster, here's Burke belting out Sins of the Father from the 2020 Metal Gear in Concert performance held in Tokyo. It's stirring stuff.

<p>
Metal Gear in Concert began in Osaka in 2017, and has since been performed most years in Japan. Subsequent performances have been toured internationally to Paris, New York and Los Angeles - but never to the UK, until this year.
</p>
<p>
Tempted? Tickets for the event's matinee (at 2.30pm) and evening (at 7.30pm) performances on 1st November will go on general sale at 10am this Thursday, 17th April via the <a href="https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/events/2025/metal-gear-in-concert">Royal Albert Hall ticket site</a>. 
</p>
<p>Kojima may have now left the Metal Gear series behind, but he is making a return to its genre for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-making-new-metal-gear-solid-style-game-and-movie-for-playstation">the mysterious upcoming Physint, a fresh action-espionage game and movie</a> set to arrive at some point for PlayStation 5, following the upcoming launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's available to check out over on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/UbiChroma" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Github</a>.</p><p>In the announcement, Ubisoft explained that there are an estimated 300 million people across the globe who are impacted by colorblindness. Chroma's purpose is to simulate the three major colorblindness types: Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia.</p><p>Ubisoft also said that its quality-control team in India started developing Chroma in 2021.

Chroma utilizes the Color Oracle algorithm and is compatible with single and dual screens. It also works with hotkeys and has a customizable overlay.</p><p>"Chroma is a testament to the team's innovation and dedication; their work is already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind," said Ubisoft QC product manager Jawad Shakil. "Open-sourcing Chroma is a proud step forward, allowing everyone to benefit from this innovation."</p><p>Ubisoft isn't the only large developer aiming to make accessibility available to the general public. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-just-made-two-accessibility-patents-open-source/1100-6528289/" data-ref-id="1100-6528289">Electronic Arts made two of its patents open-source</a>. One of them was a speech-based patent that made it easier for players' speech to be recognized and reflected in-game. The other was an Unreal Engine 5 plugin called IRIS, which automatically alerts developers to moments in their games that could cause seizures in players with photosensitive epilepsy.</p>

For years now I have watched Haenir's putrid action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blight-survival">Blight: Survival</a> like a miasmatic knight errant squinting through the bushes at a peasant-shaped mushroom. I reached out to the devs for an interview a while ago, and received no reply. I wasn't hugely surprised by their silence: Blight began life as a two-person project, and is a long way from release. Still, there's been some ominous movement of late: the developers have unveiled a new biome and enemies, and are now fielding applications for very limited closed playtesting.

In Blight: Survival, you and up to three chums roam a squelching hinterland between two warring kingdoms. The conflict has bred a noxious brainrot that has reduced the resident villagers to sporing undead. There are also enemy soldiers to worry about, busily farming the wreckage. You're a graverobber yourself, siphoning gear from the battlefield by means of "mechanics inspired from rogue-lites and extraction games". Your higher goal is to reach and obliterate the source of the Blight. I'd have thought persuading the opposing kingdoms to stop spilling blood everywhere would have been the place to start, but this is a video game.

I will not say that Blight looks like High Art. I will not say that it courts thematic complexity. It is about hiking through the flyblown boondocks, murdering reanimated shepherds with a longsword. I don't get the sense that any particular commentary on any particular war is being offered. Still, within its stinking parameters, it ticks a number of boxes for me. Firstly, "directional combat", with players angling their sword to swing or parry. Directional combat is often horribly implemented, or treated as a source of comedy, but it worked in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a> and it mostly works in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and I'm always drawn to the concept, because I like to feel like I'm literally hefting a sharpened metal stick. To get a sense of it, check out the reveal trailer from 2022.

Secondly, Blight has some appreciably nasty swamp environments, full of chopped chapels and gibbet trees. It makes me think of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-innocence">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a>, but there's some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> here and probably some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as well. I enjoy when games commit to being a swamp level, inasmuch as this is purposefully and viciously alienating a section of your audience in advance. I'm hoping the landscapes will be as enveloping as they seem, with plenty of opportunities to get lost. "Will you go back and secure your spoils or risk it all and push forward?" offers the Steam page. "How far are you willing to go?" That very much depends on whether I've got dinner on, Haenir. When I'm playing an extraction-style game the critical factor is whether the average round lasts longer than it would take a pot of pasta to cook.
</p>
<p>
Haenir's puny ranks have recently been swollen by "several dozen full-time developers" from publisher Behaviour Interactive, including "level designers, narrative writers, programmers, UI/UX devs, concept and VFX artists, animators, sound designers, QA testers, directors, producers, and more". I'm a bit leery of Behaviour, given the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">recent mass layoffs and closures</a>, but Blight's sweaty skirmishing feels like a decent fit for the creators of Dead by Daylight. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1774880/view/545603039390598280?l=english">Read more in the latest Steam blog post, including details about the forthcoming playtests</a>. Release date as yet the game hath none.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">Horror</a> is escaping a melted flesh abomination, but to pull off true terror, you need to have a gleefully murderous human get right up in my face and grin about whatever nasty human stuff they're planning to get up to. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/agni-village-of-calamity">Agni: Village Of Calamity</a>, an Indonesian survival horror that looks interesting for its early Resident Evil influences, but has gotten stuck in my head for specifically evoking Resident Evil 7's intimate human threat. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>It's that claustrophobic camera work that's drawn me in. I have to admit I've become so spoiled by indie survival horror of late that I've grown slightly numb to the sort of things that used to excite me. Fixed camera angles. Limited inventory space. I blame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/signalis">Signalis</a> for being so excellent. But Agni feels deliberate, rather than overly reverent to its influences.</p>
<p>Agni is your character. She's an Indonesian cop who's gone rogue to explore a remote village. Not a remote village, Agni! That's where the bad things happen. I'm especially fond of how the setting allows for more lush and distinct greenery than you might expect from this genre. Not enough vibrant fronds in survival horror, as a rule.</p>
<p>"Throughout the journey, Agni grapples with guilt, fear of abandonment, and unresolved trauma from her past," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151360/Agni_Village_of_Calamity/">Steam</a>, leaning into Silent Hill-isms. "Her perilous journey tests her resolve as she confronts her inner demons while striving to find out what happened and find her missing partner".</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://youtu.be/DYPsXgQHsGk">13 minute gameplay video</a> available besides the trailer. Agni explores an abandoned house with her trusty lighter, strolls past some mannequins (pointing out the tired trope herself, which doesn't absolve you, game), and eventually has to run as they come to life. Again, it's the focus on Agni's own reactions during cinematics that I feel is the strongest part here, lending everything an off-kilter indie cinema slant I'm very drawn to.</p>
<p>Things get progressively strange, but I'll leave that for you to discover on your own. No release date on this one just yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-a-minecraft-movie-getting-a-sequel-will-there-be-a-minecraft-2-movie-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Barely two weeks after A Minecraft Movie was released, a sequel was demanded by the rabid fanbase. It honors the franchise and brings Minecraft to life in ways never thought possible, and if a sequel does happen, you’d have to think it would be as big a smash hit.</p>



<p>Jack Black, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jason-momoa-promotes-minecraft-movie-by-saying-he-doesnt-let-his-kids-play-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Momoa</a>, and co. had the difficult task of bringing to life one of the most successful franchises of all time. Minecraft has earned billions from game sales, merchandise, and much more. But A Minecraft Movie is a different beast. It hasn’t disappointed moviegoers who helped the movie earn over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-301-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$300 million in its first weekend</a>.</p>



<p>Its success has grown daily, fueling speculation of a successor. We’ve got the latest on a new movie, and whether this is becoming a fully fledged film franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-status-explained">Will There Be A Minecraft Movie 2? Sequel Status Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I feel for you, buddy. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to an interview, plans for A Minecraft Movie sequel are “imminent.”</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/warner-bros-mike-de-luca-pam-abdy-courage-in-face-of-brutal-press-coverage-1236366618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> interviewed Mike De Luca and Pam Abdy from Warner Bros. about the future of A Minecraft Movie and the potential for a sequel. When queried about the plans for a Minecraft sequel, De Luca had this to say: <strong>“Imminently. The ink might not be dry on the deals yet, but imminently.”</strong></p>



<p>This comes days after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-sequel-already-being-discussed-says-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">film’s director, Jared Hess, said</a>: “He would have a blast doing the sequel.” He said there were many ideas and concepts they couldn’t fit into this film, so it makes for a sequel to follow and to include a lot more of the source material that didn’t make the cut the first time around.</p>



<p>An imminent sequel is hardly a surprise given the overwhelming success of A Minecraft Movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-a-minecraft-movie-2-sequel-be-about">What Could A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel be About?</h2>



<p><strong>There are still many new characters, enemies, and ideas that could be introduced in A Minecraft Movie 2 Sequel, but the end of the original film gives away some big details.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Spoiler Alert—I’m about to briefly discuss what happens after the credits roll in A Minecraft Movie. You have been warned.</strong></p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-minecraft-movie-runtime-explained-does-it-have-a-post-credits-scene/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-credits cutscene to prolong its runtime</a>. In it, Steve turns up at a house with the hope of going into the attic. We find out the house belongs to a person named Alex—who Minecraft fans will instantly recognize.</p>



<p>We don’t know if this is a mini one-off for Alex or if they could feature heavily in a sequel. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

<p>We hope you’re enjoying A Minecraft Movie, and listening to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disclaimer about not throwing popcorn</a>.

            <p>Remember <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a>, Ubisoft's beleaguered pirate adventure? Having been announced in 2017, the game finally released in February of last year after numerous delays and setbacks. However, Skull and Bones failed to make positive waves on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">players calling out the underwhelming gameplay and poorly designed end game</a>, among other gripes.</p>
<p>Since its release, Skull and Bones has pretty much fallen off the radar, to be honest. At the time of writing, the game currently boasts <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/">221 players on Steam</a>, and while that is obviously not a complete overview (the game released on other platforms, as well) it still isn't an especially auspicious number .</p>
<p>But despite all this, Ubisoft is still updating Skull and Bones (perhaps tinkering away with the engine and such while it gets ready for the yet-to-be-announced, but much desired and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">heavily rumoured piratical remake of Assassin's Creed Black Flag</a>).</p>

<p>Last night, Skull and Bones' team released patch notes for the first season of the game's second year, known as Ascent into Chaos. This new season kicks off today, 15th April, and includes things like a new ship (a Schooner), a new status effect (Shell-Shocked), new upgrade tree and a new pet in the form of a tiger cub.</p>
<p>Item Ascension will also arrive this season, with the accompanying lore blurb reading:</p>
<p>"The Indian Ocean is set ablaze by the war between the Megacorporations, with each side looking to gain an advantage over the other by using increasingly powerful weapons. The origins of these ascended weapons remain a mystery, but what is known is that acquiring them may be vital to surviving the coming onslaught."</p>
<p>You will need to have made your way up to Infamy Tier 9 at a minimum to be able to make use of Item Ascension. When you reach this, though, you can expect to recieve some mail which will enable you to begin the Ascension and Modification quest. Once you do that, you will then need to pop over to  the Blacksmith to unlock the Item Ascension feature.</p>
<p>There are three modification grades, Ubisoft explains. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic - General improvements</li>
<li>Advanced - Noteworthy improvements</li>
<li>Special - Powerful improvements with unique properties</li>
</ul>
<p>Modification Slots, meanwhile, are assigned based on the weapon rarity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Common - 2 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Uncommon - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced, 1 Special</li>
<li>Rare - 2 Basic, 1 Special</li>
<li>Epic - 1 Basic, 1 Advanced</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find full details in <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/19T7NArKvzO1MofftUXPDi">Ubisoft's Skull and Bones blog post</a>.</p>
<p>In an accompanying Skull and Bones: Year 2 Showcase video, senior community developer Alexis Cretton thanked the game's community, adding Ubisoft was "committed to support Skull and Bones for years ahead".</p>

<p>On its release last year, our Matt complimented Skull and Bones' "beautiful world" and "bombastic ship-to-ship combat". However, he was less enamoured with the game's boring busywork and tedious traversal.</p>
<p>As he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-review">wrote in Eurogamer's two star Skull and Bones review</a>: "No game, let alone a swashbuckling pirate adventure, should be so consistently dull."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>While The Last of Us Part II Remastered doesn't really need ray tracing to look good, features like ray-traced global illumination and ambient occlusion would really bring the game's visuals to the next level, judging from a new video shared online a few hours ago.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by Beyond Dreams, shows the recently released PC version of the game running with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MassiHancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a ray tracing mod</a> powered by the Complete RT shader, the most advanced ray tracing shader available to date, and a custom Reshade preset that introduces improved global illumination, ambient occlusion, color grading, dynamic depth of field, and other enhancements. As highlighted at the beginning of the 8K resolution video below, the differences are massive and significantly enhance the game's visuals in the vast majority of scenarios.</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K] The Last of Us 2 Remastered: RAY TRACING Mod | Complete RT | RTX 5090 | Relaxing Walking &amp; Ride" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YZgjAvsP_UY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered launched on PC earlier this month, featuring the same content seen in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">PlayStation 5 release</a> as well as some additional features like new characters and maps for the No Return roguelike mode, which have also been added to the PlayStation 5 release following the game's PC launch, and support for PC-specific features like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS. You can learn more about the PC port by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-report-no-nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-but-still-smooth/">report.</a></p>
