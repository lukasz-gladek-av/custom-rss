            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-tiny-bookshop-switch-the-epitome-of-cosy-perfect-for-bookworms.1265868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’re a self-proclaimed bookworm like me, then chances are you’ve probably fantasised about packing everything away, moving to a quaint seaside town, and starting up a cute little bookshop (<em>don’t worry, NL, I’m not going anywhere!</em>). Well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, that's exactly the pitch. Developed by neoludic games, this is the epitome of ‘cosy’; a tranquil experience that demands little of you, yet offers oodles of satisfaction as you watch your numbers gradually tick up.</p>
<p>Within the town of Bookstonbury (chortle!), you’re provided with a selection of locations in which to sell your books, including (but not limited to) a beach front, a café, and, depending on the day of the week, a flea market. You’re then tasked with filling your bookshelves with titles, and providing a nice variety is the key to success. I went one step further and put all the kids' books at the bottom, so the little ones can reach them.</p>
<p>You can boost your chances of selling books within a particular genre by decking out your shop with items. A skull will get folks interested in the crime genre, while a typewriter might inspire those more interested in classic fiction. You can go one step further and add signs, plants, tables, or even completely repaint the exterior. One quick note, though: it would be nice if the game added in some touchscreen controls for those portable sessions. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but something for the future, perhaps.</p>
<p>Generally, your days progress automatically, with customers trickling in and cute little speech bubbles popping up to demonstrate their actions within the store. Occasionally, however, someone will ask for help. At this point, you’re given a brief description of what kind of book they’re after, and it’s up to you to scan through your shelves and find the right fit. What’s great is that all of the books are real, so you’ve got your Stephen Kings, your Bill Brysons, your Agatha Christies… As a horror fan, I was delighted to see deep cuts like John Langan’s <strong>The Fisherman</strong> represented (a great Lovecraftian folk tale, by the way).</p>
<p>Sometimes, you simply won’t have anything to satisfy your customers’ needs (this is exacerbated if your other patrons have already stripped your shelves clean), and it can be a little heartbreaking when that happens. Generally, though, each day will complete with just a bit more money in your pocket, and this then allows you to purchase more stock and more trinkets, thus fuelling even more successful ventures later down the road.</p>
<p>Tiny Bookshop is a fun little experience whether you’re into reading or not, but I think it’s clear that those who can’t leave the house without a paperback will get a lot more out of it. I adore the stylised visuals, the catchy, laid-back tunes, and the satisfying loop that each day brings to the table. I often found myself going to put the game down before stopping myself to see what might happen the next day. Kind of like a great book.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a teaser for their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game. While the English-language release is just a few months away, the studio already has plans for the second set, <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release from Riot Games, they provided a few crumbs of information on <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>. This will be the second set released after the <em>Riftbound Origins</em> set, which is scheduled for release in English in October.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-promo-artwork-man-with-deck-of-cards.jpg?itok=ft9WI3hZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-promo-artwork-man-with-deck-of-cards.jpg?itok=LMNUvefx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The press release contained the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Once <em>Riftboundʼs</em> origin story is told, itʼs time to become Spritiforged. This dynamic second set&nbsp;<br>
introduces new champions to the game, like Ezreal, Fiora, Irelia, Lucian, and Rumble. Spiritforged&nbsp;<br>
features 200+ new cards, two new Champion Decks you can pick up and play right out of the box,&nbsp;<br>
and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Riftbound: Spiritforged launches in December 2025 for China and February 2026 in English</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> is Riot's attempt to bring the deep lore and iconic characters from <em>League of Legends</em> into the TCG space. The game aims to bring in both tabletop veterans and new players with a mix of accessible and deep gameplay. A gameplay mix that, according <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to our preview</a>, appears to be on the right track. The game will support 1v1, 2v2, and 4-player free-for-all formats.</p>

<p>The <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> teaser does demonstrate Riot's commitment to supporting their TCG game. It is a space that has been heavily dominated for decades by the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. But more recent competition, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, has shown a place can be made in that space with the right amount of appeal and gameplay polish.</p>

<p>The teaser does invite some questions. The set will feature two premade Champion Decks. Who will be featured in those decks? How will the game's champions be represented in this new TCG format? Only time will tell.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-online-just-won%E2%80%99t-stop-adding-new-players.1265862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The sun just refuses to set on <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-gtav-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-review-impre-1848652706"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>. Even with<em> GTA 6</em> delayed into next year, the current entry’s multiplayer mode is seeing an surprising surge in new and returning players. Rockstar Games’ parent company, Take-Two, just revealed the 12-year-old spin-off is 50 percent more popular than it was last year.</p> <p>“During the quarter, engagement for <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>&nbsp;benefited from the record-setting launch of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> Trailer 2 and the successful release of the ‘<em>Money Fronts</em>‘ Summer content pack, which culminated in higher than expected recurrent consumer spending growth,” the company announced in its quarterly earnings report this week. “We are pleased that new player accounts<em>&nbsp;</em>for&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>grew over 50 percent year-over-year.”</p> <p>Every company that delays one of the most anticipated releases of all-time by more than six months should be so lucky. At this rate, Rockstar could push back the release of <em>GTA 6</em> from May to October 2026 and see <em>GTA Online</em> potentially double in popularity in just two years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-online-future-updates-gta6-take-two-ceo-support-1851763665">merely by dropping new trailers for the sequel</a>.</p>

 <p>I guess all of those people still buying <em>GTA V</em> each month are for real. The game was the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k">ninth best-selling game of the year so far in June</a>. That was up from being the 15th best-selling overall in 2024. Even if that number eventually comes down by the end of 2025, it would still be incredible if<em> GTA V</em> sold&nbsp;<em>just as well</em> as it had the year prior after more than a decade of being out in the wild.</p> <p>No wonder Rockstar has been content to take its time with the sequel while everyone else selling games on consoles battles to convince <em>GTA Online</em> fans to take a chance on buying something new. Shutting <em>GTA Online</em> down for good would be terrible for Take-Two’s shareholders but it <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-selling-games-2024-hogwarts-legacy-dragon-ball-1851746095">might spread the wealth around a bit</a> and give great games from other studios a better shot at getting recognized. Or all of those people would just go play <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Roblox</em> instead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Going up to the great big pasture in the sky.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grass Wonder, one of the real-life racehorses that inspired a character in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, passed away on August 8 at age 30, prompting an outpouring of condolences from fans of Cygames’ anime horse-girl franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stallion Grass Wonder is one of the real-life Japanese racehorses Cygames turned into a character for its Umamusume: Pretty Derby anime and games. As all Umamusume’s characters are anime girls with equine ears and tails, Grass Wonder also got a sex change. In the Umamusume universe, Grass Wonder is a friendly but determined girl who grew up in America but loves Japanese culture, echoing how the real horse was American-bred but trained in Japan. The character’s light brown hair with a white dot at the front mimics the horse’s chestnut coat with a white star marking.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/grass-wonder-1754672021724.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grass Wonder has passed away aged 30. Image credit: Big Red Farm.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The real Grass Wonder is known for winning Arima Kinen, one of Japan’s prestigious Grade 1 races, twice. During his four-year career (1997-2000), he placed first in nine out of 15 races. At the time, Grass Wonder was matched against fellow racehorse Special Week (resulting in a tense <a href="https://youtu.be/cptKFbDoEqY?si=QGM7eJaojt5v7MIG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>photo finish back in 1999</u></a>), and this rivalry is portrayed in the Umamusume: Pretty Derby anime. After retiring from racing in 2000, Grass Wonder went on to sire four champions including Screen Hero and Earnestly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the <a href="https://www.bigredfarm.jp/post/%E3%82%B0%E3%83%A9%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AF%E3%83%B3%E3%83%80%E3%83%BC-%E6%AD%BB%E5%8E%BB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official obituary</u></a> from Big Red Farm, where Grass Wonder lived out his twilight years, the former champion racehorse was in good health until he started to decline yesterday evening. He passed away from age-related multiple organ failure at the age of 30, an impressive age for a racehorse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the news about the real Grass Wonder going to the great big pasture in the sky, Umamusume’s <a href="https://x.com/uma_musu/status/1953773211667009804" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official X account</u></a> posted: “On August 8, we received the news that Grass Wonder, one of the horses that served as inspiration for a character in our franchise, has passed away. We would like to extend our condolences to all related parties, and pray for the repose of this champion horse’s soul.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans also posted messages of condolences, with many hoping that Grass Wonder was now in a place where there are plenty of dandelions (his favorite food). “The last horse from the strongest generation has set off on his final journey… Thank you Grass Wonder,” one commenter <a href="https://x.com/rUdtTauYetz6ouj/status/1953774418229879163" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posted.</u></a> Another <a href="https://x.com/yaya777season2/status/1953792038161272978" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pointed out</u></a> that although they feel sad when the real horse behind a character passes away, the horses will keep on shining forever in the world of Umamusume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By coincidence, Rena Maeda, who voices Grass Wonder in Umamusume: Pretty Derby, posted on X yesterday about her experience visiting the racehorse in real life. She said she intends to go back and see him again, although sadly she won’t get the chance.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>海外のトレーナーさんたちが2018年のこのポストを見つけてくれている！ありがと！</p><p>Trainers from overseas are watching this post!

But don't sleep on this patch's best, most important feature: the ability for your character to lean back against a wall and look brooding or nonchalant, just like you've always wished they could.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, but seriously! WoW's latest patch, 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, adds a brand new emote to the game: /lean. It does exactly what it sounds like. Your character leans back, either relaxing against whatever wall or support is behind them or, if there's nothing, will just sort of lean in mid-air awkwardly. It's a fairly small addition, but players are already having a lot of fun with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mkln6i/rating_each_lean_emote/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One player has shared tier rankings</a> of each race and gender's unique /lean emote, ranging from Blood and Void elves up in S-tier for having perfectly sassy leans, all the way down to D-tier which contains gnome males, draenei females, goblins and dracthyr of both genders, and several more, all of whom apparently have stiff and uninteresting poses. Another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1mj7rz7/lots_of_hold_stuff_in_your_hand_toys_working_with/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discovered that you can hold in-game toys in your hands</a> in ways that play nicely with the /lean emote, giving your character a casual way to check a compass or sip a beer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/08/wowscrnshot-080825-111103-1754669902060.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">WoW's latest patch, 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, adds a brand new emote to the game: /lean.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silly as this is, players are really digging it. It's a fun little bit of flavor, especially for those who use World of Warcraft as a role-play space. I've already run into a bunch of players just casually leaning in capital cities while AFK, and I'm looking forward to using my C-tier tauren female emote in the new raid to lean on the aggressively purple walls while my raid leader explains mechanics for the 17th time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft's latest patch, Ghost of K'aresh, is out now, and the new raid, Manaforge Omega, will open on Tuesday next week. The patch has had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-players-say-newest-patch-has-a-lot-of-weird-bugs-including-one-thats-turning-everyones-banks-german">sliiiightly buggy start</a>, but Blizzard is actively working to clean things up.

Launched to huge fanfare in 2023, Bethesda's big sci-fi hope landed to a mixed reception from players — who have since gone on to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating">complain about the game's disappointing first expansion</a> and lack of substantial ongoing support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, one bright spot on the horizon appears to be signs of Bethesda finally adding the highly-requested ability to travel in your spaceship from one planet to another — rather than what happens now, as you load up a loading screen to enter orbit, and from there load up another loading screen to get to where you're going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fragments of code uncovered by Starfield fans now suggest Bethesda has a more streamlined experience in the works, though potentially still with some caveats. While you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, fans say it looks like you won't be able to fly all the way between systems. Oh, and you also won't be able to fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky. Oh, well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">References to the new offering, referred to in the game's code as "Cruise Mode," were detected by players this week and shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1mii922/new_findings_in_the_last_2_update_suggest_dev/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, though Bethesda has reportedly now issued another small patch to scrub them from view.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">another no-show at June's Xbox Games Showcase</a>, it remains to be seen when Bethesda will get around to mentioning the game again.

Perhaps we'll hear more in a couple of weeks around Gamescom, ahead of the game's two-year anniversary?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion">Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port will now arrive in 2026</a>, following the poor reception to 2024 add-on Shattered Space. Bethesda boss Todd Howard had <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previously talked of expansions arriving annually</a>, but perhaps Bethesda sees the addition of some form of spaceflight as something to keep players occupied until then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-and-valve-will-kill-steam-for-chromebooks-experiment-in-january-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Bad news if you're one of the handful of people using Steam to play games on a Chromebook: Google and Valve are preparing to end support for the still-in-beta ChromeOS version of Steam on January 1, 2026, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/07/steam-chromebook-2026/">according to 9to5Google</a>. Steam can still be installed on Chromebooks, but it now comes with a notice announcing the end of support.</p>
<p>“The Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026," reads the notification. "After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming.”</p>
<p>Steam originally launched on Chromebooks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/steam-on-chromebooks-is-ready-for-testing-comes-with-steep-requirements/">in early 2022</a> as an alpha that ran on just a handful of newer and higher-specced devices with Intel chips inside. A beta version <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/steam-on-chromebooks-enters-beta-adds-amd-support/">arrived later that year</a>, with reduced system requirements and support for AMD CPUs and GPUs. Between then and now, neither Google nor Valve had said much about it.</p>
<p>The Steam beta was one component of a "gaming Chromebook" push that Google made in 2022 and 2023. It saw the release of laptops with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/stadias-dead-but-new-chromebooks-keep-googles-cloud-gaming-dreams-alive/">better hardware and high-refresh-rate screens</a> and optimized versions of GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Google had reportedly been working to add Steam support to ChromeOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/01/report-google-wants-to-bring-the-steam-game-store-to-chrome-os/">since at least 2020</a>.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> beta has officially begun, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-is-off-to-a-very-hot-start-amid-some-server-hiccups/1100-6533756/" data-ref-id="1100-6533756">already surpassed Battlefield 2042's peak player count</a> on Steam. Hundreds of thousands of players have jumped in, which has led to some massive queue times, but not everyone of these players is a Battlefield veteran. The beta is full of players who are simply looking for a new first-person shooter or dipping their toes into Battlefield to see if they like the experience or not.</p><p>If you're one of those new players or a player returning to the franchise after a long hiatus, you might be confused about the different game modes available in Battlefield 6. There are four game mode options, but the game doesn't explain them too well in the menus. To find out more about the Battlefield 6 game modes and see which one might suit your playstyle the best, check out the guide below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_every_game_mode_in_Battlefield_6_works">How every game mode in Battlefield 6 works</a><ul><li><a href="#Conquest">Conquest</a></li><li><a href="#Closed_Weapon_Conquest">Closed Weapon Conquest</a></li><li><a href="#Breakthrough">Breakthrough</a></li><li><a href="#Domination">Domination</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_every_game_mode_in_Battlefield_6_works">How every game mode in Battlefield 6 works</h2><p>During the open beta in Battlefield 6, there are four game modes you can choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Conquest</strong></li><li><strong>Closed Weapon Conquest</strong></li><li><strong>Breakthrough</strong></li><li><strong>Domination </strong></li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545959-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.25.44.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545959-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.25.44.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545959"></a><figcaption>The four game modes in the Battlefield 6 beta</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545959-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.25.44.38.png"></figure><p>More game modes will arrive at the full launch, but this is what you can play during the open beta. While you can hop into each one and see how the game mode works for yourself first-hand, it's always better to have a little bit of knowledge beforehand.</p><p>Below, we'll summarize each game mode, including its goal, how to win, and the playstyles it caters to.</p><h3 id="Conquest">Conquest</h3><p>Conquest is the bread-and-butter game mode of the Battlefield franchise. It's what the franchise has become known for over the years, and it works very similarly to how it has in the past in Battlefield 6.</p><p>The mode sees two teams, each of which can be made up of as many as 32 players, spawn on opposite ends of a large-scale map. Starting at each team's base are a variety of vehicles, including tanks, helicopters, off-road SUVs, and more. The vehicles available are dependent on the map you're playing. In addition to the vehicles, six flags are spread out across the map, labeled A through F. Each team will begin near either the A or F flag, and the flags need to be captured by standing in their zones, which are indicated by lines on the ground.</p><p>The overall goal of Conquest is to capture as many flags as possible and eliminate enemies as they try to take your team's flags or defend their own. Points are earned by capturing more flags and keeping them under your team's control for longer periods of time. You can capture an enemy team's flag by standing on its zone for roughly one to two minutes, but the enemy team can also do the same to your flags.</p><p>As the match proceeds, you'll see the score bar at the top of your screen fluctuate. Each team starts with 1,000 points, and those points get depleted the less flag control you have. Eventually, a team will reach zero points, and the first team to do that has lost the match. So, in a nutshell, Conquest is about holding flags for longer so you can deplete the other team's points.</p><p>When you die in Conquest, you have to wait for a few seconds to respawn. Your spawn point can be on one of your squad's locations or at one of your team's active flags. Every person is grouped into a squad of four, and coordination with your squad is key so you know where to push on the map.</p><p>A Conquest match can take anywhere from 20-30 minutes in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Closed_Weapon_Conquest">Closed Weapon Conquest</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545961"></a><figcaption>Closed Weapon Conquest forces you to use only weapons from your class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png"></figure><p>This game mode is exactly like the base Conquest mode, but every player is locked to the weapon of their chosen class. So, for example, if you choose the Assault class, you can only use an assault rifle, as that's the signature weapon of that class. If you go with the Engineer class, you're locked to SMGs, Support is locked to LMGs, and Recon is locked to snipers.</p><p>Of course, you're also able to pull out your secondary weapons and gadgets as well. This means Assault class players can pick between their rifle, pistol, and two gadget weapons that can be a shotgun, DMR, carbine, or explosive sidearm.</p><p>The point of Closed Weapon Conquest is for players to use their class the way it was intended in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Breakthrough">Breakthrough</h3><p>Breakthrough is another classic Battlefield game mode, and matches in this mode can take the longest out of any other. It also takes place on large-scale maps with teams of 30+ players. However, Breakthrough assigns teams one of two roles: Attackers or Defenders.</p><p>The team of Attackers' job is to push their forces forward on the map, capturing objectives along the way and continually pushing the enemy team back. The Attackers succeed if they push all the way up the map, reaching the enemy's team base within a certain timeframe.</p><p>Speaking of the enemy team, that's where the Defenders come in. The Defenders' sole goal is to stop the Attackers from pushing up on the map and capturing objectives. Defenders often hold specific positions that make it difficult for the Attackers to get around them and push up the map. However, if Defenders aren't coordinated, Attackers can bust through their defenses and make it very tough to stop them as they keep moving forward.</p><p>Breakthrough matches can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to complete in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Domination">Domination</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545964" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545964"></a><figcaption>Fighting over the B flag in Domination is crucial</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png"></figure><p>Last up, we have Domination. If you're coming from Call of Duty, then this is the exact same game mode you know and love. It's also very similar to Strongholds from Halo, but the scoring works slightly differently.</p><p>In Domination, you're playing a scaled-down version of Conquest. The maps take place in the same locations, but the playable areas are cut off due to only three flags being available to capture (A, B, C). Teams spawn in on either A or C and must fight over the B flag while also trying to capture the enemy's spawn flag and defend their own.</p><p>Two teams, which are made up of eight players each, start at zero points in Domination and must try to earn 200 to be declared the winner. Teams score by owning at least one flag, but you score more points the more flags you have. So, if a team has two flags, they'll score points at a faster rate compared to the team that just has one flag. If you don't own any flags, you don't score at all.</p><p>Spawning is immediate in Domination, and you don't get to choose where you spawn, like in Conquest. This makes matches a little more chaotic, and they tend to finish much quicker than any other game mode. Domination is perfect for players who seek quicker action and fewer players to deal with on the map. The mode also doesn't feature any vehicles.</p><p>And that does it for all of the current game modes in Battlefield 6. As we said before, more are coming with the full launch in October, so we'll update this guide with those modes when they are released.

<p>Mike Bithell came to prominence with Thomas Was Alone, a narrative-driven abstract puzzle-platformer. After forming Bithell Games, the studio gained a strong reputation for well-received releases such as the 2015 stealth game <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/volume/b/pc/archive/2015/08/17/volume-review-game-informer.aspx">Volume</a> and the acclaimed 2017 text-based adventure titles Subsurface Circular. The last few years have seen it delve into making inventive and stylish takes on licensed properties, such as the strategy title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/john-wick-hex/john-wick-hex-review-a-slow-motion-ballet-of-blood">John Wick Hex</a> (which was delisted last month), the visual novel puzzle title <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/tron-identity/grid-based-decision-making">Tron: Identity</a>, and 2025’s Tron: Catalyst, a top-down action game.

Bithell Games, the studio behind the acclaimed likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thomas-was-alone">Thomas Was Alone</a>, John Wick Hex, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a>, has announced job cuts impacting the "majority" of its full-time employees.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">statement announcing the news</a> on social media, studio founder Mike Bithell explained he company has been unable to secure a new larger scale project, meaning eleven jobs are now being made redundant. "This," he noted, "constitutes the majority of our full-time staff".
</p>
<p>
"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025," Bithell wrote. "We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance pay."
</p>
<p>
"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."
</p>
<p>
Bithell concluded by noting the news will not affect the availability of the studio's existing self-published games, nor will it impact any ongoing support for those titles. "We are incredibly grateful for our audience," he added, "and hope that you're interest in our work follows individual team members as they head into other roles."
</p>
<p>
"Bethel Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."
</p>
<p>
Layoffs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">continue to blight the games industry</a>, with <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">tens of thousands of workers</a> - across both major publishers and smaller studios - having lost their jobs in the last few years. In July alone, Microsoft laid off more than 9,000 employees, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">significantly impacting staff and studios across its Xbox division</a>, and that was followed by job cuts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-goes-independent-to-continue-focus-on-original-projects">Still Wakes the Deep developer The Chinese Room</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/supermassive-games-delays-sci-fi-horror-directive-8020-following-layoffs">The Dark Pictures Anthology studio Supermassive Games</a>.

According to Leadbetter, Digital Foundry was established in 2015 with a 50 percent investment from the company Gamer Network, formerly the ultimate parent company of Eurogamer and Gamesindustry.biz.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamer Network was then purchased by event operations company ReedPop (which organizes PAX East, Star Wars Celebration, and other events), and later sold to Ziff Davis. Leadbetter stated that IGN offered to sell back its shares to him—a welcome message given that he'd been looking to buy them back for "many years." The purchase was assisted by investment from Gamer Network founder Rupert Loman.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"All aspects of Digital Foundry going forward are actually decided by us, the team, which is something we've never really managed to have before," said Leadbetter. "The concept of being fully independent is quite staggering when you think about it."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gamesbeat-spins-off-from-venturebeat-to-become-niche-independent-publication-" target="_self" data-discover="true">GamesBeat spins off from VentureBeat to become 'niche independent publication'</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ziff Davis also spent this week laying off workers at IGN, months after buying sites like CNET, Lifehacker, and other outlets. It did so in the same week it reported a 9.8 percent growth in revenue and 17 percent growth in income from operations year-over-year. (Net income did decrease about 30 percent in the same period).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For more information, you can view Digital Foundry's announcement on </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/tl7bIJ2yu4I?si=We0H1E4L61TJMZWY">its YouTube channel.</a></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/let%E2%80%99s-remember-some-good-video-game-boats.1265796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What began as Aftermath’s unofficial Boat Day has evolved into Aftermath’s unofficial Boat Week. With Riley freshly off a boat and me in the general proximity of many, we figured it’s finally time to fulfill one of the site’s original purposes: to serve as a repository for Riley’s countless stories from his various times at sea. Also, secondarily, to talk about video games.</p><p>On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, Riley and I are joined by Chris “Peg Leg” Person to discuss boats, boating, and a flotilla of related matters. First we talk about Riley’s recent voyage, which involved <a href="https://aftermath.site/moby-dick-marathon-mystic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading<em> Moby Dick</em> as quickly as possible while on a boat</a>. Why? Riley enjoys punishing himself, I guess. Then Riley regales us with tales of the time he lived on a boat during his youth, up to and including his convoluted waste disposal process.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to a boat-related news item at the opposite end of the wealth spectrum: Gabe Newell, billionaire co-founder of Valve, recently <a href="https://aftermath.site/gabe-newell-oceano-yacht-steam-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased a yacht company</a>. Why are rich people so obsessed with big boats? Listen to find out. Lastly, we list the best boats in video games, including the GOAT boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy a boat and go bow-to-bow with Gabe Newell’s yacht armada – or at least start a band and call it Gabe Newell’s Yacht Armada.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Riley, given that you’ve lived on a boat and you have this fascination with them, do you generally enjoy boats in games, or are you kinda whatever about them?</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I’m trying to think of games with good boats. I was actually just thinking about the game <em>Dredge</em>, which I bought forever ago and haven’t played. I should finally play that game.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong><em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em> is a pretty good one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Oh yeah, I met the kid at Mystic Seaport who performs sea shanties and gives little presentations – “songs of land and sea” – and I was talking to them, and I asked them “Oh my gosh, did the sea shanty trend reinvent your career?” And they were like “No! But thanks to the soundtrack of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, little kids are always asking me to play these incredibly obscure songs, and I’m like ‘How on Earth do you know about this deep cut sea shanty?’”&nbsp;</p><p>Then this other kid there who also did sea shanties started praising and praising the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> soundtracks, and then I told them I was a games journalist, and they were like “Oh wow.” I was telling them about the whole <a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-ceo-charlie-guillemot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft split up</a> thing, and they were like “That sucks.” But anyway yeah, apparently <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is reinventing interest in sea shanties. Screw you, TikTok.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Alright so, other good video game boats. I put together a list. I’m gonna just take it from the top: The boat in <em>Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em>. Do we think it’s a good boat or a bad boat, because obviously it’s also a character. But as a boat, as a craft, what do we think?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s pretty agile given its circumstances. The problem with that isn’t the boat; the problem is that the Triforce quest near the end sucks, if I remember correctly. It’s not that the traversal was bad.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think also that for all the openness <em>Wind Waker</em> brought to the table relative to other games at the time, the exploration was underdeveloped.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, it was pretty sparse.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think the promise of that game was greater than what it delivered, at least in the sailing and exploring department. Still a great game!</p><p>Next boat: <em>Sid Meier’s Pirates</em>. Probably my favorite boat-based game. I love <em>Sid Meier’s Pirates</em>.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> My sister and I had a pirate game as kids that I keep trying to hunt down, and I’m 90 percent sure that’s the one it was. But you know when you’re trying to find a game from your childhood and you just type words to look at pictures, and you’re like “At some point this picture will emotionally resonate with me, and I’ll be like ‘That was the game’?”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> When I was looking up games for this list, I scrolled past some screenshots of <em>Pirates</em>, and it had that effect that some older games have on you where you’re like “Man, my brain up-rezzed that game so much.” Now I see actual screenshots, and it looks… not bad, but very quaint. The boats are far less realistic-looking than I remember them being.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong><em>Sea Of Thieves</em> is probably the best boat game, generally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, that seems to be the consensus pick.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> For as cartoonish as it is, people are like “Yeah, but it does feel like you’re on a boat.” The boat stuff is really good, and it does have those moments of panic where you have the bucket, you’re shit’s sinking, and you have to plug it up. That always feels very nice.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s also about the boat a lot of the time. It’s about sailing, which a lot of these games aren’t – or they partially are, but they don’t consider the boat to be a physical object or space. They think of it as a vehicle, as opposed to a thing with its own needs and its own unique characteristics. That makes <em>Sea Of Thieves</em> really cool.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> And people will fuck up your boat. They aggressively love fucking up your boat.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong><em>Sea Of Thieves</em> I think is one of those games that’s become sort of a fixture, albeit in its own niche, and as a result does not get the credit it deserves – especially because it came out in a way where it wasn’t fully baked yet. It was a little bit sparse as a game. It didn’t review super well. But it has been improved tremendously over the years and still has an active community. It’s a really cool thing.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/digital-foundry-ign-ziff-davis-eurogamer-patreon"><h3>Good For Digital Foundry</h3></a><p>'We answer to nobody but you, the audience'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/pc-desk-floor"><h3>Wait, Are We Not All Keeping Our PCs On Top Of Our Desks</h3></a><p>Why would you put one of the most expensive things you own on the floor where your feet go</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

              <p>Big news, everyone! Capcom has heard all your pleading and begging and has finally announced a brand new <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060"><em>Dino Crisis</em></a>…merchandise lottery event. Wait, is that not what all you fans have been clamoring for over the last 20 years? Oh…well, uh, this is almost as good as a new game, right?</p> <p>On August 8, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-official-dino-crisis-merchandises-revealed-by-capcom-japan.1265337/">as first spotted by ResetEra users</a>, Capcom announced a new merch event themed around its classic survival horror series, <em>Dino Crisis.</em> The event runs from now until September 12 and features a variety of <a href="https://capcom-capkujionline.com/lp/DINO_CRISIS/">new <em>Dino Crisis</em> merchandise</a>, including desk mats, sweaters, keychains, and stickers. You can’t just buy this stuff directly, though. Instead, Capcom is operating this merch event like a raffle or lottery. Each <em>Dino Crisis</em> item in the event has a rarity scale. For example, the sweater has a 1-in-100 chance of shipping. You can purchase one or more “tickets” for 880 Yen (about $6 USD) and then Capcom ships out however many items you ordered, and you hope you got lucky enough to get some of the rarer ones, like the desk mat, which has a 3-in-100 chance of arriving at your doorstep.</p> <figure><figcaption>Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p>This new merch sale is the latest example of Capcom remembering <em>Dino Crisis,</em> but not actually announcing a new game or even teasing a hypothetical remake or fancy remaster. In 2024, <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-survey-dino-crisis-sequel-remake-onimusha-okami-1851235768">Capcom asked fans what dormant franchises they would like revived</a>. One of the options was <em>Dino Crisis</em>, and the internet screamed loudly, “That one please!” That same year, <em>Dino Crisis</em> arrived on GOG with a few appreciated improvements. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-siren-ps2-horror-ps-plus-games-october-2024-1851669030">It was also released on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4</a> as part of Sony’s PS Plus Premium retro library, complete with new trophies. And now we have this new merch sale.</p> <p>So it’s clear Capcom remembers that it owns<em> Dino Crisis.</em> That’s an important first step toward getting a new game or sequel. Of course, when or if that will ever happen remains to be seen. But at least you can (sort of) buy a cool <em>Dino Crisis</em> sweater right now? That’s neat.</p>

            <p>If I went to hell, I can't imagine the first thing on my mind would be trying to pull off a bank job with a crew of fellow damned souls. However, in freshly announced tactical RPG Thousand Hells: The Underworld Heists, that's the sort thing you'll be doing, with plenty of choice and consequence if things go pear-shaped.</p>
<p>Thousand Hells is the latest cool thing from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/six-ages">Six Ages</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-of-dragon-pass">King of Dragon Pass</a> devs A Sharp. While they're working with Kitfox Games as publisher again, there's plenty of different stuff going on, including a move away from world of Glorantha as a setting. That's in favour of fantasy pastures new, inspired by myths of the ancient proto-Indo-European, Norse, and Mesopotamian varieties. Oh, and a dash of Hieronymus Bosch's lovely paintings.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I’d like to push procedural storytelling in a new direction, both in how the quests are generated and with the narrative game that lets you use your team’s traits to resolve situations by making story choices, not just dice rolls," A Sharp founder David Dunham said of the game. "And it’s fun to see the system that Robin Laws and I designed put to use by other writers."</p>
<p>Thousand Hells revolves around four heroes making the toasty jaunt to hell, each of these folks being "procedurally generated with fears, desires and personalities". Once there, your job is to pull together a team with different skills and a set of temperaments that won't result in blowups midway through the "trials of the underworlds" you'll be trying to overcome. There's a "mysterious ambassador" you're contracted to do it all for, which doesn't sound ominous whatsoever.</p>

<p>The stakes, if it wasn't clear, are high. "Use the strengths of your party in over 200 unique dynamic narrative encounters," reads the game's blurb. "Skills will change depending on your team’s successes and failures. Avoid combat by sending your bard to calm the nerves of bandits. Hire a demonologist to communicate with a possessed book. Take the risk and reap the rewards, otherwise you’ll end up with a broken arm, or worse."</p>
<p>Sounds like a game that might be my cup of tea, provided I can still hold said cup of tea after I've had these things my hands are attached to violently wrenched out of place and put in casts. In all seriousness, any game that has four different types of mastermind and art as surreally majestic as this is well worth a look.</p>

<p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick “loves” Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford despite some of his recent comments.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Zelnick was asked about Pitchford’s recent comments, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/randy-pitchford-real-fans-would-pay-80-for-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">such as telling a fan</a> that if they were a “real fan” of Borderlands, they would spend $80 on Borderlands 4 if that was the price.</p>



<p>For Zelnick, that’s just part of Pitchford’s “big personality”</p>



<p><strong>“I love Randy, first of all. Let me just say that on the record,”</strong> Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told IGN</a>. <strong>“And I love his big personality. I love his passion and he is one of the all time great game makers. He also can be controversial at times — sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. I still love him to death.”</strong></p>



<p>For his part, Pitchford addressed the “real fans” comment saying he didn’t mean any harm with his words while acknowledging players being frustrated with price increases.</p>



<p>Circling back to Borderlands 4 itself, the first mainline game in the series since 2019’s Borderlands 3, the base edition price ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-price-has-been-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained the standard $70</a> that has been common for years. The game is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-move-forward-after-randy-pitchford-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on September 12</a> for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 version</a> will launch just weeks later on October 3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Third-party games often struggle on Nintendo platforms. Not <em>Madden NFL 26</em>. The first EA football game to grace one of the Mario maker’s consoles in over a decade, it’s already taking over the top of the Switch 2 sales charts, with its $100 Deluxe Edition bundle second only to <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. But how does it play? New <em>Madden</em> entries have fraught receptions, even on the most powerful consoles. Last year’s version has 3.2 user rating on Metacritic. Apparently the Switch 2 version of Madden 26 successfully carried over that part of the franchise’s legacy. Fans are already divided on whether the port is a dream come true or hot garbage. And some are begging for refunds. Could it really be that bad?</p> <p>I haven’t played the game on Switch 2 yet myself (<em>Kotaku</em> received review code on PS5) but I have been monitoring day-one impressions as they roll in (early access began August 7 but the full launch isn’t until August 14). <em>NintendoLife</em> praised the port in its review. <em>“</em><em>Madden 26</em> on Switch 2 is absolutely a triumph in most regards,” writes PJ O’Reilly. “It plays well, it runs decently, and it looks not too far removed from other console versions.” He notes that the problems he has encountered like “existing menu issues, long loading times, and/or a persistent issue that’s locking me out of <em>Madden 26</em> because the servers are busy” are present across both platforms at the moment. Per usual, the paid early access period is more of a paid beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dude yeah, it’s not optimized. We need frame rate improvements it’s nearly unplayable</p> <p>— Jeremiah Krakowski (@JeremyKrak) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyKrak/status/1953520199862227228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So, what to make of some players raging about things like apparent input lag and framerate stuttering on Switch 2, where it hovers above 30fps but doesn’t hit 60fps like on the other platforms? “Submit your refund asap for Switch 2. Game is unplayable,” reads<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk717v/submit_your_refund_asap_for_switch_2_game_is/"> one of the more dire warnings</a> on the <em>Madden</em> subreddit. The player in question, WhatIsGodWithoutOD, was seemingly able to extract a refund out of Nintendo according to a screenshot. “PSA&nbsp;: Avoid Madden on Switch2–at least for now,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk7acf/psa_avoid_madden_on_switch2_at_least_for_now/">reads another</a> thread by a player lamenting “insanely low frame drops.” The comments sections in both posts, however, include players reporting perfectly fine play sessions with the game.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VnHtNs_Hbs">Direct capture of <em>Madden 26</em></a> running on Switch 2 shows the frequent stuttering some players are talking about, but overall the resolution and performance seems decent enough for a PS5 and Xbox Series X/S game running on a handheld hybrid (this year’s entry is also the first to leave PS4 and Xbox One behind). “It’s a solid port overall although it could be better, and it’s still a very fun experience especially on the go,” wrote one especially level-headed player on the Switch 2 subreddit. So far at least, it sounds like the real divide is over the lack of a 60fps mode. Fans coming from PS5 and Xbox Series X/S <a href="https://x.com/JuniThePuny/status/1953492620937699745">might find the difference jarring</a>. Nintendo fans coming to the series for the first time in years seem to be finding it good enough so far, though there are some questions about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mky5gt/did_ea_lie_about_switch_2_feature_parity/">discrepancies in half-time shows and other features</a> between the different versions.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Madden on Switch 2 is not 60fps but the game still plays good!  Cant explain it, but it’s definitely smoother than 30fps too.  I have about two hours of gameplay here on X and YouTube you can see for yourself.  Definitely would recommend the game!  Here is a clip of a pick 6… <a href="https://t.co/6yHIhQhrgd">pic.twitter.com/6yHIhQhrgd</a></p> <p>— OBE1plays YouTube (@OBE1plays) <a href="https://twitter.com/OBE1plays/status/1953533129655722051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>For those who are playing <em>Madden 26</em> on Switch 2, fans are already circulating two urban legend fixes to help make the experience go smoother. These tricks&nbsp;<em>might</em> be legitimate, or they might simply be the modern day placebo analogues to blowing in the cartridge. The first is making sure the game is installed on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mk8lb9/switch_2_moving_game_to_internal_storage/">Switch 2’s internal memory</a> instead of being read of a cartridge or sitting on the Micro SD express card. The second is doing a hard reboot of the game and system if performance starts to get especially funky. At least until EA starts patching the game, some players are already resorting to turning it off and on again.</p> <p>Otherwise, the early access period is a good time to wait and let Madden 26 begin sorting itself out, a now familiar pattern to annual <em>Madden</em> obsessives. There will be the round of rushed fixes, fans saying, “Actually this entry is pretty great,” and then the mid-fall slump when the nagging issues come back to dominate the conversation. Any real movement in the franchise or player base will be marginal, at least <a href="https://kotaku.com/2k-will-make-nfl-games-again-for-the-first-time-in-16-y-1842235385">until 2K releases its own football game</a> and there is finally some competition in the space again. But you don’t have to actually play <em>Madden</em> to enjoy the best part about each new release: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1mkafrj/classic_ea/">a fresh season of glitches</a>.</p>

There are penalties for leavers in quick matches as well, though they are less steep. Repeat leavers there can be banned for up to eight hours from matchmaking.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As for the teammates of leavers or those with an AFK member, NetEase is looking to ease the sting of losing a teammate in the 6v6 hero shooter. If a disconnection or AFK players is detected within the first 70 seconds of a competitive match, the match will be deemed invalid, with penalties for the leaver or AFK player but no negative results or penalties for other players in the match.</p><p dir="ltr">If a disconnected or AFK player later rejoins, if their team wins, they won't receive a penalty, but will if their team loses. Other players on the losing team will receive ranked-point compensation, easing the sting of the loss.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been adjustments to matchmaking as well, with players in higher ranks no longer being able to queue as a larger team. In Platinum, Diamond, and Grandmaster, players can only form up to a three-player team to enter matchmaking, while Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All players can only queue in teams of two.</p><p dir="ltr">While that's the majority of what makes up the patch, there are a few other changes. On PC, shaders will now compile in the background, players can now zoom out and use emotes while in the team lobby, and unique costume voice and sound effects can now be toggled for specific costumes. The only major gameplay change is increased audio cues for Wolverine and Black Panther in order to give those they are ambushing a chance to hear them coming.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-joins-marvel-rivals-august-8-along-with-new-and-removed-team-ups/1100-6533566/" data-ref-id="1100-6533566">Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 additionally adds Blade</a> to the game's ever-expanding superhero roster, alongside the removal (and addition) of a number of team-up abilities.

<p>Launching next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a fresh new survival horror from Bloober Team, has a new deep dive trailer, giving players a proper look at the story and characters from the upcoming Switch 2 title.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty sweet, and we're particularly intrigued by a character called The Warden, who looks like a cross between Cronos' protagonist and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/doom_the_dark_ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>' Slayer. Bloober Team states that we'll be meeting "a lot of characters" in the game, and it sounds like the devs have put a lot of focus on telling a human story amongst the blood and gore.</p>
<p>Coming off the back of Silent Hill 2, we're intrigued to see if Bloober Team can continue its winning streak. It's no doubt received some criticism for its storytelling in the past, and Silent Hill was very much the brainchild of Team Silent developers Takayoshi Sato and Hiroyuki Owaku.</p>
<p>Still, we're excited to dive into this one. Up until recently, it was only confirmed for the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but a recent Partner Direct confirmed its existence for the Switch 2, and it'll be launching on <strong>5th September 2025</strong>. So less than a month to go!</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S generation has seen the longest cross-generation period to date, making players feel like the actual new generation never truly began, but next year may mark the end of this long period, with multiple developers looking into dropping PlayStation 4 support.</p>



<p>In a new report shared by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sonys-confidence-in-playstation-is-well-placed-opinion">GamesIndustry</a>, it has been revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/genshin-impact-drops-playstation-4-support/">HoYoverse dropping PlayStation 4 support for the extremely popular Genshin Impact</a> isn't going to be an isolated move, as <em>"many other operators of major online and live service titles also eyeing up the timeline for dropping PS4 support."</em> While some developers are dropping support for the previous generation system due to technical reasons, like in Genshin Impact's case, the report suggests that the install bases of the current generation systems are now high enough for some publishers to leave the PlayStation 4 behind and focus their effort on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>With Sony's system confirmed to have shipped 80.3 million PlayStation 5 units, it's not surprising to hear that developers of live service games are finally ready to leave the previous console generation behind. Still, the current console generation finally coming onto its own may be short lived, as rumors abound regarding the next generation systems from Sony and Microsoft which should release between the next couple of years. Going by these rumors, both the PlayStation 6 and Xbox Next will represent a sort of shift for both manufacturers, as Sony is reportedly aiming to offer a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-will-deliver-5-10x-ray-tracing-performance-over-base-ps5-a-4k-120-fps-console-will-be-a-compelling-proposition-at-anything-below-900/">4K, 120 FPS machine while keeping costs down</a>, while Microsoft to use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">flexibility offered by the Magnus APU</a> to deliver a wider range of systems which won't necessarily compete with a traditional console, but with gaming PCs. As such, amidst so many challenges, it seems like gaming is going to change quite a bit in the future, and even the concepts of console generations and cross-gen periods may become a thing of the past.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Maybe Strauss Zelnick's been asked about the GTA 6 price one too many times</p>

    </div>

            <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has reaffirmed 2K Games' assertion that the reportedly troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> 4, currently in the works at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a>, will make it to release.</p>
<p>The reassurance follows a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one">report from Bloomberg earlier this week</a> which reported that the game had failed a recent internal progress check, with the story specifically being tapped as an aspect that needs reworking, and some of the devs working on it have been reassigned to non-BioShock roles.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Hence why, in an interview around 2K Games' parent company Take-Two's latest financial report, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question">IGN</a> asked Zelnick whether BioShock 4 is in danger of being canned. "It’s going to come out. That I can say hand on heart, without question," the exec responded. "We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership."</p>
<p>Zelnick went on to cite living up to the "legacy" left by series creator and current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a> developer Ken Levine, as well as the reputations carved out by its previous entries, as a tough task. "We need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand," he explained.</p>
<p>This was was also, unfortunately, where words began to word. As part of his explanation of why BioShock 4 is taking a while to come out, Zelnick offered the following as the reason game development cycles are getting longer:</p>
<blockquote>I think it's a reflection of the fact that as entertainment businesses mature, consumers seek quality and everyone realises that the consumer is highly demanding and properly so. The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly a precious few times. And I think some of our competitors have realized maybe a little late in the day that consumers are not okay with okay. Good is the new bad, great is the new great. And our goal here is to make everything exceptional.</blockquote>
<p>The first bit makes sense regardless of whether you agree with it, given we're talking about the species that made the three most recent Fast and Furious films highly lucrative ventures. Then, towards the end, Zelnick seems to lose track of what words actually mean, even if those words are inherently subjective in terms of which games they apply to. I can just about stomach "good is the new bad," given it's just expressing how games that perceivedly fall short of greatness arguably face a tougher challenge nowadays due to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-next-fests-have-grown-into-humongous-battle-royales-and-june-2025s-was-no-different">sheer saturation of "good" games out there</a>.</p>
<p>But what does "great is the new great" mean? I'd get it if he'd just said making a great game is great for business. How can making a great game be the new making a great game? They're the same thing, surely. Zelnick then goes on to say that Take-Two are aiming to "make everything exceptional". He's clearly just run out of superlatives above great, because it's impossible for "everything" to be "exceptional" by definition.</p>
<p>The use of the word makes sense if he means this specifically in terms of Take-Two's output in comparison to the rest of the industry, but I think he needs to bite the hyperbole bullet and commit to saying he's aiming for nothing less than super-mega-fantastic-one-of-a-kind-uber-masterpieces, which will simultaneously not be one-of-a-kind, because <em>all</em> of Take-Two's games will be like that.</p>
<p>I get that this is just one bit of CEO talk, but verging on breaking the English language maybe conveys how much the industry's moneyfolks are losing the plot when it comes to the expectations - fuelled by a perceived need to make unfathomable amounts of money for a release not to be a total failure - that they heap upon their own games. By all means aim to make a great game, but if every game's got to be great because good is bad, how long is it until we've burned through the whole dictionary?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-is-not-ok-good-is-bad-great-is-the-new-great-and-bioshock-4-is-coming-out-as-take-two-boss-stops-short-of-claiming-that-up-is-down]]></content:encoded>

<p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> was a wildly successful sequel to one of the Nintendo Switch’s most popular games, so an upgraded version on Nintendo Switch 2 was a no-brainer. The upgrade promises improved visuals, performance, HDR support, and more; arguably, there is no better way to experience this gorgeous open-world adventure. But how does the original version run on new hardware <i>without </i>the upgrade? Let’s discuss. We’ll also get into some helpful tips for getting started in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i>.</p>  <p>Say you’ve got a copy of <i>Tears of the Kingdom </i>on hand, but are short the $10 needed for the upgrade. Fortunately, the first Switch edition of <i>TotK</i> is the same, incredible game many of us fell in love with in 2023. Yes, the resolution is lower, the load times are slower, but it remains one of Link’s greatest adventures yet.</p> <p>Without the upgrade, <i>TotK</i> will still only run at 30 frames-per-second on Switch 2. That said, the framerate is more stable, so you’ll have a slightly better experience than what you’d get on aging, OG Switch hardware.</p>

 <p>As has been <a href="https://youtu.be/XtdaeX_fGHI">well documented by this point</a>, the Switch 2 upgrade is a dramatic improvement. The game looks sharper, it runs at double the framerate, and load times have been cut in half. Also, the Zelda Notes are an excellent dose of extra lore.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Zelda Totk switch 2 UPGRADE vs ORIGINAL edition LOADING comparison" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBBtcxdv2mg"></iframe></p><p>&nbsp;Unless you’re running on a super tight budget, we wholeheartedly recommend spending the extra 10 bucks to enjoy this masterpiece. Now, let’s get to some helpful tips for those jumping off a Sky Island for the very first time.</p> <hr> <h2><span id="tips-for-tears-of-the-kingdom-newcomers"></span>Tips for <i>Tears of the Kingdom</i> newcomers<span></span></h2>  <h3><span id="make-a-beeline-for-the-paraglider"></span>Make a beeline for the paraglider<span></span></h3> <p>Anyone who has played <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> will remember the paraglider being an immensely important part of Link’s kit, helping him glide around and reach new spots. It’s only more vital in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </i>due to the game’s heavier focus on sky exploration, so don’t accidentally start exploring too much of Hyrule before getting your hands on it. Luckily, you just need to follow the first few hours of the main quest to score the paraglider, so you’ll be gliding in no time at all.</p>

 <h3><span id="level-stamina-before-hearts"></span>Level stamina before hearts<span></span></h3> <p>Enemies in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> hit hard as hell, with some baddies being able to one-shot you handily during the first half of the game even if you have a few extra hearts. With this in mind, it’s a good idea to prioritize leveling your stamina as much as possible early on. This will let you do a lot more climbing and gliding, which is very important for reaching new areas or shrines with exciting loot.</p> <p>You can always cook and eat meals that give you extra hearts if you really need them. And after making a little more progress in the game, you’ll be able to respec your hearts and stamina for 120 rupees at a particular statue in Lookout Landing, so you’ll be able to change things up as you see fit.</p>

 <h3><span id="fuse-a-lot-of-makeshift-hammers-and-keep-them-handy"></span>Fuse a lot of makeshift hammers and keep them handy<span></span></h3> <p>This may seem like a niche tip, but keeping makeshift hammers around is one of the most helpful things you can do for yourself in <i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.</i> You’ll find yourself exploring numerous deep caves in Hyrule, and you’ll be shocked at how many contain multiple pathways blocked by breakable rocks.</p> <p>Though you may be able to use bomb plants or other methods to clear rock blockages, hammer weapons, which you can make by fusing a normal weapon with a rock/boulder (or certain other hard materials), allow you to attack specific pieces of the blockage to carve a path just big enough for you to fit through. Even better, breaking the blockage will sometimes spawn new rocks you can use to fuse a brand-new makeshift hammer!</p>

 <p>You’ll find a more efficient way to break these walls later in the game–but until then, keep fusing!</p> <h3><span id="trust-your-own-ingenuity"></span>Trust your own ingenuity<span></span></h3> <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </i>goes big on the Ultrahand ability, which lets you combine various items in the world to create everything from simple platforms to intricate machines. And if you’re going to solve every puzzle and reach every well-hidden secret in Hyrule, you’ll need to master this ability.</p> <p>While you may encounter some puzzles or hard-to-reach-items here and there that have only one or two building solutions, a significant portion of these scenarios can benefit from your ingenuity. So, feel free to opt for a complex device or even a sloppy, half-assed solution of your own choosing. You’d be surprised at how often your own random building ideas can get the job done–sometimes even easier than the solutions the developers intended for you to use.</p> <p>Ultrahand doesn’t control you—you control Ultrahand.</p> <p><i>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</i> is available now for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>BANG! One moment, I was running down a dusty street in Cairo; the next moment, I was on my ass, bleeding out. Someone had shot me. A few teammates near me fired into the building where my attacker was and killed him. Lying on the ground, I watched them reload their rifles, look around for other enemies, and then…they just ran off, leaving me to die in the street. They could have revived me, but they didn’t. Instead, I had to respawn and burn one of our conquest tickets. It was annoying, and it keeps happening in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 7, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-huge-player-count-steam-beta-jurassic-forza-castle-crashers-2000616307"><em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta</a> launched on consoles and PC. However, for now can only play if you have an early access code, as the beta doesn’t go fully open until August 9. It’s weird to gatekeep an “open” beta, but whatever. Since it launched on Thursday, I’ve been squeezing in as many matches of Conquest and Breakthrough as I can and having a great time. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">I really enjoyed EA’s upcoming military shooter</a> when I played it <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">earlier this month at a big event in Los Angeles</a>, and I still like <em>BF6</em> now that I’m playing it at home. The gunplay is tight and responsive, everything sounds dangerous, explosions are incredible, and the maps are big, but not too big. Good shit. But what isn’t good is how frequently people don’t revive me or others when we’re down. Instead, they just run by or stand near me and do nothing. Please, stop ignoring your downed comrades and help them out.</p> <p>You might be thinking, “Well, if they aren’t medics, they can’t help you.” But that’s not how <em>Battlefield 6</em> works. In this game, anyone can revive a downed soldier by running up to them, holding a specific button, and dragging them to safety. After a few seconds of holding onto the injured player, they’ll be revived with partial health. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385">It’s a wonderful mechanic</a> that has already led to some incredible moments with friends while playing the beta. And I’m always willing to drag a random player to safety and bring them back into the fight as it’s fun, useful, and doesn’t take too long.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Sadly, most other players either don’t realize that anyone can drag and revive players, or don’t care to help. Worse, I see plenty of people playing the Support class, which has access to defib paddles that can instantly revive people, and they also ignore me and my friends. Why are you playing the medic-themed class that is built around helping people if you just run by all your downed teammates? It’s incredibly annoying and has led to my team losing matches because we keep respawning to get back into the action instead of reviving, and that burns through our respawn tickets in modes like Conquest. It also makes it harder for me to revive people because so many players just instantly respawn the moment they die, as they assume, understandably, that nobody is going to help them. Why waste time waiting for help that is unlikely to come? That leads to the team burning through tickets even faster. It’s all very frustrating.</p> <p>Look, I don’t expect to be revived every single time I go down. Sometimes I’m too far away from others. Sometimes there’s a fucking tank next to me. I’m not expecting people to throw themselves into danger just to revive me. But it would be nice if I didn’t have to bleed out slowly in a building filled with teammates simply because nobody grabbed me and helped. So, I ask you all, during the open beta and when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches later this October, to please, please, please revive people more. You’ll feel better, they’ll be happy, and your team won’t burn a ticket. Everyone wins. Doesn’t that sound nice?</p>

<p>More collaborations with other Marvel titles are coming to Marvel Rivals in the future, Game Director Guangguang has confirmed to Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has seen regular updates bringing costumes and looks from other Marvel media into the title, including some from other games, and that shows no signs of stopping.</p>



<p>Speaking exclusively to Insider Gaming at the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-ignite-mid-season-finals-complete-scores-standings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals Ignite Mid-Season Finals</a>&nbsp;in Guangzhou, Guangguang would not elaborate on specifics with the plans but confirmed they are on the agenda.</p>

<p>Asked whether collaborations with other Marvel games are on the cards, including the upcoming Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Guangguang did not confirm whether that specific title would be featured in collaborations but confirmed “future plans on collaborations with other Marvel titles.”</p>



<p>While this isn’t too surprising, given the game already features a Spider-Man costume based on the Insomniac series, albeit a PlayStation exclusive, it’s still exciting news for players—particularly given the slew of upcoming Marvel titles in the works, including Insomniac’s Wolverine, EA’s Iron Man, and Arkane’s Lyon.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marvel Ri</a>vals has also had collaborations outside of the Marvel sphere, including with Fortnite, and teased “maybe” when asked if similar collaborations with Epic Games could happen in the future.</p>



<p>There will also be a continuation with collaborations with other Marvel properties, as Guangguang confirmed discussions with Marvel Studios, Marvel Animation, and Disney+. In future, releases could be timed to coincide simulataneously with other media forms, bringing new costumes and locations into the game at the same time as movie releases, for examples.</p>
