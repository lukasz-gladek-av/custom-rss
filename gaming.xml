<p>Nintendo has announced plans to acquire Bandai Namco’s Studio in Singapore, where they already have an existing relationship due to contributions in developing the likes of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>Bandai Namco Studio Singapore, which was established in 2013, has worked on the likes of Ace Combat 7 and Splatoon 3, and will now be brought under the Nintendo umbrella.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo announced</a> that, subject to approval, an acquisition of 80% of the studio’s shares will be acquired on April 1, 2026, with the remaining shares being acquired “after a certain period.”</p>



<p>Nintendo will rename the studio Nintendo Studios Singapore, which will become a subsidiary of Nintendo, but the studio will “continue its development operations.”</p>



<p>The Singapore studio is likely to become a support studio for Nintendo, continuing in a similar role that it has operated in for the past decade, with Nintendo stating it has “strong expertise in creating in-game art assets.” Nintendo adds that the acquisition “will have only a minor effect on Nintendo’s results for this fiscal year.”</p>



<p>Nintendo’s ongoing business relationship with the Singapore studio should lead to an easy transition, with the studio already familiar to the working processes given their involvement in the development of Splatoon 3.</p>



<p>The ongoing expansion of Nintendo is already set to bring more of its famous IPs to life in the movie scene, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-movie-franchises-mario-zelda-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo involved in multiple projects</a> set for release after The Legend of Zelda in 2027.</p>

<p>Back in 2011, the DS was gifted one of the all-time great <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/alien_isolation">Alien</a> franchise games in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/aliens_infestation">Aliens: Infestation</a>, a slick and polished Metroidvania that nails its mix of puzzling, platforming, signature series tension, and great big scary extraterrestrials (alongside their face-hugging pals). Hey, we even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2011/10/aliens_infestation_ds">gave it an 8/10 back at release</a>, so you just know it's verified fresh, or whatever they're saying these days.</p>
<p>It's a very good game that you should definitely play, in short. Even if you don't like Metroidvanias or aliens. Because of one song.</p>
<p>As we were happily reminded this very morning, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social/post/3m6lqhazfs22a">via a much-appreciated social media post,</a> of the ending credits song for Aliens: Infestation (below), written by the very same band (Guyz Nite) who penned the also wonderful <a href="https://youtu.be/dH34jMqHBmw?si=9ZQDc0uf6d8PkmUg">Die Hard song</a> (warning for NSFW swearing, but otherwise a treat and a wonderful Xmas song to boot).</p>

<p>If you can listen to this and somehow resist immediately diving back in to replay the whole flipping game all over again, you've got more willpower than this writer. And shoutout to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhallenbeck.bsky.social">@MrHallenback</a> for the Thursday morning levity!</p>

			<p>PC and consoles sent to repair shops come with all sorts of issues, but a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5 </a>unit sent to a shop in the United States definitely wins the award for the most disgusting. The system needed to be debugged, in the most literal sense.</p>



<p>As reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?s=20">Financial Dystopia</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dvdgameexchangeutah/?hl=en">DVD Game Exchange Repair Center</a>, a repair shop based in Orem, Utah, recently received a broken PlayStation 5 for repairs. After opening up the system, and verifying that the power supply was not to blame, it was discovered that the system was likely no longer working due to a serious bug. Or rather, many of them.</p>



<p>After discovering cockroach droppings all over the system's components, which is disgusting enough, the repair shop rep showed in the video how cockroaches were actively crawling out of the console. The truly literal "debugging," however, will have to be conducted by the owner of the system. The repain center wrapped up the console in plastic to prevent the insects from escaping before sending it back.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">He runs a console-repair business. Started the diagnostics, saw what was inside, and immediately decided to pack it up and send it back. Can’t even blame him. <a href="https://t.co/QIrKXSsWqw">pic.twitter.com/QIrKXSsWqw</a></p>— Financial Dystopia (@financedystop) <a href="https://twitter.com/financedystop/status/1993727198050873432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Scouring the X thread, other users reported all sorts of disgusting stories, including one about a PC tower case with a black widow spider infestation, so this cockroach-infested PlayStation 5 is hardly the first system to become a nest for bugs. </p>



<p>Still, this stands as a warning to all console and PC users: clear your systems frequently, as they can house something much worse than dust. A small investment of time cleaning now could save you from a truly stomach-churning repair bill later.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s next big event will act as a narrative sequel to Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies, bringing back Uma Thurman as Beatrice Kiddo as well as Yuki Yibari, the sister of one of Kill Bill Volume 1's antagonists.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of The Lost Chapter: Yuki's Revenge, which will premiere in Fortnite on the 30th November at 2pm, ET / 11am PT / 7pm GMT / 8pm CET. It's an animated movie made in the Fortnite engine, directed and written by Quentin Tarantino. You can access the premiere 30 minutes before its starting time, so be sure to get there early.</p>
<p>In addition, you can watch it in real life on an actual cinema screen on the 5th December,  where select theatres across the USA, Canada, and the UK will be showing the animated film as well as Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair (a combination of both original movies). Those who purchase a ticket to see this real-world premiere will get a code that can be redeemed for the Gogo Yubari outfit. This appears to be the only way to get the skin as of writing.</p>

<p>If you don't want to sit down and watch the film yourself, you can log in to Fortnite at any point between now and the 1st December to earn a Yuki Yubari in-game skin. She, as you may have guessed, is a main presence in Yuki's revenge.</p><p>This isn't the first time Tarantino has used animation to expand upon Kill Bill. Chapter three of the film, the Origins of O-Ren, used 2D animation to show the backstory of one of its main characters. However, this was included in the movie itself. This is the first time anything Kill Bill has been portrayed away from the silver screen.</p>
<p>This comes shortly after Fortnite gave the world <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-x-simpsons-caused-a-spike-in-new-and-returning-players">a hugely popular Simpsons crossover</a>, which brought back a record number of returning players. We'll have to wait and see whether some beloved gory action cinema can replicate similar results.</p>

            <p>UK studio Splash Damage has entered a studio-wide consultation process ahead of extensive redundancies.</p>
<p>The studio has suffered difficulties this year after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splash-damage-cancels-transformers-reactivate-says-roles-at-risk-of-redundancy">cancellation of its Transformers: Reactivate project</a> back in January, which left roles "at risk of redundancy". Then, in September, it was acquired by unnamed private equity investors (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splash-damage-breaks-away-from-tencent">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). Previously it was owned by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, which acquired the studio back in 2020.</p>
<p>Staff were notified of redundancies yesterday, and a public statement was shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">LinkedIn</a>. "This was a difficult step for us to take, but we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market," it reads.</p>

<p>Before that it worked on Gears of War and Halo games for Microsoft in a support capacity.</p>

			<p>Sweet Surrender is a VR roguelike, and it comes with everything that label brings. You’ll be making your way through the environment picking off enemies, looking for weapons, cash, and upgrades, and swearing every time an enemy shaves off a bit of your health and you come closer to the end of a run. But it’s all in VR, and it’s cool throwing daggers that are somehow poisonous to robots. Oh yeah, everything is a robot – including you.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sweet Surrender - PS VR2 Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcibo6YqOEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Originally launching in 2021 for Quest and PC VR, this PSVR 2 port has come after a bunch of upgrades and additions tot the game. There’s some great twists to the roguelike format and general gameplay, thanks to Sweet Surrender being in VR. The upgrades you can find throughout a level are chips that are fitted into slots by your wrists, for example, but the boosts they provide will only apply to the weapons in that hand, forcing you to really think about what upgrades you’re choosing and where you put them. A revolver that usually only shoots one, very powerful bullet before reloading on an arm with upgrades that triple its capacity and double its damage is a force to be reckoned with, but maybe something that heals you when you find cash would be smarter, to make up for the inevitable health loss.</p>


<p>The weapons themselves are mostly the standard fare – pistol, shotgun, SMG, and so on – but there are more interesting options, such as a katana that burns with plasma when you pull the trigger, or a spear that can shoot electricity. Melee weapons are particularly risky to use, as they force you to get into melee range, giving enemies a good opportunity to shoot you full of holes. Thankfully there are also a bunch of other items you can find, such as grenades, boosters that increase damage, and a holographic shield that feels pretty satisfying to use. At least, until you misjudge it and it runs out of energy in time for a bunch of bullets to the face.</p>


<p>When all this comes together the combat is pretty satisfying, rewarding accuracy for targeting weakspots on the various robot enemies. It’s fast and frenetic, and you can quickly lose a lot of health by getting surrounded. In classic shooter fashion, I found that the best way to fight is to find a bottleneck and take enemies out as they come into view. It does make you feel a bit like a robotic assassin, which is cool, but after a while the temptation to wade in with a plasma sword and a shield comes back because it’s more fun. It’s just that it’s more fun for less time, because you’ll die quicker.</p>
<p>Once you’ve had a few runs, Sweet Surrender starts to feel a bit limited and repetitive. You do have to expect repetition in a roguelike, but you will start to see the same rooms and layouts repeating themselves very quickly. The upgrades and weapons you find can also duplicate and repeat themselves within a run, so there’s limits to how far you can really extend your build.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that this game has very little of the meta progression that has come to define run-based gaming in recent years – it’s a more classic rogulike than a modern roguelite. There are different classes to unlock – Medic, Grenadier, Sniper and Reaper – but there’s no overarching upgrades beyond that, and they don’t actually change the experience all that much beyond some boosts to certain types of damage or more healing. I’ve settled into building my character with one arm for shooting and the other for healing every single time I play, regardless of the class I’ve chosen. Beyond that, you can get shortcuts to let you skip areas, which is nice, but does mean you’re skipping past the items in those areas as well.</p>

<p>Then there are a bunch of immersion breakers and frustraters. Whilst implanting chips into your arm for your upgrades is cool, the experience of actually doing it is a bit of a pain. Just viewing the UI to see your current upgrades is fiddly, requiring a precise twist of your arm that can sometimes trigger in combat and get in the way. I’ve also found the controls to be very finicky for accessing hip holsters,&nbsp;shoulder holsters, and chest item storage. I’m constantly grabbing the wrong thing, including the rifle on your back when you’re trying to get the pistol from your hip, a good foot away from where your hand is.</p>
<p>There’s also a lot of dropping things, as the game doesn’t use the PSVR’s touch sensitive buttons, so you’re only holding an item if you’re specifically pressing the button properly. This becomes uncomfortable, but if you switch it to toggle it becomes nearly impossible to throw things properly, so you just have to live with it. Two handed guns like the assault rifle can be a bit awkward to aim down the sight on as there’s some jitter to the tracking, though you can just use them one handed like a pistol anyway.</p>
<p>Sweet Surrender does look pretty good, with a pseudo-cel shaded art style that allows explosions and things like electricity to stand out a bit. It’s not going to astonish you, but it suits the style of the game pretty well. There some nice attention to detail as well, such as there being an actual trigger on the plasma sword that is pulled when you trigger the plasma. The sound is decent as well, with the best bits being the gun sounds and the warning sounds of nearby traps. Again, nothing to amaze, but it does its job well enough.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>'s Midnight expansion finally has a full release date.

<p>The date was announced via a fresh trailer, in which old and evil void being Xal’atath has a mid-battle snarky line-off with Lor'themar, the ruler of Azeroth's blood elves. There'll be big void beasties who're well into demonic snarling to battle, as Xal’atath unleashes a Voidstorm that threatens to permanently knock the world's lights off if she succeeds.</p><p>You'll be fighting back, infuriated at the very idea of having to fumble around for switches whenever you leave the new digs the expansion's delivering. To be fair, 'Just go away, I'm trying to pick a carpet which matches my drapes and it's VERY STRESSFUL' sounds like as good a battlecry as any. Three different editions of the expansion will be on offer - base, heroic, and epic - with the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24243639/world-of-warcraft-midnighttm-goes-live-march-2">date announcement post</a> outlining the extras the latter two include via a big chart.</p>
<p>Outside of the player housing, the update includes a new allied race dubbed the Haranir, a nature-focused gang of humanoids who serve as "ancient guardians of the rootways" in their jungle homeland of Harandar. Harandar's one of four fresh or revamped areas you'll be exploring in Midnight, with the blood elves' Eversong Woods, Amani troll-filled Zul’ Aman and the Voidstorm itself. There are three paths through the main story, with the option to head to Zul'Aman, Harandar, or off on a quest to head off with Arator Windrunner and seek some relics of light all being options after kicking things off in Eversong.</p>
<p>If you're keen to delve into the expansion early, sign-ups for its beta are <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/midnight">currently open</a>. Epic edition purchasers get immediate access to said beta as part of their forking over of extra cash.</p>

IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 review</a> returned a 7/10.

This write-down, Paradox said, was based on an updated sales forecast now it has had a month to look at Bloodlines’ commercial performance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fredrik Wester, CEO of Paradox Interactive, said the blame for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2’s failure lay at the publisher’s door, not that of The Chinese Room, which had been drafted in to save the project after years of development hell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is a strong vampire fantasy and we are pleased with the developers’ work on the game,” Wester said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve had high expectations for a long time, since we saw that it was a good game with a strong IP in a genre with a broad appeal. A month after release we can sadly see that sales do not match our projections, which necessitates the write-down. The responsibility lies fully with us as the publisher. The game is outside of our core areas, in hindsight it is clear that this has made it difficult for us to gauge sales. Going forward, we focus our capital to our core segments and, at the same time, we’ll evaluate how we best develop World of Darkness’ strong brand catalogue in the future.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 has two expansions planned as part of the game’s Premium Edition, and Paradox said it remains committed to delivering them. “Our post-release plan remains firm; we will deliver updates and the promised expansions to the game in the coming year,” Wester added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Swedish game company Paradox’s main focus is on grand strategy games, which have proven enormously successful over the years. Games such as Stellaris, Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Cities: Skylines have all enjoyed big sales, and, in total, Paradox games have six million players each month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, however, falls outside that core grand strategy genre, and always looked like it would struggle upon release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Remember when Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> in its most recent financial report that it would acquire more gaming studios? Well, it didn't take long for it to actually happen.</p>



<p>This morning, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> in a press release that it has entered an agreement to acquire Bandai Namco Studios Singapore from Bandai Namco. So far, the Singapore studio has functioned in a co-development capacity on Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival, Soul Calibur VI, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown, and Splatoon 3. Clearly, it is their work on the latter game that caught Nintendo's attention, as clarified in the announcement:</p>



<p><em>BNSS has contributed to the development of Nintendo titles, including the Splatoon series, and has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo. Considering this business record, Nintendo has made the decision to acquire shares in BNSS to strengthen the development structure of the Nintendo Group.</em></p>



<p>Splatoon 3 was released in September 2022 to generally positive reviews. Our own Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated it 7.5 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Splatoon 3 may be the series’ best entry yet, featuring some nice gameplay tweaks and new weaponry, an expanded and polished story mode, and more launch content than its predecessors. That said, it’s very much an evolutionary sequel, every bit as iterative as many of the shooter franchises it’s meant to be an alternative to. After a five-year absence, that may not be enough for some. Splatoon 3 is still fun and funky, but Nintendo’s squid shooter series can’t get by on freshness alone forever.</em></p>



<p>However, fans of the third-person shooter series really enjoyed this entry. The game has sold over 12 million units to date, making it the fastest-selling Splatoon game.</p>



<p>80% of the shares of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore will be acquired on April 1, 2026, while the remaining ones will be purchased later, once the new subsidiary's operations have stabilized. BNSS will henceforth be known as Nintendo Studios Singapore.</p>

<p>The Holiday season covers the months of November, December, and January. Most of the biggest game releases happen outside of this period, but there’s still plenty of the best games releasing in Holiday 2025.</p>



<p>As 2025 begins to wind down, players are peppered with massive games from August through to October. The season starts again around February and March. Sandwiched in this is the Holiday season, and 2025 still has the odd homerun to knock out of the park first.</p>



<p>Also, for even more holiday shopping guides, check out&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a>&nbsp;for the best deals available.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-best-video-games-for-holiday-2025">The Best Video Games For Holiday 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-football-manager-26">Football Manager 26</h3>

<p>Absence makes the heart grow fonder. It’s incredible to think it’s been two years since the last FM game. But Sports Interactive finally dropped Football Manager 26, and while it’s <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/football-manager/football-manager-26-is-one-of-the-worst-games-ever-rated-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the worst games ever rated on Steam</a>, it’s selling like hotcakes!</p>







<p>It would make a nice present under the tree, and is sure to eat up any free time you have.</p>







<h3 id="h-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big sequel. Image from Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Dynasty Warrior-like combat and gameplay aesthetics are back in The Legend of Zelda, thanks to Age of Imprisonment. It carries on the spin-offs’ focus on large-scale combat over cave exploration and puzzles, but it makes for one of the most unique Zelda games of all time.</p>







<h3 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More Call of Duty. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-ranked-play-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is the next Call of Duty game, and it doesn’t matter how it reviews, it’s guaranteed to be under most Christmas trees for Holiday 2025. It doesn’t have to be the best game; it just has to be Call of Duty—which it is. Insider Gaming understands this, which is why you can get money off the heavy-hitter below.</p>







<h3 id="h-kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A nice surprise. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stand back, Mario Kart World, there’s a new racing game speeding onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Mario Kart World was the guaranteed winner for the Switch 2 in 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/controversial-kirby-air-riders-bikini-skin-has-already-been-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a> whistled through and turned out to be a pleasant competitor. It brings back a fairly niche franchise into the mainstream again.</p>







<h3 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Samus strikes again. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-new-unlisted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> journey has been stressful, but potentially rewarding. Metroid Prime 4 was starting to slip into the void and become another <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-evil-2-still-advertising-new-job-roles-after-17-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>. It finally reappeared, and now it’s set to grace Nintendo Switch 2 consoles for the Holiday 2025 season, and it’s one of the most anticipated games—one you should probably buy if you have the console!</p>







<h3 id="h-code-vein-nbsp-2">Code Vein&nbsp;2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More pain. Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Code Vein was Bandai Namco’s solo attempt to crack the Souls genre market. It didn’t quite reach the levels of a FromSoftware game, but its enchanting art style and sales were enough to captivate Bandai into giving the franchise another chance. Code Vein 2 is one of 2026’s first big games.</p>

<p>'Mounts of Mayhem' is almost here</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> announced a new drop officially titled '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-minecraft-live-september-2025-new-drops-mobs-weapons-dlc-and-more">Mounts of Mayhem</a>'. The development team has now confirmed the Bedrock Edition of the game will receive this "final game drop" of the year on <strong>9th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>In case you missed the initial reveal, this new drop will come loaded with a new weapon (the spear), the Zombie Horse, and the Nautilus (a new mob you can tame, ride and equip with armour). There'll also be a Zombie Nautilus.</p>
<p>Last but not least is the Camel Husk and its two riders - a husk and a parched. The team is also adding some quality-of-life improvements such as the ability to cross bodies of water on horseback. You can get more details about this content drop in the latest monthly video update above and in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-minecraft-live-september-2025-new-drops-mobs-weapons-dlc-and-more">Minecraft Live September 2025 round up</a> post.</p>

<p>More Mega Man action in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_star_force_legacy_collection">Mega Man Star Force: Legacy Collection</a> in September, mentioning at the time how this new retro package would be arriving on the Switch at some point in 2026.</p>
<p>In an update, this new collection featuring multiple titles from the DS generation has now been rated E10+ by the ESRB – with the rating listing "Fantasy Violence" and "Users Interact". Here's the official ESRB summary in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection</em> is rated E10+ for Everyone 10+ by the ESRB with Fantasy Violence. Also includes Users Interact. This is a collection of action role-playing games in which players help characters battle viruses in a futuristic world. Players interact with characters, explore fantasy environments, and use battle cards to perform attacks on enemies in an arena. Battle-card attacks include use of energy blasts, punches, kicks, bombs, ice blasts, and swords. A higher-resolution art gallery depicts other violent acts: robots cut in half or impaled by swords; a character with arrows sticking out of his back."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Protodude, the owner of Mega Man fansite <a href="https://www.rockman-corner.com/">Rockman Corner</a>, also notes how the "three original releases", which started out as a series in 2006/07, all carried 'E' ratings back in the day in this same location. With any luck, fans won't have to wait much longer for these games to return.</p>

<p>Once again, here are the titles and additional versions from this series included in this collection. You can find out more about what to expect from this new collection in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Leo</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Dragon</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force Pegasus</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxNinja</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 2 ZerkerxSamurai</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 3 Black Ace</em></strong></li>
<li><strong><em>Mega Man Star Force 3 Red Joker</em></strong></li>
</ul>
<p>One other Switch game that's recently surfaced on the ESRB is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which is due out on the Switch and Switch 2 next month.</p>

<p>The new update and patch notes for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Version 1.02, are out now for Nintendo Switch 2. With it, new quests, weapons, and fixes have been added.</p>







<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-announced-at-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the newest entry</a> in the Hyrule Warriors spinoffs for The Legend of Zelda. In it, fans get to see the original Guardians that took a stand against Ganon, which is shown in flashbacks in Tears of the Kingdom. The Musou hack-and-slash combat and colorful visuals are well worth it, especially on Nintendo Switch 2, but now, there’s a lot more to get excited about with Version 1.02.</p>



<p>For Version 1.02 of Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, available now, there’s some new content to enjoy. The biggest of all are new battles and quests, which are unlocked after beating the main story. New stylish Sync-Strike Attacks between Zelda and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-new-trailer-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calamo</a> have been added, as well as the Longsword of Light for Rauru. Furthermore, some improvements to split-screen and UI have been addressed and fixed.</p>

<p>This patch follows a launch update for the title on <strong>5th November 2025</strong>. You can find out more about today's update in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-adds-new-weapons-and-challenges-in-free-update-this-week">our previous story</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't already joined the fight in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, here's a sample of what we had to say about it in our review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"With Zonai devices to play with, a cracking roster, tons of sexy Sync Strikes to pull off, and a ludicrously slick recreation of early Hyrule to set about kicking ass in, this is dream time for hack-and-slash fans and Zelda enthusiasts alike. Yes, map layouts are still a bit bland, and co-op mode is 30fps, but everything else here combines to make for the best entry in this spin-off franchise to date."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fitbit-adopts-zero-profit-play-on-charge-6-fitness-tracker-this-black-friday-selling-at-new-all-time-low-2000647751</link>
            <guid>1366075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fitness trackers solve the accountability problem that derails workout consistency by providing objective data on activity levels, sleep quality and health metrics that self-assessment consistently misjudges. The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 is the company’s most advanced fitness band</strong> through refined sensors, expanded app integration and comprehensive health monitoring that rivals smartwatches costing twice as much.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/">At $99, down from $159, this flagship tracker has hit a record-low price </a>on Amazon for Black Friday while including six months of Fitbit Premium membership that unlocks advanced analytics and personalized guidance. The <strong>38% discount</strong> makes serious fitness tracking accessible to casual exercisers who want data-driven insights without smartwatch complexity or expense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Tracker</h2>
<p>The Bluetooth-enabled heart rate transmission feature means that your<strong> real-time heart rate information</strong> can be directly transferred to compatible exercise equipment in the gym, such as treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bicycles, in order to accurately determine the number of calories that you’ve burned.</p>
<p>The use of your exercise equipment and your personal health tracker means that you don’t have to wear the uncomfortable chest strap monitors offered by the gym, and spin classes are immensely improved when the bike computer shows you your actual heart rate zones, rather than approximate averages.</p>



<p><strong>Integration with the Google app enables you to manage Maps, Wallet, and YouTube Music</strong> right on your wrist. The seamless connectivity offered by the Google ecosystem enables you to access your walking and cycling directions without having to refer to your phone. The functionality also enables you to make contactless payments using your Google Wallet when checking out. The integration with the Google app sets the Charge 6 apart from other models, including the earlier Fitbit models, because they worked in isolation from the technology ecosystem.</p>
<p>The<strong> GPS feature provides mapping and pace analysis for outdoor running, walking, and biking activities</strong> without the need for connectivity, making it possible to exercise using the phone in a phone-free manner. The GPS in the phone works accurately like a running watch using multi-satellite technology that keeps the lock despite tree coverage and buildings. The <strong>maps provided after exercise offer the accurate routes, pace, and zones</strong> corresponding to different segments.</p>



<p><strong>Heart rate monitoring</strong> enables the observation of resting heart rate trends that may signify an improvement in cardiovascular performance and the onset of overtraining, and the feature related to sleeping enables the monitoring and evaluation of light, deep, and REM sleep stages. The optical heart rate sensor provides constant contact using the flexible band, enabling the fitment of different wrists using the provided small and large bands.</p>
<p>The<strong> bundle comes with an included six-month subscription to the service</strong>: This service has several advanced features, such as in-depth sleep tools with personalized advice, exercise plans with different difficulty levels, mindfulness exercises designed for stress relief, and health charts that enable tracking long-term trends. Regular members would have access to readiness scores, which provide an overall readiness indicator through the integration of scores related to their sleeping, activity, and Heart Rate Variability. The cost would be $9.99 a month, and the service would be worth $60.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery duration of a week ensures the use of the tracker continuously and 24/7,</strong> without the need to remove the tracker every night and undergo the process of frequent recharging, like in the case of other smart watches. The battery can be quickly recharged and it takes only about two hours to do so in case it needs recharging, even though the tracker can be recharged on a weekly basis when the user takes a shower.</p>
<p>With the Fitbit Charge 6 at just $99, you get the ability to wireless heart rate broadcast, integration with the Google app, GPS, health monitoring, six months of health and fitness insights through the health and fitness service, and a battery life up to seven days on a charge, all at 38% lower than the usual cost and available on Black Friday.</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> deals are officially here, and right now you'll find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft Physical Edition</a> on PS5 for its lowest price ever. It's discounted to just $25 (was $30), so if you haven't yet played the iconic game, this is a great chance to dive in (or snag it as an affordable gift for a friend or family member). The discount doesn't seem like much, but it comes bundled with 3,500 Tokens, which typically cost $20. This version of Minecraft doesn't see many discounts. It briefly dropped its price by a few bucks during the summer, but this Black Friday deal is the best we've seen. If you're looking for a holiday gift for a younger gamer in your life, this is likely a good choice--just keep in mind this discount only applies to the physical PS5 version.</p><div title="6536428 - Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) (BF2025)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5071" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536428 - Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5) (BF2025)" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Minecraft-PlayStation-5\/dp\/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Minecraft Physical Edition (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Minecraft-PlayStation-5\/dp\/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Minecraft-PlayStation-5/dp/B0DHHH2LHB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$25 (was $30)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>While you'll find <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/212779" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Minecraft</a> for $20 at most digital storefronts, this physical edition deal is actually the better offer.

<p>Support for "GameCube adapters in Wii U mode" also added</p>

<figure data-uuid="d47e43c4fbfc2"><a title="Switch 2 Pro Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d47e43c4fbfc2/switch-2-pro-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>During the original Switch generation, PC gaming giant Valve added Nintendo controller support to its Steam client.</p>
<p>Now that the Switch 2 has arrived on the scene, Valve has issued a Steam Client Beta update for November 2025 that adds support for the new hybrid system's Pro Controller.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Added support for Nintendo Switch 2 controllers connected over USB on Windows"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some more surprising news, Valve has also "added support for GameCube adapters in Wii U mode with rumble on Windows". So, you can now use wired GameCube controllers with this accessory. You can see the official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/599669707226744434">patch notes on the Steam community page</a>.</p>
<p>Steam has previously added support for Nintendo's original Switch Pro Controller. Other Nintendo controllers are also supported on Steam such as the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/08/valves-steam-client-beta-adds-support-for-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers">Joy-Con</a> and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3361392458123611354">Switch Online classic controllers</a>.</p>
<p>In some <em>other</em> controller news, Nintendo recently rolled out updates for its controllers on the Switch 2 following a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/psa-dont-forget-to-update-your-switch-2-pro-controller">major firmware update</a>.</p>

"Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter, which means there are technically several popular games like it, but I've never played a game in the genre that's as unpredictable, thrilling, and--perhaps most surprising of all--hopeful," wrote critic Mark Delaney. "We can all kill each other in Arc Raiders. The fact that most of us are choosing instead to lend a helping hand, if not a sign that humanity will be all right in the real world, at the very least makes for one of the best multiplayer games I've ever played."</p><p>Arc Raiders isn't the only great shooter on sale at Fanatical.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-supplies-amazon-millions-of-galaxy-buds-3-pro-to-clear-stock-now-at-new-all-time-low-2000647746</link>
            <guid>1366033</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple and Samsung battle across smartphones, tablets and increasingly in the wireless earbuds category where both companies push technological boundaries through annual releases. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro compete directly with the new AirPods Pro 3</strong>&nbsp;and matches capabilities in active noise cancellation and AI-powered features that define premium earbuds in 2024.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">$159, down from $249, Samsung’s flagship earbuds</a> undercut Apple’s $249 retail pricing by $90 during Black Friday on Amazon and creates an obvious choice for value-conscious buyers. The decision becomes even clearer for Android smartphone owners who benefit from Samsung’s ecosystem integration that Apple deliberately restricts on non-iOS devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation Capable of Thinking on Its Own</h2>
<p>The <strong>adaptive active noise cancellation powered by Galaxy AI constantly monitors the environment</strong> and changes the strength of the filter on its own, without the need to switch between fixed settings. When you leave the quiet offices and enter the bustling street, the intensity of the noise-cancelling effect changes on its own, and when you enter the restaurant, you are no longer in a bubble. By contrast, the need to switch between different modes on the typical ANC earbuds means you are forced to use the technology in a way that always slightly misses the mark.</p>



<p>The reworked stem-style design and ability to personalize the blade lights help differentiate the product and offer an improved fit over some models in the past lineup, namely the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds, where there was an occasional fit issue related to insecurity when engaging in vigorous dynamic action. The stem style enables leverage, keeping the earbuds in the proper location when running, working out, and engaging in other actions where stemless models are dislodged. The lights help personalize the product through custom color and patterning, reflecting the user’s personality, and making the earbuds themselves rather than the phone the fashion statement.</p>
<p><strong>Sound optimization using the Adaptive Equalizer examines the fit of the earbuds in your ear</strong> and optimizes the audio response. In cases where the audio leaks because the fit isn’t tight, the EQ adds bass, and in cases where the fit is tight, the bass reduces because too much would cause muddy tones. These adjustments occur, in effect, on their own when wearing the earbuds.</p>



<p>The <strong>Real-Time Interpreter feature functions by facilitating the direct conversation</strong> and translation process using the earbuds when interacting with people who don’t speak English, and the translations appear on your phone screen. The use of an AI Real-Time Interpreter feature when traveling internationally gains even less relevance in situations where you need directions, order food, and hold business conversations in foreign languages.</p>
<p>The intuitive touch controls make programming gesture controls available for the functions in accordance with your priorities, rather than adopting the pre-programmed settings provided by Samsung. Customization options include double-tap functionality for triggering the voice assistant, triple-tap functionality for skipping songs, and long press functionality for switching between ANC settings, according to your priority functions.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP57 water and dust resistance offered by the earbuds</strong> protects against the type of perspired moisture in the gym, rain, and accidental splashes, all accomplished without the fear that typically undermines great-sounding earbuds when they come into contact with moisture, driving up the cost of quality earbuds in the first place. The double warranty on the Amazon product protects against typical replacements, double the typical warranty periods and ensures its quality outweighs the cost upfront.</p>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are available on Black Friday at 36% off the regular price and come with Adaptive ANC, AI sound optimization, real-time translations, customizable controls, an IP57 water resistant rating, and a two-year warranty all in a $159 package. The $90 price gap in the AirPods Pro 3, courtesy of Samsung, means there’s no contest here when it comes to choosing the right wireless earbuds.</p>

Well, it’d cost you nearly $1,500 and be called <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.minisforum.com%2Fproducts%2Fminisforum-g1-pro%3Fvariant%3D47325699408117" rel="sponsored">the Minisforum AtomMan G1 Pro</a>.</p><p>Minisforum is one of the only companies shipping such powerful discrete GPUs in mini-PCs, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/minisforum-atomman-g7-pt-mini-pc-review/">its earlier AtomMan G7 PT</a> is the closest thing anyone’s sold to Valve’s own spec. But the new G1 Pro might be a better competitor now it’s got an integrated power supply (like Valve) and even beefier components.</p><p>The most surprising feature is a full but lilliputian desktop graphics card — look how cute it is in the render below! — that fits into the top of the chassis. (Minisforum doesn’t claim it’s upgradable, just FYI, but does boast that it offers the full 145W of power you’d get in other desktop 5060 cards.)</p><p>And, in “Beast Mode,” Minisforum says it can drive the AMD Ryzen 9 8945HX CPU at 100W while that GPU stays at 145W. You also get not one but <em>two</em> M.2 2280 slots for NVMe SSD storage, two SO-DIMM slots for up to 96GB of DDR5 RAM, and <em>five</em> display outputs (2x DP2.1, 1x DP 1.4, and 2x HDMI 2.1) for up to four displays at once.</p><p>It’s on sale now with 32GB and 1TB for $1,440, shipping mid January — which is honestly starting to look like a decent deal now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828337/ram-memory-shortage-crunch-market-prices-central-micro-center">RAM prices are out of control.</a> There’s also a bring-your-own-RAM-and-storage barebones version for $1,040, though it’s not available to order yet.</p><p>Valve still isn’t talking price yet, but I’d hope it’s more affordable than this one. Even so, Valve says it put a lot of work into cooling, noise, and wireless connectivity, and Linux drivers are still more mature on the AMD GPU side of things if you’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/761025/framework-desktop-bazzite-linux-steam-machine-pc-game-console-impressions">considering a Bazzite</a> or SteamOS install. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/828620/linux-benchmarks-bazzite-gamersnexus">GamersNexus’ new video</a> does include Linux benchmarks for desktop RTX 5060, maybe check those out?</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/831106/minisforum-g1-pro-mini-pc-price-release-date]]></content:encoded>
