		<p>Last night’s Xbox Developer Direct stream was pretty good, wasn’t it? I’ve come to enjoy the way that Microsoft presents these, giving the spotlight to a small selection of games that are locked in for the year ahead, and always with one smaller surprise along the way. The most exciting thing was to really see and hear about Playground Games’ take on Fable, though, which looks like it’s going to capture so much of the British charm and whimsy.</p>
<p>But what about the games we can and are playing in the here and now? Well, I’ve made a belated start on Rennsport, setting up my racing wheel to dip a tyre into this racing sim. I’ll have some thoughts to share on it in a review at some point.</p>
<p>We’ll start with Dom this week, who’s been getting his blacksmithing skills up to snuff in Bladesong, enjoying its unusual atmosphere and feel, as well as playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes and Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2 for our reviews. He’s also somehow ended up checking in each day on a new Animal Crossing island. He says “somehow”, but this was totally my fault for needing a buddy to try out the new online features…</p>

<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been hopping around on rocks this week, but has been doing so while embodying an adorable fox and getting lost while playing Spirit of the North 2 with Ade. <strong>Ade</strong>, meanwhile, has mostly been enjoying Marvel Rivals with the launch of Season 6 – “With the launch of season 6, the game is the best it’s ever been. Faster gameplay, silky smooth animation, punchy and responsive combat, and a nerfed Daredevil. For anyone who understandably bounced off the rather rough version of Marvel Rivals we got at launch, it’s definitely worth a revisit.”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> is coming to the end of two games, reaching the summit of Cairn for our upcoming review, and coming to the conclusion of Ghost of Yotei which (and he can’t believe he’s saying it for an open world game) is actually too small.</p>

<p>MIO: Memories in Orbit largely delighted <strong>Aran</strong> for our review this week, with just some frustrating patches getting in the way of a visually stunning and challenging game. Now he’s gone back to Star Wars Outlaws to roam Tatooine, searching for treasure, and making mischief.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has hopped back into Last Epoch this week, and thinks ” it still has the coolest skill system of just about any game I’ve played. Being able to respec constantly is also very soothing for my poor addled brain.”</p>
<p>Playing Xbox but on PS5 is still a bit strange, but it has meant that <strong>Jim</strong> has been able to drop into Sea of Thieves, matchmaking with crews to go on voyages, and experiencing Hellblade 2 this week. “I’m just the past the halfway point and while I enjoyed the opening hour or so, this middle portion has really dragged with boring, drawn out environmental puzzles that act as filler between the occasional bout of combat.”</p>

<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> found it a bit tricky to focus this week with his gaming, jumping into the “shameless RE ripoff” of Ebola Village, bouncing off Quarantine Zone: The Last Check, and loading up Gigasword as a bedtime Steam Deck game. He’s also set to explore the weird world of game streaming soon with some upcoming horror games, so keep an eye out for that.</p>
<p>And we’ll wrap things up with <strong>Miguel</strong>, who’s been playing a bunch of Code Vein 2 for our review next week, a sprinkling of the silly co-op of The Outlast Trials and Peak, and getting his extraction shooter fix with Synduality: Echo of Ada.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

However, we are living in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">very challenging times</strong> for console manufacturers, who must deal with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">current economic situation and<a href="https://wccftech.com/asgard-launches-256-gb-ddr5-memory-kit-at-the-price-of-nvidia-rtx-5090/"> soaring RAM prices</a></strong> as they prepare the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox.</strong></p>



<p>Although neither Sony nor Microsoft has <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">openly addressed the situation,</strong> which is expected to remain challenging for a few years at best, it is very likely to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-industry-as-a-whole-is-concerned-about-ram-availability-heres-why-the-playstation-6-and-xbox-next-could-be-delayed-past-2027-2028/"><strong>impact their next-generation plans significantly</strong></a>. So much so that a known analyst is expecting the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6 to be delayed</strong> from the expected 2027/2028 release date.</p>

While the report looks at Sony's entire operation, including the television and music businesses, the observations on the company's <strong>Gaming Division</strong> are the most interesting.</p>



<p>For the third quarter, Sony's results are <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"expected to beat market expectations, driven by sales of both in-house and third-party games."</em> These results will likely make it easier for Sony to extend the current console generation, as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Sony expects the PlayStation 5's lifecycle to be extended</em>, with the <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">PlayStation 6 likely to be </em><em>"</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">delayed longer than many expected."</em></p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a delay of the next console generation</strong> isn't something we are hearing this month for the first time, the prediction coming from an expert analyst definitely gives more weight to the prospect. However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a longer delay into 2029/2030</strong> or even beyond would make the scenario very peculiar for the console industry, as Sony, and possibly Microsoft, would be sitting on hardware that will be outdated by 2030. </p>



<p>This wouldn't be completely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">unprecedented</strong>, given that the Nintendo Switch 2 successfully launched in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/"><strong>later than even NVIDIA expected</strong></a>, and without cutting-edge technology, but it would still be new for both Sony and Microsoft. And under current conditions, it will likely be preferable to delay new systems rather than release them at a very high price that wouldn't make them compelling to the price-savvy console audience.</p>

            <p>The surprise game reveal at last night’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fables-evil-landlords-wont-grow-devil-horns-as-reboot-ditches-classic-character-morphing-due-to-a-lack-of-belief-in-objective-arseholery">Xbox Developer Direct</a> was Kiln, a pottery-based multiplayer party brawler in the works at Double Fine. Combatants take the form of pots, vases, dishes, and urns, custom-sculpted and fired by players themselves, and will usually end up smashed into shards of tragic ceramic in the following online slapfights. Or maybe not, as there’s apparently nothing stopping you from simply playing Kiln as a nonviolent pottery sim by sticking to its clay-shaping component alone.</p>
<p>"The whole pottery part is such that it grabs people who might not want to jump into a multiplayer game," project lead Derek Brand explained to Microsoft’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/kiln-developer-direct-double-fine-hands-on-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>. "Some people just want to try pot making."</p> <figure>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi0iRV0U3VY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Judging from the reveal trailer, there is something enticingly simple about Kiln’s brown goop manipulation. I’ve only tried the real thing once and ended up with a crap bowl, but the two-button pulling and squeezing system that Kiln brings to the spinny table is clearly designed to make crafting finer vessels much easier. Regardless of whether or not you’re being canoodled by Patrick Swayze.</p>
<p>Sponges and scrapers are on hand for adding texture, and there’s also a selection of handles, glazes, and decorative patterns to adorn your pots with. Offbrand Le Creuset or offbrand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-kind-of-pot-is-elden-rings-pot-boy-we-asked-an-expert">Iron Fist Alexander</a>? That’s up to you.</p>
<p>Brand did add that Kiln will at least try to tempt pacifist potters into the game’s fighty side, saying "...if we can, we just slowly ease them into the 'I want to punch something now with this pot.' We don’t want it to be a hard shift from those two things." Those who heed the call will join objective-led punchups where the design of their pots affects how they perform on the battlefield: tall vases, for instance, can carry more water (useful for the 4v4 'Quench' mode where the aim is to douse the enemy team’s oven) but move slower and, because of their height, are less stable when they move.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Double Fine</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Small plates, meanwhile, lack carrying capacity, but can unleash a special attack in which they bounce between enemies, chipping into them with sharp-edged rims. There are 24 of these moves in total, each dependent on a finished pot’s shape, and applying varying degrees of logic: sculpting a versatile mid-sized pot lets it shower enemies in a harmful rain of popcorn.</p>
<p>Yeah, I dunno. Do I have to put my pots in such mortal danger? I think I’d like my pots. Let my pots be, Kiln.</p>
<p>It’s out sometime in Spring 2026, PC and Game Pass included, and <a href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/sign-up-for-the-kiln-beta">beta playtest signups are open now</a>. Dedicated Double Fine followers may already be familiar with Kiln’s general homeware warfare angle, as it appeared as a prototype during the company’s Amnesia Fortnight game jam – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd7riA8vb8h1kP3jCFS_qtTM">broadcast on YouTube</a> – all the way back in 2017. It’s evidently struck a more colourful, jolly tone than that of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVJCxk5VDvA">original pitch</a>, though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doublefine.com/post/3md2bsg7k6k2u">Double Fine’s Bluesky account</a> says it’s stayed free of generative AI in the intervening years.</p>

<p>2026 is set to be a mammoth year for gaming, and Xbox Game Pass subscribers have plenty to look forward to with their subscription, as a host of new releases are dropping day one.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s approach of having all first-party titles available on the launch day with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription has proven to be a solid move, and there’s a stacked list of titles coming this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Japan is the host of Forza Horizon 6. The racing game is going back to its roots with its gameplay, but the series continues to evolve where accessibility and playability are concerned. Forza Horizon 6 platforms are an interesting one, so it’s time to check which consoles it’s coming to.</p>



<p>Hello, Horizon! Playground Games has its hands in many pies, but it’s hard to picture a time when the developer isn’t working on some type of Horizon content. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-revealed-at-tokyo-game-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 was revealed at Tokyo Game Show</a>, and it made all the sense in the world, considering the game’s setting.</p>



<p>So, let’s start building toward the game’s big-time release with a breakdown of consoles and platforms.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-ps4-amp-ps5-status-explained">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On PlayStation? PS4 &amp; PS5 Status, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Racing toward the finish. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed that Forza Horizon 6 will be on PlayStation 5 consoles after launch, but there will not be room for a PS4 port.</strong></p>



<p>FH6 on PlayStation is two-fold: On one hand, there’s no last-gen port, but this was expected. Whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-coming-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 is coming to PS5 post-launch</a> and won’t be a day-one game for PlayStation like other platforms.</p>



<p>Firstly, the 2025 Forza Horizon 5 PlayStation port only arrived on PS5, not PS4. It’s likely due to the PlayStation 4 just not having the power to process the size and seismic levels of polish the game features. With FH6 expected to be bigger and better, a PS4 port was never happening.</p>



<p>Secondly, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-6-playstation-5-release-window-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6 PlayStation 5 release window has been confirmed</a>, so we all know it’s happening. You just might have to wait a while.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-xbox-xbox-one-status-explained">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On Xbox? Xbox One Status, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 being on Xbox is a no-brainer, but this time, the new Forza game is on Xbox Series X|S, and there will be no Xbox One port.</strong></p>



<p>This one might be a kicker. FH5 will likely be the final Forza game on Xbox One, as Microsoft has moved on and is only developing Forza Horizon 6 for the Xbox Series X|S. A day-one launch for FH6 on Xbox Series X|S is happening, so you can pre-order now, but Xbox One owners need to upgrade their console to play.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-pc">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On PC?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Vroom. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There will also be a Forza Horizon 6 PC release alongside the Xbox Series X|S launch.</strong></p>



<p>PC players really do get the best of everything (If you ignore the endless performance issues). Forza Horizon 6 buyers can acquire it on launch day for PCs—if you meet the demanding specs.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-nintendo-switch-amp-switch-2-status-explained">Will Forza Horizon 6 Be On Nintendo? Switch &amp; Switch 2 Status, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Whereas some platforms get a mixed bag, it’s a big no for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 players with a Forza Horizon 6 release.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation and Xbox divide is almost non-existent now. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/year-in-review-2025-is-the-year-the-console-wars-ended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console wars are basically over</a>, but a line is drawn between Nintendo and everyone else. The Japanese company is an independent monster that can’t stop rolling in cash every year. There’s no reason for Mario or Zelda to come to Nintendo unless the company suddenly nosedives into an unimaginable crisis.</p>



<p>While many third-party games are on the Switch 2, you won’t find Forza Horizon 6 making the drive.</p>



<p>What do you make of Forza Horizon 6’s platforms? Is it a good thing that a PS5 port is coming? Is it also sad that the Xbox One is no longer considered?

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Earlier this week, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelled six games, delayed seven more, and closed three studios in Halifax, Canada and Stockholm</a>, as part of efforts to "right-size" the ship under Commodore Tencent by chucking a lot of people and projects into the sea. I do not need to tell you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a> was not one of the cancelled projects. Cats and dogs will be getting married before Ubisoft cancel Beyond Good and Evil 2 - a game announced 17 years ago, which has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-staff-up-for-captivating-beyond-good-evil-2-but-we-both-know-theyre-just-going-to-hurt-us-again">survived many rounds</a> of key departures, scandals, tragedies and cost-cutting. Ubisoft's latest public reasoning for not abandoning BG&amp;E2 is that it's an open world game, and their new corporate strategy is to focus on open world and live service games.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft are restructuring around five mildly Shakespearean "Creative Houses", according to a broad remit of  "transforming Ubisoft's operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences", <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">in the words</a> of CEO Yves Guillemot. 
</p>
<p>
The main "Creative House", Vantage Studios, is "focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft's largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands" - specifically, Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six. The other four are dedicated to "competitive and cooperative shooter experiences", "select, sharp Live experiences", "casual and family-friendly games", and "immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes". BG&amp;E is filed under the latter.
</p>
<p>
Speaking as somebody who loved the original Beyond Good &amp; Evil - which I've previously and not quite accurately labelled an open world game, despite it being more of an Ocarina of Time-style hubworld affair with peripheral dungeons - I'm happy in principle that Beyond Good &amp; Evil will continue. But as ever, you do have to wonder why. The sequel has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/">reportedly</a> cost over half a billion dollars, making it one of the most expensive videogames ever developed, and I can't imagine it recovering the cash. Anecdotally, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-online-world-of-space-pirates">the last proper trailer back in 2017</a> confused as many people as it enthralled.
</p><p>
Still, Ubisoft are plugging on with it. "As mentioned in yesterday's press release, Beyond Good &amp; Evil will be part of Creative House 4, dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321">Kotaku</a> in a statement, following this week's bout of corporate surgery. "Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains a priority for us in the context of our strategy centered around Open World Adventures."
</p>
<p>
I'm no Scientist of Money, but I feel like the real reason for Ubisoft not cancelling BG&amp;E2 at this stage is a basic question of accounting. Right now they can report it to their investors as an asset, i.e. something that can bring in cash. If they cancel it, they'll have to take a massive write-off. So it's better to finish and release it, even if it doesn't sell what they want it to sell.
</p>
<p>
Again speaking as somebody who isn't a Scientist of Money, I reckon the obvious and cheapest way to boost the game's chances is to stop calling it Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. Presenting something as a sequel naturally risks advertising only to those who played the first, and people have literally been born and had children since the first game came out in 2003. Even allowing for the release of a BG&amp;E remaster, today's young 'uns likely know little of Jade and Uncle Pey'j. So I would just call it Beyond Good &amp; Evil (202X). Or something more targeted, such as Cockney Cybermonkeys Online: An Open World Game From The Assassin's Creed Folks.

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Wireless Gaming Controller (2025) Gets Restocked at Its Lowest Price of the Year, Headed for Another Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-wireless-gaming-controller-2025-gets-restocked-at-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-headed-for-another-clearance-2000662378</link>
            <guid>1414078</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Controllers can make or break your gaming experience. After all, you rely on these gadgets to find your way around in digital worlds, fight battles, explore, and more. If you’re experiencing persistent stick drift, poor connectivity, and unresponsiveness from your current option, it’s time for an upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">Right now, you can grab the latest Xbox wireless gaming controller in carbon black at a sweet 25% discount for $49.</a> Several other options are discounted too, but the prices may vary. For instance, the stunning Heart Breaker version with vibrant patterns is sitting at $59, while the Shock Blue option is going for $52.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gives You a Competitive Edge</h2>
<p>The controller features a modern design with sculpted surfaces and refined geometry for enhanced comfort during gameplay. Textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case make it easy to lock onto targets and stay on them, while the new hybrid D-pad offers incredibly accurate yet familiar input that gives you a competitive edge. Additionally, if the standard layout doesn’t quite work for you, or you simply want more control over the way you play, you can also customize button mappings with the Xbox Accessories app. It lets you tweak controls according to your playstyle, offering accessibility and increased comfort, which can eventually lead to better performance.</p>
<p>Those who like to show cool in-game moves and strategies off will appreciate the new Share button, too. With this, you can take screenshots and record with just a single click. There’s a 3.5mm audio headset jack to connect headphones for easier communication, as well.</p>



<p>Compatibility-wise, the controller plays nicely with Windows, Android, iOS, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and VR Headsets. You have the option to plug in directly via the USB-C port for a quick setup, or go wireless using Bluetooth for cable-free gaming across all your favorite devices. Maybe use it with your console for gaming on the go, and switch to a bigger screen when you want to enjoy a more immersive gaming experience, especially with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">The console is now down to just $49, after Amazon knocked a nice $16 off its retail price.</a> Several colors are going for less, so there are options to choose from. You can pick the one that best fits your gaming aesthetics. It’s important to note that the discount is only around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last more than a day, so it’s best to grab it as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we can’t guarantee that the controller will be this affordable again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy Entertainment has spoken out to defend its publishing deal for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/alan-wake-ii">Alan Wake 2</a>, which saw the game launch on PC exclusively via the Epic Games Store. More than two years later, there's still no sign of it coming to rival storefront Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released in October 2023, Alan Wake 2 took a year to eventually begin generating royalties for Remedy, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-tops-2-million-sales-and-finally-starts-turning-a-profit">after ticking over the 2 million sales mark</a>. Now, a debate has been sparked over its sales — which would undoubtedly be higher if it had also arrived on Steam, even if the game only exists because of Epic Games cash — as well as the benefits of storefront exclusives.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Discussion was sparked on social media by a lengthy <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/2013963017197691329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> from Michael Douse, director of publishing at Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity studio Larian. "I understand Epic entirely funded Alan Wake 2 but this altruistic pro-developer talk doesn't sit well when Remedy seemingly went into financial crisis because they couldn't tap Steam for AW2 sales suffering potentially hundreds of millions in lost revenue," Douse wrote.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not that they need the money but a % take to Epic could've recouped dev costs + more. Competition is good, and important, but it is difficult to buy the message when there are demonstrable cases of games underperforming as a result of the tactic."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initially, Douse had been replying to a <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/2013717881431769340" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> by Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney, who noted that "Epic and Steam compete for each customer and each sale." Sweeney continued: "On some transactions, Epic wins. On more, Steam wins. But one thing is constant on every transaction: gamers and developers win by having more options and better deals."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing his response, Douse characterized the Epic Games' ambitions for its PC storefront as resting on "their ability to convert hundreds of millions of Fortnite players into mid-hardcore premium gamers," tempted by giveaways of free PC titles. "I don't see the Fortnite brand attempting to do that," Douse continued. "So it's like 🤷‍♀️ Maybe if there was a shit-hot Untreal Tournament.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Apple &amp; Google stores spent a decade devaluing games &amp; apps to a point where it is largely impossible to sell a premium game there in a way that doesn't massively devalue it on other systems. Giving everyone everything for free might bump numbers but doesn't create a viable storefront from which to sell premium experiences."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Alan Wake II - Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Douse's thread caught the attention of Remedy itself, who then replied with the following <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/2014375181507047630" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Hi. There would be no Alan Wake 2 without Epic Publishing. The publishing deal with Epic was very fair to Remedy.

Epic Games was, and is, an excellent partner to us.

            <title><![CDATA[26 of the biggest PS5 games coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/23/26-of-the-biggest-ps5-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1414063</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>What are the biggest PS5 games coming out in 2026? It’s a busy year ahead that will feature a bunch of first party exclusives like Marvel’s Wolverine, plenty of Xbox-published games like Fable and Forza Horizon, and will build up to the juggernaut launch of Grand Theft Auto VI in November.</p>
<p>There’s tons of games on the way, but we’ve tried to pare it back to just the biggest launches.&nbsp;We’re breaking this list into two parts, starting off with games that already have scheduled launch dates, with most of those set to arrive in the first half of 2026 because of that, before switching gears for the games coming to PS5 that are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<h2>Scheduled Game Launches</h2>
<h3>Code Vein 2</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 30th January 2025</em></p>


<p>The anime soulslike returns, with Bandai Namco looking to follow up on the popularity and success of the 2019 original. They’re stepping into a much more hotly contested genre than they were last time, but that allows them to burrow down into what specifically made their first game well regarded, and expand and improve on other ideas.</p>
<p><iframe title="Code Vein 2 Preview –&nbsp;Anime Soulslike of Future Past" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FxZSqlaieMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So let’s start with what worked. The AI companions are returning, but this time they’re heroes from the past that you are jumping back in time to fight alongside and seeking to really learn their backstory and lives. They’ll fight alongside you, but you can also now absorb their essence to power up your core character, which is great when the AI behaviours got on a few players’ nerves in the past. This one’s out really soon, so keep an eye out for our review!</p>

<p><em>Catch our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/05/code-vein-ii-preview-anime-soulslike-of-future-past/">Code Vein 2 preview </a>from the start of this year here.</em></p>
<h3>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, NSW, PC –&nbsp;5th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Square Enix know a thing or seventy-two about remastering their classics, and it feels like every remake and remaster takes a different approach to the visuals and gameplay changes. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Adventure Log Part 1 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtcnET6lQwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too. Absolutely one to watch for classic JRPG fans.</p>

<h3>Nioh 3</h3>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 6th February 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> was revealed back in June which came with a timed PS5 demo. The third entry to the series refreshes things again with a new protagonist and updated combat. The main character for Nioh 3 is Tokugawa Takechiyo, the now former Shogun who was forced from the top of the Shogunate by his brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu. Tokugawa Kunimatsu hasn’t wasted time by transforming the country into a Yokai infested hellscape either.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Nioh 3 has two major changes compared to the previous games. First is the more open world structure, referred to as Open Field by Koei Tecmo, and the second is the Ninja combat stance that can be used alongside the Samurai stance. Where Samurai is all about is about facing off against enemies using high, medium, and low stances to attack and counter, Ninja is about a more hit and run approach to strike quickly and efficiently. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be a great third entry and we don’t have long to wait for its release.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">Catch our hands on preview of Nioh 3 here</a>.</em></p>
<h3>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 12th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Of the many branches of the Yakuza / Like a Dragon franchise, some of the most popular games are the Kiwami remakes. With the series’ origins on PS2, Yakuza Kiwami and Kiwami 2 were great efforts to spruce up the acclaimed originals and bring them to a much broader global audience at the same time. Now, having branched off in various new directions, they’re tackling the first game to release on PS3 with Yakuza Kiwami 3.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties | Demo Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vtv7LzYLwc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But wait, there’s more to this than before, and in addition to remaking a chapter in Kazuma’s life (and expanding it with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-adds-a-new-bad-boy-dragon-mode/">a Bad Boy Dragon mode</a>), there’s a new Dark Ties side story, which sees Yoshitaka Mine trying to bolster his reputation and rise through the ranks. This is a fresh side-story to the main Yakuza 3 tale, but RGG has now revealed the Hell’s Arena underground fight club that you can dive into. Your goal is to dive into 1v1 Hellish Brawls and perilous races to avoid hunters through a treasure-filled dungeon in Survival Hell.</p>
<p>Need this in your life sooner than later? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/a-yakuza-kiwami-3-demo-is-rolling-out-today/">Grab the Yakuza Kiwami 3 demo</a>, which is live now on all platforms!</p>
<h3>Styx: Blades of Greed</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The grubby, sneaky little goblin is back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> this year with a new obsession driving him forward. He seeks the power of the Quartz to give him a bunch of new abilities, and to strike back at the humans and elves that would oppress him and his kind. That makes him sound like an altruist, but he’s always just been out for himself, really.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou-Wox_h1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>
<h3>Tides of Tomorrow</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 24th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is an ambitious game which weaves a single player and multiplayer experience together to shape its narrative. The world is already an unpredictable mess in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> where deadly plastification is threatening to kill every living thing. It’s a troubling situation made worse by living in a post-apocalyptic flooded world, but as you’re rescued from drowning, you aren’t the first who is given the chance to shape its future. This innovative narrative sees you follow in the footsteps of another player, whose journey through the game’s story before you has left its mark with a rippling impact that can dramatically change what you encounter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tides of Tomorrow - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVjNGNZcqHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tides of Tomorrow, you will have to navigate the water world of Elynd which is filled with various characters that have jobs and tasks for you to complete. You will have to make decisions that will not only impact your own path, but that of others too with your actions impacting their game worlds. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow Preview,</a>&nbsp;Stefan said, “Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs.” Tides of Tomorrow could prove to be one of the most ambitious narratives of 2026.</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Requiem</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 27th February 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s time for another fresh reinvention of the Resident Evil franchise, kicking off a new story arc, introducing new characters, and shifting the tone of the horror once more. Our new leading lady, Grace Ashcroft might be an FBI agent, but she’s woefully unprepared to face the horrors awaiting her in the Renwood Hotel, the same hotel in which her mother was murdered, dragging her back to Resident Evil’s original stomping ground of Raccoon City.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview – First person frights, third person delights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But there’s another side to Requiem, as Leon will also return to the game, his story intertwined with Grace’s, letting her handle all the tense psychological horror, while Leon will be handling all the gory action.</p>
<p>We went hands on with Resident Evil Requiem last summer, delving into its creepy horror-filled delights. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/">See our preview here.</a></p>
<h3>Marathon</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 5th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Bungie’s extraction shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/marathon">Marathon</a> reboot has already been through the wringer of public opinion, with the public tests last year forcing the studio to delay their planned launch and rework significant parts of the experience. But where many once questioned if an extraction shooter could hit the mainstream, the huge success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">ARC Raiders</a> last year has buoyed interest and optimism for Bungie’s take on the genre.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pre-Order Trailer | Marathon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Key changes since last year include the introduction of proximity voice chat, a new solo runner queue and solo scavenger character type, and upgrades to the visual fidelity across the board. Leaning further into the scavenging gameplay, opening up the avenues for greater ad hoc player collaboration, and extending the game’s distinctive art direction should make this pretty attractive. Once to keep an eye on!</p>
<h3>Toxic Commando</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 12th March 2026</em></p>
<p>John Carpenter loves himself some zombies, and while a little unexpected, it is pretty neat to have the 70s and 80s action film icon and master of the held note synth soundtrack attach his name to a new co-op zombie shooter. Not only that, but it’s partnering with Saber Interactive, who know a thing or two about making giant hordes of enemies for you to shoot down!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="John Carpenter's Toxic Commando - Release Date Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/svWU-rezMu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/25/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-preview-world-war-z-with-a-side-of-roadcraft/">our hands on time with Toxic Commando last year</a>, there’s a wild hodgepodge of Saber’s previous games and ideas being brought together for this game. Yes, you have the big WWZ-style zombie hordes and defensive set pieces, but they’re now taking place in open world sandbox zones, and there’s some MudRunner and RoadCraft style vehicle mechanics at play too. A curious one, but once you add co-op to the mix, there’s always fun to be had.</p>
<h3>Crimson Desert</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with a huge open world to explore and a plethora of bosses to battle against. You’ll step into the role of Kliff, a member of the Greymanes, who has been ambushed and fails to fight back against the Black Bears. Managing to survive, there’s a sweeping adventure ahead, spanning the continent of Pywel.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/">I got to play the game last summer</a>, sampling a few of the boss battles, saying “We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.”</p>
<h3>Pragmata</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 24th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally thought to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> is a new sci-fi action adventure from the Monster Hunter and Street Fighter publisher. You play as Hugh and Diana, an astronaut and his android companion looking to uncover the mysteries of a lunar research station that has been overrun by hostile artificial intelligence. The protagonists have a symbiotic relationship that weaves its way into Pragmata’s combat, navigation, and puzzle-solving gameplay with Hugh doing the heavy lifting as Diana employs her hacking abilities right in the middle of battle.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pragmata World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A6YCL6UW1lI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To explain what that’s all about, we went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/26/hands-on-pragmata-exploring-the-enigmatic-lunar-hacking-shooter/">hands on with Pragmata</a> last year, writing in our preview of the curious blend of hacking and shooting gameplay, “Hacking enemies becomes a vital part of combat right away, as it’s used to open up their armour and expose weaknesses for you to blast away at with Hugh’s guns. This is far from a simple button tap, or even a button hold, but rather throws up a minigame for you to complete to launch the hack at the targeted enemy.”</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/pragmata-release-date-confirmed-and-its-coming-to-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo/">a demo currently available on PC</a>, which will hopefully make its way to consoles ahead of its launch this Spring.</p>
<h3>Saros</h3>
<p><em>PS5 – 20th April 2026</em></p>
<p>When something works why change the formula too much? That seems to be Housemarque’s thinking behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal’s</a> successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>. A time loop roguelike third person shooter where progress is made by repeating runs and pushing forward each time as you learn more about the world. While the gameplay is similar the story and characters are all new.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saros follows the story of Arjun Devraj, played by Rahul Kohli, a team leader of the Soltari Enforcers who have been sent to this planet. The planet is already hostile enough but the dying sun and time loop issue is stretching patience between the team. The story here will appear to focus on the stress of the time loop on Arjun and the rest of his team.</p>
<h3>007: First Light</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 27th May 2026</em></p>
<p>While we still wait on the news on who will be the next James Bond for the films, we don’t have to wait much longer for IO Interactive’s take on the most famous of spies, even if the game has been delayed to May. 007: First Light is IO Interactive’s most ambitious games, taking on the mantle of crafting a new Bond story while using lessons learned from its highly acclaimed Hitman games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="007 First Light: Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTUoIyTMw0Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bond is not yet the globe trotting super spy we all know, but a young agent still earning his reputation and having to work as part of a team. The mission is to take down 009 who has gone rogue, using MI6’s own tactics against them. Bond is a loose cannon who will do things his own way to get the job done, even if it doesn’t please others in the organisation. The game will feature spycraft, shootouts, and driving ( a first for IO Interactive) with each taking inspiration from the 007 books and movies.</p>
<h3>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 29th May 2026</em></p>
<p>Arkham is likely to be a significant part of our next game on the list too, but any horrors here won’t scare our protagonist so easily. LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight is going to be the biggest LEGO Batman game both in scope and depth. This is a celebration of all things Batman from the very beginning to his most modern iterations, with a Gotham City that moves with the times and is open to exploration however you see fit.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5ha2VwHJCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-gets-a-new-trailer-stuffed-with-villains-and-heroes/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> draws from a history of Batman comics, shows, and movies to celebrate Batman, the Bat-family, and the villains that have all become iconic characters in their own right. The game itself will move through different generations, with key moments from the different eras providing a foundation for the game’s story. The story is not going to be the sole focus, with the open world Gotham City providing plenty of opportunities for Batman to stop criminals.</p>
<h3>Grand Theft Auto VI</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S – 19th November 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a> is inevitably going to be the biggest game of whatever year it eventually releases in. Once upon a time we expected it to arrive in 2025, but two delays through last year now have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">the release date penned in for this November</a>. Will Rockstar manage to hit this latest target? You have to hope so!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI takes us all back to Vice City for Rockstar’s latest crime opera, and from what little we’ve seen of the game so far, it looks like they’re fully embracing all the wild excess and craziness that you’d expect from a fictionalised rendition of Miami and the Florida Keys. It looks like this will be a bit of a modern-day Bonnie &amp; Clyde style story with its two protagonists. Lucia Caminos is the series’ first female lead, who’s coming fresh out of a stint in prison, while Jason Duval is working for the local drug gangs. The pair are thrust together after a failed bank robbery, and are then swept up in a grand conspiracy.</p>
<div>
<p>Of course, then there’s whatever GTA Online morphs into for this game…</p>

<h2>Release Date To Be Announced</h2>
<h3>Marvel’s Wolverine</h3>
<p><em>PS5 – Second half of 2026</em></p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-1-marvels-wolverine/">most wanted game of 2026</a> is all about a grizzled old Canadian who just wants to be left alone. Insomniac Games are branching away from the mouthy web-slinging of Spider-Man and embracing the slicing and dicing of Adamantium claws that Wolverine offers.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Marvel’s Wolverine looks set to be the grittiest, most mature game the studio has worked on since the Resistance trilogy on PlayStation 3. It wouldn’t make sense to try and sanitise a comic book character so steeped in violence and bloodshed, but while we’ve yet to see a full combat demo, it’s hard to imagine Insomniac passing up the opportunity to craft another clever, layered web of gameplay mechanics which embodies what the lead character is best known for.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to see more!</p>
<h3>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</h3>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> was one of the biggest surprises announced in 2025. A 4v4 tag team fighter is not something that anyone was expecting for Marvel, Sony and Arc System Works to collaborate on, but from the first glimpses of gameplay, it looks amazing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Arc System Works has hosted a closed beta so players could try it out, but the team has been quiet on who else will be on the roster. We still only have the initial eight from the announcement trailer with those being Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Miss Marvel, Star Lord, Ghost Rider, Dr Doom, and Storm. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too long to get a release date and more roster reveals in 2026.</p>
<h3>Control Resonant</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Remedy Entertainment might have stumbled last year with their Control spin-off FBC: Firebreak, but their full sequel to the 2019 hit looks like it will get them right back on track. Control Resonant brings us much more of a melee focus to the combat, while embracing and furthering the trippy, twisted environments that you’ll be fighting supernatural forces in.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="CONTROL Resonant – Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WhQm-ExRz60?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having previously been contained within The Oldest House, malevolent forces have now spread out into Manhattan, reshaping the world and breaking down the laws of physics and reality as it goes. With Jesse having gone missing, it’s up to her brother Dylan to step up, awaken new powers within himself, and fight back.</p>
<h3>Star Wars Zero Company</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>Do you want a Star Wars-themed XCOM? Because that’s what Star Wars Zero Company promises to be. Coming from XCOM veterans at their new studio Bit Reactor, Zero Company is set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, the announcement trailer showcased an intriguing mix of characters, including a clone trooper, Mandalorian warrior and at least one rogue Jedi Padawan, pulled together by former Republic officer Hawks.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC 2026</em></p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/10/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review/">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a> will be celebrating its eighth anniversary later this year. It’s also hard to imagine that 2026 will see yet another reincarnation of gaming’s favourite gunslinging archaeologist, first appearing in a remake of Lara Croft’s original adventure.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-reimagines-laras-original-adventure/">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</a> will offer a complete modernisation of the first game, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5 and starring new lead actress, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also take lead in next year’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/tomb-raider-catalyst-legacy-of-atlantis/">Tomb Raider: Catalyst</a>.</p>
<h3>Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In October, the once unthinkable finally happened. Microsoft’s flagship <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo franchise was confirmed to be coming to PlayStation for the first time</a>. What had long been a key part of Microsoft’s strategy to draw players to its hardware over PlayStation, is now going multiplatform with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a full on remake of the original Halo campaign with new gameplay tweaks and content. As the name suggests it will not feature any competitive PvP multiplayer, but Halo: Campaign Evolved will have two player local co-op and four player online co-op. It will also feature three new prequel missions, new enemies, more weapons including the Halo 2’s Battle Rifle, and more vehicles.</p>
<h3>Directive 8020</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>Where Supermassive spun out the first series of The Dark Pictures anthology games in rapid succession, the wait for the new generation of the studio’s horror games is extending into 2026. Yet we’re still very keen to see how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> comes together.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Directive 8020 | Gamescom 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dmqh6m7vSBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in Supermassive’s series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship. The game is really pushing Supermassive’s breed of horror into action game territory, the sci-fi setting, the tight third person control and needing to stealthily sneak and evade the alien monster that’s hunting you.</p>
<h3>Warhammer 40,000 Boltgun 2</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was heralded as a great return to form for the boomer shooter form, getting critical acclaim and commercial success. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has already got high expectations placed upon its shoulders, and what we know of it so far seems to promise a lot more action without sacrificing much of what made Boltgun great.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Character Reveal Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43jjsBVarPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 gives us two protagonists to play as, Sternguard Veteran Malum Caedo and Sister of Battle, Nyra Veyrath. Each has their own playstyle so you can try new ways of taking on enemies as you travel through a hive city and mangrove swamps. The story will also have a branching narrative with each choice taking you to different levels, meaning you may have to play through a few times to see everything. On top of that there are new enemy units to engage in combat with including Bloodletters ,Juggernauts and other new enemies from different factions. Boltgun 2 is going to be a bigger and louder experience than its predecessor, but we will have to wait and see if it is better.</p>
<h3>Fable</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>More than half a decade since its announcement, Playground Games’ Fable reboot / sequel is finally set to launch in 2026, and it looks incredible. You start your adventure as a child growing up in Briar Hill, when your heroic powers start to emerge just as the townspeople are all turned to stone. From there, you venture forth into the open world of Albion and can adventure to solve the dangers that threaten this fantasy world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Fable - Gameplay Teaser | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_4zJJSEm1ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But what has always made Fable special is the freedom to do what you want between adventuring. Playground Games has made 1,000 people to inhabit this world, all of whom are fully voices, and all of whom can and will have opinions on you. What you do will affect how they react to you, and when you can be a bigamist with a bunch of spouses and dozens of children, or buy up all the property in the world and become a benevolent or cruel landlord, those opinions are going to change pretty dramatically. Morality is here, but it’s more subjective and personal than ever before.</p>
<h3>Forza Horizon 6</h3>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 19th May | PS5 – Late 2026</em></p>
<p>The excellent open world arcade racing of Forza Horizon is heading to Japan – easily the most requested destination for any long-running open world game series. Forza Horizon 6 promises the biggest map to race around yet, both in terms of the footprint of the world, and in terms of what it contains. There’s a sprawling rendition of Tokyo here with multiple districts, each of which has its own particular look and style.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Gameplay Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWw-UENvdTw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s another rags to driving riches journey here, as you race your way to the top of the Horizon Festival, but after Horizon 4 and 5, Playground has sought to rejig the progression you’ll see, the balance of the vehicles, improve their handling, and much more. We’re really keen to see what this next step means for the series.</p>
<h3>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h3>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA 2026</em></p>
<p>It has been 20 years since the release of the last mainline Onimusha game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is going to bring that long absence to an end. While games have changed in 20 years, it looks like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will retain its identity as a third person action game where you face off against demons in Japan. You will be able to cut through enemies using your sword and absorb different orbs that can replenish your health, your energy attack, and give you experience. A new black orb will provide pivotal story points.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword Preview – Slicing through this samurai revival" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will take place in Kyoto during the Edo period where peace is shattered as the demonic Genma launch an attack. The only one who can fight this infestation is Miyamoto Musashi due to being bonded to an Oni Gauntlet. If you are worried about having to catch up with Onimusha lore, don’t be. Onimusha: Way of the Sword is essentially a fresh start for the series, which ties into the story it’s shaping up to tell.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-preview-slicing-through-this-samurai-revival/">Catch our hands on preview of Onimusha: Way of the Sword here</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>Phew! That’s a lot of big games! Keep your eyes glued to TheSixthAxis for reviews of this lot as they drop, and news, previews and more details as they emerge through the year.</em></p>

            <p>The character morphing system which has facilitated many a dickhead protagonist sprout devil horns and red eyes in the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a>s isn't in Playground Games reboot, which is set to arrive this autumn. As to why they've opted not to bring back the chance to grow a halo or be beset by baldness due to your bastardry, the studio say it's a matter of opting for more regionally-focused reputation system and aiming to mirror "the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today".</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground">IGN</a> following a hornless first in-depth look at Fable during last night's Xbox Developer Direct, Playground founder and general manager Ralph Fulton confirmed that your character's appearance won't change in line where their choices indicate their moral compass to be pointing.</p>
<p>In reimagining how morality works for the reboot, Fulton said Playground have leant more into "shades of gray", while still trying to remain faithful to the spirit of the original games. "It's more about the subjectivity of morality that honestly we see in the world today," he explained. "There's no objective good, there's no objective evil. You couldn't get everyone in the world to agree that something is evil or something is good. That just doesn't happen. That diversity of opinion I think is really clear these days."</p><p>The classic Fables played around with the idea that you could be a cartoonish arch-bastard who slaughters villages and swears at babies just for the hell of it or an arch-paragon who spends every waking hour flitting around helping folks and complimenting their hairdos. In the reboot, Fulton said that "you're never that thing, absolutely". That's not to say you won't be heckled in the street by Albion's residents due to your reputation for dickheadedness or saintliness, but the reboot handles this in a fashion that treats different regions or towns as more isolated bastions where you can be viewed differently.</p>
<p>Going to a new locale is designed to offer you a blank slate, with the effects of things you've done to piss off folks in other places not colouring how your new neighbours see you. As such, you can be loved in certain areas and reviled in others. "You couldn't do that if you walked in with horns and a trident," in Fulton's estimation. "Your reputation would precede you in that instance. And honestly, that ability to be completely in control of your identity and thus what people think of you felt more important to us than that legacy feature."</p>
<p>While the regional reputation system sounds like it could certainly be plenty of fun in a fashion I'm going to compare to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> because I'm a white guy in my mid-twenties and nothing else immediately springs to mind, I do think there might be something lost in ditching the wonderful ridiculousness of the morphing system. Sure, people can't not notice you've got devil horns, but that's where the fun of developing the ability to convince or trick folks into thinking your horns are just some harmless physical quirk you've inherited could come in. </p>
<p>In a similar mould, the game's showing at the Developer Direct mentioned the consequence of a choice over whether or to kill the giant Richard Ayode you run into early on being that his corpse can end up driving down house prices. My first thought was that it'd be cool if there are things you can do to double down and solve that issue, while inevitably creating others. For example, maybe you covertly manage to have the body's flesh baked into pies. You then sell these to the villagers, and the house prices go back up. But, you're left with a settlement of folks who either hate you because they've found out what you made them do, or start to develop a bit of a taste for their fellow flesh-haver in a fashion that makes you wonder if you should buy an extra lock for your nearby mansion. The latter consequence could also result in all of the town's livestock suddenly deciding they like you a bit more.</p><p>The way new Fable's handcrafted world full of named NPCs was presented in this showcase certainly suggests it could still have plenty of those sorts of in-depth interactions regardless of its approach to morality. Though, it's a bit sad that one of the key elements of classic Fable's simple fun has taken a backseat in favour of a change which might not fit as neatly into what makes the series stand out from the crowd in the eyes of long-time players.</p>

            <p>Sophie Turner is set to star as Lara Croft in the upcoming live-action <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> from Amazon, and it sounds like beyond just costume aesthetics, the globe-trotting heroine will also be leaning into the character's more confident 90s personality as well.</p>
<p>In conversation with the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-21/sophie-turner-steal">Los Angeles Times</a>, Turner said Amazon's Tomb Raider adaptation will not simply portray Lara as a "sex bombshell".</p>

<p>Rather, the show is about Lara "and her story and what drives her". It is not about how "hot she is in the games and the movies", Turner said, though she did acknowledge this is something "so many people also love about" the character as well.</p>
<p>"But I really want to show the other side," the Game of Thrones alum continued, calling Amazon's version of Lara Croft "so unashamedly capable".</p>
<p>"She is not a woman who hides her strengths at all," Turner closed. All I can say to that is, excellent!</p>
<p>Filming for the series - which along with Turner also stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sigourney Weaver and Martin Bobb-Semple</a> - began earlier this week. Weaver previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-scripts-are-incredible-and-very-funny-sigourney-weaver-confirms-she-will-play-wallace-in-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Tomb Raider scripts are "incredible, and very funny, very charming, very witty"</a>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the Tomb Raider series' creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner. Jonathan Van Tulleken will be director and executive producer, along with Chad Hodge as co-showrunner and executive producer.</p><p>For more, I recently shared my thoughts on why <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-2026-lara-croft-seems-to-be-returning-to-what-made-90s-tomb-raider-great-and-as-a-lifelong-fan-i-couldnt-be-more-excited">I believe 2026 is going to be a very good year for fellow Tomb Raider fans like myself</a>. Yep, I got a whole Lara love for Tomb Raider, and I don't care who knows it. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Valve has released details and content for Deadlock with the major new update called Old Gods, New Blood bringing with is a new 4v4 Street Brawl mode, new bosses and patrons that fall into the camps of the Hidden King and Archmother, and lots of updates. There are also six new heroes coming to Deadlock with two released per week, with the release order determined by community votes.&nbsp;The six new heroes have just three phrases to describe each of them, and they are as follows:</p>

		
		

<ul>
<li>Silver – Feral, Hot Mess, Transformation</li>
<li>Rem – Tiny, Helpful, Zzz</li>
<li>Graves – Morbid, Aerial Denial, Necromancer</li>
<li>Celeste – Performer, Disruptive, Dazzling</li>
<li>Venator – Devout, Arms Expert, Tactical</li>
<li>Apollo – Finesse, Mobility, A Cut Above</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Street Brawl mode is a fast paced 4v4 mode where players duke it out in a best of five format with rounds just taking a couple of minutes. At the start of the match, players can pick three random items to add to their inventory, and everyone starts each round on the same level with no farming. The post game screen and MVP system have also been updated so it is easier to get the information you want. Valve has also looked at additional UI and settings improvements which include:</p>


<ul>
<li>Reactive Portraits – Your hero portrait changes based on how you are doing in game.</li>
<li>Kill Streaks – Show off your hot streak</li>
<li>Chat – Various chat visual improvements and updated ally vs. enemy chat styles.</li>
<li>Custom Channel Bars – Players now have animated custom channel bars for each of their channeled abilities.</li>

<li>Mid Boss Timer – Keep track of when Mid Boss will spawn next directly on the minimap.</li>
<li>Random Hero Button</li>
<li>Rejuv Duration Time – More easily track the rejuv timer before it expires.</li>
<li>Visibility Outlines – Improved readability for players and structures during gameplay.</li>
<li>Hole Punch View – A new Camera Hole Punch system reduces the amount of unexpected camera movement when running in front of obstructions. The camera will peer through the objects instead of pushing toward the player character.</li>
<li>Neutrals Near Walls – Jungle camps now glow through walls when you are in close proximity, to help aid in navigation.</li>
<li>Settings Search – Quickly find and update the setting you are looking for on the fly.</li>
<li>Custom Reticle Control – New custom reticle editor with live-preview to help you find the perfect crosshair.</li>
<li>FOV Slider – Instead of a single legacy FOV option, you can now adjust the camera more gradually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you have even more changes outside of the UI and settings including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two new items to use
<ul>
<li>Ballistic Enchantment – Imbue an ability with increased range. Dealing damage with that ability grants you increased weapon damage per target hit.</li>
<li>Recharging Rush – Dealing significant Weapon Damage replenishes a charge for each of your charged abilities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Improved trooper AI</li>
<li>New music added</li>
<li>New voices for the patrons</li>
<li>Build authoring improvements</li>

            <title><![CDATA[“My Lara Is Not a Sex Bombshell”, Says Sophie Turner of Her Version of the Character in Amazon’s Tomb Raider TV Series]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/my-lara-croft-is-not-a-sex-bombshell-says-sophie-turner/</link>
            <guid>1414036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just over a week ago, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared with <strong>Tomb Raider</strong> fans a first look at <strong>Sophie Turner</strong></a> as <strong>Lara Croft</strong> in the upcoming TV series adaptation, which recently started principal photography.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2026-01-21/sophie-turner-steal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during an interview with the LA Times</a> for another Prime Video show (<strong>Steal</strong>, a six-episode limited series available now for streaming), Turner spoke a little about her version of the beloved English adventurer and archeologist. She clarified that she and the showrunners are focusing on her extraordinary skill set rather than her sexy appearance, unlike previous games and even the movies starring Angelina Jolie, which didn't shy away from it. </p>



<p><em>My Lara is not a sex bombshell. It's about her and her story and what drives her, rather than what so many people also love about her, which is how hot she is in the games and the movies. But I really want to show the other side. She’s so unashamedly capable. She is not a woman who hides her strengths at all.</em></p>



<p>Interestingly, the actress, who got her breakthrough role as <strong>Sansa Stark</strong> in <strong>Game of Thrones</strong> and was also a main character (<strong>Jean Grey</strong>) in <strong>X-Men's Dark Phoenix</strong>, says she never trained as hard for any role as she did for Lara Croft's upcoming Tomb Raider TV series. </p>



<p><em>I now really feel like I could protect them [<strong>Editor’s Note: she's referring to her kids</strong>]. As a mum, I come up with scenarios in my head, and I’m like, ‘OK, if a man jumped out of here, what would I do?’ And it’s always like, ‘I just pick the kids up and run. But now it’s changed. My instinct would be to deck him in the face.</em></p>



<p><em>I’ve never had to train for anything like this before. In ‘X-Men’, we had to be in good shape, but my character was telekinetic, so I didn’t need to do much. I didn’t realize I could push my body that far. I feel like I’ve achieved something even before we’ve started shooting.</em></p>



<p>Truthfully, even the most recent Tomb Raider reboot trilogy started moving away from Lara Croft's previously inherent sexiness. We'll see if that continues with the next game iteration, <strong>Tomb Raider: Catalyst</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in development at <strong>Crystal Dynamics</strong> and scheduled to launch in <strong>2027</strong></a>.</p>

            <p>The CWA-backed United Video Games union has written to the US Federal Trade Commission in opposition to the proposed acquisition of EA by private investors, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and various investment firms.</p>
<p>The letter, published on Action Network, lays out the case against the acquisition, stating that EA is not "a struggling company", and any jobs lost as a result of the sale would be: " a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors pockets -- not to strengthen the company."</p>
<p>They conclude the letter with a call for members of the US public to sign an accompanying petition, and to a request to members of the Federal Trade Commission who could potentially halt the deal, writing: "We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, and preserves creative freedom."</p>

<p>Last December,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal"> EA shareholders approved the proposed deal for private investors to buy the company</a>. This left only US institutions like the Federal Trade Commission able to slow the deal down or block it. If approved, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">EA will be almost entirely owned by the government wealth fund of Saudi Arabia</a>, a country that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-takeover-the-saudi-arabian-public-investment-fund-and-vanity-mega-projects-human-rights-watch-assesses-the-impact-of-gamings-latest-controversy">has been criticised due to its history of human rights violations</a>.</p><p>How likely is it that the US would block such a deal?

            <guid>1414027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming Fable reboot is in ‘consideration’ for the Nintendo Switch 2, according to an Xbox insider. </p>



<p>Playground Games’ Fable finally received some gameplay <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday at Xbox’s Developer Direct</a>, along with a concrete release window. The title is releasing for Xbox Series X/S and PC, as well as the PlayStation 5, on release day. It seems developers may have another platform in mind, but it isn’t 100% confirmed yet. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-on-switch-2-isn-t-100-but-there-s-a-chance">Fable on Switch 2 isn’t 100%, But There’s a Chance</h2>



<p>The claim about Fable being discussed for the Switch 2 comes from reliable insider Jez Corden. According to his recent post on <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2014463781250777444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), the release “isn’t 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future.” In one of the replies, Corden also added that currently, the decision is in “logistics” today, and the port is not in development right now. However, he speculates that the port will come through. </p>



<p>Playground Games has also spoken about how it is retaining Fable’s true spirit while adding much more player freedom. The three core pillars of the upcoming title are “Freedom,” “Fairytale,” and “Britishness,” and they establish Fable’s DNA.

            <p>A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> suddenly dropped, bringing six new characters that will join the roster gradually, a new game mode, and various quality-of-life tweaks to the popular MOBA.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most notable addition in this update, dubbed Old Gods New Blood, is a faster-paced game mode called Street Brawl. A quick 4v4 alternative, the shopping system is streamlined down to a random selection each round. In addition resources are equalised across all players, with farming disabled.</p>
<p>The patrons have been given a proper redesign too, as do their minions, finally giving each team's endboss the makeover they've been sorely lacking. They are the Hidden King and the Archmother, two polar opposites with their own thematic arena.</p>

</figure>
<p>Then there's the six new characters. These are Silver, Rem, Graves, Apollo, Celeste, and Venator. Two of them will release per-week, with the first two hitting the game starting the 26th January. Players can vote to determine the release order, with votes earned by playing the game.</p><p>Once the heroes are out, a priority token system will be rolled out to help Deadlock players get an opportunity to try these newcomers out. There are also going to be in-game sprays for each newcomer available, so you can promote your vote in live matches. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>As for those quality-of-life changes, there are some absolute scorchers coming. A revamped post-game screen is on the way, alongside an adjustment to how the MVP is determined. More detailed post-game stats screens will help break down your performance, and UI overhauls are aiming to improve visibility and ease of play.</p>
<p>There's also a massive rework to the in-game settings, and ongoing map updates. You can read <a href="https://www.playdeadlock.com/oldgods">a full breakdown of all the changes and additions on the Deadlock website</a>.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, the Deadlock community anticipated some big news would be dropping overnight, <a href="https://x.com/IntelDeadlock/status/2014435973485002770">thanks to a surge in activity at local pizza spots by the Valve office</a>. Much like the pentagon, it seems when the pizzas are rolling fresh and fast near Valve, something's afoot.</p>

<p>On the hardware side of things, Nintendo systems take up the full podium this time, with the Switch Lite and OLED joining the Switch 2 at the top of the standings. As you might expect from the software numbers, console sales haven't been massive this time, but hey, that's the post-holiday blues.</p>
<p>Combining the three Switch 1 SKUs for the week gives us 27,234 sales, while the trio of PS5 models comes in at 9,983.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has revealed a new physical product, making the Talking Flower from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> into something you can plonk on your sidetable and have quip away at you all day, every day (unless you tell it to stop).</p>
<p>Launching on 12th March, the Talking Flower is now available to pre-order from Nintendo and retail partners, priced at £24.99 / $34.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Talking Flower – Coming March 12th" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlPHrDkoukM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Talking Flower will spout out somewhat random quips throughout the day, set by default to say something ever 30 minutes, and able to be manually triggered with a press of the Talk Button. It’s just about smart enough to be able to announce the hour (but will sometimes get it wrong and then correct itself, which is actually marginally more intelligent than the self-assured ChatGPT). It can also comment on the time of day and temperature, and will sometimes play background music from the game (you can then mash the Talk Button and it’ll shout and yelp to match the music).</p>
<p>Thankfully, you can get it to shut up. Hold the Talk Button for two seconds and it will halt its chit chat, and you can set a sleep schedule so that it doesn’t disturb you. It also has support for English, German, French, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Dutch, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Chinese and Korean localisation.</p>

<p>It’s another thoroughly odd little bit of Nintendo merch, to go alongside their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/09/nintendo-alarmo-is-an-alarm-clock-and-not-switch-2/">Alarmo alarm clock</a> from a couple years ago.</p>
<p>Chances are most people will stick with just playing the game. Super Mario Bros. Wonder was a real highlight for the Nintendo Switch, bringing a renewed sense of fun and imagination to the 2D side-scrolling platformer, and Nintendo are now expanding it for Nintendo Switch 2 with a Switch 2 Edition and Bellabel Park add-on. They just delved into the various multiplayer modes and added challenges that will be making their way into the game on Switch 2 when it launches in March, and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/22/super-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-edition-arrives-in-march-with-playable-rosalina-more/">read all about that here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“We Nicked It From The Office”: Fable Lead Confirms In-Game Mockumentary Style]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fable-lead-confirms-mockumentary-style-is-in-the-game/</link>
            <guid>1414003</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>There's no doubt that most of the curiosity surrounding the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> was directed at <strong>Fable</strong>. Sure, <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong> is massively anticipated on the heels of the excellent previous game, but it's mostly a known quantity. Fable, on the other hand, has been missing for over fifteen years, and it's now being rebooted by a new developer, <strong>Playground Games</strong>. </p>



<p>The presentation <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-launches-autumn-2026-amazingly-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was very promising</a></strong>. As I noted in my article, it appears that the developers have successfully retained most of the spirit and gameplay features that made the original trilogy unique. However, there's still a lot we have to discover about the game. A fresh interview with Game Director <strong>Ralph Fulton</strong>, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/fable-interview-overview-details-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the Xbox Wire blog</a>, helps with that. In the interview, Fulton mentions that Fable will feature a 'sensational cast of characters', although it's too early to unveil who will be playing them, except for <strong>Richard Ayoade</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-first-gameplay-xbox-games-showcase-richard-ayoade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was revealed nearly three years ago as Dave</a>. </p>



<p>Then, Fulton went through the studio's inspirations to get that British humour right. <strong>Ricky Gervais's The Office</strong> was apparently the main inspiration, but not only for the tone: the show's trademark <strong>mockumentary style</strong> wasn't just reserved for the trailers; it will actually be found in the game.</p>



<p><em>We were inspired by the incredibly rich variety of British comedies that have been around over the last 20 years like ‘Peep Show,’ ‘The IT Crowd’ and so many others. We started with ‘The Office’, which again started out as quintessentially British, but also travels really, really well. Not just that IP, but a lot of the techniques and the devices that it’s popularized, you know. It’s that really grounded, awkward style of humour which really appeals to us. And the actors who have been in a lot of these shows – and indeed some of whom are in our game – they’re known all over the world.</em></p>



<p><em>The other cool thing about The Office is something we’ve kind of nicked. You’ve maybe seen in our trailers that we have a sort of mockumentary interview style. I think a lot of people assume we just did that for those trailers, but it’s actually a device we use throughout the game. I’ve never seen it in games before, but it allows you a way to really neatly tell a joke or drop a little bit of character detail in a way that would feel really clunky in a dialogue, but suddenly feels entirely natural when you do it to ‘camera’.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, I'm not too thrilled about this. While the mockumentary style made perfect sense for The Office, I'm not sure it will work just as well in a game like Fable. Sure, the British humour was always part of the series, but that and the mockumentary style are quite two different things. <strong>I'm not sure delivering lines to 'camera' makes sense when you're supposed to be feeling immersed in the fantasy world of Albion</strong>.</p>



<p>That said, as I wrote earlier, <strong>everything else about Playground's game looks spot on</strong>, so perhaps this will only be a minor annoyance - and perhaps it might even be fun from time to time. It won't be too long until we find out: now we know that Fable will be released in Autumn for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X. If I were Microsoft and Playground, though, <strong>I'd make sure to release well before Grand Theft Auto VI</strong>, which is currently set for November 19, 2026.</p>



<p>As a side note, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just won Wccftech's most anticipated roleplaying game of 2026 category award</a></strong> from both staff and community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>Koei Tecmo</strong> unveiled new <strong>Nioh 3</strong> footage in a 17.5-minute gameplay showcase. As you know if you've read <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nioh-3-everything-we-know-about-team-ninjas-supernatural-action-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our roundup article on the game</a></strong>, Nioh 3 actually takes place across multiple time periods, including the early <strong>Edo</strong> period, the <strong>Sengoku</strong> period, the <strong>Heian</strong> period, and the <strong>Bakumatsu</strong> period. </p>



<p>Today's gameplay showcase begins in the second one, also known as the <strong>Warring States</strong> period. In the game's version of the era, the <strong>Yōkai</strong> (demons) freely roam the land, and a horrifying realm known as the <strong>Crucible</strong> has manifested. The player explores a large, open field while seeking a way to the Crucible. </p>



<p>The protagonist, the historical figure <strong>Tokugawa Takechiyo </strong>(Iemitsu), <strong>can switch between the classic samurai style and the new ninja style at any time during combat</strong>. Switching is particularly useful whenever there's a need to adapt to certain enemies and situations, or simply to shift to the player's preferred play style.</p>



<p>Samurai mode lets Tokugawa confront enemies head-on, utilizing martial arts and deflecting attacks while switching between stances to unleash a variety of strikes. On the other hand, Ninja style aims to outmaneuver enemies with <strong>Ninjutsu</strong>, evading with mid-air and behind-the-back attacks.</p>



<div><p><strong>Not everyone or everything is hostile in Nioh 3, though</strong>. The developers from Team Ninja highlighted that Tokugawa will encounter friendly characters and even friendly Yōkai on his journey. Interacting with them may bring useful rewards.</p><p>Ultimately, Tokugawa's journey heads to the aforementioned Crucible, a treacherous area ruled by dangerous, hostile Yōkai. <strong>Players should expect even more challenging fights in this area</strong>. According to the developers, those who summoned the Crucible are heroes who have lost their way, succumbing to their own ambitions and misguided causes.</p></div>



<p>The gameplay video then switches to the Heian period, where the land is entirely frozen. Here, as in the other time periods, the protagonist must cleanse the Crucible to restore the land, purging it of Yōkai corruption.</p>

<p>Nioh 3 <strong>is set to launch on February 6, 2026</strong> for PC and PlayStation 5. Eager fans can jump in early to sample the free demo, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-demo-ps5-pc-january-29-2026-carries-full-game-crossplay-missing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which will be released on January 29</a></strong>. Its save data also carries over to the full game, so in essence it's a bit like having early access to the initial portion.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/activision-unveils-warzone-resurgence-series/</link>
            <guid>1413973</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has lifted the lid on a massive Call of Duty: Warzone tournament circuit dubbed ‘Resurgence Series’. The new ecosystem boasts a massive prize pool worth $1.2 million and will unfold through 2026, culminating in a Championship event at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>This is set to replace the World Series of Warzone, throwing players into the small-form, fast-paced maps, as opposed to the larger, traditional battle royale experiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-has-a-new-esports-circuit">Warzone Has a New Esports Circuit</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://callofduty.worldseriesofwarzone.com/resurgence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent release</a>, Activision detailed the all-new Resurgence Series, a grand event set to turn around some gamers’ fortunes in 2026. It starts with online qualifiers that begin on February 9th, which will feed players into the first LAN event at DreamHack Birmingham in late March in the United Kingdom.</p>



<p>Following that event, a second qualifying stage starts, this time with players competing at DreamHack Atlanta in May. From these two LAN events, a selection of teams will qualify for the Esports World Cup <strong>directly</strong>. Another 22 spots will remain open for the Esports World Cup Qualifiers, set to be hosted in June ahead of the ultimate tournament in July in Riyadh.</p>



<p>The prize pool will be split accordingly:</p>



<ul>
<li>DreamHack Birmingham: $100,000</li>



<li>DreamHack Atlanta: $100,000</li>



<li>Esports World Cup: $1,000,000</li>
</ul>



<p>This is a trios-based tournament that uses the traditional kill race format, with players earning points for kills and getting boosted multipliers for higher finishes during each round.</p>



<p>For a while, fans have been sceptical about the future of Warzone’s esports ecosystem. It has been rocky for a couple of years now, but this new diverse approach that has spawned more LAN events at some of the biggest showcases in the business has pro players enthused.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#957)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 23]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-23-957/</link>
            <guid>1413970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Welcome to the end of another long week, and the introduction of a fresh round of NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is a tough one, but that’s why I’m here to help you out. Before we roll into the weekend, let’s see if we can keep your streak running for a little while longer.</p>



<p>Read on to get today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions in just a few seconds.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-23">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 23)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #957:</p>



<ul>
<li>STONE</li>



<li>TEMPLE</li>



<li>PILOT</li>



<li>LIP</li>



<li>STREET</li>



<li>CHEEK</li>



<li>FOOT</li>



<li>TRAFFIC</li>



<li>EYE</li>



<li>ACRE</li>



<li>FLOOD</li>



<li>METER</li>



<li>GARAGE</li>



<li>LIME</li>



<li>BUSHEL</li>



<li>VALET</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think about parts of the face you’d point to during a game of “Simon Says.”</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Different ways you might leave your car depending on the situation</em>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> –<em> Old‑school measurements still used in certain countries.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each one forms a common compound phrase when placed before the word <em>light</em>.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 23:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-23-957">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 23 (#957)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– CHEEK, EYE, LIP, TEMPLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – GARAGE, METER, STREET, VALET</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ACRE, BUSHEL, FOOT, STONE</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – FLOOD, LIME, PILOT, TRAFFIC</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Nintendo surprised us with a new trailer for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park</a>. It detailed what to expect when it launches on <strong>26th March 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>At the very end of this video, Nintendo explains the two purchase options, which are similar to previous Switch 2 Edition releases.</p>
<p>You can either purchase the Switch 2 Edition of the game, which contains the base game and expansion content, or if you're an existing owner, you'll have the option to purchase the upgrade pack for $19.99 (or your local equivalent).</p>

<p>And how about those new amiibo arriving on the same date? Will you be getting any (<em>or all</em>) of them? <em>Vote in our poll and let us know in the comments.</em></p>
