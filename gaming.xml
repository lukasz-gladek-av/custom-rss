			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition</a> was already ported to PC before they announced the remaster. Now, Sony has created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster that requires players to create a PSN account</a> to be able to play the game. This has been a hugely controversial move by Sony, as it lands them in hot water with players every single time a PlayStation game gets ported to PC and requires a PSN account.&nbsp; Last Friday, the original Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was delisted on Steam and the Epic Games Store to make way for Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered. It seems those who don't own the game will now be forced to buy the remaster instead of the original PC port.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was previously available in countries where Steam could be accessed. While the Steam page for the Complete Edition is still live, people are no longer able to purchase the game itself. Instead, Steam users are prompted to either pre-order Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered or Horizon Forbidden West.</p>
<p>Previously, Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition was available straight after the remaster was announced, but then PlayStation quietly upped the price of the original to replicate its starting price when the game was first released. <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-quietly-doubles-price-of-horizon-zero-dawn-complete-edition-on-ps-store/">It went from $29.99 to $49.99</a> on the PlayStation store. In the six years the game was available in the store, this was the first time the game experienced a price bump, with the game going on sale frequently and the price dropping to a fixed rate of $29.99 in the past.</p>
<p>Pulling the Horizon Zero Dawn Complete Edition is a risky choice made by Sony, as it will make it more difficult for customers to be able to play the game depending on what country they're in. The Remastered release will be out on October 31 but will require a PSN account. Sony's PlayStation Network is not officially available in more than a hundred countries, with most of them being in the Middle East, Europe, Africa and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>As stated before, there have been previous games ported to PC by Sony that also require a PSN account, such as Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok, which has proved to be a point of contention for many players. When Helldivers 2 was released on PC, Sony tried to make it a requirement for players to link to a PlayStation Network account, which led to review bombing. This was a quickly reversed decision. Whether that will happen for Horizon Zero Dawn remains to be seen, but considering that Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok both still require PSN accounts, it's unlikely.</p>

Tess, voiced by Kaitlyn Dever (HBO’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-us-season-2-trailer-abby-joel-ellie-guitar-1851658503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-us-season-2-trailer-abby-joel-ellie-guitar-1851658503"><em>The Last of Us</em> season two’s Abby</a></span>), is a teenage girl with a contentious relationship with her mother Opal (<em>The Americans’</em> Keri Russel). It’s a pretty familiar mother-daughter dynamic, but the third figure, Opal’s mom and Tess’s grandmother, looms over the two at all times. She might be dead, but her secret is what sends Tess and Opal on an adventure that teases out their generational trauma. </p><p>This road trip is more about the handful of stops you make along the way rather than the drive, tasking you with exploring these smaller spaces (An empty house filled with moving boxes, an abandoned vacation home, a boat) on foot as Tess. All of these places are filled with objects and traces of past lives for both Tess and Opal to uncover. The developers behind<em> Open Roads</em> used to work at Fullbright—of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gone-home-the-kotaku-review-1118218265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gone-home-the-kotaku-review-1118218265"><em>Gone Home</em></a></span> fame—so you’ll walk around and pick up objects just as you did in the seminal 2013 walking simulator. Just like <em>Open Roads</em>’ spiritual predecessor, the story is told mostly through piecing together context clues found in the environments and objects of the world. News clippings, pictures, letters, and more bring out the (maybe purposely) forgotten frustrations between three generations of women in the family: Tess, Opal, and the grandmother.</p><p>While <em>Gone Home</em> had you exploring an empty house on your own, <em>Open Roads </em>keeps Tess and Opal together at all times. Instead of lonely reminiscing, each discovery turns into an opportunity for dialogue between mother and daughter. This is one of <em>Open Roads </em>greatest strengths, as Dever and Russel are both wonderful performers. Hearing the two actors play off each other feels less like a game and more like an intimate play. The game’s runtime reflects that, as it only takes about two hours tops to complete. If you want to experience a short but emotionally packed story carried by its excellent performances then <em>Open Roads</em> is the game for you. Its inclusion on Game Pass means that you don’t have a good reason not to play it. Even if you don’t like it, you’ll only have lost two hours of your life.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Midia, in 2023 and 2024 the survey asked a range of players from the U.S., Australia, the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Poland, Brazil, South Africa, and Turkey about their various video game preferences. And yeah, it turns out most people like playing single-player games. However, digging into the data reveals some more interesting findings. </p><p>For example, it seems that the older you are, the more likely you are to avoid online games and stick to single-player adventures. 74 percent of gamers over the age of 55 told Midia that they preferred single-player games over co-op or online PvP. In fact, the younger you are, the more likely you are to want to play with other people. Only 30 percent of players under the age of 19 prefer playing solo.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="126345f3e59908a507bdeaf50764527e" data-recommend-id="image://126345f3e59908a507bdeaf50764527e" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2250" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="126345f3e59908a507bdeaf50764527e" data-recommend-id="image://126345f3e59908a507bdeaf50764527e" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2250" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Another interesting data point: 58 percent of mobile gamers prefer single-player titles.

Midia also says that younger gamers like to take “vacations” from games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em>, and suggests that publishers and devs should try to release new single-player games toward the end of live-service seasons, when players are more likely to be looking for a break. </p><p>Of course, while this data shows that single-player is still a very popular type of video game, I doubt publishers will stop pushing for live-service hits. The reality is that single-player games are still expensive to make and take years to develop, just like live-service titles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">But if a live-service game can build a large audience, you could spend years supporting it</a></span> and making a lot of money while not having to make another big single-player experience.

On October 4th, both the newest anime season, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/17/sword-art-online-alternative-gun-gale-online-episode-2-ggo-review">Sword Art Online Alternative: Gun Gale Online II</a>, and the newest game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sword-art-online-fractured-daydream">Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream</a> were released. </p><p>SAO: FD is already quite different from the previous in the video game series, but we had to ask: What’s next for the Sword Art Online video games? Here’s what SAO: FD producer Shoehei Mogami and SAO game series producer Yosuke Futami had to say about the possibility of a more mature SAO game and the MMORPG-style SAO game they know fans want. </p><p>“Sword Art Online itself, the anime and the game, will keep going into the future,” Futami said. “We do want to bring SAO to the next level, maybe even to a higher-performing console.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Futami also explained that while Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream is more character-based, they maybe also want to try to do something around the concept of SAO that if you die in game, you die in real life. That’s something they want to explore in the future, but Futami clarified they likely wouldn’t implement a permadeath mechanic because  “the current SAO game fans might be angry and just might break their keyboard or something.” </p><p>“We want to try to have more for those SAO fans who are adults and experience an SAO which is more mature,” Futami explained. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We want to try to have more for those SAO fans who are adults and experience an SAO which is more mature</p></div><p>The future of SAO probably also wouldn’t be something like a Souls-like, and because of the difficulty behind development, neither an MMORPG.</p><p>“MMORPGs are very difficult to make,” Futami said, joking that in Japan it’s said to take 70 years to make one. “While we know the IP [Sword Art Online] would be great for it, and many of our fans and player community are interested in it, it's something we would only pursue once we know we have a strong concept and could do it right. Maybe, if all the stars aligned, we would be able to start making it.” </p><p>Though it isn’t an MMORPG, Sword Art Online: Fractured Daydream seeks to emulate raids found in MMORPGs with 20-person dungeons and raid bosses, complete with boss-specific, rare loot that not everyone can pick up at the end of the fight. It’s also a standalone title, so anyone familiar with just some of the anime would be able to get into and understand SAO: FD, no previous SAO game knowledge required. </p><p>“There’s a barrier to entry after ten years of [SAO] games,” Mogami said. “We want people who haven’t played the games to be able to enjoy SAO games.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The team also wanted to challenge themselves by implementing cross-play in SAO: FD, so friends aren’t barred from playing with each other, Mogami explained. </p><p>There is one more thing we know about the future of SAO games, too: Though the chance is not entirely zero, don’t expect an SAO game without Kirito or Asuna. Having an SAO game without Kirito and Asuna, Futami said, “is like having a Dragon Ball without Son Goku.” </p><p><em>Casey DeFreitas is IGN's Deputy Guides Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-starfield-star-citizen-yakuza<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a belief, among a certain school of game designers, that bigger is better – or that the larger and more detailed a simulation gets, the more convincing it becomes. Cases in point: <em>Star Citizen</em> and <em>Starfield</em>, both of which attempt to model entire universes to exacting standards (albeit in pretty different ways) and both of which made headlines this week for all the wrong reasons. The best, most lived-in feeling video game worlds are elaborate illusions. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we talk about that.</p><p>We begin by doing our best impression of that one meme where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9S1EzkRpelY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan Frakes asks you things</a>: What’s going on with <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-shattered-space-metacritic-steam-reviews-long-1851664605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starfield</em>’s new, poorly-received DLC</a>? Why is <em>Star Citizen</em> – a <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-wonder-what-star-citizen-is-up-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crowdfunded</a> testament to one man’s hubris that’s been in development for more than a decade – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forcing developers to crunch</a> in the year 2024? In light of the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4tmmzh2PfA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TV show</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another spinoff game</a>, is the <em>Yakuza </em>series spreading itself too thin? And <a href="https://aftermath.site/shadows-of-doubt-early-access-full-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when is an early access game done</a>, really?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we answer questions about the psychic damage we sustain while trying to play games with optimal outcomes and which power Kirby would gain if he swallowed us (anxiety). Luke definitely does not regret the way he phrased his response to the latter question at all.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can make a hyper-realistic, simulated-down-to-the-skin-pore version of <em>Yakuza </em>and then throw it out after realizing that it’s bad.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s so funny that we were talking about the creaky systems underlying something like <em>Starfield </em>and how people got tired of those after only a handful of installments, really, of games in that engine [in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> and modern <em>Fallouts</em>, specifically]. Compare that to <em>Yakuza</em>, which has had many more games that are more openly formulaic, and yet people are still hungering for more <em>Yakuza</em>. Meanwhile, with something like <em>Starfield</em>, they’re like “It’s too similar to this one game that came out eight years ago, or this other game that came out 13 years ago.” How do you account for that? What’s going on there?</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>It happened on a magic formula. It’s always been open-world to an extent, but an extremely limited one. But the setting for that open world has always been so intimate that nobody minds that it’s actually quite small. By making it a neighborhood that the story’s set in, most people relate to that. We all live in a neighborhood. We all live somewhere. You guys especially, you live in New York. It’s a major city. You’ve got your bodega, you’ve got your department store, you’ve got your pizza place. You’ve got two bars and a cafe. That’s what <em>Yakuza </em>is. The more you run around its streets doing errands, the more you become familiar with the layout of those streets.&nbsp;</p><p>I know Harper did <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-yakuzas-city-changes-from-game-to-game-1821884988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a really cool piece</a> a few years ago on Kotaku about this: The cities of <em>Yakuza</em> actually become the star of the series, because that’s what you grow to love and remember and think really fondly about. You just know every street corner by heart. When you play the next game, you can be like “Aw, the burger place closed.” You start to imagine a storyline involving “Oh, maybe they were down on their luck” or “Maybe their wife got sick and they had to sell. Now it’s a fake Irish bar.” And then for the next 11 [in-game] years, that’s a fake Irish bar.</p><p>It’s got that limitation, that you don’t mind that it’s a small open world. Then it’s got the main appeal of the dialogue itself. Dialogue’s dialogue; you go up to someone and press a button. But in <em>Yakuza </em>you’re doing it for the writing and the story itself, not for the way it’s delivered. You’re not relying on a clockwork NPC or a dynamic branching storyline. It’s a soap opera. So they can just keep releasing this game forever, and people won’t care because it’s an interactive soap opera.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Jarathen in chat says “It also speaks to where the Bethesda formulas fail, and that’s in making a place feel real, lived-in, and engaging.” And like, yeah, it’s that human element. Maybe this also ties back into <em>Star Citizen</em>, so we’ve really come full circle in a lot of ways. You don’t need to simulate everything.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s this belief, I think, among at least some people who make games that the closer you get to a simulation, the better your game is, or the more advanced it is. When in reality, <em>Yakuza </em>takes all of these what would be considered shortcuts to create the illusion of life and the illusion of a real place. But that’s so much more effective as a means of conveying the <em>feeling </em>of a place than something like Bethesda’s Radiant AI where everybody’s a little clockwork person that does the same thing every day or <em>Star Citizen</em> trying to model the whole universe and just having this kind of janky tech demo.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>There are few experiences in video games as immersive as putting a modern <em>Yakuza </em>game into first-person mode and walking really slowly through a busy street. I know that sounds ridiculous, but these are really good-looking games. They know that they need to worry about neon lights and rain puddles on a city street as the main things you’re looking at, and they’ve nailed it. Walking through the city streets, all it does is spawn NPCs. You can’t talk to them. They’re not on a clockwork routine where one of them has to be Trevor the blacksmith, who has to be back in his barn by 5 PM to feed his ox, because that’s what Bethesda’s system mandates.</p><p>It doesn’t matter, because someone walking past you on the street doesn’t have to be a person with a story. That’s just a model. What’s important is the volume of them to make you feel like you’re in a bustling place that’s alive and full of people. And it absolutely nails that. </p><p>One of my favorite things to do in <em>Yakuza </em>is to walk between missions. And you can fast travel in a cab. Most people will run and sprint, but I like to walk. I like to look at every shop, because every shop is unique. You really feel like you’re in a place. Every time I play these games, no matter how many times I’ve been to Kamurocho, I can walk past and notice something new – just because I’m walking in this place that feels alive. I can be like “Oh, there’s a pachinko place here that I never noticed” or “The movie posters here are different this time around. I wonder what this movie is – because it’s all in Japanese and I can’t read it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ironically, for a game that’s able to come out so frequently, that is built on such a repetitive platform, that it can feel so alive every time speaks to how well they’ve got that machine oiled. They know what is special about the game, what they’re good at, and what they can do, and they execute every part of it perfectly every time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A few hours ago, BioWare <a href="https://x.com/dragonage/status/1842218290032111742" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> via Twitter (X) that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is officially gold. That means the game is basically finished, the physical copies are being prepared, and there is no chance of a delay (although, on extremely rare occasions, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-to-december-10th-cdpr-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that's been known to happen</a>).</p>
<p>The game will launch on October 31 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. It'll be almost ten years since the previous installment, Dragon Age: Inquisition, which debuted on November 18, 2014. Fans of the fantasy saga have been waiting for a very long time, mostly due to BioWare getting busy with Mass Effect Andromeda first and then Anthem, but the fourth Dragon Age installment also had its own development troubles. As noted in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/dragon-age-the-veilguard-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-dragon-age-in-a-decade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our roundup article</a>, Dragon Age Inquisition Game director Mike Laidlaw had prepared plans for a new game codenamed Joplin. This would have been a smaller installment focusing on a 'heist' in the region of the Tevinter Imperium magocracy. This iteration was, however, canceled in late 2017 (Laidlaw left the company around the same time) as Electronic Arts attempted to pivot the game toward a live service design. At the time, this new Dragon Age (codenamed Morrison) was described as "Anthem with dragons."</p>
<p>That wasn't the last major change of direction. After the massive failure of Anthem and the success of Respawn's single-player game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, EA eventually reconsidered its stance and allowed BioWare to drop the live service elements and resume development as a single-player title. Thus, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf was born. More recently, the title was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> to highlight the main character's companions rather than the (supposed) villain.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for Dragon Age: The Veilguard are open now on PC and Xbox Series S|X, while PlayStation 5 pre-orders will open soon, according to BioWare. To dive more deeply into the game's features, check out our recent coverage from the preview event: <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-exclusive-qa-no-side-quest-exists-without-contributing-to-the-narrative/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Q&amp;A</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-roundtable-qa-the-conclusion-to-this-game-needs-to-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roundtable Q&amp;A</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a> is an action roguelite much like Dead Cells, the previous game from developer Motion Twin, but it trades sidescrolling 'vania vibes for a 3D and more colourful world, and adds co-op for up to three pals. That sounds plenty appealing, and it now has a release date: October 24th. 
</p>
<p>Better still, on October 14th, it's getting a singleplayer demo as part of the Steam Next Fest.

<p>Dead Cells had fabulous-feeling combat and an exciting progression system that made each new run exciting. Despite the change in style and perspective, Windlbown seems to want to offer a similar experience as you dash and smash across floating sky islands.
</p>
<p>That dash is seemingly key, based on Edwin's impressions from seeing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-cells-developers-new-roguelike-windsblown-has-a-dash-so-potent-it-makes-the-game-seem-disposable">a Windblown presentation back at GDC</a>.
</p>
<p>"Windblown's dash seems expressive, at times, of deep impatience towards the rest of the game, which sounds perverse on the surface, but makes sense when you consider the roguelike's intrinsic element of repetition. It's a dash dedicated to the experienced player's desire to immediately return to the biome where they last popped their clogs," Edwin wrote. "There are some familiar elements that slow you down, however: boss enemies that must be fought to progress the story, and the basic pressure to defeat foes and gather new equipment, or else get your arse handed to you by an unskippable threat in the next biome along."
</p><p>My favourite times with Dead Cells came early in its Early Access, when it was likewise a game of dash-rolling impatience, and where most enemies could be bested via turret deployments and ladder-based cheese strats. Once the updates came, forcing me to slow and engage with its deeper systems, it was still fun but no longer freewheeling and frivolous. I'm inclined to hop on the Windblown train early, in case it charts a similar path.
</p>
<p>The demo seems a good place to start. It'll launch on October 14th, and while limited to singleplayer online, progress made will carry over to the full game ten days later. You'll find a few more details <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/">over on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, if you find that your friends have left you behind somehow—maybe they were distracted by a passing truck, and followed it from state to state, forgetting all about their MMO and friendships—you can always opt to pay for a Server Transfer Ticket—but that costs real money, so just get it right the first time, dammit.</p><h2 id="h379"><a id=""></a><strong>Pick your weapons wisely, and stick with them</strong></h2><p>Part of the appeal of <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is its unique class system, that allows you to equip any two weapon types at the same time so that you can make use of each one’s passive and active skills simultaneously. But that doesn’t mean it’s a great idea to swap between a bunch of different combinations throughout the game—that is, unless you want to spend a <em>lot</em> of time grinding later on.</p><p>While you can certainly choose to swap weapon combos any time you’d like, you should be aware that the time and material investments necessary to level up each weapon type are rather extensive. As such, it’s a good idea to play around at the start, pick the combo you like early on, and stick with it until you’ve made significant progress with your initial weapons. Only then should you consider leveling new ones. Think of it like your stats are attached to the weapons.</p><p>You’ll get access to one of each type of weapon from the very beginning of the game, so it’s highly recommended that you spend as much time as you need attacking the target dummies in one of the early areas, trying out each combo until you’ve nailed down something that really works for you.</p><h2 id="h380"><a id=""></a><strong>Every weapon combo is viable, but yes, there’s still a meta</strong></h2><p>Speaking of your weapon loadouts, you can rest assured that every combination in the game can handle <em>most</em> content, but that’s not to say that they’re all created equal. Indeed, combining these weapons is all about synergy, and not all loadouts will work as well together as others.</p><figure id="" data-id="05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-recommend-id="image://05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A frantic battle against an enormous skeletal baddun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A frantic battle against an enormous skeletal baddun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-recommend-id="image://05e757eefd69b956bb9e81f2d9bc87dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A frantic battle against an enormous skeletal baddun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s take, for instance, tanking. In this scenario, your two best options will be Sword &amp; Shield + Greatsword, or Sword &amp; Shield + Wand &amp; Tome. The former will let you deal more damage while tanking, and the latter will provide you with plenty of self-healing for sustainability. This doesn’t mean you can’t try other combinations—it simply means they’ll likely provide fewer benefits to you in more demanding content. Bringing something like a staff or longbow along with you as a tank really doesn’t add many useful defensive skills that will aid you in survivability, which can make your job a bit harder (as well as the job of your healer).<br></p><p>Regardless of whether you’re looking to tank, heal, or DPS, you should still absolutely play what you have the most fun with. Just don’t be shocked if you’re occasionally turned down for some of the game’s hardest dungeons and encounters by meta-focused groups.</p><h2 id="h381"><a id=""></a><strong>Complete the early crafting and upgrade quests ASAP</strong></h2><p>Early in the game, you’ll receive a series of quests asking you to craft various accessories and upgrade pieces of gear. Do these as soon as possible. By upgrading different pieces of gear to Green quality and equipping multiple accessories, you’ll be able to increase your Combat Power (see: Gear Score), which is necessary to access dungeons and other content.</p><p>As an example, the game’s first main dungeon is unlocked at level 20, but you’ll need a Combat Power ranking of 600. If you complete the early quests that ask you to engage with this mechanic, you should easily hit that number almost immediately.</p><p><strong>You can see your Combat Power in your character screen</strong>, directly under where you level up your stats. Continue increasing it as frequently as possible by upgrading and enchanting your gear, or your improving skills.</p><h2 id="h382"><a id=""></a><strong>Keep an eye out for a guild to join</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-recommend-id="image://a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Running toward a misty castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Running toward a misty castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-recommend-id="image://a5545c2f84f870ef1e7a72fde69149db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Running toward a misty castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, joining any old guild isn’t usually a great call, but you’ll definitely want to look into finding one that suits you—<em>Throne and Liberty</em> is a very guild-focused experience. Being in a guild offers an abundance of benefits, such as access to guild contracts for earning Guild Coins, which can then be used to purchase unique items from a guild merchant. As a guild grows and levels up, you’ll also eventually be able to make use of guild skills that can offer buffs like bonus EXP or Sollant (money), decreased boss damage, or mana regeneration.</p><p>These guilds are a core component of the PVP experience, letting you form alliances with other guilds or mark an undesirable guild as hostile. You’ll be able to join together with your guildmates to try to occupy specific spots on the map for unique buffs and opportunities to fight specific raid bosses.</p><p>Alternatively, if joining someone else’s guild doesn’t appeal to you, you can always just create your own in the Guild menu—though you’ll want to be certain that you’re interested in recruiting and building a jolly band of guildmates if you want to reap the best benefits of having a guild. It’s going to be kind of hard to take on other guilds as a single person, ya know.<br></p><h2 id="h383"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast travel to your heart’s content</strong></h2><p>Fast travel in <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is free until level 30. With that in mind, make sure you’re using the various waypoints across the map to move quickly between areas to turn in quests, or find any enemies or items you’re currently seeking.</p><p>Of course, to fast travel to a waypoint you’ll need to have interacted with it at least once previously, so don’t skip out on walking up to those suckers and saying hello with a quick button press—it’s gonna save you a hell of a lot of time.</p><p>Now get out there and see everything <em>Throne and Liberty</em> has to offer MMO fans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-ghost-of-yotei-gets-history-right<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The new trailer for Ghost of Yotei is here and in three minutes, Sucker Punch has managed to tease a ton of cool details from Japanese history. Placed 300 years after the story of Jin and Ghost of Tsushima, Ghost of Yotei takes us to a time of turmoil in the Hokkaido region, which was known as Ezo in 1603 and not really considered part of Japan. It was the perfect destination for fleeing Ronin and Wokou (aka pirates), who were escaping the newly appointed Tokugawa shogunate. Since the trailer released I’ve been poring over the details it contains, translating the text, brushing up on Japanese history, finding out about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumae_clan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matsumae clan</a>, and learning all about the indigenous people called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ainu_people" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainu</a>, because I’m incredibly hyped for Ghost of Yotei. Here’s why.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We are beyond the edge of Japan.”&nbsp;</p></div><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ghost of Yotei</h3></div></output><p>Let’s talk about that opening quote because knowing a bit of history helps set the stage as to why it’s important. In 1600 the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Sekigahara" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battle of Sekigahara</a> took place, which was fought and won by famed warrior <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. Following his victory he hunted down and executed those who stood against him and folded many into his shogunate if they accepted. By 1603 clans like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_clan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Takeda clan</a> – who may have their crest or one like it represented in the trailer – would have either joined Tokugawa or been left to their own fate.</p><p>In March of 1603,<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ieyasu_tokugawa.shtml#:~:text=In%201600%20Ieyasu%20defeated%20the,to%20confirm%20his%20pre%2Deminence." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ieyasu was made Shogun</a> and guess which region was deemed important around that same time? That’s right, Ezo, which would explain the scene of Ronin and Pirates trying to burn down what we think might be a Tokugawa building or one teased to be like it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghost-of-ytei-announce-trailer-ps5-games-11-54-00-02-12-21-still015-1728065480721.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In addition to that turmoil, the Matsumae clan was defending the southern region of Ezo from the Ainu. Since Ezo wasn’t really considered part of Japan and the Ainu were local to the area there was friction between the two factions, which came to a head when the Ainu and Matsumae faced off in 1669 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakushain%27s_revolt#References" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revolt of Shakushain</a> over control of the land. The Ainu are a very spiritual people believing that everything from flora and fauna to animals had a spirit. In fact they believe they were born from a union of a wolflike creature and a goddess. They also have a ritual involving bears who they consider to be gods, but more on that later.</p><p>In 1603 the conflict between the Ainu and Japanese was coming to a bit of a head. The Matsumae clan established a base on Ezo near the southern edge of the island, and would eventually build the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumae_Castle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matsumae Castle in 1606</a>. Ezo was seen as an important point of defense from Russia, but it wasn’t until the Castle was built that trade was more well-established with the Ainu in 1606.</p><p>Also a fun fact about Mount Yotei. It’s referred to as the female mountain by the Ainu people but let’s not forget about the nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Y%C5%8Dtei" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mt. Shiribetsu</a>, known as the male mountain is nearby and I believe it’s teased as a location a bit earlier.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“People will come north to disappear. But you… you are hunting.”</p></div><p>So how does our new protagonist Atsu fit into all of this? There’s a lot of Wolf iconography in the trailer, which is interesting because the now-extinct Ezo Wolf, also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkaido_wolf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ezo Okami</a>, are known as a god who had the power to dispel evil. They also symbolize mountain worship, which ties in nicely with Yotei’s setting. Atsu also has Wolf iconography on her hilt, which makes me wonder if she has ties to the Ainu, given their belief that many animals were gods roaming the earth, and the Wolf god's importance I noted earlier is particularly important in Ainu culture.</p><p>The Ainu loved animals, but despite this had ceremonies that by modern standards could be seen as somewhat violent. For example, the <a href="https://www.bears.org/spirit/ainumyth.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ainu believed Bears</a> were gods waiting to be set free, so they would take bear cubs, raise them like they were their own children until they were about two years old, and then sacrifice them and drink their blood in a ritual they believed sent the god back to where they came from. It’s also interesting that Atsu has what appears to be a bearskin cloak for warmth. While this may not have been from the ritual itself, it could have been traded or acquired from the Ainu in some other manner related to the ritual. Sucker Punch has teased an upcoming video about the other animals we can expect in Ghost of Yotei so I’m intrigued to know more about the blood sacrifice… or maybe the Ural Owls of Ezo which would be a bit more my speed.</p><p>But beyond the bear cloak, Atsu also has several interesting traits that could paint her as having a Japanese background. Besides her stances, weapons, and attire which we’ll discuss in just a moment, her instrument, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsugaru-jamisen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tsugaru Shamisen</a>, is an interesting choice. The Shamisen was popular in the pleasure districts, highbrow theater, and even with folk music of Japan which have led some fans to wonder if Atsu may use subterfuge as a Geisha in Yotei. Her well-kept nails also lend to this theory as they looked pretty nice for a roaming Ronin who’s just committed a brutal murder. Regardless, the Shamisen is an interesting choice because while it has been depicted as a weapon in some Japanese cinema, chances are it’ll instead be a replacement for Jin's Shakuhachi (flute).</p><p>Japanese attire included a ghost mask that had been repaired with a technique known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi#:~:text=Kintsugi%20(Japanese%3A%20%E9%87%91%E7%B6%99%E3%81%8E%2C,gold%2C%20silver%2C%20or%20platinum." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kintsugi</a>. Kintsugi is the practice of fixing a break using a lacquer mixed with gold, and it was a very popular repair method of the time. The gold repair hints at the history of the item and was seen as beautiful by collectors. All this makes me wonder what story the mask seen in the trailer is hiding.</p><p>That question leaves us wondering how Atsu became a wandering Onna-musha warrior, which were basically the female version of a Ronin. Of course, there have been many well-documented Onna-musha throughout history, as it was common to train women to defend their homes and children during time of unrest. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomoe_Gozen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomoe Gozen</a> one of the most feared <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onna-musha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onna-musha</a> warriors of all time has been well documented, and while she is more of a legend who’s authenticity is debated, there are still plenty of documents about women going to battle in Feudal Japan. I imagine Atsu would be inspired by one of those stories.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghost-of-ytei-announce-trailer-ps5-games-11-54-00-01-04-17-still001-1728057550301.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Translation: "Wanted List. We have 100 Ryo rewards for this woman's head. There are rumors that she was witnessed on Mount Yoteizan. 28 or 29 years old.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For this time period, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodo-dono" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yodo-dono</a> stands out to me as she has often been portrayed as fighting against the Tokugawa Shogunate. Yodo-dono was a concubine for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a>, and gave him two children. When Hideyoshi died in 1598, she was very powerful as the mother of Hideyoshi only heir. She declined meetings with the Tokugawa clan. Rebuilt Osaka Castle with a bell that read "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodo-dono" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyotomi's force will rise again</a>" and let's just say that was not received well by Ieyasu. It’s said that she resisted Tokugawa until she met her end in Osaka castle by committing suicide with her son.<strong> </strong> She’s an interesting character of the time period, who could make good inspiration for Atsu and has been portrayed many times in Japanese films, but I digress.</p><p>The bigger question for Atsu is why is she wanted? The sign we see in the trailer reads: “Wanted List. We have 100 Ryo rewards for this woman's head. There are rumors that she was witnessed on Mount Yoteizan. 28 or 29 years old.” Ryo isn’t the modern currency for Japan, but, let’s just say that’s a large bounty by today's standards.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Wanted List. We have 100 Ryo rewards for this woman's head. There are rumors that she was witnessed on Mount Yoteizan. 28 or 29 years old.”</p></div><p>Why does she have a list of names on her waist? The list reads Demon, Fox, Dragon, Spider, Snake, and Saito. Snake is crossed off with blood near the end of the trailer. Does that mean she has eliminated whomever Snake is? And who sent her and why is she on this quest?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/04/ghost-of-ytei-announce-trailer-ps5-games-11-54-00-02-16-04-still033-1728057183961.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The text reads Demon, Fox, Dragon, Spider, Snake, and what looks like the family name Saito.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Still think your the hunter?” is the final quote we hear before Atsu defeats her enemy, and it leaves me wondering… where did she get those toys? Atsu uses the niten'ichi, or two sword style, Miyamoto Musashi popularized and which roughly translates as two heavens as one. It appears that she has a Katana in one hand and a Wakizashi in the other. She also wields an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arquebus#:~:text=An%20arquebus%20(%2F%CB%88%C9%91%CB%90rk,arquebus%20is%20called%20an%20arquebusier." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arquebus </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanegashima_(gun)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanegashima rifle</a> with a Serpentine matchlock and is shown with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusarigama" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kusarigama</a> twirling around the chain. Other weapons spotted in the trailer include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cdachi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odachi </a>teaser, indicating there will be even more to master in Ghost of Yotei.</p><p>Of course, we have other questions about the game, like if hot springs will make a return, or if the crest that we see slashed will wind up being an homage to the Toyotomi clan that was wiped out. Time will tell. For now, the history, turmoil, and drama surrounding Ezo, the Ainu and the Tokugawa Shogunate has me hyped for Ghost of Yotei. Let’s see what you’ve got, Sucker Punch!</p><p>A special thanks to...

Torishima then starts to talk about content ratings abroad, and the difficulties of getting stuff approved in the U.S. “It really came from the West; a way of approaching sex education with a religious concept exists in America, doesn’t it?” Torishima said according to <em>RPG Site.</em> “Their way of thinking on compliance is really very narrow.”</p><p>Then Horii, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-yuji-horii-new-story-1851589755&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-yuji-horii-new-story-1851589755">who is contributing new story elements to the remake</a></span>, seems to bring the conversation back to <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. “You can also choose a male or female [version] of the protagonist, but we cannot write it as ‘choose from Male or Female;’ it became ‘Type 1 &amp; Type 2.’ he says according to <em>RPG Site</em>. “I wonder who the heck are going to complain about ‘“Male and Female?’ I don’t understand.” That part of the extended conversation was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/saou0345/status/1840243748007219257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/saou0345/status/1840243748007219257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately clipped out on September 29</a></span> and spread like wildfire online among critics of the <em>Remake </em>changes. </p><p>That’s when Elon Musk found it. “This is insane,” the tech billionaire, who has become like a moth to the flame for anti-woke engagement bait, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840620975248785486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1840620975248785486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X (formerly Twitter) September 30</a></span> in a quote of the clipped conversation. It was unclear which part specifically he was referencing, but it helped the soundbite break containment. Two elder statesmen of manga and video games (both Torishima and Horii are in their 70s) seemed to be vindicating the quiet outrage on certain forums and YouTube channels about the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> cuts, and a broader conspiracy about quiet censorship of Japanese games and entertainment. </p><p>So far, all of this was as predictable as the sun. It’s what happened next that got weird. Naz Chris, the original interviewer, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NazChris_dj/status/1841688282746519843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NazChris_dj/status/1841688282746519843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on October 2</a></span> accusing the clips of mistranslating part of the conversation and taking it out of context. Valute News, one of the X accounts that originally shared translated remarks of the footage, deleted the post and apologized. </p><p>“I would like to sincerely apologize for the incorrect English subtitles created for Mr. Kazuhiko Torishima’s statement,”<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/saou0345/status/1841740043884626353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/saou0345/status/1841740043884626353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a statement from the account read</a></span> on October 3. “In the scene where he mentioned ‘Puritan,’ it was mistakenly translated as ‘sex education.’ This error was due to my mishearing. I deeply apologize for any inconvenience caused to all parties involved.”</p><p> The Twitter account for the radio program Horii and Torishima host together also responded, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/KosoKoso_hoso/status/1841681747786006615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/KosoKoso_hoso/status/1841681747786006615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">putting out a statement</a></span> calling on people to stop spreading clipped parts of the conversation and suggesting the content had been mistranslated and misconstrued. The substance of the dispute seemed to hinge on the use of “sex education” instead of “Puritan.” It’s unclear what meaningful difference that would have made to the overall meaning, however, especially Horii’s remark about the remake changing the gender labels. </p><p>For anti-woke gaming conspiracists, this reaction is the best of both worlds. The initial conversation seems to validate their original criticisms of the changes while the apparent damage control efforts after the remarks escaped into the wider internet are now being treated by some as evidence of some kind of coverup. What does Square Enix think of all this? The publisher declined to comment. </p><p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>is out on console and PC on November 14.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> SILENT HILL 2 - Launch trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As for the rest of the world, Silent Hill 2 will become available for purchase on Steam and PlayStation 5 at the following times:</p><p><strong>São Palo (GMT-3)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 1 AM</p><p><strong>London (BST)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 5 AM</p><p><strong>Paris (CEST)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 6 AM</p><p><strong>Warsaw (CEST)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 6 AM</p><p><strong>Istanbul (GMT+3)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 7 AM</p><p><strong>Riyadh (GMT+3)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 7 AM</p><p><strong>Hong Kong (HKT)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 12 PM</p><p><strong>Tokyo (JST)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 1 PM</p><p><strong>Sydney (AEST)<br></strong>PS5: 12 AM<br>Steam: 3 PM</p><p dir="ltr">Curiously, Bloober Team listed the game's launch times by city rather than by country, and the announcement does not include launch dates for cities located in Canada, India, Africa, Central America, most of Eastern Europe, or the majority of South America. Still, it's possible more launch times will be announced in the next few days.</p><p dir="ltr">Anyone hoping to play the game on Xbox will have to wait quite a while, however, as Bloober Team has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-playstation-console-exclusive-for-at-least-a-year/1100-6526604/" data-ref-id="1100-6526604">Silent Hill 2 will remain exclusive to PlayStation consoles for at least a year</a> post-launch.</p>

Larian is in another of its celebratory moods, applauding the barnstorming - and apparently record-smashing - success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mods on consoles just a week after their arrival.
</p>
<p>
While Baldur's Gate 3 has had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings">official mod support on PC</a> since August - giving players access to a new Mod Manager and a range of official modding tools - it's only been available to console and Mac players since the beginning of October.

And it looks like players have been going wild following their arrival on new platforms, with an <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1842245853307650426">infographic shared on Larian's social media channels</a> revealing over 1.7m mods were downloaded in the first 24 hours of release on consoles. That is, admittedly, just a fraction of the 22m mods that have been downloaded since Baldur's Gate 3's Patch 7 launched for PC in August, but it's an impressive start all the same.

<p>
According to Larian's figures, that means over 40 percent of Baldur's Gate 3 players have now dabbled with mods since their official arrival, with over 2,000 mods having been uploaded by 768 mod creators in that time. Granted, the overwhelming majority of Baldur's Gate 3 mods are currently PC-exclusive, with a little over 70 available on consoles right now as part of Larian's curation process, but the developer does say more will continue to release.

<p>
"Thank you to the mod authors who have been bringing their creations to life with the BG3 Toolkit," Larian concluded, "and thank you to all of the players now causing chaos in Faerûn."

						<h5>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred</h5><p><span>October 8, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is set to launch just about sixteen months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-great-albeit-safe-hack-n-slash-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the debut of the base game</a>. It's a much quicker timeframe than we've seen with Reaper of Souls, the first and only Diablo III expansion, which only materialized almost two years after the base game's launch.</p>
<p>This speaks to a much greater commitment to the continued support of Diablo IV, as promised by Franchise Director Rod Fergusson, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/annual-diablo-4-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> around a year ago that players would get annual expansions. However, such an aggressive content plan inevitably has some drawbacks, particularly for the story.</p>
<p>The plot of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred's campaign continues directly from the end of the base game. After choosing to trap the Prime Evil Mephisto in the Soulstone, Neyrelle has left on her own in the desperate hope of finding a more permanent solution to contain the Lord of Hatred. Her research brings Neyrelle to Nahantu, a jungle-themed region previously seen by fans in Diablo II's third Act (although back then, it was referred to as Kehjistan, the bordering region). As teased by the pre-release trailers, Neyrelle is already being corrupted by Mephisto's evil even as she enters the region, and the situation only gets worse from there.</p>
<p>The main character (addressed as the Wanderer, like in the base game) has been trying to learn about Neyrelle's whereabouts ever she since left with the Soulstone. That suddenly changes at the beginning of the expansion, and they set out to follow her tracks, eventually reaching Nahantu. There, they come in contact with the local Spiritborns, which is a way to introduce the new class from a lore standpoint.</p>
<p>From that point onwards, the story of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred largely unfolds as you would expect, except for a major twist toward the end. The storytelling quality is, I would say, comparable to that of the base game; that is to say, very high for a game of this genre. The main difference is that it is way shorter (it was compared by Blizzard itself to an Act, of which there are six in Diablo IV). Moreover, as mentioned above, it is also somewhat of a stopgap in what inevitably needs to be a story told year by year; Reaper of Souls felt far more significant and meaty of a follow-up to Diablo III, whereas Blizzard already <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-launch-roundtable-qa-blizzard-dives-into-every-aspect-of-the-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> this is far from the latest we've seen of Mephisto, teasing future appearances in later expansions.</p>
<p>The same largely goes for the Nahantu region itself. It is around the size of Scosglen, with six Waypoints and twenty new Dungeons, not to mention several side quests, but Scosglen was just one of five regions in the base game. On the upside, it is rather gorgeous and definitely adds a biome that was fairly lacking in Diablo IV, increasing the variety in the environments.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/diablo-4-spiritborn-spirit-guardians-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Like Reaper of Souls with its Crusader class, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred also adds a new class, only this time it's something franchise aficionados have never seen: the Spiritborn. Native to Nahantu, the Spiritborns undergo a coming-of-age ritual that tests them to survive in the jungle for days on end by learning to open their "sight". They subsequently go through a metamorphosis in which they shed their former existence for their Spirit Realm self and believe their spirit will be reborn as a powerful animal guardian.</p>
<p>At its core, the class was designed around fluid combat, acrobatic movement, and a martial arts weapon fighting style. It offers four powerful spirit Guardians that allow players to fully customize their playstyles. The Jaguar is a warrior-like Spiritborn that uses repeated aggressive/fire attacks that increase in lethality. The Incarnate skill is Ferocity, a stacking buff that increases attack speed and provides a reduction to skill cooldowns.</p>
<p>The Gorilla is a defensive Spiritborn that excels at physical skills, fending off incoming damage and focusing mainly on damage reduction and blocking. The Gorilla's Incarnate skill is Resolve, which can be stockpiled and provides additional damage mitigation. The Eagle is the most agile of the Spirit Guardians, providing lightning-focused strikes while moving swiftly across the battlefield and increasing the evading capabilities. Finally, the Centipede focuses on debuffs, draining enemies of their energy with poison damage over damage over time and excelling at crowd control.</p>
<p>All Spiritborns have their own class feature called Spirit Hall, which lets players customize the build with Spirit-based bonuses. The catch is you have to decide whether to set a Guardian as a Primary or Secondary Spirit Animal, which provides different bonuses. For example, setting the Jaguar as Primary Spirit Animal has the following effects: <em>every 4th time you deal direct damage to an enemy with a Jaguar Skill, unleash additional slashes dealing 100% of the damage of the 4 hits. All Skills are now also Jaguar Skills.&nbsp;</em>On the other hand, as a Secondary Spirit Animal, the Jaguar increases Maximum Ferocity by one and lets you gain one stack of Ferocity whenever you kill an enemy or damage a Boss.</p>
<p>As a massive fan of melee combat, I landed on a build largely centered on the Jaguar with a couple of Eagle skills for good measure. It felt a lot like playing the Barbarian, albeit with its own twist. There's definitely much experimentation that can be done by mixing the Spirit Guardians, and overall, the Spiritborn is a great addition to the game's class roster.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Mercenaries-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred also adds AI companions through the Mercenaries system. You'll unlock the first one, Raheir, very early in the expansion's campaign. Raheir is the former leader of the Pale Hand band of mercs, and he'll eventually offer the Wanderer to set up camp in the Pale Hand's now deserted underground haven. Then, he'll provide pointers to the other three Mercenaries: the half-demon child Aldkin, the berserker and former cannibal Varyana, and the disgraced bounty hunter Subo. It's a ragtag group of misfits, each one introduced with a short but very interesting quest that provides plenty of background on the character.</p>
<p>From a mechanics standpoint, you can pick one Mercenary to bring with you at all times (unless you've got a full party) and another to use as a 'Reinforcement.' This is the big innovation: you can select a specific skill of one of the Mercenaries to be triggered whenever you perform a particular action. In my case, I linked Aldkin's Fireball-like skill to the activation of the Spiritborn's Vortex; they are a perfect fit since Vortex pulls in groups of nearby foes and Aldkin's Fireball deals area of effect damage and stun. For the active Mercenary, I picked Raheir, who is a very traditional tank with taunts, buffs and debuffs that are very handy.</p>
<p>As you defeat enemies throughout the game, the selected Mercenaries gain Rapport, leveling up to offer more bonuses and skill customization as well as valuable rewards and bartering currency. As you build Rapport, you can even Barter with your mercs and enter trade agreements for a chance at powerful loot and other items. One thing should be clarified: Mercenaries do not make the game any easier. Blizzard clearly worked hard to rebalance the difficulty, and if anything, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred felt a tad more challenging than the base. As such, their purpose is not to make your life easier but rather to offer more customization to your preferred playstyle. You'll have to try out different combinations to find out the best way to complement your build with Mercenaries.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d4-runeword-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred features yet another major new system: Runewords. Longtime franchise fans may recall it from the days of the revered second installment, although this version is a bit different. Runewords are mainly about accessing the skills of other classes or augmenting your movement or attack speed. At launch, there are 17 runes of Ritual and 28 runes of Summoning Runes available. To create a Runeword, players must combine a rune of Ritual with one of Invocation. The Ritual rune sets which action will trigger the effect, while the Invocation rune lets you select the effect. For example, the first Runeword I crafted provided a critical hit chance bonus after my character performed the Evade (dodge) action.</p>
<p>Runes operate on a resource system called Offering, which is generated by Ritual runes when their listed condition is met. Conversely, Invocation runes consume this offering to activate their effects. The more demanding a condition is, the more Offering the Ritual rune will generate. On the other hand, the Offering requirement to activate an Invocation rune scales with the strength of its effect. Generating more Offering than required results in 'overflow', which provides a bonus to the effects of a Rune of Summoning.</p>
<p>Runewords are crafted at the Jeweler NPC. Since you need two runes, a Runeword can only be added to an item with two sockets, like chest, leg, and two-handed weapon. The developers have also added an extra socket to helm items, so they may also host a Runeword. Last but not least, Runes come in three rarities: Magic, Rare and Legendary. The higher the rarity of a rune, the more powerful its effect will be, exactly as you would expect. Needless to say, you will be sacrificing the option to insert gems into those sockets. However, from what I've seen, it should generally be worth it. Runewords are another interesting way for players to complete their build with something they were perhaps lacking, and Blizzard can surely add a lot more depth to it over time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/d4-dark-citadel-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For endgame players, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred introduces a new cooperative dungeon experience called Dark Citadel. Whereas the regular dungeons are perfectly playable solo, the same is not true of the Dark Citadel, which expects players to have a group of at least two. Blizzard also promised complex boss fights that require coordination (thus the addition of a new Marker system) and situations where the party has to split forces and traverse separate paths for a while.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't check out Dark Citadel during the few days of pre-release access. That's partly because Blizzard decided not to provide any preset characters, so we had to level up from the beginning. It's also the main reason this review is currently not final yet.</p>
<p>For now, though, Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is a solid expansion that is perhaps not heavy on content but more than makes up for it with many systemic changes that will elevate the whole game for years to come.</p>
<p>One last tidbit about the PC version. As listed in the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140808/diablo-iv-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a>, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation and Ray Traced Foliage do not work right now. While the loss of Ray Traced Foliage is trivial, the same cannot be said about DLSS Frame Generation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-boosts-diablo-iv-low-frame-rate-by-nearly-50/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided a sizable performance boost</a> (especially to frame rate lows) to owners of the GeForce RTX 40 GPU series. Hopefully, it will be fixed soon.</p>

            <p>I'm on a one-man mission to destroy your productivity. Yesterday I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piece-together-a-jigsaw-of-city-streets-in-this-browser-based-daily-puzzle-game">offered you Scrambled Maps</a>, which is good for fifteen minutes of not working. 
</p>
<p>Today I offer Alphaguess, a once-a-day browser puzzle game in which you must guess a word. With every incorrect guess you make, the game tells you whether the correct answer comes before or after it alphabetically.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>It took me 26 guesses and eight minutes to find today's answer, which is not a result I'm proud of. You can <a href="https://alphaguess.com/">head here to see if you can do better</a>, and I'd wager you can.
</p>
<p>My first guess today was "muddle", because I figure it's better to open with a word somewhere in the middle of the alphabet and immediately split the possibility space in half. When I struggle it's normally because I have correctly identified the first letter or two and begin to lose sight of what's in and out of the realm of possibility. But then I am both addled and dotty.
</p><p>I regularly refer to works like Alphaguess and Wordle and Scrambled Maps as puzzle games, but I'm not sure that quite communicates their appeal. There's no lateral thought required to complete a round of Alphaguess, no deeper understanding of its rules to be gained. It's fundamentally easy, your success inevitable, and the outcome is only initially obscured because there are so many possible answers. It's no different than a friend asking you to guess what number they're thinking of between 1 and a thousand, and we wouldn't call that a puzzle.
</p>
<p>Yet I find the process of finding the correct word utterly diverting all the same, like playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_numberplate_game">numberplate game</a> on a long car journey, without the need to leave your home.</p>
<p>Credit to <a href="https://www.carolinecrampton.com/newslettersignup/">Caroline Cramptom's newsletter</a>, which linked to both Alphaguess and Scrambled Maps this past week.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Similar to <em>Dead Rising</em>, it’s by progressing through the campaign that you learn how this unhappy situation came about.</p><p>The first <em>Dead Space</em> came out in 2008, followed by a couple of well-received sequels, but then from 2013 went quiet—too quiet.

But he also looked forward to Kingdom Hearts 4, which he admitted he has little information on as of yet.</p><p>"I hope that we hear something about [Kingdom Hearts 4] sometime soon, I guess it's rumored that there's going to be another one," he said.

With that news, Osment had this to say about potentially getting ready to say goodbye to Sora:</p><blockquote>"You know, I'm sure that [Nomura] has great plans to wrap it up in a satisfying way. And I think that sometimes that's the best thing to do, even if you have something that you love and you feel like you want to play it forever, to tie it up in a nice way and not let it drag out beyond where the creator wants it to go. I think that's the way to go. And clearly there's many, many hours of gameplay for people to go back and revisit."</blockquote><p>Osment first voiced Sora in the 2002 original Kingdom Hearts and has since reprised the role in a whopping 11 games since then, in addition to providing voicework for the character in Super Smash Bros.

        <p>It's in early development</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Avatar: The Last Airbender hasn't had much luck when it comes to adaptations, whether to film or to video games. Now Paramount Game Studios and Saber Interactive are going to take a new swing at it. The pair have announced an action RPG set in the "Avatar Legends universe", the broader world and timeline that The Last Airbender and Legend Of Korra take place within.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game, which is early in development, is said to be "the biggest video game in franchise history", which wouldn't be hard, and it's being made in collaboration with Avatar's original creators.
</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like players will necessarily take control of a known character, but information <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-is-getting-a-aaa-rpg-with-saber-interactive-and-paramount-game-studios-exclusive">shared with IGN</a> said that you will "master all four elements, engage in dynamic combat alongside companions, and experience the challenges and decisions that come with being the keeper of balance in the world."
</p>
<p>Avatar: The Last Airbender was a Nickelodeon cartoon which began airing in 2005. It's set in a world where certain people from different nations can telekinetically control one of the four elements - water, air, fire, and big rocks. The protagonist is Aang, who as the Avatar is the only person with the potential to manipulate all four. 
</p><p>It's a fantastic show, particularly for the careful way it builds its character arcs, and the clear structure of its world and magic system make it ideal fodder for a video game adaptation. Despite that, it's had some underwhelming action games, an underwhelming MMO, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-skins-coming-to-smite-in-weird-crossover">some Smite skins</a> (pictured above). Legend Of Korra faired better with a Platinum-developed action game, but it as Platinum games go it was some extremely mid work-for-hire stuff.
</p>
<p>Fingers crossed this next attempt is better. Saber seemingly did <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">a good job recently in adapting Space Marine 2</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hayter was famously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kiefer-sutherland-is-the-new-voice-of-snake-in-metal-gear-solid-5">ousted from the role in 2013</a>, after Metal Gear creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> - always one to be swayed by a celebrity - controversially decided to replace him with Sutherland for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 5: The Phantom Pain. Long-time fans, it's fair to say, were not particularly happy with the move, and Hayter has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-voice-actor-david-hayter-throws-shade-on-hideo-kojima">made no secret of his disappointment</a> in the years since, saying the switch was handled "pretty badly and I've got no particular love for Kojima."
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Hayter has sparked renewed excitement among fans with a fresh <a href="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1841994392896442768">post on social media</a>, teasing, "I was in the booth today. Playing a role I’ve not played, since..." And just to make sure no-one was in any doubt where he was going with that particular wink, Hayter <a href="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1842129046991417481">followed the post up</a> with an animated gif of a dagger-wielding Snake.

Kojima, of course, has long parted ways with the Metal Gear series after an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">acrimonious split</a> with publisher Konami, clearing the way for Hayter's return. Obviously, a recording booth appearance doesn't mean Hayter is returning for anything like a brand-new Metal Gear game, and fans over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/">series' subreddit</a> aren't daring to dream quite that big just yet. Instead, most are speculating he's warming up the vocal cords to record supplementary or promotional material for Konami's upcoming Metal Gear Solid 3 remake, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, which is already confirmed to be using the original game's audio. It's also possible he could be recording a handful of new lines to accomodate new release formats.

It's also been noted (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-sparks-metal-gear-speculation-by-teasing-return-to-role">IGN</a>), Hayter will cameo as Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuEUts1Zvuo">Sonic the Hedgehog fan movie Sonic Villains</a>, but recording for that will have been completed long ago given it's out this month - and it seems unlikely he'd be doing much in-character promo work for a fan film.
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say, the purpose for Hayter's recording booth visit remains inconclusive. But with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater still set to release this year, it shouldn't be too long before we'll know what we can and can't start crossing off the speculation list.
