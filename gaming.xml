			<p>The first news from Tokyo Game Show 2024 is a new 11-minute gameplay video of UNDEFEATED: Genesis, a superhero action game made by the indie Japanese studio Indie-us Games. This is a sequel to 2019's free game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116960/UNDEFEATED/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNDEFEATED</a>, which was made by three studio members when they were still students.</p>
<p>Developed with Unreal Engine 5, UNDEFEATED: Genesis is planned to be the first entry in a trilogy. Here's the brief synopsis and overview provided by Indie-us Games:</p>
<p><em>You are an ordinary college student living an unremarkable life when you are struck by a meteor. You wake up on a mysterious planet where you discover you have been endowed with incredible powers.</em></p>
<p><em>This planet was once home to a civilization far more advanced than Earth's, but centuries earlier, a massive explosion devastated it and left it plagued by destructive mutants. Now, you must stand up for the remaining survivors and use your awesome powers to rid the planet of its violent and catastrophic blight.</em></p>

<p>If you're attending Tokyo Game Show 2024, the developer has also brought a public demo that anyone can try by heading to the Chorus Worldwide booth in the TGS Indie Corner.</p>
<p>UNDEFEATED: Genesis is currently targeting a 2026 release window for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088020/UNDEFEATED_Genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>) and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10011831/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. Chances are we won't be getting any Superman games before that date, although maybe Monolith Productions will have released its <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman game</a>.</p>

			<p>The new <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Quest 3S</a> VR/MR device was the star of Meta Connect 2024. It will launch on October 15 and be priced at $299 for the 128GB version or $399 for the 256GB version.</p>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S offers the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as the Meta Quest 3, so its performance is essentially identical. However, there are some minor differences. Beyond the lower storage (the Meta Quest 3 has 512GB), the new 3S also has a slightly lower field of view (between 89 and 96 degrees, compared to the 110 degrees of the MQ3); it uses the Quest 2's fresnel lenses instead of the pancake ones from the MQ3 (making it quite a bit thicker; it has a single display LCD instead of a dual LCD, and it lacks a headphone jack. On the plus side, the reported average battery life is 2.5 hours, which is more than the Meta Quest 3's 2.2 hours.</p>
<p>The 3S is compatible with most existing accessories, such as Elite Straps and carrying cases. However, it is incompatible with the Charging Dock, so it needs a new Compact Charging Dock.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Meta Quest 3S" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAf5M4Q0Pu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Do note that the Meta Quest 3 is also getting a price drop from $649 to $499, while sales of the Quest 2 and Quest Pro are being discontinued. All Meta Quest 3 purchases made between now and April 30, 2025 at 5 PM Pacific Time will be eligible for a free copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, the prequel in development at Camouflaj and due to launch on October 22. Additionally, Meta is gifting three months of Meta Quest + subscription, which includes access to several VR games.</p>

<p>Other big VR games shown at Meta Connect 2024 include <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro: Awakening</a>, which is out on November 7 for PS VR2, Meta Quest 3 family, and Steam VR, and <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/skydances-behemoth/5767635983306831/?intern_source=blog&amp;intern_content=meta-connect-2024-content-recap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skydance’s BEHEMOTH</a>, the new fantasy action/adventure game from the makers of The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners. BEHEMOTH is scheduled to launch on December 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steelseries-is-launching-160-gaming-earbuds-for-your-xbox-playstation-or-pc.992661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24253924/steelseries-arctis-gamebuds-earbuds-pc-xbox-playstation-nintendo-switch-release-date-pricing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>SteelSeries has created new earbuds that are designed to pair with Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch consoles, or even PCs and mobile phones. The $159.99 Arctis GameBuds include active noise cancellation (ANC), Qi wireless charging, and the ability to instantly swap between mobile Bluetooth usage and console or PC gaming. </p><p>I’ve been trying them out for the past few days, and so far, I’m impressed, but I’ll need more time for a full review.</p><p>The Arctis GameBuds look very similar to most earbuds on the market, complete with a variety of silicone tips to fit different ear shapes. SteelSeries is using a four-microphone ANC system to block out sounds while you’re gaming, and there’s a transparency mode if you want to hear the environment around you.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Arctis GameBuds fit into a wireless charging case.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>The GameBuds connect to an Xbox or PlayStation through a tiny USB-C dongle that provides 2.4GHz wireless connectivity. You can triple-tap a button on the earbuds to swap between Bluetooth 5.3 for mobile devices and the 2.4GHz wireless signal for consoles and PCs. It’s surprisingly quick at swapping the audio over, but it doesn’t support simultaneous audio over Bluetooth and 2.4GHz like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23957860/sony-pulse-explore-playstation-earbuds-impressions">Sony’s Pulse Explore earbuds</a> do.</p><p>I’ve been immediately impressed with the EQ settings in the mobile companion app. It includes more than 100 audio presets for popular games like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em>, <em>EA Sports FC 24</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Valorant</em>. These largely mirror the same EQ presets that can be found in SteelSeries’ GG desktop PC app with Sonar, and the results are impressive in games like <em>Valorant, </em>where you need to hear every footstep possible.</p><p>You can also toggle ANC and transparency modes in the mobile app or adjust the level of how much noise is being canceled out or allowed in. Both the mobile and desktop SteelSeries apps will allow you to control these settings and show the battery life levels for each earbud and the charging case.</p><div><figcaption><em>The GameBuds come with a useful mobile app.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>The ANC does a good job of filtering out sounds around you if you’re playing music or a loud game, but you’ll still hear some ambient sounds if you have the volume low or your game doesn’t have a ton of audio.</p><p>SteelSeries promises that the charging case delivers 40 hours of battery life, with 10 hours for each use and three extra charges thanks to the case. I’ve found that the battery drains at around 10 percent an hour using the 2.4GHz connection, so the battery life looks like it will be solid. The case also offers wireless Qi charging (not Qi2) and a USB-C connection at the rear that will provide around three hours of play with 15 minutes of fast charging.</p><p>While the GameBuds work across consoles and PC, there are separate models for both Xbox and PlayStation. If you purchase the PlayStation model, it will only work on Sony’s consoles, PC, and mobile, but the Xbox version works across all platforms. The Xbox variant includes an additional chip to adhere to Microsoft’s security policies and a slider button to switch to Xbox compatibility. The white model is exclusive to PlayStation, and there is a black variant for both Xbox and PlayStation.</p><div><figcaption><em>There is a black version of the GameBuds for Xbox players.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>SteelSeries is entering an increasingly crowded earbud market for gaming, going up against Sony, Razer, and Logitech. The $159 price of the Arctis GameBuds is less than the $199 Sony asks for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23957860/sony-pulse-explore-playstation-earbuds-impressions">PlayStation Pulse Explore</a>, and the GameBuds even include the ANC support that Sony surprisingly omitted. Sony offers ANC on its $199 InZone Buds with impressive 12-hour battery life, but those still lack the wireless charging case that SteelSeries provides.</p><p>While the $149 Razer Hammerhead HyperSpeed buds include ANC, they only deliver three hours per charge. Logitech’s $179 G Fits have better battery life at seven hours but lack ANC. SteelSeries has clearly found a gap in the market where it can offer low-latency earbuds with Bluetooth connectivity, a mobile app, ANC, and a wireless charging case, all for $159.</p><p>The Arctis GameBuds are available to preorder today in black and white versions, priced at $159.99 (€169.99). The GameBuds will be released worldwide on October 29th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From now until April 30, 2025, while supplies last, the Quest 3S will come bundled with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a Quest 3-exclusive action game that pits the Caped Crusader against the Rat King. The Meta Quest 3S launch bundle is available in both storage configurations: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">128GB for $300</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">256GB for $400</a>.

Just like with the Quest 3, you'll get a pair of Touch Pro controllers that support gesture controls to navigate menus. Battery life, according to Meta, is slightly better with the Quest 3S, with an average playtime between charges of two-and-a-half hours instead of two hours with the regular Quest 3.</p><p>Where it cuts costs is with the lenses. The Quest 3S is fitted with the 1832 x 1920 fresnel lenses found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the pricier Meta Quest 3 has 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for improved resolution and clarity. In addition to the lower-resolution lenses, the Quest 3S drops the depth sensor and has a narrower field of vision.</p><p>You can check out the Meta Quest 3S bundle details as well as an upcoming Quest 3 bundle below.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2691" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Meta Quest 3S Preorder Guide" data-collection="" title="[Various] Meta Quest 3S Preorder Guide">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vega-1-Meta-Quest\/dp\/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Meta Quest 3S (128GB) + Batman: Arkham Shadow Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Vega-1-Meta-Quest\/dp\/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDK1WM9K?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$300</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The base model 128GB Meta Quest 3S costs $300, the same price as the now-discontinued Meta Quest 2.

The new Batman game releases October 22, one week after the Quest 3S arrives.</p><p>The limited-time Meta Quest 3S bundle also comes with three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription program that normally costs $8 per month. With Quest+, you get two free games each month (valued up to $50). Even if you cancel your subscription, you get to keep those freebies. If you're new to the Meta Quest ecosystem, you're essentially getting seven free games with the purchase of the Quest 3S. Since the Quest 3S launches in October, you'll get two free games each month through the end of the year.</p><p>Amazon also has a bundle that includes the Elite Strap, one of the most popular first-party accessories for Meta Quest headsets. The Elite Strap replaces the default band and is designed to provide better weight distribution to minimize pressure on your face. The strap is fitted with a dial that allows you to make quick adjustments.</p><p>You can preorder the Meta Quest 3S bundle with the Elite Strap for $365.73 at Amazon. If Amazon drops the price bundle prior to launch, you'll pay the lowest price offered when your preorder is shipped. If you're unsure about the Elite Strap, you can buy it separately later on.

			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the latest game developed by ATLUS. At the Metaphor Launch Event in Tokyo, Studio Zero Game Director Katsura Hashino announced that the Prologue demo for the game is now available. At the time, it was only available on Xbox, but the demo is now available on PlayStation and PC.</p>
<p>By playing the Prologue demo, players will get a taste for some of the early-game narrative, as well as get to explore the city that players will eventually learn about in the full game. The demo also allows players to explore some of the social elements in the game and engage with some of the characters that will make appearances in the rest of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metaphor: ReFantazio — Demo Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zItvCKVaUrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Prologue demo, the journey begins, showing the player how to begin the journey of lifting the prince's curse. In addition, it gives players access to the first four dungeons and the ability to unlock seven of the 40+ classes that are known as Archetypes in the game.</p>
<p>In terms of social aspects, in the prologue, players will meet six followers, some of whom are party members who will support them on their journey in the game.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is a new fantasy RPG in a new universe, created by the same iconic game developers who created Persona 3, 4, and 5. In this game, players are in charge of writing their destiny and have to work to rise above their fear to take the throne.</p>
<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-gamescom-hands-on-a-jrpg-hit-in-the-making/">will launch on October 11, 2024</a>, on Xbox Series X|S, Windows, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Steam. Players can obtain multiple pre-order versions, including a Collector's Edition that features an artbook and plenty of BGM DLCs as they are released.</p>
<p>To celebrate the demo being released for Metaphor: ReFantazio, a Prologue demo trailer was released so players can see what they are getting into if they decide to jump into the demo. Additionally, all progress made in the demo will progress to the full game if <a href="https://metaphor.atlus.com/index.html?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you purchase</a> the game. This will allow you to get a head start in Metaphor: ReFantazio, and aid you on your journey through the United Kingdom of Euchronia. The demo is just under two minutes long and showcases some of the features players can explore in the game.</p>
<p>Although the demo is only the prologue, it's still a whopping 58 GB download, with the full game being roughly 93 GB to install.</p>

<p>It is a sad day when one of the best esports players to ever live retires from the competition. Topson, the popular Dota 2 competitor, is officially making his exit from the competitive Dota 2 scene. This comes just after he and his team got third place at The International 2024. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-topson-announces-retirement-from-dota-2-competitive-scene">Topson Announces Retirement from Dota 2 Competitive Scene</h2>



<p>The gaming legend announced his official retirement from the Dota 2 competitive scene recently via Twitter on the official Tundra Esports page. The competitor, who has been competing for Tundra Esports for quite some time now, gave some insights into why he will be leaving the Dota 2 competitive world.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>From standing in at TI12, to getting third place at TI13</p><p>Pogson, Godson, Dadson – Topson 🥹<br>After many patches, countless tournaments and some crazy picks we will have to say farewell to Topson as he retires from competitive Dota</p><p>Thank you for everything and all the best. 💙 <a href="https://t.co/dE6Va6zj5T">pic.twitter.com/dE6Va6zj5T</a></p></div>— TUNDRA (@TundraEsports) <a href="https://twitter.com/TundraEsports/status/1838609775266820446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>“I have always loved competition,” said Topson in the video posted on Twitter announcing his retirement. “All my life, though, has been about Dota. I think this year has given me a lot of clarity about my future.”</p>



<p>The rest of the video was filled with heartfelt moments, showcasing Topson’s victorious career. The competitor has seen his fair hair of Dota 2 action over the years, with various iconic moments competing in The International events and more.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-3rd-in-the-international-to-retirement-topson-makes-his-official-exit">From 3rd in The International to Retirement: Topson Makes His Official Exit</h2>



<p>Earlier this year, Topson and his team, Tundra Esports, walked out of The International (TI) 2024 tournament with third place. While this may not seem as impressive as a feat compared to the teams that got first and second, the competitor has one of the most decorated careers within all of esports.</p>



<p>Not only has he competed in various TI events, but he also got first place back in The International 2019. </p>



<p>With millions in earnings under his name, Topson has built one of the greatest esports careers from the ground up, showing heavily what perseverance and hard work can do for a career. </p>



<p>Topson, you will be missed.</p>

<!-- cache hit 3:single/related:7886b1c7e92720ef3b1965682fd699d0 --><!-- empty -->
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, the long-anticipated next major release in the popular historical, open-world game franchise, has been moved back from its previously announced November 15, 2024 release date.</p>
<p>The new date is February 14, 2025, according to an open letter <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1838971189722562906">posted to X</a> by franchise executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté. "We realize we need more time to polish and refine the experience, pushing further some of our key features," Côté wrote. "As such, we've made the decision to postpone the release date."</p>
<p>He went on to promise a same-day launch on Steam as well as the console platforms for that date.
</p><p>Côté wrote the note to players, but a letter from publisher Ubisoft to investors <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf">went into more detail</a>. "While the game is feature complete, the learnings from the <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title," it says. "This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition, notably by fulfilling the promise of our dual protagonist adventure, with Naoe and Yasuke bringing two very different gameplay styles." (It was previously announced that the game allows players to play as two characters: a samurai warrior and a stealthy assassin.)</p>
<p>The investor note also says that "the game will mark the return of our new releases on Steam Day 1," so that's a silver lining for PC players.</p>
<h2>A precarious position</h2>
<p>The massive-budget <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was positioned as an "Assassin's Creed, but in the Star Wars universe" game and was released on August 30. However, it was met with a mixed reception. Players, reviewers, and streamers praised its meticulous, high-fidelity presentation of Star Wars locales and characters, but they criticized its stealth gameplay as repetitive and frustrating.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Among other things, the game involved lengthy stealth sequences that forced players to start over if they were discovered, but it didn't do a very good job of giving players the information and tools they needed to complete these sequences without resorting to trial and error. Shortly after the launch, one of the game's creative leads promised a patch (which arrived) that would fix one of the earlier missions, but his suggestion in an interview that the problem was simply with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/star-wars-outlaws-patches-dlc-interview">a single mission early in the game</a> rather than something more fundamental rang hollow for many players.</p>
<p>Ubisoft acknowledged publicly that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> did not meet expectations in terms of either sales or critical reception.
</p><p>It's unclear exactly which lessons Ubisoft intends to take from the misfire of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. But Assassin's Creed is its most vital franchise, so after a setback like that, the company can't afford anything other than an enthusiastic reception for <em>Shadows</em> from players. It's the first tentpole release in the storied franchise in four years.</p>
<p>Of course, this delay now means that Ubisoft's open-world samurai game will launch in the same year as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/ghost-of-yotei-the-acclaimed-ghost-of-tsushima-is-getting-a-sequel/"><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></a>, a sequel to the Sony exclusive big-budget open-world samurai game called <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> that many players felt did the Assassin's Creed formula more justice than most Ubisoft titles. <em>Shadows</em> will also launch just a few months before the planned release of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, which is likely to suck all the oxygen out of the room in gaming spaces for some time. There remains some possibility that<em> GTA6</em> will be delayed, though.</p>
<p>This is the first time an Assassin's Creed game from the main franchise has been delayed in a decade; the last delay was <em>Assassin's Creed Unity</em>, which saw its release date bump from October 28, 2014, to November 11. Despite the delay, that game launched with significant technical problems, which were mostly fixed in later updates.</p>

The place is filled with decades of Nintendo history, ranging from when the newly founded company made playing cards in the late 1800s all the way up to its current smash hit console, the Switch. But perhaps the best part of this museum is actually its gift shop, which is filled with some of the coolest Nintendo merch I’ve seen in a long time. </p><p>On October 2, after being announced in 2022, the official Nintendo Museum opens. Good luck getting in, though, as tickets are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-showcases-super-mario-game-boy-history-new-museum-2024-09-25/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-showcases-super-mario-game-boy-history-new-museum-2024-09-25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sold out for the next two months</a></span>.

Well, you live an odd life, but lucky you, Nintendo can make your (oddly specific) dreams come true. There are also Wii U items, too. Perhaps the coolest things I spotted are giant pillows based on different Nintendo controllers. Finally, I can sleep on a massive and fluffy N64 gamepad.
