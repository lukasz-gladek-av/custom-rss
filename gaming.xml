            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I like to consider myself an avid gamer, and then I come across someone like ‘timpurnat’, who has just celebrated unlocking his 15,000th <strong>Platinum Trophy </strong>on the PlayStation Network. I don’t even dwindle in comparison; I’m a mere speck in timpurnat’s overwhelming universe of completion.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, timpurnat, self-proclaimed Trophy Hunter, revealed that he’d 100% completed 15,000 PlayStation games, hitting level 999 on PSN and securing a total of 387,000 individual Trophies in his bid to become the most completed PlayStation gamer in the world.</p>



<h2 id="h-one-from-top">One From Top</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://psnprofiles.com/timpurnat/levels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PSN Profiles</a>, timpurnat sits in second place behind dav1d_123, <strong>but not by much</strong>. The number-one PlayStation gamer has 21,228,060 points on the platform with 15,489 Platinum Trophies, while timpurnat is in second place with 20,422,230 points and 15,020 Platinum Trophies.</p>



<p>Dav1d_123 boasts a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/447928-most-playstation-platinum-trophies-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Guinness World Record</a> for the most verified Platinum Trophies, which he received in December 2023.</p>



<p>In timpurnat’s fight for the top spot, the gamer has completed 16,300 games with a completion rate of 99.23%, and has earned an average of 112.2 Trophies <strong>every day</strong>.</p>



<p>I don’t think I unlock 112.2 PlayStation Trophies <strong>a month</strong>.</p>



<p>These attributes have landed timpurnat with the number-one rank in his country, and the number-two rank <strong>in the world</strong>.</p>



<p>On social media, timpurnat can frequently be seen discussing his Platinum awards in sequence, offering a tidbit about the games that he uses to climb further up the leaderboard. Most recently, he wrote about his 14,929th Platinum, unlocked for Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Nice music and easy platinum, I was surprised to see they made this one so much easier than previous entries. Even if you fail a song, you’re still progressing towards the platinum.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Timpurnat’s efforts enabled him to move up the charts on PSN Profiles, overtaking the gamer now in third place, ginko765.</p>



<p>How many Platinum Trophies have you unlocked on PlayStation? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The massive portable PC – dubbed the Abxylute 3D One – is actually based on a prototype co-developed by Intel and Tencent that was demoed at CES earlier this year.</p>

<p>Retailing for "under $1,700" according to the manufacturer, the Abxylute 3D One will be powered by an Intel Lunar Lake chip and will boast 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM and a 120Hz display.</p>
<p>According to The Verge, Abxylute claims that the device will be "specifically optimized" to play 50 of the top games on Steam in 3D.</p>
<p><a href="https://abxylute.com/products/abxylute-3d-one">When you visit the official site</a>, it's startling to see that Abxylute is using <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Super Mario Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Fire Emblem: Awakening</a> to promote the device—two games that aren't available officially on anything but Nintendo hardware.</p>
<p>It would seem that the company is subtly promoting the Abxylute 3D One's emulation capabilities – after all, this <em>is</em> a PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-duckov-preview-i-plucked-this-beak-biting-eggstraction-shooter-and-it%E2%80%99s-no-yolk.1279377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’d told me that one of the gems of my Gamescom experience would be a parody extraction shooter themed around <strong>birds</strong>, I’d probably have believed you, because I <strong>gel </strong>with games like Escape from Duckov. This title wins points for the name alone, but there’s <strong>a surprising </strong>amount of meat on this bird, even if it has a few glaring and somewhat fowl flaws.</p>



<p>I promise I’ll stop the bird-related puns now.</p>



<p>Join me and we’ll take flight (sorry) with a full Escape from Duckov preview, pecking away (sorry) at the layers of this developing game that might just hatch (sorry) into something beautiful.</p>



<h2 id="h-extreme-bird-bashing-action">Extreme Bird Bashing Action</h2>



<p>Following my week at Gamescom, I sat down with a demo of Escape from Duckov and took a deep dive into everything this satirical extraction shooter has to offer. What I wasn’t expecting was a thoroughly enjoyable game that’s a little rough around the edges but stacked with hilarious potential.</p>



<p>In Escape from Duckov, you control <strong>a bird</strong>. When you start playing the game, you’re able to customise your bird, opting to pick a pre-designed all-yellow chick or create something utterly bizarre. The sliders give you full freedom to flex your imagination, and the resulting build can see you becoming <strong>a walking beak</strong>.</p>



<p>I mean…</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>When you’re ready to go, you’re plunged into the world of Escape from Duckov, which is, of course, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-revealed-game-is-not-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently received a full release date</a> after eight years in beta.</p>



<p>In Escape from Duckov, you follow a simple gameplay loop:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enter the world</li>



<li>Loot, shoot, and survive</li>



<li>Extract again</li>



<li>Rinse and repeat</li>
</ul>



<p>As you explore the small, cartoony, and charming maps, you’ll find a vast variety of items that you can use to build stations and creature comforts in your hideout, sell to traders, or use to complete quests. There are stacks of side missions to complete, which are represented by a relatively diverse selection of objectives.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="It’s a perfect day for an adventure! | ESCAPE FROM DUCKOV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-VqL4FBFrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I was genuinely surprised by how <strong>violent </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-competitor-duckov-new-trailer/">Escape from Duckov</a> is. Taking a bat or a gun and attacking enemies (dogs and other birds) results in an explosion of blood and gore, which dissipates to reveal something that resembles a cooked chicken on a plate, which is the ‘loot box’ of defeated enemies.</p>



<p>If you die at any point, the typical extraction shooter formula kicks in and you’re booted back to your hideout, which in this case is a bunker. You’ll have lost everything you took with you and picked up, but you’ve got a chance to run back to where you died and collect your dropped gear.</p>



<h2 id="h-similarities-run-deep">Similarities Run Deep</h2>

<p>Escape from Duckov is a carbon copy of Escape from Tarkov in <strong>many ways</strong>. First, there’s the name – that’s pretty obvious. As I played, I noticed themes, iconography, mechanics, and even <strong>map names </strong>that mimicked Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>The opening map is named Ground Zero, which is one of the ‘starter maps’ in Escape from Tarkov. Many of the weapons, such as the PM Pistol, AKS74, and TOZ shotgun, are mainstays in Escape from Tarkov, and Duckov players escape their raid by finding a green flare and standing in a zone for a few seconds, which is <strong>identical </strong>to most Tarkov extractions.</p>



<p>Even the trader, stash, and mission systems are reminiscent of Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Because of all this, it’s impossible to take Escape from Duckov seriously, no matter how entertaining the gameplay loop is or how genuinely satisfying the combat is.</p>



<p>There are differences, of course.</p>



<p>Escape from Duckov utilizes a ‘top-down’ kind of perspective, while Tarkov is a first-person shooter. Duckov also has a ‘fog of war’ mechanic on higher difficulty levels, which means you can only see in the direction your character is facing. On that note, it’s important to stress that Duckov has several difficulty tiers to suit the individual playing the game.</p>



<p>Also, Escape from Duckov is (for now) entirely single-player.</p>



<h2 id="h-imperfection">Imperfection</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Duckov shines in some areas, such as the charming visual palette, the combat mechanics, and the customization elements, plus you get to run around with a puppy dog companion, which is fantastic. The hideout building system shows great promise, and there are plenty of tasks to complete, even at a demo level.</p>



<p>I also know that expansions, including new maps, are already planned.</p>



<p>However, the demo was riddled with issues related to the UI, menus, and accessibility elements like subtitles. Many tasks and conversations had their subtitles replaced with placeholder text, which is pretty tough considering the game isn’t voiced. The difficulty balancing is also a little skewed at times.</p>



<p>There are a few elements in Escape from Duckov that don’t make much sense. For instance, you can find teleportation points around the map that shoot you across the way to another site for no real reason. I’m sure there’s <strong>something </strong>in there to explain why these exist, but I’ve not noticed anything yet.</p>



<p>I can’t see anyone sinking more than a few hours into Escape from Duckov, but it would do much better if it had PvP features woven into it. Perhaps that’s a deliverable further down the line after basic considerations like subtitles and a clean UI.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: Delta is not the first remake of Metal Gear Solid 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the two decades since Metal Gear Solid 3 first HALO-dropped into our hearts, Konami has reissued, remastered, and remade Hideo Kojima’s tactical espionage opus more than a few times– adding to, subtracting from, and significantly changing Snake’s adventure in the nonexistent jungles of the Soviet Union.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can dig up the raw PS2 original that hit 2004 like a tactical nuke, or feast on the more refined and rounded Subsistence. You can enjoy it on the go, or accept some sacrifices to play it on the newest tech. And if none of those get you charged up, perhaps Delta will deliver the Snake Eater of your dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty of ways to enjoy one of the greatest games ever made– but what’s the <em>correct </em>way to experience MGS3? Is authenticity the aim, or even achievable? Are we willing to lose some of its original truth in the name of enjoyability and accessibility? In short: what’s the real Metal Gear Solid 3?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your mission, Jack, is to infiltrate the various versions of this virtuous masterpiece and explore the changes it’s accumulated throughout the years, for better and for worse, beginning with...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/05/24/rewindep4-thumboov2-1684954498189.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Try to remember some of the basics of life in 2004: You’re wearing your “Vote for Pedro” shirt, rocking a Livestrong bracelet, and T9 texting your MySpace top 8 on the brand-new Moto Razr. Spider-Man 2 is <em>at</em> the movie theater, <em>on </em>your iPod Mini, and <em>inside </em>your sixth-generation console. Other games vying for your attention in this absolutely stacked year include a squad of S-tier sequels like Half-Life 2, Halo 2, and GTA: San Andreas. MGS3 hangs with them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Etched on this PS2-exclusive disc is an all-time classic. Hot on the heels of the mind-shattering Metal Gear Solid 2, Snake Eater is the platonic ideal of a prequel– an approachable action epic, with excellent voice-acting, and intricate, quirky game systems. It’s the perfect on-ramp to the Kojima experience and it easily deserves our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/11/17/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">contemporary score of 9.6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the game is about all you get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first release of Snake Eater had no VR missions, no multiplayer, and no bonus features beyond Snake vs. Monkey, a charming hide-and-seek minigame starring the titular simians of Sony’s Ape Escape series. Since the campaign itself is more than a hearty meal, no one much complained at the time, though there was some grumbling about the fixed, overhead camera carried over from MGS2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A top-down view worked great for the bases, tankers, and… struts of past Metal Gear games, but a lot had changed since the heyday of 8-bit Japanese PCs. The first release of Snake Eater can be aggravating at times, and the cramped perspective doesn’t take full advantage of the wide-open jungles of Tselinoyarsk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the PS2 original is the rare, unseasoned Snake Eater experience– and there’s nothing quite like sinking your teeth into the earliest draft of a masterpiece. It doesn’t get more authentic than this flawed but foundational text from which all MGS3 is derived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It only took a few months for Kojima and Konami to start tinkering with the game. Like MGS2 before it, the PAL version of Snake Eater includes a boss rush mode, cutscene theater, and the “European Extreme” difficulty level– perhaps one of the highest honors ever bestowed upon a continent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game itself was substantially unaltered, but it would see subSISTantial changes in MGS3: Subsistence.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/mgs-3-subsistence-1755271279484.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new-and-improved version of Snake Eater didn’t come as a surprise, since both prior MGS titles were followed by revised expansions. Metal Gear Solid: Integral included an entire disk of VR missions, a playable first-person view, and a bizarre photoshoot mode that has since been reborn in Death Stranding 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">MGS2: Substance was flush with bonus content, including non-canon, largely silly Snake Tales to appease the angry anti-Raiden army. The game itself received lots of subtle refinements, though nothing near the extent of MGS3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With MGS3: Subsistence, the Snake Eater experience is now composed of double disks, with a second DVD bursting with bonus material, as well as new ports of the original MSX games– including the first official localization of the magnificent Metal Gear 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if that wasn’t enough bang for your buck, the so-called “Persistence” disc also includes a full-fledged online multiplayer mode: Metal Gear Online. Other MGS games, including Delta, would offer their own spin on the PvP formula, but this is the only release of MGS3 that includes it– though the servers have been dark since 2007.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Goodies aside, it’s the massive change to gameplay that makes Subsistence such a big deal. It’s why the rerelease has been the blueprint for all future iterations of the title, and it’s a big enough deal that one could plausibly argue that Subsistence is a remake unto itself.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The new camera makes Subsistence a strong candidate for the definitive version of MGS3.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsistence incorporates a brand-new, player-controlled, third-person camera system– essentially a prototype borrowed from the then in-development Metal Gear Solid 4, and a huge improvement in terms of user experience. The game now allows you to peek around corners and scope out your surroundings, without the tedium of popping into first-person. The old way is still available as an option, though not a very appetizing one– even if some of the experience is lost in the transition:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new POV makes the game slightly easier, though nowhere near the extent to which Twin Snakes trivialized the halls of Shadow Moses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some cinematic setpieces originally contained bespoke camera shots and movements that go unseen with the new system. They’re still there, but you’d have to know about them to switch over beforehand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the wide-open Soviet jungle loses just a little magic when the camera is unshackled. Without the curated, limited angles of vanilla Snake Eater, it’s easier to see past the illusion of a sprawling wilderness and recognise the region for what it actually is: a series of surprisingly small rooms connected by loading screens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Issues aside, the new camera makes Subsistence a strong candidate for the definitive version of MGS3. It’s almost purely additive and, unlike future releases, it’s content-complete. Our more granular review scale of the era deemed the upgrade <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/10/metal-gear-solid-3-subsistence">worth two whole tenths of a point</a>, and many others would agree that it’s the better game over the original… But is it the <em>same </em>game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enhanced rerelease is a Kojima tradition at this point. Even Death Stranding has a “Director’s Cut,” although Kojima himself disagrees with that label– he prefers the term “Director’s Plus.” His expansions exist to supplement the original, not cast shade on or replace them– even though in several cases, the vanilla versions are no longer commercially available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsistence is the smoothest way to play MGS3, and it’s probably the camera the game should have shipped with. The thing is… it <em>didn’t</em>. The first release of Snake Eater remains Kojima’s uncompromised vision– and so does Subsistence. It’s up to you if you want to endure an aggravating camera in the pursuit of historicity, sans the temptation to switch to the better system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsistence remained the final word on MGS3 for five years, until another version brought Snake Eater into a new generation. Most of it, anyway.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater HD</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid: HD Collection was released in November of 2011, the same day as Modern Warfare 3, making for one interesting midnight at Gamestop. The Collection contains updated ports of MGS 2 and 3, plus a brand-new big screen version of the PSP-exclusive Peace Walker, all in glorious 720p.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snake Eater HD is based on Subsistence, incorporating the free camera while offering higher resolution, native 16:9 widescreen support, and 60 frames per second performance. The HD collection was also the first opportunity for XBox owners to experience MGS3, although that came with a massive caveat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the optimistic early years of the millennium, console manufacturers went kind of crazy with controllers. It was a big period of innovation, leading to the abandonment of wires, built-in rumble, buttons shaped like beans, and controllers modelled after TV remotes and chainsaws. Pressure sensitive buttons were an evolutionary dead end of this era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to analog sticks and triggers, the DualShock 2, 3, and original XBox controllers all utilized analog face buttons that responded to pressure, meaning instead of a simple on/off state, they can report how hard they’re pushed. Not many games took advantage of this feature, but Kojima, the man who turned the sun itself into a game peripheral, gleefully stitched pressure-sensitivity into the very fabric of MGS2 and 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To raise your weapon, lightly press the designated Weapon Button. Let go to lower your gun without raising the alarm or spending silencer health. Push it all the way in to pull the trigger. With today’s muscle memory, it’s kind of jarring to not touch the shoulder buttons while handling an in-game firearm, but it works.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The HD Collection is the first release of MGS3 to remove content from the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">MGS3’s focus on close-quarters combat adds the wrinkle of questioning enemies at the end of Snake’s blade, where one slip of the thumb can turn interrogation into exsanguination. The slightest difference of pressure is all that stands between snagging some shiny new dogtags or splattering GRU guts on your camo and losing the precious Pigeon rank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure-sensitive controls can be inelegant at times, but they’re how the game was meant to be played– a uniquely tactile, immersive mechanic that might be forever lost to history.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS3 version of MGS3 HD is the last release of the game to support pressure sensitivity. Starting with the XBox 360 release of the HD Collection, Snake Eater has replaced it with a clumsy but functional scheme that involves clicking sticks, because today’s controllers are<em> no longer capable</em> of this level of input.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Analog face buttons are expensive, and the general apathy toward them led console manufacturers to dump them like a sack of spoiled tree frogs with the seventh generation. Today’s controllers are in their haptics and internal microphone eras, and no one has shown much interest in reviving pressure controls. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not a lot can be done about an industry-wide decision to drop a feature, but it does mean we might never get a chance to experience the game like this again. Even emulation requires original, aging analog hardware to enjoy Snake Eater as it was intended. You really can’t know what it’s like unless you’ve actually <em>felt </em>it</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The HD Collection is also the first release of MGS3 to <em>remove </em>content from the game. Every single bonus feature from Subsistence is absent save for the 8-bit Metal Gears. Metal Gear Online is gone, and so is Snake vs. Monkey– a component of Snake Eater since its first printing in 2004. Sony didn’t want their Ape Escape on other platforms, and as of Delta they still don’t. We’ll get to Konami’s clever compromise soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The HD Collection replaced the lethargic framerate and hazy PS2 sheen of Subsistence with smooth performance and HD clarity. Some cutscenes don’t play super well with widescreen, and some visual effects are lost in translation, but it suits its purpose as a solid, adaptable, almost archival edition of MGS3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s just a shame Guy Savage didn’t make the cut.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/guy-savage-1755271682056.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In previous releases, after Snake is captured and imprisoned deep within the fortress Groznyj Grad, our now-cyclopic hero has the option to call Para-Medic and save his game. This, naturally, sparks a discussion about Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Snake falls asleep, and when the player loads the save again, they find themselves in a completely different video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without any explanation we are tossed into a barebones, black-and-white hack-and-slash sequence in control of a hook-sword wielding anime hunk. There’s a textured warehouse environment, a horde of zombies with rudimentary AI, and even a basic “heating up” mechanic, but the action ends after just a few minutes of mayhem and Snake Eater returns to your regularly-scheduled adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snake’s nightmare, known as the “Guy Savage” sequence, is Kojima’s trademark fourth-wall trolling at its finest. It was intended as a teaser for another game the team had been kicking around at the time, using a battle system borrowed from the never-released Zone of the Enders 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, beginning with the HD Collection, Guy Savage has been M.I.A. from MGS3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t really know why. Maybe the separate game engine proved too laborious to port. Perhaps Konami doesn’t want the hassle of licensing old concepts for a cancelled game. For whatever reason, we must endure the seemingly-permanent loss of Guy Savage– along with the related codec banter from your kooky crew of future global authoritarian overlords.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cutting an entirely missable non-sequitur fantasy sequence isn’t the end of the world, but Snake Eater <em>is </em>less <em>complete </em>without it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imagine if Psycho Mantis no longer talked your ear off about Suikoden, or MGS4 didn’t open with surreal live-action in-universe TV shows. It’s these playful, winking moments of weirdness that make Kojima games so special, and it would sincerely be a shame if Guy Savage has joined the likes of P.T., skateboarding Snake, and Sam Bridges slamming Monsties in the catalog of Kojima content that we may never see again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The MGS3 HD port was carried forward into the currently-available Master Collection, meaning it’s the only way to legally purchase and play the original Snake Eater on modern hardware. For that reason alone we would easily recommend it, especially since the game was actually delisted for a while over rights issues surrounding stock footage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best version of any game is the one you can actually play, after all, and unlike other Metal Gear titles stuck in limbo, you can own and run this extremely solid version of Snake Eater on pretty much anything. It’s not the same game that was released in 2004, but until Delta, it’s all we’ve got.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s one more iteration of Snake Eater to talk about before we reach the current day, though, and it’s one of the most interesting of all:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/mgs3-3ds-1755271834963.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Until the Switch, there’s never been a straight-up port of the core MGS trilogy to a Nintendo platform. Metal Gear is no stranger to the company, but whenever the series appears on Nintendo hardware there’s usually some sort of twist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Boy Color received a meaty 2-D throwback title, the GameCube enjoyed the extremely extra Twin Snakes remake, and Snake himself dukes it out with the Super Smash Bros. on the regular. Even the NES port of the first Metal Gear game was a bespoke, albeit wildly inferior, version that spawned a Nintendo-exclusive sequel without Kojima’s blessing, prompting him to continue the series purely out of spite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo 3DS port of Snake Eater is no exception to this trend. Snake Eater 3D isn’t simply a portable port of the PS2 title– it’s more like a full-fledged remake. Rather than cram the HD edition onto a cartridge, Snake Eater 3D applies the art, sound, and content of MGS3 to the more modern, portable-first engine of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. The differences are subtle, but quite clear in your hands.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The color scheme and character models are slightly altered, and new button prompts demystify the confusing CQC mechanics. Collectible Kerotan dolls have been replaced by Yoshi. The game takes full advantage of the 3DS’s hardware, using the onboard camera to create your own PhotoCamo, while the secondary touch screen does wonders for MGS3’s notoriously convoluted menu system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real giveaway that Snake Eater 3D is built on the bones of Peace Walker is the new movement and aiming system. Like in Peace Walker and MGS4 before it, Snake can now quickly scamper across the jungle floor via crouch walking, eliminating the need for slow crawling and tedious tip-toeing in the original versions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gone are the thumb-twisting weapon controls, replaced by a conventional over-the-shoulder third-person aiming system, complete with modern “aim with the left trigger, shoot with the right” scheme. The easier ability to move while aiming gives Snake far more mobility options during combat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That freedom combined with the rather exploitable create-your-own-camo feature, on top of the free camera from Subsistence, makes Snake Eater 3D the easiest iteration of MGS3– though it’s far from the most pleasant to play. The framerate is abysmal, the resolution is miniscule, and good luck stopping the Shagohod without a Circle Pad Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The distinct gamefeel and quality of life improvements can’t really make up for these massive downsides. Still, Snake Eater 3D is sui generis. There’s no other version quite like it, and it’s worth experiencing– but mostly as a curiosity, provided you have access to a 3DS with two sticks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides, most of its better features have been incorporated into our final and most recent incarnation of MGS3...</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/12/metalgear-thumb-1739400146815.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta actually has a <em>lot </em>in common with Snake Eater 3D. It too grafts the story and gameplay of MGS3 onto a brand new engine, in this case Unreal 5, with the aim of updating but strictly adhering to the classic content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Peace Walker-style controls carry over from the 3DS, including crouch-walking and third-person shooting. Delta also borrows from the godlike traversal of Metal Gear Solid V for some slick new additions to Snake’s moveset, although this time around, the developers are directly addressing the balance changes by tuning up the enemy difficulty in response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snake’s camouflage is now directly impacted by the environment around him, with a coat of mud or a refreshing bloodbath helping Snake stay hidden. The clunky healing system of the original is now enhanced by wounds and scarring that persist throughout the game, as does damage to Snake’s drip.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The UI has been streamlined and the graphics given a gorgeous, if somewhat expected, photorealistic shine– but if you’d prefer a more vintage experience, the original color filters and fixed-camera controls are available courtesy of a “Legacy” mode. Like Snake Eater 3D, Delta leaves the essential aspects of the game intact and brings the gameplay up to par with the series’ evolution. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the original Snake Eater slithered into our hearts via a 4GB DVD, Delta weighs in at an eye-popping 100GB of Metal Gear greatness. Most of that can be attributed to high-resolution Unreal Engine assets, but Delta is also packed with bonus features both new and surprisingly old.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Can Delta become the definitive form of Snake Eater, or will there still be a place for the more awkward, idiosyncratic vintage versions?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Secret Theater has returned, while the multiplayer Fox Hunt mode serves as a spiritual successor to the dearly-missed Metal Gear Online. Even Snake vs. Monkey has reared its siren-toting head once more, though only on the PlayStation and Steam versions. Thankfully, XBox players won’t be left out this time: In place of Sony’s Ape IP, Konami is offering an exclusive Snake vs. Bomberman mode. We’re just one bad dream away from having quite possibly the most complete package of MGS3 <em>ever</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Twenty years from now, when someone asks which version of MGS3 to play, will the overwhelming consensus be “just play Delta?” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans are relieved that Delta’s ambitions are limited to a remaster, sticking to the original design, script, and hall-of-fame voice acting of a singular artistic achievement. Others are disappointed that it’s not a full-on reimagining of the scenario ala the Resident Evil remakes or Konami’s own Silent Hill 2, bemoaning the dated environments and annoying interstitial screens that come with such classic territory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Can Delta become the definitive form of Snake Eater, or will there still be a place for the more awkward, idiosyncratic vintage versions? If the 2004 release will always be the purest incarnation, and Subsistence holds onto its title as the best, how will history look upon Delta? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear Solid is famous for its complicated story, but ultimately it’s actually quite simple. The conflict at the heart of the series revolves around the will of the Boss– the greatest soldier in history who sacrificed everything for her country and left behind a vision of a better world. The warriors who came after her spent their lives fighting and killing each other over their own clashing interpretations of the Boss’s dream.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the end, it’s the humble, doomed clone Solid Snake who finally unlocks the meaning of her will: Freedom. The freedom achieved by respecting the will of others. The freedom to fight for causes you believe in. The freedom not to fight at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no “correct” way to play Metal Gear Solid 3, no “real” Snake Eater that obviates all the others. We have the liberty to choose the version that speaks to us the most, whether we desire a nostalgic trip to the days of Shrek 2 and The Simple Life, the jam-packed, fully-loaded final form of Hideo Kojima firing on all cylinders, or a fresh and gorgeous, fun and accessible new coat of paint that reminds us just how timeless this game truly is.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-the-complicated-history-of-all-5-versions-explained]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blood-of-dawnwalker-preview-witcher-coded-but-laced-with-stunning-vampirism.1279344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I was ushered into a replication of Svartrau Cathedral at Gamescom and sat down before a screen to experience half an hour of live gameplay from The Blood of Dawnwalker. This vampiric debut title from Rebel Wolves has sat firmly on my radar since the studio was opened, and I was beyond excited to finally see it unfold before my eyes.</p>



<p>In a guided segment, I saw combat, exploration, puzzle-solving, and cinematic sequences unravel, with the Rebel Wolves team showcasing as much of The Blood of Dawnwalker as possible in a relatively short window.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview based on that presentation.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-will-rival-the-witcher">The Blood of Dawnwalker Will Rival The Witcher</h2>



<p>Rebel Wolves took me deep into a reimagination of 14th-century Europe, complete with Gothic architecture aplenty, dark and foreboding streets, and mythical themes of monsters lurking in the shadows. I quickly learned that our hero, Coen, is one of those monsters, cursed with vampiric powers and a bloodthirsty mission to save his family before a ticking clock runs out.</p>



<p>The demo started some ways into the game, with Coen already boasting many upgrades and being around a third through his ‘time limit’ to rescue his family before the worst could happen.</p>



<p>Instantly, I could see how ‘Witcher-coded’ The Blood of Dawnwalker is. This game comes from Rebel Wolves, an all-new studio made up of a mix of talent, much of which has worked extensively on CDPR’s The Witcher franchise in recent years.</p>



<p>It was almost inevitable, but much of the UI, the combat mechanics, menus, and even music are deeply reminiscent of The Witcher. That’s not a bad thing, but it <strong>might </strong>harm Dawnwalker down the line when it’s trying to stand apart from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-witcher-4-trailer-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games like The Witcher 4</a>.</p>



<p>I can honestly say that, if nothing else, Dawnwalker will be <strong>a strong rival </strong>to The Witcher. The hybrid action-RPG flow of the game promotes skill paths and brutal combat sequences unfolding in real-time, and the addition of vampirism only makes the game more visceral and visually incredible.</p>



<p>As I watched the Blood of Dawnwalker preview, I saw Coen walk up walls as though they were floors, dart between rooftops as a cloud of smoke, and dispatch enemies with gnashing teeth and slashing claws. This is his <strong>night form</strong>, and it’s remarkable to behold.</p>



<p>In the daytime, Coen is much more human and relies more readily on swords, daggers, and traditional approaches to navigate the game’s open world environment.</p>



<p>I was pleased to note that very few bugs were present in the demo, despite Rebel Wolves offering a disclaimer warning us of the possibility. I noticed <strong>one </strong>issue, and that was when Coen chopped off an enemy’s head, and it proceeded to float away like a balloon.</p>



<h2 id="h-coen-is-already-memorable">Coen is Already Memorable</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>I found myself pulled in by Coen’s story, aided by the reiteration of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cinematic trailer</a> that was used to unveil Rebel Wolves’ The Blood of Dawnwalker in the first place. I’ve always been a fan of vampire-themed tales, and Blood of Dawnwalker hits the nail on the head in that respect.</p>



<p>As the minutes ticked by, I watched a Rebel Wolves representative explore Svartrau, hunting for a powerful sword that would be a key tool in the fight against the vampiric overlords who had claimed Coen’s family. The journey took me from a gorgeous and thriving cityscape to catacombs and tombs beneath the bustling streets.</p>



<p>I was informed that while players have a ‘time limit’, Rebel Wolves have cleverly employed control tactics to make sure users can still enjoy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-devs-quality-not-quantity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything on offer in Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. The clock will only tick down when certain tasks are completed, and you can see ahead of time how much a certain action will cost you. It’s a very transparent system, and I like it already.</p>



<p>As the Blood of Dawnwalker preview came to an end, I watched a tense boss fight unfold, with Coen battling Mihai, a long-forgotten soul trapped by betrayers hundreds of years before. He uses similar techniques to Coen, which makes the fight a relatively matched battle.</p>



<p>This is where we learn more about the Dawnwalker lore, understanding how important a character Coen is and how unique his condition is to the world around him.</p>



<p>I can already promise you that Blood of Dawnwalker is now one of my most highly anticipated titles. It might remind everyone who plays it of The Witcher, but in many ways, it’s doing certain things <strong>better </strong>than CDPR, and both Dawnwalker and The Witcher 4 can exist happily in the same space.</p>



<p>Blood of Dawnwalker is slated for release in 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Are you hunting for Roblox Steal a Brainrot codes?</p>



<p>Steal a Brainrot is the most popular game on Roblox right now, tying in terms of player record with Grow a Garden. In Steal a Brainrot, players do exactly that – <strong>they steal Brainrots</strong>. If you’re enjoying this insanely popular game and are hunting for all Steal a Brainrot codes and rewards that are active <strong>now</strong>, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve captured every Steal a Brainrot code so you can unlock all the key benefits and rewards in a matter of seconds. If you’ve been trying to figure out how to use Steal a Brainrot codes, I’ve covered that too.</p>



<p>Read on to see all the latest Steal a Brainrot codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-steal-a-brainrot-code-in-roblox-august-2025">Every Steal a Brainrot Code in Roblox (August 2025)</h2>



<p><strong>It might sound bizarre, but there are no Steal a Brainrot codes in August 2025</strong>. Since the game was released, the developer ‘Brazilian Spyder’ has neglected to provide a function for redeeming any reward codes in Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<p>The only way you can unlock Brainrots in this game is to steal them from other players, which is the core gameplay loop of Steal a Brainrot.</p>



<h3 id="h-will-steal-a-brainrot-ever-have-rewards">Will Steal a Brainrot Ever Have Rewards?</h3>



<p>It’s a good question, and I’d like to say for sure one way or another, but it’s entirely up to the developer.</p>



<p>Grow a Garden, one of the most popular games ever introduced to the Roblox platform, has <strong>plenty of codes </strong>for players to activate and soak up, but Steal a Brainrot just doesn’t follow suit. There are no codes in <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steal a Brainrot</a>, nor is there any way to redeem them.</p>



<p><strong>Yet.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-secrets-in-steal-a-brainrot">How to Get Secrets in Steal a Brainrot</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As there are no Steal a Brainrot codes, you’re restricted to two methods when it comes to getting secret characters in Steal a Brainrot:</p>



<ul>
<li>Purchasing them using earned cash</li>



<li>Stealing them from other players</li>
</ul>



<p>Most players follow a ‘server jump’ tactic to enter a server, scan for valuable secrets, and then steal them when the owners aren’t looking. If there are no valuable secrets on a given server, players just complete a jump to another one.</p>



<p>If you’re going hard on stealing Brainrots from other players, you’ll need to buy gear to help you trap them.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you can try using a private server combined with a conveyor belt to hopefully roll a valuable secret character.</p>



<h3 id="h-most-valuable-secret-brainrots-in-steal-a-brainrot">Most Valuable Secret Brainrots in Steal a Brainrot</h3>



<p>Here are some of the most valuable secret characters in Steal a Brainrot. Be aware that the values might have changed since this guide was published:</p>



<ul>
<li>Garama and Madundung (10 Billion)</li>



<li>Nuclearo Dinossauro (2.5 Billion)</li>



<li>La Grande Combinasion (1 Billion)</li>



<li>Chicleteira Bicicleteira (750 Million)</li>
</ul>



<p>Let me know below or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> what your most valuable Brainrot is.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-steal-a-brainrot-rewards">Where to Find Steal a Brainrot Rewards</h2>



<p>The best way to find Steal a Brainrot codes is to keep this page bookmarked and check back regularly. Failing that, you can join the Brazilian Spyder Discord server for the game and hope that the developers announce the addition of a Steal a Brainrot codes function in Roblox.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tens of millions of players have flocked to Roblox this weekend to participate in a special, limited-time event backed by the two biggest games in the Roblox ecosystem. Grow a Garden, joined by the more recently successful Steal a Brainrot, have linked forces in an ‘Admin War’ event that pushed Roblox’s concurrent player count to <strong>47 MILLION+</strong>.</p>



<p>This shatters the previous record set in June, originally spearheaded by <strong>just </strong>Grow a Garden. Steal a Brainrot is the latest monumental success in the Roblox space, and it continues to soar.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-admin-war-in-roblox">What is the Admin War in Roblox?</h2>



<p>On social media, Jandel (<em>Grow a Garden</em>) and SpyderSammy (<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>) have been engaged in a digital beef to promote an Admin War event in Roblox. This event has propelled Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot to the top of the charts and the history books alike, with more than <strong>30 million concurrent players </strong>enjoying these two games alone.</p>



<p>This has now cemented Roblox as boasting the record for the highest CCU in gaming history.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7365329529675882496/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a>, Roblox Strategist James Purell noted that the recent PR issues that have set Roblox alight are doing nothing to slow the platform’s growth:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Now Roblox is officially the largest gaming platform by concurrent users and also holds the record for highest CCU game in the world.</p><p>While Roblox corporate deals with PR issues, developers like Jandel and Sammy are building experiences that millions of kids can’t stop playing. They’re the ones pushing the platform forward with innovation and community building.</p><p>Yes, Roblox 100% needs to do better on safety, but these developers are creating the content that keeps 47M people engaged. They’re the real engine behind the numbers – not Roblox corporate.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>In a similar sentiment, Atlas Creative’s CEO, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelherriger_roblox-hit-47-million-concurrent-users-this-activity-7365080265284567040-tD_J/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Michael Herriger</a>, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The future of gaming is happening right in front of us. Great job to all the devs and for Roblox for propping up great games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>No game on the market can come close to Roblox right now, which is <strong>technically </strong>more of an ecosystem than a single title. It’s unfair to refer to Roblox as ‘a game’ when it’s the most diverse UGC-backed universe in the industry.</p>



<p>Those taking part in the Admin War between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot are picking their side and soaking up the special event before the weekend is up and things return to normal.</p>



<p>Which side did you pick in the war between Grow a Garden and Steal a Brainrot? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-need-to-talk-about-x-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/opinion-we-need-to-talk-about-x-games.1279281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="X Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/568b8747adf54/x-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Most of the time, I'm pretty oblivious to game name trends. It's normally only when someone points out to me that all AAA games have names like 'Chronicle of Shadows: Rebirth', that I start to see that formula used everywhere — like when you find a trendy new pair of shoes that you swear you've never seen before, only to wear them out of the shop and see every other person styling them.</p>
<p>The way it's usually pointed out to me is when Nintendo releases a game that rehashes a title format we've seen hundreds of times before. Most recently, it was the rise of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/soapbox-the-games-industry-needs-to-give-up-on-exclamation-marks">unnecessary exclamation mark</a>, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/princess_peach_showtime">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/warioware_move_it">WarioWare: Move It!</a> made me question whether I should be shouting their final word each time I said them. This year, it's X games.</p>
<p>And no, I'm not talking about the high-octane motorbike stunt riders, long may their games continue. I'm talking about 'Forgettable x Title', 'Franchise x Franchise' and, dare I say it, 'Verb x Verb'.</p>
<p>I'm looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>. You have opened my eyes to the wonderful world of the meaningless 'X', and now I can't stop seeing it everywhere. It's reached the point where the humble 'X' can mean anything, nothing, or something in between, and I'm left wondering: why the heck are we sticking them in every game title like they're a piece of punctuation?</p>
<figure><a title="Metroid X Dread" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dcd3c3f699dd1/metroid-x-dread.large.jpg"></a><figcaption> What could have been, eh? *shudders* — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>'But Jim, aren't there more important things to be talking about? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was finally given a release date this week, you know?'</em> Yes, I do know, but I have to get this off my chest because I fear we're reaching a point where, if Team Cherry were to release its moody Metroidvania series today, it would have been called 'Hollow X Knight' and nobody would have batted an eye. That's insane!</p>
<p>Let's look at some X games that have either landed a release, announcement, or demo in the last month alone. We've got Drag x Drive, where the 'X' is pronounced "and". <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, opts for the "<em>eks</em>" pronunciation. Indie World alumni <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ball-x-pit">BALL x PIT</a> has an 'X' in the middle, and the game is pronounced "Ball Pit", for crying out loud.</p>
<p>We can go further back and see it infiltrating our brains throughout recent years. We've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> ("eks"), anime adaptations where the 'X' is completely bypassed when said out loud, regardless of how many there are (I'm looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/xenoblade_chronicles_x">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> ("eks" or "cross", depending on your region), and don't even get me started on the "ten"/"eks" discussions that come with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_x_x-2_hd_remaster">Final Fantasy X</a> series' blending of Roman and Arabic numerals. That's too many ways of saying "X"! <em>[Wait until you watch Hunter x Hunter and see the episode titles, Jim... Ed.~]</em><em><br></em></p>
<p>And this is where we hit the crux of my issue — my Big x Problem, if you will — I have no idea how to say game titles out loud any more. The addition of a middle X has left me fumbling through conversations as if I've never heard of a video game before. I can't deal with the embarrassment of accidentally recommending "Xenoblade Chronicles And: Definitive Edition" to a friend again. How was I supposed to know??</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08ab3f6566ce1/xenoblade-chronicles-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Or is the 'X' silent? "Enoblade Chronicles"? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now look, I can put my sensible hat on for a second and recognise that 'X' is a fundamentally cool and sexy letter. Marketing a game to stand out from the crowd sounds like no easy business, and if the prospect of making your title look like a cool multiplication sum is the best route to get to the top, then so be it.</p>
<p>All that I ask is that we settle on one universal sound that the 'X' represents. The <em>erg-errgh</em> 'X' sound from Family Fortunes/Feud feels a little over the top, so I'll settle on the classic "eks" for now. Either that or I'll have to keep gesturing with my forearms across my body as if I'm learning a TikTok dance every time I want to discuss the latest Sonic and Shadow joint.</p>
<p><em>Are you getting tired of Xs too, or do I need something else to worry about? Let me know in the comments.</em></p>

            <p>People are getting ready for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> in the very best way possible – by replaying the original, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, in record numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date">Ever since Silksong's 4th September release date was confirmed at Gamescom last week</a>, more and more people have been heading back into Dirtmouth, so much so that Team Cherry's critically-acclaimed game has repeatedly broken its own concurrent peak player count on Steam over the weekend.</p>

<p>Right now (and "right now" is subject to change with alarming speed), Hollow Knight's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#max">all-time concurrent peak of 39,356 players</a> was set less than an hour ago.

But before the Silksong announcement, Hollow Knight's concurrent Steam peak, set back in 2022, stood at a much more modest 20K.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will release on Thursday, 4th September 2025 for PC, Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.

			<p>During Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live, Blizzard Entertainment presented the official cinematic trailer for World of Warcraft: Midnight. Just as usual with the company's cinematic trailers, it looks stunning, but the millions of players who are still captivated by the 21-year-old MMORPG want to know more about the actual expansion (the eleventh to grace the game since its launch, as well as the second in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga trilogy</a> after <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-launch-qa-on-dungeons-raids-and-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The War Within</a>).</p>



<p>Thankfully, while in Cologne, we were able to interview Blizzard's Paul Kubit (Associate Game Director) and Jade Martin (Lead Combat Systems Designer), who kindly answered our questions on the key features and content that players can look forward to when World of Warcraft: Midnight ships next year.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Midnight | Intercession Cinematic | World of Warcraft" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>Let's start with how World of Warcraft: Midnight, the middle expansion in this trilogy of the Worldsoul Saga, differs from The War Within. </strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I would say that one of the biggest differences is the addition of a major feature like housing. Folks who come in with World of Warcraft: Midnight will see that there's a huge new way for players to express themselves and interact with one another socially, start building up collections of décor and really build up communities in their neighborhood. That's going to be the biggest way that these expansions differ. Of course, there are plenty of other ones, like the new Prey system. Unlike The War Within, which focused entirely on new areas for players to explore, we're going to be doing a little bit of revisiting in this one, which I'm particularly excited about, as we return to Zul'Aman. It will play like a new zone with brand new quests and areas to explore, but you'll also have the narrative sort of nostalgia, especially if you've got to play back during the Burning Crusade, to see what all these trolls have been up to and how their story continues twenty years after that.</p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> I think the Prey system is really cool. It's going to be a big departure from The War Within in terms of how you navigate questing. Before, questing was kind of cruise control; sometimes it may become a little bit too easy, but now we have a system where you can dictate the level of your hunt and create a unique challenge for yourself, if that's something you're willing to take on.</p>



<p><strong>What kind of rewards can World of Warcraft players expect from this Prey system?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> A bunch. There will be cosmetic rewards that come with it. There's really cool mounts and other cosmetics, but you'll also be able to expect some power rewards; it's just not purely a cosmetic feature. Details in terms of the power level of the rewards are still something the team is working on. But I can say that as you advance into the harder difficulties of Prey, if you get into Hard Mode or Nightmare Mode, the level of challenge will be close to what you see at high-level Delves, so I would expect the rewards level to be adequate to that.</p>



<p><strong>Is the Prey system meant to be engaged solo or as a group?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> In Normal mode, there are no restrictions. It is built on the questing system, so because of that, you're accepting the 'quest' by yourself, but you can join other players. It is in the outdoor world, so you'll be alongside other folks. And in Normal mode, when you finally corner your prey and are able to take them, if you have friends nearby or there's other players nearby, they can hop in and enjoy the fight with you. However, once you get to Hard Mode or Nightmare Mode, when you get to that final bit where you corner your prey and you're ready to attack them, that is a one-on-one fight where it's just you and them and whoever is better comes out alive. And so that it's kind of piece of things away,</p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> Another thing I'm looking forward to in World of Warcraft: Midnight is the Devourer Demon Hunter, who uses Void magic instead of Fel magic to defeat enemies. This will be the first midrange spec we've added in a while. Their gameplay is all about building up Void Fragments and getting into Void Metamorphosis as soon as possible. When that happens, you're continuously fighting for the ability to stay in Metamorphosis for as long as you can, ripping souls from your enemies.</p>



<p><strong>Is this a DPS class?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> Yes, a ranged DPS class.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Currently, internally, we have two ways for you to play the Devourer. You can play it purely as a mid-range caster and decimate your enemies from there, but another cool playstyle is actually dashing in and out of melee to take advantage of all the movement skills that are available to the base Demon Hunter. One of the key differences in gameplay styles is that generally, when you're playing the mid-range Devourer, it's all about staying in Void Metamorphosis as long as possible to build up as many Collapsing Stars as you can. In contrast, the dash-in, dash-out gameplay is about getting in and out of melee as quickly as possible. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Can you make some choices to customize the Devourer differently?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> Yeah. Currently, internally, we have kind of two ways that you can play the Devourer. You can play it purely as a mid-range caster and decimate your enemies from there, but another cool playstyle is actually dashing in and out of melee to take advantage of all the movement skills that are available to the base Demon Hunter. One of the key differences in gameplay styles is that generally, when you're playing the mid-range Devourer, it's all about staying in Void Metamorphosis as long as possible to build up as many Collapsing Stars as you can. In contrast, the dash-in, dash-out gameplay is about getting in and out of melee as quickly as possible. Something like playing in a Mythic Plus, that's a really nice way to play it because you're not so reliant on staying in Void Metamorphosis for a long time. So there are a couple of ways to play, and I think both are really fun.</p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> You'll have new hero talents through the Annihilator tree, which is going to be shared between the Devourer and Vengeance. Devourers will also have access to the Fel-Scarred tree, which is now just going to be called Scarred, since you're not necessarily scarred by the Fel.</p>



<p><strong>Are these two ways to play the Devourer meant to be equally efficient in PvE and PvP, or do you think they will lean more to one or the other?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> Generally speaking, I think they should be on even ground when you talk about output. Dashing in and out obviously has its own advantages when you talk about PvP, so it may naturally lend itself to that style of gameplay.</p>



<p><strong>You mentioned that there are some revisited areas in World of Warcraft: Midnight. How did you approach this kind of challenge? Some of the regions were dear to players.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It was a big challenge, for sure. Eversong Woods is a beloved zone; it has been since 2006, when it first came out in Burning Crusade. A big part of it was just delivering the fantasy of what we remember that zone to be, but with modern fidelity and level design. A lot of our work was building those familiar landmarks, the city itself, and many of the quest hubs and adventure areas in that zone, but building them in a way that looks modern. It should look like what I sort of remember this zone looking like, but it looks beautiful. It looks like what our artists are capable of these days. There's also been the story changes in this space. You may remember from 2006 the Dead Scar; this huge dead area symbolized where Arthas marched his undead army up to the gates of Silvermoon. That's been healed over now. </p>



<p>The Dead Scar isn't there anymore. In fact, most traces of the Scourge are gone by this point. The Blood Elves have perfectly manicured their front lawn and grown some nice trees, bushes, and fences over it so that it looks nice. But also the entirety of the Ghostlands, which was an entirely different zone in the Burning Crusade era, has been folded into Eversong Woods now.</p>



<p><strong>I understand Silvermoon City will still have a part exclusive to Horde players, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> That's correct. The Eastern quadrant, about a third of the zone, is a Horde district. It will have all the amenities that players are familiar with. A good two-thirds of Silvermoon City will be a shared space, and because of that, the city's boundaries have been increased significantly. It's gorgeous. We got to show a couple of shots. The Sanctum of Light in particular looks like a painting or a piece of concept art, but it is actually like what it looks like in the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>In Midnight, we're going to go into Harandar. They don't like to mix as much with outside cultures, but our cultures will come to them, and as part of that story, we will eventually convince them that Xal'atath is knocking on our front door with a big Voidstorm. It's a fight that's worth joining. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Can you tell us something about the new Allied race?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> For sure. We met the Haranir in The War Within through Orweyna, the leader of their scouts. She has a close tie to the goddess that their people revere. That's what led her to explore outside of Harandar, where people come from. Normally, the Haranir are very insular. They don't like to leave their home, and they look down on those who do.</p>



<p>In Midnight, we're going to go into Harandar. They don't like to mix as much with outside cultures, but our cultures will come to them, and as part of that story, we will eventually convince them that Xal'atath is knocking on our front door with a big Voidstorm. It's a fight that's worth joining. </p>



<p><strong>There is also some new PvP content coming in World of Warcraft: Midnight, correct?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> We have a new Voidstorm, which is technically the fourth zone of the expansion, and inside it there will be world PvP. There will be a lot of cool points to contend over for each of the factions, some really cool terrain obstacles. There's a gravity well that will pull people up, and you can actually do some damage inside there and then attack and do some very clever things, push people out a little bit with the knockback and kill them. Also taking place in the Voidstorm, but as a separate instance, there will be Slayer's Rise, the new Battleground. It is really cool. It takes a little bit of inspiration from things like Alterac Valley. It's a four-stage fight. </p>



<p>In Stage 1, you basically all emerge into the middle and fight over the middle point to try and take control of it, but if you're not into PvP and you want to explore the PvE resources, you can actually go towards the north and collect resources to funnel in allies to the middle or potentially put more materials for later in the fight that you may choose to take on the next point, which is the Stage 2, where you will take on various lieutenants. Then you continue your march onward until you get to Stage 3, which has multiple entry points. Based on your earlier decisions in the map, you are able to attack it at different points and potentially have an advantage over your enemy. And then the final one is Stage 4, where you actually fight the enemy's Dominar.</p>



<p><strong>Alterac Valley has always been my favorite World of Warcraft Battleground.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jade Martin:</strong> I think there's a lot of fond memories about Alterac Valley and I know that our PvP designers, when they were looking for inspiration, they definitely looked there.</p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> We love seeing the passion from our PvP community. We also want to grow the PvP community, which is important to us as developers, so one of the things we're also adding is Training Grounds, a new mode where you can play alongside human players against game-controlled opponents. It is similar to the Comp Stomp brawl that comes up every couple of weeks, but now this will be an always available mode for three of our Battlegrounds: Arathi Basin, Silvershard Mines, and the Battle for Gilneas. PvP can be a little intimidating, especially if you're playing later in the season. This will be a way safer place for folks to go into these Battlegrounds, to understand the mechanics and eventually become the diehard PvPers they want to be.</p>



<p><strong>Are there going to be any rewards for doing Training Grounds, or is it just the player experience that you obtain while doing it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> There will be rewards for it. These are still being worked out. One of the things that is important to us is making sure that players who are playing the more direct Player versus Player versions of these Battlegrounds still have their unique rewards available, but we should also make sure that players who are jumping into Training Grounds aren't just throwing their time away.</p>



<p><strong>Can you queue into Training Grounds as a group, or is it just solo matchmaking?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> You can queue as a group.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We have a pretty robust set of permissions that players can use to say, I am not gonna allow anyone inside my house, that is a perfectly valid thing. Or you could say, hey, my friends can come in, my guildmates can come in, or anyone at all can come in.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cool. Well, let's switch to what you pointed out as the most significant innovation of World of Warcraft: Midnight - housing. World of Warcraft players have waited a long time for this, and many other MMOs have their own version of housing. What's your approach for your community?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Yeah, we've always heard that and it is something we've been working on for several years now. It started with a couple of goals: boundless self-expression, so the players may express themselves in tremendous ways. This is also uniquely social; it's deeply social, so that you're not always just locked in your own home and not interacting with anyone else, but you'll have reasons to meet with other players and you should be happy to see other players in your neighborhood. And lastly, that this is something which is going to be around for the long term. This is a feature that we can grow over time.</p>



<p>Based on that, we've built, in terms of self-expression, a huge library of décor that the players can collect from the new Midnight zones, but also looking back to all the previous expansions and all the cultures that we discovered there, there should be lots of really cool stuff that players can collect and express themselves. Then there are the tools players use, which is another way we let them express themselves. There's a basic mode tool, which is very much a snap-to-grid mode where stuff goes where you expect it to go.</p>



<p>We've also added an advanced mode, which adds the ability to scale things, tilt them, and pitch them. You turn gravity off if you want to move things up into the air and have them floating, and we've already seen people here at the Hall interacting with these tools and things. Earlier, some people made upside-down rooms with chandeliers on the floor and chairs on the ceiling, and it looked like you were walking down the ceiling of a room. I can't wait to see how players unleash their creativity.</p>



<p><strong>Some games let you unlock a bust, for example, of a boss you defeated and put it in your home, so can you put a bust of Onyxia (or any boss) in your house?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I'm glad you asked about Onyxia. Yes, you can kill Onyxia, get her head and put it on the wall. In addition, you are not limited to hanging one. We want to make sure that players are able to have as many of like. There is a vendor in Mudsprocket, a goblin vendor who sells Onyxia heads. The vendor guarantees that they're real, but we don't really think that they are real. We believe he pieced them together from something else, but after you legitimately get your first kill, removing it from the body of Onyxia, you can get additional ones. If, for whatever reason, you want to have a whole wall covered with Onyxia heads, that will be possible.</p>



<p><strong>You talked about being able to visit other players' houses. How is it going to work? Can you give permissions to people on your friends list or your Guild?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> That's exactly it. We have a pretty robust set of permissions that players can use to say, I am not gonna allow anyone inside my house, that is a perfectly valid thing. Or you could say, hey, my friends can come in, my guildmates can come in, or anyone at all can come in.</p>



<p><strong>What can you share about the World of Warcraft: Midnight dungeons at this point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> We have eight dungeons coming in with the expansion. Some of my favorites are Murder Row, which was previously a smallish district inside Silvermoon City. It has now been expanded into a whole dungeon. Within the context of this dungeon, you are investigating a mystery. You hear rumors that someone is practicing fel magic inside the city, and that investigation leads to a grand conspiracy, which has you chasing down the warlock and the demons he's summoning along the way. It's really cool. On the other side, we have the Den of Nalorakk, which is actually one of the dungeons that you play through as part of the campaign. You enter Den of Nalorakk in Zul'Aman to pass the trials of the Bear of God Loa himself and earn his favor in the fight against the Void.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>We're happy to announce that some of the Delves are going to be located outdoors. Typically, in The War Within, most of our Delves are set in caves. That's not the case for all the new Delves. Some of them will be outdoors and you will be able to use mounts to move more quickly in those particular spaces</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>What about any new Delves?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Delves are indeed coming back; they weren't simply a The War Within feature. We're happy to announce that some of the Delves are going to be located outdoors. Typically, in The War Within, most of our Delves are set in caves. That's not the case for all the new Delves. Some of them will be outdoors and you will be able to use mounts to move more quickly in those particular spaces. We've also changed up our follower again. She's going to have access to all three different roles; in the tank role, she's got some really cool tank mechanics around evasion to keep her alive for a while.</p>



<p><strong>Any tidbits you can tell us about the PvE raids?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> We're adding three raids in the first season. We've got the Voidspire, which has six bosses, the Dreamrift, which has one boss, and the March on Quel'Danas, which has two bosses. The first reason for the changes is just feedback from players. We've done raids with eight bosses for a while now, and it's interesting to break things up differently, so you should have a different profile of the raid boss, but also it'll give you a little more flexibility if maybe you have an evening where a lot of folks are on for a shorter amount of time and you can only take one or two bosses out. In that case, you can knock out one of those smaller raids. But the other reason we did it this way is because of the story; we haven't always had our raids as part of our story campaign.</p>



<p>This is because raiding isn't for everyone, especially since it can be a challenge to get 10 people together. Before we added Story Mode, it was impossible for us to include everybody in the raids' story, so we're leaning into that with Midnight. There will be a story mode version of the Voidspire, but the story continues afterward.</p>



<p><strong>Do you expect the raids to be about the same difficulty level as The War Within raids were at launch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I think so. One of the things to note is that we've changed our approach to encounter design, not only to raids but also to dungeons, with approachability in mind. The Eco-Dome Al'dani dungeon from patch 11.2 is a pretty good success case here, where it's one major mechanic. When you understand that mechanic, you know the boss. You might have to interact with that mechanic in different ways, depending on different contexts, but they're easy to understand. There's not a list of nine completely different mechanics that you need to respond to.</p>



<p><strong>Finally, why don't we discuss the quality of life updates planned for World of Warcraft: Midnight? What improvements are you making in this regard?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> One of the changes I'm most excited about is that we are changing how the transmog works, so instead of transmogrifying the item, you transmog a slot. What that means is, if you want your helmet to look like a Murloc, even if you are levelling and get a replacement helmet, it'll still look like that; you don't have to reapply that transmog.</p>



<p>This is going to save a lot of players' money in terms of keeping their looks up-to-date. It's also going to make your character look a lot cooler as you level through the game, including how you look in those cinematics. We are also adding something called Situations. You can basically program your character to look certain ways, for example, whenever you switch specs. Or maybe you want to look different ways when you're out adventuring compared to when you're at home in your house or in your neighborhood. This should give players a lot more flexibility to express themselves.</p>



<p><strong>That is pretty cool. Thank you for your time.</strong>  </p>

            <p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto has called comparisons of the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> to soulslike games "disingenuous", insisting "a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles".</p>
<p>The comment comes as more and more footage emerges in the run-up to 25th September's launch day. And while we already <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">knew</a> the combat would have a "heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>: Remake", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fandom-split-on-silent-hill-fs-soulslike-combat">fans have expressed concern about how enemies react, degradable weapons, and "soulslike" boss encounters</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/these-things-arent-new-and-exclusive-to-soulslike-games-silent-hill-f-producer-wants-to-set-the-record-straight-on-combat">IGN</a>, Okamoto – who has become a familiar face having worked on all of the games since the series was resurrected in 2022, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a> and Silent Hill 2: Remake – insists some of the things fans have seen in the videos "aren't new and exclusive to soulslike games".</p>

<p>"This is one of the things that we see – the term soulslike – being thrown around on the internet quite a bit," Okamoto said. "And I think it's a label that's a little bit disingenuous. Modern players will see like, oh there's a stamina meter, there's a dodge, and they're like, 'Okay, it's a soulslike'.</p><p>"But to be very honest, a lot of these things we actually pulled from classic Silent Hill titles. Look at Silent Hill 4 – there’s a charge meter for your attacks, kind of like our Focus meter. And even for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> there's a stamina meter. You see it later on."</p>
<p>According to IGN's interview, Okamoto "expressed a degree of frustration with the online dialogue surrounding the game".</p>
<p>"These things aren't new and exclusive to soulslike games," he added. "They've been a part of action horror games for a very, very long time. If you have these things you're labelled a soulslike. And we'd like to reiterate we are an action horror game, but we are not a soulslike."</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to this follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p><p>It's being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07, and music from the series' usual composer, Akira Yamaoka. It's set to release on 25th September.</p>

<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/746bdc6ceda36/bye-sweet-carole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone remembers the first animated movie that scared them. For me, it was <strong>The Fox and the Hound</strong> — probably not the first movie in Disney's canon that anyone remembers, but it was one of my brother's favourites, so it was on regular rotation. Which means that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5f7pv9bU-M&amp;ab_channel=Clips%2CClipsandMoreClips">the bear attack towards the end of the movie</a> has been etched into my memory. It's a terrifying scene which probably explains why I haven't rewatched it since childhood.</p>
<p>Chris Darril, director of the upcoming narrative horror-platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bye_sweet_carole">Bye Sweet Carole</a>, understands the impact of those animated movies and the effect they have on kids. It's this, along with a healthy dose of nostalgia and passion for animation, that fuels the entire game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yvrmnj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The Disney-inspirations of Bye Sweet Carole are plain to see; very frame of the game looks like it comes from the Don Bluth era of animation — and Darril himself adores movies.This love of the cinema comes from his greatest inspiration, his mother, who sadly passed away from cancer in 2021. "[Bye Sweet Carole] was conceived when I lost my mum. I needed, at the time, to link myself to that child that I was years ago."</p>
<p>One movie trip Darril speaks about fondly in interviews is Beauty and the Beast, and he tells me he saw when he was around three years old at the time, on a call a week before the release date trailer, "[My mum] told me that she never imagined that such a young boy could ever be so calm at the cinema... But there I was really calm, I was dreaming, watching this stuff."</p>

<p>Bye Sweet Carole is a homage to that era of animation — a "homage to all the people that grew up with the Disney classics, with Don Bluth's animation, but also Bluth's experimental video game <strong>Dragon’s Lair</strong>, and a lot of other games that used to have this hyper-detailed animation." And, visually, it could easily slip in with the rest of that era.</p>
<h2>Break and rebuild</h2>
<p>At this point, Darril is best known for the <strong>Remothered</strong> series, of which there are two games and a graphic novel. But, following the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/remothered_broken_porcelain">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and the loss of his mother, Darril decided to leave Stormind Games, the studio behind the series and the company he was a partner of: "I was not absolutely happy, not satisfied... you know when there is this strange feeling of bad air around and you feel like you can't breathe? At the time I lost my ambition."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"'Is this doable? Are you sure?' [laughs]"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Initially, a new game wasn't in Darril's future, he tells me, "I was really feeling really sad, of course, for a really important part of my life, I decided that I wanted to rest a little." He took a hiatus in Malta, where he rediscovered his spark thanks to a friend's discovery online — a build of Darril's first project, <a href="https://remothered.fandom.com/wiki/Remothered_Alpha_Versions">Remothered 2D</a>.</p>
<p>"[Remothered 2D] was a game that I started developing alone, on RPG Maker XP... that changed my life forever because I started working in the film industry and then I caught the interest and the curiosity of video gamers, players, and other companies." That original build that put him on the map went missing, until his friend stumbled upon it online.</p>
<p>When he got hold of the build, Darril recalls having a renewed passion, a mix between "excitement, ambition" he says. "So I told myself, take this build — I know it's really old, because it was about 2009 and 2010 — do an HD remaster. But then I wrongly deactivated a layer on Photoshop and this frame, completely flat, popped out from my screen and I said to myself, <em>'oh my gosh, the palette, the general aesthetics remind me of the colors of <strong>Snow White</strong>.'</em>"</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/61debb13e20d2/bye-sweet-carole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this mistake, Darril says that he was inspired to experiment — "not only in terms of game design, but also in terms of art direction" — to create a game inspired by the classic animated movies he grew up watching. When he formed his studio Little Sewing Machine, he recalls saying to his team "'Is this doable? Are you sure?' [laughs]"</p>
<h2>Frame-by-frame</h2>
<p>Hand-drawn animation is well known to be a difficult medium to work with — an extreme example comes from Hayao Miyazaki's Oscar-nominated movie, <strong>The Wind Rises</strong>, in which a single four-second scene <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BeAmazed/comments/1jrnjae/studio_ghiblis_4_seconds_crowd_scene_took_1_year/">took 15 months to animate</a>. So the question above seems reasonable.</p>
<p>And Darril says that it's even more difficult for video games, because "you have a lot of variabilities." <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a> --which is inspired by rubber-hose animation — took five years to make. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spiritfarer">Spiritfarer</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/skullgirls_2nd_encore">Skullgirls</a>, and upcoming titles like <strong>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/eternal_life_of_goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> all (likely) follow similar meticulous, loving processes.</p>
<p>"If you're just watching a movie — like Beauty and the Beast, Studio Ghibli's animation, The Iron Giant — you're going to watch that movie and the movie will be just that, without any alternatives." But for games, Darril and the team had to consider much, <em>much</em> more: on a character simply falling over, you have to consider how they're moving — are they walking, running? Are they tripping to the ground? How far are they falling?</p>

<p>"So you have to do thousands of extra animations just to anticipate an action by another player." And this was just for the main character, "Every frame was drawn every time." Darril tells me "Of course we have a few frames that you recycle, but every time you make a mistake, you have to redo the whole animation from scratch."</p>
<p>But the work is more than worth it, and Darril can't praise the team enough: "They did miracles" he says multiple times throughout our chat. "I really feel that there's something beneath those wonderful illustrations, those wonderful environments... And there's something which has a kind of magic that I cannot find elsewhere in any other project. This is why I make video games."</p>
<h2>Childhood horrors</h2>
<p>The Disney-style animation may have been technically demanding for the team, but it was clearly the way to go for a game with horror elements. Darril's goal was to capture those feelings people had when watching Disney movies for the first time — not just the horrifying, though that was a big part of it.</p>
<p>Which is where contradiction comes in. When you first look at the game, Darril says "You feel like in your comfort zone because you see the nice visuals, you see the little birds, Lana in her gown, and then something happens and feels so out of place."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there's something which has a kind of magic that I cannot find elsewhere in any other project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The horrors couldn't come from the typical avenues — " we didn't want any gore, we didn't want anything exaggerated, because... Bye Sweet Carol is an allegory about bullies, about the emancipation of women, so we didn't want to speculate on the typical horror contents, the stream of violence."</p>
<p>When I asked more about his intentions to invert expectations, Darril compared it to the <a href="https://www.creepypasta.com/">Creepypasta</a> phenomenon, using the example of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/piglets_big_game">Piglet's Big Game</a> (yes, really), which many have compared to <strong>Clock Tower 3</strong> or <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/silent_hill">Silent Hill</a> thanks to its <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/piglets-big-game">foreboding music and specific camera angles</a> (yes, <em>really</em>). Darril himself even remembers playing the demo and thinking the same things.</p>
<p>But he also feels that animation, naturally, lends itself to horror more easily, bringing up <strong>Courage the Cowardly Dog</strong> as another example. He goes further to say that "I think that the closest thing to the horror media in general is the animation, because it speaks to your inner child, to your deepest feelings, traumas, memories.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14066e3cbe5b1/bye-sweet-carole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"It's pretty common that if you watch a movie, and it's an animated movie, if there's a topic about something that really touches you, it's way more common that you're going to cry at the end of the movie... And the horror is the same."</p>
<p>Bunny Hall and Corolla are deliberately designed to invoke all of those unsettling memories and destroy your comfort zone. "There are a lot of scenes set in the bathroom, the bedroom, because those areas are where you feel really comfortable... So when those [are breached] there are no more boundaries; when the enemies, the evil, whatever it is, enters your comfort zone, you're completely lost."</p>
<h2>'Votes for Women!'</h2>
<p>Darril has spent much of his career focusing on women's stories, and Bye Sweet Carole really puts the importance of women — and women's history — first and foremost by setting it at the time of the women's suffrage movement. Why?</p>
<p>It's a question the creator has been asked before, as recently as an event a few weeks prior to our chat — "'why should a grown man tell a story about women's rights?'" He recalls he was also approached on a train while reading <strong>The Scarlet Letter.</strong> The novel, written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, follows a woman who has a child out of wedlock and is forced to wear a big scarlet letter as punishment. "'Why should a man read The Scarlet Letter?'"</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55a6dba5c6a73/bye-sweet-carole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Darril has the same response to both of these people — "Why <em>shouldn't</em> a man read a specific book? Why <em>shouldn't</em> a man fight for other people's rights?"</p>
<p>Women's rights are particularly personal for Darill as she was fascinated with stories of women's emancipation: "My mum was really in love with the story of the 20th century... I fell in love when she was telling me about Emmeline Pankhurst, Harriet Tubman, or Rosa Parks. All these women that, in a moment where they really risk everything, they throw a little rock into the ocean and they make a tsunami."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I fell in love when she was telling me about of Emmeline Pankhurst, Harriet Tubman, or Rosa Parks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"What my mother taught me was really important, telling something that probably I couldn't relate yet at the time because I was too childish, I was still a teen at the time." But it still had a profound effect on the creator, so he spent the studying and honing his knowledge because he wanted the game to be "a homage to my mum and my childhood."</p>
<p>But Darill was also conscious that he was putting a woman's story, a woman's narrative, at the front of a horror game; "It was important not to exaggerate too much because I didn't want to make anyone or anything a laughing stock." His focus was to make it "unsettling" because in some parts of the world, it's still difficult to talk about "women's rights and human rights in general."</p>
<h2>Sounds scary</h2>
<p>That unsettling feeling goes beyond the darker, cartoon-esque visuals and thematic concerns, as it should for a horror game. Remothered composer Luca Balboni is once again working with Darril, and the pair spent a lot of time nailing the feel of the music.</p>
<p>"It was pretty hard," he laughs, recalling his and Balboni's process "we basically rewatched the oldest classics by Disney — so Snow White, <strong>Cinderella</strong>, <strong>Peter Pan</strong>, and the oldest movie by Bluth. The latter was most helpful because a lot of Bluth's movies were really scary like <strong>The Secret of NIMH</strong> or the rats in <strong>Lady and the Tramp</strong>."</p>
<p>"We watched those scenes thousands of times and I had a clear idea that we needed to try and reproduce this kind of specific melodic structure and instruments that were used between the '30s and the '60s." While the animation style took inspiration from across the generations, Darril was more keen to avoid the musical trappings of Disney's more-modern output.</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/291816cee8421/bye-sweet-carole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In particular, he pointed to Frank Churchill's score from Snow White — "The music doesn't just describe [the Evil Queen] Grimhilde, it describes what is happening all around. The world changes at the same time as this beautiful queen who turns into an evil old lady just to kill her worst enemy because she's jealous of her."</p>
<p>It's telling from the trailers alone that Balboni seems to have nailed that feel so far, with the music ranging from bouncy and strange to unsettling and dramatic. There's even a ballad-style song. And it all ties into what Little Sewing Machine is trying to do with Bye Sweet Carole.</p>
<h2>"An artisan of feelings"</h2>
<p>Darril is extremely passionate about Bye Sweet Carole, and understandably so — but early on in our chat, he was adamant about one thing in particular: "I don't care about the sales."</p>
<p>"Knowing there could be someone at the end of the game who says <em>'I'm going to miss those characters. I'm going to miss everything there.'</em> And then in about a few months, <em>'I'm going to replay it to experience the game again.'</em>" - this is what drives Darril's passion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Feelings command people, the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we wrapped things up, we circled back to that passion: "I don't consider myself an artist, I consider myself an artisan of feelings because I really like to share what I feel." His work isn't about explicit messages or making something universally relatable, he wants to "speak to a specific community."</p>
<p>"If you can speak to those specific people who really relate to the things you have to say, the things you want to say, I think that's the biggest change you can make.... Okay, of course I want to make a game that people could enjoy [laughs]...but at the same time, that has never been my target. I do this because I love to do this."</p>
<p>Moving from the Remothered series to a more independent studio has only strengthened Darril's convictions: "You cannot push people to create art if that art is not ready... This is why I'm independent. This is why I decided to speak, to tell my stories."</p>
<figure><a title="Bye Sweet Carole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c3bb77ff40905/bye-sweet-carole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Maximum Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But there's one thing in particular that Darril said that has stuck with me since our chat — "Feelings command people, the world." Bye Sweet Carole has clearly been developed with feelings — from Darril's childhood, from his love of movies, his mother, of the process of creation — but also, he wants the game to evoke feelings from players.</p>
<p>"I would really love [Bye Sweet Carole] to stick deeply in other people's skin, in the players' skin." And he tells me people are already "hungry for more content."</p>
<p>"There's people already in cosplay as Lana. That's the biggest achievement for a creator. Absolutely." It sounds like Bye Sweet Carole may already be sticking, then. Let's hope it brings back all of those childhood horrors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve long dreamed of doing all my gaming on PC — a single platform that’s easily upgradeable and lets me play my overstuffed Steam library wherever and however I like. The Steam Deck is a fantastic handheld, but for my living room, I want something more powerful that works as well on my TV as it does at a desk. Believe me, I’ve tried. Gaming laptops are noisy and awkward, desktops are too chunky, and Windows is annoying to navigate without a keyboard and mouse. I had hoped that Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">Steam Machine</a> experiment was my ticket, but it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019#:~:text=%E2%80%94Ashley%20Carman-,23.%20Steam%20Machines,-Valve%20Corporation">crashed and burned</a> long ago. Nothing’s ever been as easy as a PlayStation 5.</p><p>But I’m newly optimistic. I’ve spent the past couple weeks using the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">Framework Desktop</a> with a clever Linux distro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">called Bazzite</a>: an open-source take on SteamOS. It’s a lot like installing the Steam Deck’s game mode and Proton compatibility layer for playing Windows games, and you can still optionally access a desktop for work too. It took me less than an hour to set up, and I’m now able to play PC games on my TV at 4K / 60fps — on a box that is smaller than a PS5, doesn’t get too noisy, and can be woken up from my couch with a gamepad.</p><p>This combo matches the simplicity of a docked Steam Deck, but it’s <em>so much</em> more powerful. And while a Framework Desktop isn’t as portable as a handheld — or even a laptop — it’s easy to move from room to room. I’ve even taken to working from it at my desk during the day, then moving it to the living room for after-hours game time. Sometimes you don’t want to play games in the same place you just worked for nine hours.</p><p>I so very badly want this to be the future of PC gaming.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>It’s the year of Linux on the desktop in the living room.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">Framework Desktop</a> is an ideal vessel for a Steam Machine-like experience. At 4.5 liters, it’s much smaller than most living room gaming computers, and much more powerful than your average home theater PC or streaming box. It’s way more expensive than a PS5 Pro — the Desktop starts at $1,099, or $1,999 for the AI Max+ 395 version I tested here with 16 CPU cores, 40 graphics cores, and 128GB of RAM — but it’s also much more than a gaming console.</p><p>I loved the Framework Desktop as a full Windows PC when I reviewed it earlier in August. And Bazzite is one of the easiest and most user-friendly desktop Linux incarnations. Bazzite makes it easier than ever to break away from Windows if you’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/673568/microsoft-palestine-email-block-defeated-employee">boycotting Microsoft</a>, looking for an escape from Windows 10 before it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533018/microsoft-windows-10-end-support-date">cut off from updates in October</a>, or just tired of Windows 11’s incessant pushing of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688056/microsoft-copilot-advertising-watchdog-response">services you don’t care about</a> and attempts to extract <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716191/microsoft-q4-2025-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">recurring revenue</a> from your wallet. The installer is easy, there’s a very capable OS if you switch over to desktop mode with a mouse and keyboard, and if you still need Windows for specific apps or games, you can always dual boot, like I did.</p><div id=":Ribcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Framework Desktop makes a nice fit in a TV stand with a Switch 2 and PlayStation 5.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Most people are not going to move a PC back and forth from the living room to the office, but this convertible setup works great with the Framework.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The only drawbacks I found were when I needed to run apps that aren’t compatible (like Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite) or the inevitable moments I had to open the Terminal to run simple commands. Many essential apps have native Linux support, like Chrome, Slack, Signal, Spotify, and Discord. And plenty of others can run with some compatibility help via <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a>. But if much of your work and everyday computing needs are web-based, you’re good as gold on Linux.</p><p>Using Bazzite in desktop mode took me back to the days when I experimented with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2007/11/ubuntu-gutsy-gibbon-review/">Ubuntu “Gutsy Gibbon”</a> in college. (Didn’t we all give in to the temptation of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyhFeopmjmU">the cube</a> back then?) Linux is genuinely fun to use and tinker with. And Bazzite has a nice, somewhat no-frills aesthetic I admire.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Bazzite has a clean and tidy look in desktop mode.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>Linux can and will drive the uninitiated down many rabbit holes, with lots of Googling how to do little things you take for granted on Windows and macOS, like understanding what the hell the KDE Wallet Service is (it’s for managing passwords) or remapping the Caps Lock key. I gave up on the latter and just remapped it at the hardware level on my keyboard with <a href="https://usevia.app/">VIA</a>.</p><p>But small frustrations aside, both the gaming side and desktop side of Bazzite are fantastic. While my job of reviewing laptops will always mean extensively using Windows, macOS, and some ChromeOS, it’s been kind of freeing to break away (even if just for a little bit) from the oppressive grips of the big three.</p><p>Now, if you’re interested in trying Bazzite and living a bit of that Linux life yourself, here’s how I set it up. It’s not <em>totally</em> foolproof, but it’s straightforward if you’re the tinkering type and can follow some simple guides (which I’ll link to).</p><p>Since I already had Windows 11 installed from my review of the Framework Desktop, I opted to install Bazzite on the second internal NVMe drive. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPsKhJGTrs">dual boot</a> from a single drive, with some <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/dual_boot_setup_guide/#:~:text=allocate%20for%20Bazzite.-,Important,Windows%20Updates%20from%20affecting%20your%20Bazzite%20installation%20later%20down%20the%20line.,-Manual%20Partitioning%20to">precautionary measures</a>, but it’s not uncommon to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bazzite/comments/1lg7dj9/comment/myv2dbj/">forumgoers</a> <a href="https://forum.level1techs.com/t/existing-windows-10-linux-dual-boot/231191#:~:text=Two%20separate%20drives%20will%20work%20just%20fine.%20I%20know%20with%20Win11%20updates%20it%20can%20rewrite%20the%20efi%20boot%20list%20to%20remove%20linux%20entries%2C%20but%20I%20don%E2%80%99t%20think%20Win10%20had%20that%20problem.">warning</a> that Windows 11 can disrupt things like the boot order after running an update. Since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fc-3CCXbA">sharing game files</a> across Windows and Linux is also complicated, I decided to keep the OSes completely separate — which helped reinforce my work / play separation. I use the Bazzite drive for most of my gaming needs and boot into Windows when I need it for work (running Lightroom Classic for photo editing) or games that require it (PC Game Pass games, multiplayer titles with stricter anti-cheat measures, etc.).</p><div><p>I followed <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/General/Installation_Guide/Installing_Bazzite_for_Desktop_or_Laptop_Hardware/">Bazzite’s official guide</a>, cross-referenced <a href="https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Bazzite+Installation+on+the+Framework+Laptop+16/407">Framework’s tutorial</a> for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185827/framework-laptop-16-six-months-later-review">Laptop 16</a>, and I was living the Linux life in less than an hour. Bazzite’s site has a user-friendly <a href="https://bazzite.gg/#image-picker">ISO picker for downloading the file</a> you need to install the OS — typically by burning the ISO to a USB flash drive using a tool <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">like Rufus</a>. If you prefer video to written guides, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@mikes-tech-tips/videos">Mike’s Tech Tips on YouTube</a> is an invaluable resource, with a pleasant, calming voiceover to boot.</p></div><p>I only encountered one technical issue running Bazzite: There was no audio coming through the HDMI connection to my TV, despite my attempts to select “External Device” or “Default (External Device)” as my source. For some reason, this was fixed by entering desktop mode and switching the source there. It’s worked fine since.</p><p>It’s easy to <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/changing-efi-boot-order/47506#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20setting%3A%20New%20Boot%20Device%20Priority%20%2D%20Mine%20was%20set%20to%20Auto%20which%20prevents%20you%20from%20changing%20the%20boot%20order.%20I%20simply%20changed%20to%20Last%20(First%20will%20also%20work)%2C%20which%20unlocked%20the%20options%20on%20the%20EFI%20Boot%20Order%20screen.">alter the boot order</a> of the Framework Desktop to prioritize the Bazzite drive. Booting up puts it right into Bazzite and its Steam Deck-like Big Picture Mode. And then, to access Windows without restarting and mashing an F-key to get to the boot menu, you can set up a script to reboot into Windows right from Bazzite’s Steam interface. You just go into the Bazzite desktop, open the Terminal, and type in the <a href="https://docs.bazzite.gg/Installing_and_Managing_Software/ujust/">ujust</a> code below. It does the work for you and adds a “boot-windows” option to the Steam Library.</p><div><p><strong>Code:</strong> <em>ujust setup-boot-windows-steam</em></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Bazzite’s Game Mode Home Screen is basically Steam’s Big Picture Mode. You can see my “reboot into Windows” shortcut in the top row. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>As far as Linux has come, the Framework Desktop, or any other PC running Bazzite, probably isn’t the one gaming PC to rule my living room. Setting aside the requisite tinkering, there are still games it cannot play, either because they’re from services that aren’t supported (like PC Game Pass) or they reject Linux because they fear cheaters (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">like <em>Fortnite</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24283482/valorant-is-winning-the-war-against-pc-gaming-cheaters"><em>Valorant</em></a> or <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/08/battlefield-6-will-be-a-unplayable-on-linux-systems-due-to-the-anti-cheat/">the <em>Battlefield 6</em> beta</a>).</p><p>But color me impressed by Bazzite and even further by the Framework Desktop. I see why Bazzite has been gaining popularity with PC gamers. The time is ripe for Steam Machines to make a triumphant return, and I think this time it can work. Bazzite and devices like the Steam Deck and Framework Desktop are all showing the way.</p><p><em>Photography and screenshots by Antonio G.

How smooth it runs and how good it looks depends on the game. Here’s a brief overview of some games I’ve been playing on it:</p><div><ul><li><span><strong><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>:</strong> Playing <em>Cyberpunk</em> at 4K at around 60fps meant setting it to medium preset (no ray tracing, of course) with FSR set to balanced, and it looked and played great.

            <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford admits he's a "little nervous" about Borderlands 4's "more challenging" difficulty.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford acknowledged that "a lot" of Borderland players "aren't interested in deep, hard challenges", adding "we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics".</p>

<p>"We have lots of players that actually aren't interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters," Pitchford said.</p>
<p>"I'm a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging, but one of the coolest things about Borderlands 4, because of the nature of the RPG, is if anything is a little challenging for you, you can just grind somewhere and level up and become more powerful.</p>
<p>"You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass. But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 was announced last August, and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-borderlands-4-featuring-a-brand-new-planet-and-four-new-vault-hunters">finally got a first look at the looter-shooter sequel</a> when The Game Awards rolled around in December.

                <p dir="ltr">Philipp Batura didn’t expect one of his most successful designs to be a giant red bow. Simple and cartoonishly oversized, the Big Hair Bow became one of Roblox’s biggest fashion hits during Christmas, selling more than 455,000 copies and generating over $150,000 in revenue.</p><p dir="ltr">"What's funny is that it's such a simple design, but that's probably why it worked," Batura told GameSpot via email. "It appealed to a wide audience. I remember logging into games and seeing it on so many players, and I still spot it in YouTube and TikTok videos."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a story that illustrates how Roblox fashion works and why it's so different from the real-world fashion industry. In Milan or Paris, designers might obsess over silhouettes or fabric innovation. In Roblox, the fashion ecosystem moves at the speed of memes, and sometimes the winning accessory isn't high-concept at all; it's a giant bow anyone can slap onto their avatar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554670-banner_10_hairbow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554670" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554670-banner_10_hairbow.png" data-ref-id="1300-4554670"></a><figcaption>The Big Red Bow</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554670-banner_10_hairbow.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Batura, who goes by Topcat in Roblox, didn't enter the User Generated Content Creator program expecting to become a digital fashion powerhouse. He has, in a way, since he leads a full-time team of modelers and a rigger that help him design multiple items a day. When he first started selling avatar accessories in early 2023, he gravitated toward tongue-in-cheek ideas inspired by internet culture.</p><p dir="ltr">"The weirdest design I made that sold well was the SIGMA Chain," he wrote. "It was part of my very first UGC drop in early 2023 and ended up getting over 13,000 sales. That moment was a turning point--it made me realize this could be more than just something I did for fun. It could be a real business."</p><p dir="ltr">That business began with meme-driven accessories like the Mr. Peebles Head--a giant cat head--and the Rizz Frame, a literal frame you wore around your face. They were funny, eye-catching, and briefly popular. But Batura soon realized the downside.</p><p dir="ltr">"While meme-based items might spike in popularity, they aren't a sustainable niche," he said. "So I pivoted toward streetwear, which allowed for more consistent results and long-term growth."</p><p dir="ltr">At first glance, it might seem strange that the bow outperformed more complex or trendy designs. But in Roblox, simplicity is a superpower. Players want items that work across multiple outfits and social settings. The bow managed to be playful without being tied to a specific meme or cultural reference, making it endlessly adaptable.</p><p dir="ltr">It also didn't hurt that it dropped during the Christmas season, when the Roblox avatar shop is flooded with players looking for festive ways to dress up. Big, bright, and jolly, the bow was the right item at the right time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554671-10_banner_team.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554671" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554671-10_banner_team.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554671"></a><figcaption>Topcat and his team.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4554671-10_banner_team.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And once enough players picked it up, it became inescapable. Roblox fashion spreads not just through the in-game store, but through visibility in popular experiences, streamers' avatars, TikTok edits, and YouTube skits. The bow wasn't just an item--it was a trend, woven into Roblox culture.</p><p dir="ltr">The success of the Big Hair Bow underscores how Roblox fashion has matured into its own industry. The UGC program has empowered thousands of independent designers to create and sell virtual clothing, and with hundreds of millions of monthly users on the platform, the audience is massive.</p><p dir="ltr">For some, like Batura, it has become a career. The fact that one digital accessory can generate six-figure sales is a reminder that digital fashion isn't a novelty; it's an economy. Roblox has seen collaborations with luxury brands like Gucci, Ralph Lauren, and Nike, but the real pulse of its fashion world comes from homegrown creators. They move quickly, understand the platform's culture, and know when to trade high-concept ideas for something as straightforward as a bow.</p><p dir="ltr">"Seeing something I created become part of the culture like that has been incredibly rewarding," he wrote. While it may amuse Batura that his most iconic creation is essentially a cartoon bow, it's fitting. Roblox fashion is democratic and often surprising. Success doesn't always come from complexity--sometimes it comes from knowing what players will actually want to wear.</p><p dir="ltr">For Topcat, that realization has transformed a hobby into a livelihood. For Roblox, it's another reminder that in the world of digital fashion, anyone--with the right idea--can become the next big trendsetter.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Read more: The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-lawsuit-louisiana-statement-children-safety/1100-6534061/" data-ref-id="1100-6534061">latest developments in the controversy involving Roblox</a>.</em></p>

            <p>David Hayter – the original voice behind one of gaming's biggest characters, Snake – says portraying <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s stealthy creation "was the definitive role in [his] life", and if he was asked to reprise the role, he'd be "down" to voice him again.</p>

<p>"Anytime they ask me to be Snake, I'm in," Hayter said. "It's the definitive role in my life. It's so complex and so profound, and there are so many different aspects to both him and Big Boss. So anytime it comes up, I’m down.</p><p>"I get so many people coming up to me now saying, I just got into Metal Gear last year because of the Master Collection, and it's so cool to see 18-year-old fans and younger kids discovering it for the first time," the award-winning Hollywood writer added. "A great game should be like a great movie or like a great album – it should live on. And a lot of times, because consoles and technology change, a lot of great games disappear. And so I'm just grateful that Konami is behind this in the way they are."</p>
<p>That said, if given the opportunity, Hayter was candid enough to acknowledge he wouldn't have minded re-recording some of Snake's lines for the remake.</p>
<p>"I do feel that I'm a little better of an actor now than I was then," he admitted. "It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the past 20 years to it. But you don't want the controller lines to be better acted all of a sudden, because that'll take you out of the game.</p>
<p>"I've been working in Hollywood for quite some time now,” he added. "This is a beloved franchise, a huge world with massive worldwide appeal. So I'm never surprised when something like this comes back. But I didn't anticipate it would be this. But to start with, Snake Eater is very cool, because it's generally considered the pinnacle of Metal Gear.”</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-secret-mode-was-developed-by-platinum-games">We recently learned that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has brought back the secret Guy Savage mode</a>. But it wasn't made by Konami alone – Platinum Games, perhaps best known for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and Astral Chain series, is responsible for the surprise action minigame.</p>
<p>Connor had a great time with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">awarding it five out of five stars in our review</a>, writing: "A legend is brought back to life with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, in a surprisingly sensitive remake from Konami featuring developers from the original."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The trench-ridden battlefields of Napoleonic Europe were never going to be a nice place to wake up in. Turns out they’re much worse when mutated mashups of former soldiers and gruesome, blistered horrors also trudge through its mud. Valor Mortis places you right in the thick of it, and trusts that your skill with a blade, pistol, and superpowered palm will ensure you make it through alive. Despite being rooted in the fundamentals of the Soulslike genre, it adopts a non-conventional first-person perspective, which not only fully immerses you in this horrifying world but also adds an additional layer of precision and satisfaction to its parrying, slashing, and sharp-shooting combat. And while I found that its battles can be tough, during my time playing it at gamescom 2025, I found several signs this won’t be as punishing an exercise as can be found elsewhere in the genre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Face down in mud, Valor Mortis’ protagonist William hears the words of his general, Napoleon Bonaparte, echoing in his ears and telling him to get up. Dozens of corpses line the forest path ahead as a tattered French flag droops in presumed defeat. No other context is given as to how we’ve ended up here, but the infamous emperor <em>is</em> insisting that I get up, so I do exactly that and trudge on ahead. Initially armed with a sword and the ability to perform a block, parry, dodge, and both light and heavy attacks, there’s nothing initially revolutionary about developer One More Level’s new project, which has slowed its Ghostrunner melee action to a much more deliberate pace here.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Valor Mortis Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The swordplay may not be too different, but it remains incredibly enjoyable to take part in. Blocking doesn’t completely negate damage, so the timings of your parries become your best bet for quickly dispatching your opponent. There’s a wonderful metallic clang that rings out when you get it just right, followed by a momentary shift into slow motion that reminds me of Dishonored’s equally gratifying maneuver. I later find a pistol nestled in an ornate trunk decorated with a portrait of Bonaparte himself. Further adding to the Dunwall of it all, this centuries-old sidearm hands me a ranged option, albeit one with a limited supply of bullets. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then things get a bit weird as a dash of the supernatural is added to my arsenal in the form of a burst of flames I can project straight out of my palm. This flamethrower ability will look familiar to anyone who has guzzled a shot of one of Bioshock’s tonics. It’s a delightfully explosive skill that helped me deal with crowd control, and even inflict a burning state on the demo’s boss (much more on him later). There are definitely aspects of the two aforementioned immersive sims here, but I wouldn’t go in expecting anywhere near the flexibility in its combat system as you may find in one of Arkane’s or Irrational’s games. This is fundamentally still a Soulslike that relies heavily on one-to-one melee encounters while delicately managing your stamina gauge, so I wouldn’t expect to be mixing elemental effects and creating chaos of your own design here. Aside from the odd opportunity to sneak up on one of your opponents and skewer them deliciously from behind, the demo’s options when entering combat rarely stretched beyond toe-to-toe duels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fans of the genre’s traditional disgusting foes also appear to be well catered for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The creatures I fought across this 45-minute sample can all, to varying degrees, be described as being rooted in some sort of humanity. What starts out as lowly infantry staggering around like the undead made way for more interesting enemies the deeper I pushed on. I found an optional area, unlocked via blasting a glowing structural weak point with the pistol, where I was greeted by a foreboding duelist who gracefully stepped towards, his haunted manner only emphasised by an emotionless metal mask. His attacks were fast and health bar-ravaging, and his parry windows tight – I quickly decided that he was a challenge for another day. I almost made it halfway through this preview without mentioning Bloodborne, but the speed and thrust of his blade did remind me of one of Yharnam’s Hunter threats. An elevated challenge, but not quite a true boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the genre’s traditional disgusting foes also appear to be well catered for, as there are also many more mutated, monster-like enemies. Though all still appear to be clinging onto their former selves — army uniforms hang off of them, or human heads (sometimes multiple) watch your movements closely — they are very much not of this world, or at least how early 19th century Europe is depicted in history books, at least. A mysterious plague has infected the battlefields, creating these aberrations that can pose quite a challenge. One such brute appeared to be two soldiers conjoined together, who also happened to have grown an extra arm and developed a massively oversized, meaty, clawed hand. He took swipes at me at close range, but enjoyed nothing more than throwing explosive cinders if I stepped too far back. Luckily, a big ol’ glowing red sack looked ready to pop where his elbow should be, so I aimed a few pistol rounds at it to take advantage of his weak point.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But he was outclassed by another, far more horrendous-looking entity. The demo’s final boss was General Lothaire, The Eagle Bearer, a man-mountain of a bastard with a comically normal-sized head that I would have laughed at more if it hadn’t been for the three guns pointing at me that emerged from his fleshy, contorted right shoulder. Dual-wielding a sweeping flagpole and slicing cutlass, his reach was vast and the hits heavy. I’ll freely admit it took me a fair few attempts to take him down, but after a few upgrades at a nearby rekindled Lantern (this universe’s version of the classic Dark Souls bonfire), I managed to take him down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, his first form anyway. Yes, One More Level has decided to take the piss and give the very first boss of Valor Mortis a second phase. This version of Lothaire still has a deadly mix of ranged and close attacks that keep you on your toes, but also packs the ability to summon annoying minions and capture you in his clawed clutches. He’s tricky, but thankfully, nothing overly difficult for anyone trained in this genre of combat.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Crucially, upon dying your collected catalysts are dropped at the outside perimeter of boss arenas.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But to those who are relatively new to Soulslikes, or even find first-person combat a challenge, Valor Mortis is lenient… to a certain extent. Catalysts are your resource upgrade here, and you can use them to level up your stats at what seems to be a reasonably cheap cost. I pumped points into getting a bigger stamina bar, as a few quick stabs can quickly drain your initial meter, and it made overcoming the boss a much more manageable affair. Crucially, though, upon dying, your collected catalysts are dropped at the outside perimeter of boss arenas, not through the murky, smoky gate that precedes them. One More Level doesn’t want you to have to grind elsewhere in its world in order to progress, and this offer of saving you a little frustration, combined with special traits that can be unlocked through exploration that utilises a little of parkour design the studio perfected in Ghostrunner (you can swing from trees, for instance) all come together to help you feel more powerful more quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo ended as I finally took down Lothaire, the words “Abomination Eradicated” filling the screen. I imagine there are many more abominations to be dealt with, though, if Valor Mortis’ reveal trailer is anything to go by. All in all, I had a very satisfying time with it, finding its blend of first-person swordplay and superpowered magic abilities an enjoyable power trip. I look forward to digging deeper into what secrets its combat suite may have in store and taking on more of those abominations with it when Valor Mortis arrives sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a75b1c24fbd6f/chibi-robo-park-patrol-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's time to plug into another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-super-adventure-island-snes">Last time</a>, we matched up a trio of covers for the SNES classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_adventure_island">Super Adventure Island</a>, with the three regions opting for vastly different designs. The disparity wasn't enough to drastically split the vote, mind you, as the golden Japanese variant walked away with a comfortable 76% of the votes, leaving North America with 16% and Europe with a diddly 9%.</p>
<p>This time, to celebrate <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a>'s arrival on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-this-week">GameCube NSO library</a>, we're taking a look at the oft-forgotten DS sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/chibi_robo_park_patrol">Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol</a>. Once again putting you in the metallic shoes of the tiny robot protagonist, this handheld adventure was all about making a sweet little garden, by planting seeds, watering roots and getting rid of nasty Smogling pollution. In short, it was really rather sweet.</p>
<p>The game never received a European release, which means there are just two designs to choose from today. Let's get into it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/snes/related-articles:3451,186410 @ 1756076207 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6cbaad5035a94/chibi-robo-park-patrol-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right off the bat, the North American design tells you everything that you need to know about this DS entry. Our titular robo takes centre stage with his water pistol, running across the grass and dwarfed by the giant game logo — a nice indication of his diminished stature, we'd say. All this is capped off by some creepy flowers and fauna in the foreground, making everything look that bit smaller. <em>Neat</em>!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Chibi-Robo!: Park Patrol - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5be9b77e35a56/chibi-robo-park-patrol-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design swings for something different. We get the same Chibi-Robo sprite, but his garden is nowhere to be seen. Instead, the stripped-back background shows colourful little flower sketches, with the blocky logo redesign running along the bottom. There is a patch of grass to be found in the lower portion of the frame, but it's not as in-your-face as the NA variant.</p>
