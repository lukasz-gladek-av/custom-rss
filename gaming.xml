<p>It's been...well...it's been a year in which we have all existed, that's for sure, and as a result games happened. Loads of them, in fact. Of course, and as is tradition at this time of year (it's Christmas, mate, wake up), you've got your usual shoe-ins for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-of-2025">Game of the Year</a>, your fancy writing awards, nice acting, and good gameplay nods. All that stuff and nonsense for people who do everything right all the time.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>However, and as anyone who's drunk as much festive sherry as we have over the years will tell you, there are many more games worthy of a mention in any given year when you broaden your horizons ever-so-slightly. Who needs the pomp and circumstance of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a>, for example, when you've got the guns and squirrels of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a>? That sort of thing.</p>
<p>Now, that's not to say what follows is in any way less prestigious, mind you. We've got some absolute bangers in here. It's just that some good games come at you from unexpected angles. Y'know. Like those wee Christmas vol-au-vents. You just never see them coming.</p>
<p>So, without further ado, and before these delicious flaky pastries go cold, let's dig into our 2025 Alternative Award choices. <em>Regarde!</em></p>

<h2 id="nintendo-lifes-alternative-awards-2025">Nintendo Life's Alternative Awards 2025</h2>
<h3 id="best-game-we-wish-we-liked-more-2025">Best 'Game We Wish We Liked More' 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="073b3de12a895"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/073b3de12a895/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion was announced for Switch 2, this particular writer couldn't quite contain their excitement. The reason? Well, it seemed as though this sequel to a super-solid predecessor was going to give early Switch 2 adopters exactly what they wanted to see on a new console. Huge big open worlds, high-octane robot fights, and all the other sorts of things that made the original Switch crap itself.</p>
<p>In the end, and as you can read about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">in more depth in our review</a>, what we got was a very good game at its core, but one that just didn't satisfy when it came to performance at all. This 30fps effort stuttered too much, it's too janky overall, and combat that sings on other platforms feels well mushy and unsatisfying at points here as a result. A shame! There have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/another-switch-2-game-has-been-updated-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">updates and fixes</a>, so there's hope yet.</p>

<h3 id="best-game-featuring-a-squirrel-with-a-gun-2025">Best 'Game Featuring A Squirrel With A Gun' 2025</h3>
<p>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel with a Gun</a></p>

<p>One of the tougher categories to judge, as we're sure you can imagine. <strong>*cough*</strong> This prestigious — and also very large and expensive — award goes to a bit of a left-field choice in this category. Yes, that's right, it's Dee Dee Creation's Squirrel with a Gun.</p>
<p>Congratulations to everyone involved in a game that sure did make this writer's children laugh a lot. They also know the names of loads of types of real-world guns and weapons now, too. LEARNING BONUS MULTIPLIER X5!</p>
<h3 id="best-retro-remake-remaster-re-release-2025">Best Retro Remake / Remaster / Re-Release 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="dce79be1cc4a9"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dce79be1cc4a9/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This very (bald) writer gave Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles a great big <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">juicy 9/10 in our review</a> back at launch, and he'd do it again!</p>
<p>Yes, some folk haven't taken to the way in which some War of the Lions content was cut, but honestly we reckon the remix works better overall. Also, the extra fighting you got in War of the Lions...who really needed it? Seriously. You just had like 40 hours of top-notch combat and you're kicking up a stink for more?</p>
<p>With meaningful quality-of-life enhancements, gloriously slick visuals and performance, and CPU tweaks to make battles even better, this is the best version of one of the best FF games. So there.</p>
<p><strong>Runners Up:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawks Pro Skater 3+4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_i_and_ii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD Remake</a></p>

<figure data-uuid="5913fbd79ef1b"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5913fbd79ef1b/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Devolver Digital</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unbelievable scenes here at the awards. Unreal stuff. We were up all night (this writer pulled all of his own hair out), but in the end the decision has been made to award Best Game Featuring A Glass Skater Whose Soul Is Chained To Their Board 2025 to...<strong>*drum roll*</strong></p>
<p>It's Skate Story! Devolver has given us another one of those games, you know the ones, like your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hotline_miami_collection">Hotline Miamis</a> and whatnot, that immediately...as soon as you start to play...you just <em>feel</em> x100 cooler. The plot (involving hell, souls, demons, glass things, skating) is exactly mad enough that you simply must know how it ends, and on this chaotic hook is then hung some supremely good skating.</p>
<p>Like, actually. The skating is great. Who knew?! We just thought it was gonna look nice, but it's got the whole lot this one. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Check out our 8/10 review</a> if you don't believe me.</p>

<p><strong>Winner:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="56aa3174c373c"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/56aa3174c373c/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The folks at Hello Games are no strangers to pulling off a late save and turning things around on a game (or in this case port) that looked all but out to sea. Or maybe that should be out to space or something. Something clever.</p>
<p>We loved the Switch 1 port, but No Man's Sky is a game transformed on Switch 2, now with all the bells and whistles you'll find elsewhere. And it runs good. And it looks great. It's also a game that benefits hugely from having portable mode on the table - exactly the sort of thing you can leave on your console for years and pick at during lazy periods (Mon-Fri, 9am - 5pm).</p>
<p><strong>Runners Up:</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a></p>
<h3 id="best-game-with-poisonous-centipedes-2025">Best 'Game With Poisonous Centipedes' 2025</h3>
<p>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/labyrinth_of_the_demon_king">Labyrinth Of The Demon King</a></p>
<figure data-uuid="75de073047e5b"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75de073047e5b/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Top Hat Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might think there'd be a whole lot of competition for this one. Centipedes have long been a fundamental and core part of gaming. However, and as we can see, these modern game-makers...they just don't honour the classics amongst...eh...computer game insects?</p>
<p>Anyway. Labyrinth of the Demon King is absolutely stonking (and stinking) stuff. It's a belter. And you, my friend, should play it. It also has some great big centipedes in there. And they are poisonous. The good stuff.</p>
<h3 id="best-end-of-year-arrival-that-dropped-too-late-to-make-our-goty-list-2025">Best 'End-Of-Year Arrival That Dropped Too Late To Make Our GOTY List' 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Winner: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">Despelote</a></strong></p>
<figure data-uuid="84527fa1d00f1"><a title="Nintendo Life Alternative Awards 2025" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84527fa1d00f1/nintendo-life-alternative-awards-2025.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this was a shame, actually, because Despelote really is a special game - a December arrival in the US and we don't get it on European eShops until 13th January. A roughly two-hour experience, it's something we can <em>all</em> make time to play, and something we really should, too.</p>
<p>Set during the Ecuadorian team's historic 2001 World Cup qualifying campaign, this is a beautiful thing to just lose yourself in for a single sitting, and it's also the sort of game (given the running time especially) that you shouldn't let anyone ruin for you. So no spoilers here. It's a top tale told well. It's also a game that displays a deep knowledge, not just of its subject matter, but of video games and interactive stories and how they are told in a way that best conveys the emotion, alongside a time and a place that is universal to anyone who's ever been a child (that's, like, loads of people).</p>
<p>Seek it out, submit to its story and enjoy a very special thing indeed.</p>

<p>This one is terrifying for this writer because I was on reviewing duty and it's genuinely hard to believe this wasn't about two years back.</p>
<p>Regardless of how long and tiring you may or may not have found this year, one thing is for certain: it's always worth giving XCX a shout.</p>
<p>This Definitive Edition makes good on the promise of the OG, adding performance boosts and other enhancements that make for one of the best open-world games (and/or Mecha games) on Switch consoles as of writing. We're really feeling it! Still.</p>

<p>Who wants 20 more hours or thereabouts of premium-grade Chained Echoes content? We'll tell you who.</p>
<p>Me. We. We mean we do! And also, you. Perhaps. Let's forget about this sentence. Chained Echoes is one of the greats of recent times, a belter that everyone should dig into. Ashes of Elrant (and keeping it vague, so no spoilers) adds more of everything you may have loved about the main game. Hey, it's got 15 new songs in it. 15!</p>

            <guid>1392511</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="408">Ever experienced this? You’re recording an important moment on your phone, maybe your child about to score their first goal in a peewee soccer game. You decide to run alongside them, phone in hand, trying to capture the action. But when you watch the video afterward, you realize it’s a shaky, unwatchable mess. The footage bounces around with every step, making it nearly impossible to see what’s happening.</p>
<p data-start="410" data-end="803">That’s why anyone serious about filming, whether professionally or as a hobby, should consider adding a gimbal stabilizer to their toolkit. Amazon has some excellent year-end deals active right now with some great discounts on DJI’s phone stabilizers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">For example, the DJI Osmo Mobile 7P, usually priced at $129, is now only $109.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="805" data-end="1071">While the Osmo Mobile 7 and 7P share many features, the 7P offers a few upgrades. One key difference is that the 7P includes a retractable extension rod built into the handle, which adds extra versatility, allowing you to use it as either a selfie stick or a tripod. It’s worth the little bit of extra change to have that flexibility in how you can use it.</p>
<p data-start="1073" data-end="1229">Attaching your phone to the gimbal is a breeze thanks to DJI’s magnetic connection system. This means you can start filming immediately with minimal hassle.</p>


<h2 data-start="1073" data-end="1229">Native Tracking</h2>
<p data-start="1231" data-end="1700">The Osmo Mobile 7P come with intelligent tracking features that make your filming experience much smoother. They can automatically track your subject, keeping the camera stable and free from any shaky hands or movement. Even if your subject suddenly changes direction, the gimbal adjusts to keep them in focus. If the subject briefly disappears from view, like behind a tree, the gimbal will continue tracking, ensuring your footage stays seamless and fluid.</p>
<p data-start="1231" data-end="1700">If you’re filming solo and want to shoot in selfie mode, you’re covered. Just convert the handle into a tripod, allowing the gimbal to stand upright on its own. You can control the shot remotely with simple hand gestures. For instance, raising your palm will start or stop the tracking, while a “double-L” with your thumbs lets you adjust the framing. A “V” or peace sign will trigger the camera to take a photo or begin/end video recording.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2378">The battery life on this model is impressive, lasting up to 10 hours on a single charge. When you’re done filming, the gimbal folds up easily into a compact, portable form, making it convenient to take on the go.</p>
<p data-start="2380" data-end="2560" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With this DJI stabilizer for iPhone and Android, you’ll never have to worry about shaky footage again.</p>

<h3 id="h-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is my pick of all the games. I can tell you that I spent over 70 hours just scouring through the open world, not even finishing half of the story, with my total gameplay coming in at 140 hours. I am not a fan of first-person games; however, this title has been the best entry into the genre. The world of this game is so incredibly dense, and the characters are so well defined that you will spend most of your game exploring Night City, which, to be honest, is the real main character of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-lies-of-p">Lies of P</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are looking into testing a challenging soulslike title, then Lies of P might be more your speed. In this game, you get to play as Geppetto’s puppet, who has been tasked to slay unearthly monsters while unearthing the secrets of Krat, a city set in the Belle Epoque era. The 2023 title is Neowiz’s take on&nbsp;the beloved fairy tale of Pinocchio, with a dark, grim spin. </p>



<h3 id="h-marvel-s-spider-man">Marvel’s Spider-Man</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Again, if you are a PlayStation player, then this game cannot be missed. Marvel’s Spider-Man is one of the biggest PlayStation games and also one of the best superhero games out there. It is a remastered version that features higher resolution and a higher frame rate, while offering players an original story in which they play as Peter Parker, fighting crime and iconic villains as they swing through New York.</p>



<h3 id="h-alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alan Wake 2 is the critically acclaimed sequel to the 2010 title; however, players don’t need to play the first game to experience this mind-bending survival horror. It features Alan Wake, a writer trapped in a nightmare, and Saga Anderson, who is in the world of the living. Players get to play as two characters and even explore two locations, the majestic landscapes of Cauldron Lake and the nightmarish cityscape of the Dark Place. The game puts you in close-combat situations with various supernatural enemies, and the ultimate weapon for survival against them is the light. </p>



<h3 id="h-red-dead-redemption-nbsp">Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Red Dead Redemption is the first game in the series, even though the events of the game take place after RDR2. Players get to play as John Marston as he tracks down the last remaining members of the Van Der Linde Gang in his quest for revenge. The new version of the game offers higher resolution and a higher frame rate, making it better suited for current-gen consoles.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Earth Directorate Commander Ash was sent to settle a labor strike issue on behalf of Auntie's Choice, in an effort to gain favor with the corporate conglomerate. A bit of an outlaw, and someone who excels in shooting, lockpicking, and smooth-talking, I felt like my character was primed to work out a result that was favorable for the workers without too much of an issue.</p><p dir="ltr">I was able to enter the closed-off facility and even nab some blackmail on the manager in charge before confronting her directly about the labor strike. I conveyed the workers' demands, and expected to be able to convince her to see things my way--after all, I invested a decent amount of points in speech.</p><p dir="ltr">It quickly became clear that no amount of talking was going to solve this dispute. As far as the manager was concerned, any concessions she might make would prevent the factory from hitting its quota. Someone with engineering or hacking skills may have been able to solve this issue by messing with the equipment in the factory, but my character wasn't built for that. My character was good at three things, and I'd already exhausted the lockpicking and talking options.</p><p dir="ltr">So Commander Ash solved the problem the only other way she knew how: shooting the manager in the face and telling the striking workers to take it from there. What could easily feel like a failure of the game--not offering me a more diplomatic solution using whatever skills I had invested in--instead felt right, given the story I had built for myself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624358-theouterworlds2-2025_11_08-19_12_56large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624358" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624358-theouterworlds2-2025_11_08-19_12_56large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624358"></a><figcaption>The limited number of skill points in The Outer Worlds 2 means you can only build up a handful of skills.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624358-theouterworlds2-2025_11_08-19_12_56large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In prior games in a similar style to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, including the modern Fallout games, Cyberpunk 2077, and the original The Outer Worlds, I always had trouble resonating with the story. I would neglect the role-playing part of the RPG, not out of some refusal to engage with the story on its own terms, but because of the particular way I like to play games. I have a tendency to want to do everything and see everything, without the need to play through multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">I would often end up with a hodgepodge of skills, some points to improve combat skills, a few to increase carry weight to deal with my need to pick up everything I find, and a few skills to get me into locked areas. This would always result in me having a character that was good at a bunch of things, but worthless for high-end skill checks. If I had the option to respec, I would cheat my way through, and if it didn't, I would grind for some extra skill points. Sure, I got to see everything in the game, but that often lessened the chances of something different or odd happening.</p><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 doesn't have the option to respec, outside of one opportunity just after the opening sequence. On top of that, leveling isn't particularly fast, and you are only given two skill points to place into a massive list of skills. My particular playstyle would wreck my adventure here, making me lack the skills for interesting interactions and leaving me to suffer the consequences.</p><p dir="ltr">So, I made a game plan during character creation. I gave my commander an outlaw background, and focused on guns, speech, and lockpicking. I built her like a smooth-talking space cowboy, someone who could get into places via speech or lockpicking and when the time came, shoot her way out. I even managed to spare two points of medicine, although even that small deviation meant I wasn't high enough level for a lockpick in a main quest area I was definitely overleveled for.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624359-theouterworlds2-2025_11_02-00_04_43large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624359" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624359-theouterworlds2-2025_11_02-00_04_43large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624359"></a><figcaption>Not every door can be lockpicked open.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4624359-theouterworlds2-2025_11_02-00_04_43large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For as often as my speech skills could get me out of a jam, they also couldn't. After all, some people just can't be reasoned with. While I got through plenty of doors without issues, I would regularly run into a door that required hacking or another skill I didn't have. But I could always accomplish my goals in one way or another, I just had to make use of the skills I had chosen to invest in.</p><p dir="ltr">This resulted in an experience with The Outer Worlds 2 where I felt invested in role-playing. Without the option to run away from or fix my decisions in the level-up screen, I had to work with it. I had satisfying experiences convincing low-level lackeys that their bosses didn't care about them, causing them to run rather than fight me. When a villain started lecturing me about the state of the galaxy, it felt right to choose the attack now option. I'd heard enough and was confident in a duel.</p><p dir="ltr">It feels a bit silly to point out the benefits of role-playing in a genre with role-playing in the name, but respecing has become a crutch for some similar games. Playing Avowed earlier this year, while I felt like I knew who my character was from a personality standpoint, I regularly rebuilt my combat abilities and other skills, sometimes to use a new weapon or to deal with a situation differently.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Outer Worlds 2, I often had to deal with an outcome that wasn't what I was angling for, because I had to play with skills I chose. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/full-flaws-list-for-the-outer-worlds-2-best-flaws-to-pick/2900-7182/">flaws system</a> adds to this too, with my penchant for reloading constantly being something I could lean further into by getting a damage buff, so long as I didn't empty out my magazine.</p><p dir="ltr">These thoughtful decisions also resonated with my companions, with Niles turning from a once-dedicated and hopeful Earth Directorate agent into an outlaw of his own. I taught him that large organizations will never have your back, and sometimes the only solution to a problem is a bullet, something that he now believes too.</p><p dir="ltr">So while shooting that factory manager in the face might feel like a simple or unsatisfying solution in an RPG like The Outer Worlds 2, it was exactly what my character would have done in that moment anyway. Instead of trying to wiggle my way out of the consequences of my choices, undermining my own story in the process, I was forced to do exactly what my character was built to do, making something simple feel impactful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>2025 has been a fairly quiet year in the world of video games with little in the way of scandals or surprises. Gone are the days of Giant Enemy Crabs or Microsoft completely flubbing an Xbox launch. Nevertheless we have spent at least an hour collating and debating these very special awards which are to be presented by Geoff Keighly as soon as we can drag him away from counting the millions of dollars he makes every year from presenting three hours of adverts.</p>
<h3>The Most Botched Game Launch Award</h3>
<p>When the trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mindseye/">Mindseye</a> landed it got the attention of a lot of people, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/mindseye-revealed-and-it-looks-pretty-darn-fantastic/">myself included</a>. A big open world action game with driving, explosions, and lots of gun play? Yes, please! But alarm bells started to ring when a very limited number of YouTubers got to preview the game a week before it launched and they came away thoroughly unimpressed. Those alarm bells tuned into the honking of a bin lorry slowly reversing into your house when Build a Rocket Boy decided not to send out any review codes.</p>
<p>When they reviews did arrive they were not good and Mark Gerhard, co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, claimed that a “third party” (he means his former employers, Rockstar Games) had made a “concerted effort to trash the game and the studio”. Rather than fix the game post launch, management instead decided to fire 300 employees.</p>

<h3>The Most Inevitable Game Delay Award</h3>
<p>Speaking of Rockstar, if you have been playing video games for any length of time you will know that Grand Theft Auto games never come out on time and always get delayed at least twice. True to form, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> was delayed not once, but twice in 2025, with Rockstar <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/02/gta-6-gets-a-release-date-but-its-been-delayed-to-2026/">first pushing it back to May 2026</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-to-november-2026/">once again until November 2026</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VQRLujxTm3c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Most Hated Review Award</h3>
<p>Who would have thought the game that got you most riled up this year would be a kid-friendly Pokémon game? We didn’t, but after we awarded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> a<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"> well-deserved ten out of ten s</a>ome of you decided to tell us we got it wrong. Did they leave a helpful comment here on the site? No, they found the reviewer’s honeymoon photos on Instagram and posted abuse there instead. Stay classy.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokemon Legends: Z-A  - Official Trailer | Pokemon Presents 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eNML51GuBew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Worst Promotional Trope Award</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. The Elder Scrolls VI. Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. Fable. The list of games that are revealed with CGI trailers before barely a line of code has been written grows every year and it is immensely frustrating. There is no need to announce your game five years before it comes out other than to impress shareholders. Stop it.</p>
<p>In the case of Fate of the Old Republic, Arcanaut Studios was founded by Casey Hudson this year and he reckons they’ll manage to ship by 2030. We’ll see you in the Most Inevitable Game Delay Award category in a few years.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAmkl1jL0fo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Best Xbox Award</h3>
<p>This year, Microsoft really pulled it out of the bag and made PlayStation the best place to play Xbox games. You might not have expected this in 2020, but in 2025, the PS5 can play all of Sony’s exclusives and now pretty much all of the recent (former) Xbox exclusives as well. The Xbox fanboys have been incandescent with rage, but Microsoft were very happy with<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/forza-horizon-5-ps5-release-date-set-for-april-22nd-launching-alongside-horizon-realms-update/"> Forza Horizon 5</a> and other Xbox games topping the PlayStation charts, month after month.</p>
<p>Although it makes no sense to the rabid Xbox fans the decision makes perfect business sense, the Xbox Series X|S consoles dropped to fourth in the US recently, behind PS5, Switch 2, and the NEX Playground.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halo: Campaign Evolved - &quot;The Silent Cartographer&quot; Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/175XWulP__Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Shirley Bassey Award</h3>
<p>Valve have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-the-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller/">announced the Steam Machine</a>, a new PC in a console-like box that’s designed to go under your TV in the living room.</p>
<p>Just like the did ten years ago.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Propellerheads feat: Miss Shirley Bassey - History Repeating" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzLT6_TQmq8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Most Ridiculous Video Game Title Award</h3>
<p>A packed category this year with strong contenders in the shape of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43PSM_b8aA">DDinosaur with Double D’s</a> which is <em>EXACTLY</em> what you think it is, and FUBUKI ～zero in on Holoearth～ HOLOLIVE ALTERNATIVE. However there is one clear winner and it insists on being in all caps. Well done to BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3: I OPENED A PORTAL TO HELL IN THE FAVELA TRYING TO REVIVE MIT AIA I NEED TO CLOSE IT.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BRAZILIAN DRUG DEALER 3 - Full Game Walkthrough " width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Dg0UFMoJFQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Most Pointless PS4 Remaster Award</h3>
<p>This award is returning for a second year, but for a different reason. Last year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/16/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-review/">The Last of Us Part 2 got a PS5 version</a> which was clearly unnecessary when the PS4 version already had a free update to run at better frame rates on PS5. This year Sony decided to take the slightly polished PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/days-gone/">Days Gone</a> and shove it back on PS5. Did anyone notice? No.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Days Gone Remastered - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RjRLSZalxgs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The Most Obvious Rip-Off, Like, Evs, Award</h3>
<p>When Tencent revealed<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/light-of-motiram/"> Light of Motiram</a> it was very clear that it was “inspired” but Sony’s Horizon games but when Sony got the lawyers involved we found out there was a lot more to it. It turns out Tencent had, on numerous occasions, pitched a Horizon game to Sony and had been turned down every time. Rather than give up they changed a few things and voila, Light of Motiram.</p>
<p>Sony and Tencent have now reached an out of court agreement and Light of Motiram has been removed from Steam and will no longer will be released. Who could have predicted that?</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3>The “U OK HUN” Award</h3>
<p>Someone over at Ubisoft social media seems to be having a breakdown and is posting all sorts of weird “joke” posts on Facebook. We can’t tell if they are trying to be funny or if it is a cry for help.<br>
</p>
<h3>The Half-Life 3 Award</h3>
<p>Awarded for the second year in a row to all those top tipsters on the internet who were 100% convinced that Half Life 3 would be announced, this time as an exclusive for the new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/12/valve-announces-the-steam-machine-steam-frame-and-steam-controller/">Steam Machine boxes</a>.</p>
<p>It wasn’t.</p>
<p><em>And that’s a wrap! Another strong year in a lot of hotly contested categories, and&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-led-cylinder-floor-lamp-drops-to-its-lowest-price-to-clear-out-remaining-stock-2000655263</link>
            <guid>1392487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s hard to think of the last time something changed home lighting as much and as radically as the advent of the multi-colored app-driven LED light. Edison, maybe? But even the Wizard of Menlo Park would have been blown away by the lighting setups that Govee keeps coming out with. If you’re&nbsp;<em>really</em> fast, you can order one like this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp while it’s 41% off at Amazon.</a></p>
<p>While this limited-time deal is still going, the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is easily the best $100 full-room transformation you can make. Even above the 1500 lumens of brightness that will fill your space, it comes with over 64 pre-programmed scenes and lighting effects, and the DIY potential to create your own is virtually limitless. It’s all app-controlled and smart home friendly, and it takes up precious little space in proportion to the way it fills a room with incredible lighting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tall Cool One</h2>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is perfectly designed for corners, standing an impressive 68.8 inches hight but only 10.3 inches at the base and an especially slender 3.2 inches across the top of the cylinder. When we say “some assembly required,” we mean very, very little — it comes in five pieces, all of which screw together by hand. No tools required and certainly no knowledge of wiring or anything of that sort.</p>
<p>Once it’s up and running, you’ll go to the app to start experimenting. This is an easy rabbit hole to enjoyably go down, because there are literally millions of colors available. The brightness, timer, and patterns are all entirely under your control through the intuitive and free Govee Home App. The lamp can be set for accent lighting, fun party effects, or full-on room-brightening.</p>



<h2>How Customizable?</h2>
<p>The level of customization of the Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp’s effects is beyond impressive. Aside from having a palette of millions of colors to choose from and mix together, the Govee Home App even has a Finger Sketch feature that lets you draw a pattern with those colors, and then see the pattern take shape on the LED cylinder. Add your pattern or any other color scheme you create to the six different music sync modes to watch them dance in beat with whatever tunes you’re playing. Or, stick with the generous library of 64 preloaded scenes. There’s no shortage of compelling, mood-setting lighting effects available, from sedate to dramatic to whimsical.</p>
<p>The Govee RBIC Cylinder Floor Lamp is normally a $170 purchase, and well worth it for the amount of personal touch it adds to whatever space you use it in. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6591/">With this limited-time Amazon deal taking 41% off that price, it’s just $100.</a></p>

              <p>A great pair of earbuds can change the way you experience your favorite music. If it’s time to try something new, you should get a pair of Apple AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds. These earbuds provide high-quality audio, top-notch noise cancellation, and easy connectivity for Apple devices. And you can get a pair on sale right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">To take advantage of their sale price, which is now priced at $199 (down from its original price of $249),</a> just shop Amazon to claim the discount and see how much these AirPods can transform the way you listen to music, podcasts, and make or take calls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds that provide excellent audio</h2>
<p>These earbuds have Active Noise Cancellation technology to help eliminate ambient sound so you can clearly listen to whatever it is you’re playing. Whether you’re using the earbuds while commuting through heavy traffic or you’d like to listen to music without distractions at home, the Active Noise Cancellation feature automatically adjusts to your surroundings.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you need to be aware of your surroundings, such as in a crowded restaurant or while walking through a busy airport, the Transparency Mode allows you to hear your surroundings by allowing ambient sounds to filter into the earbuds without needing to remove them.</p>
<p>All of that, and the AirPods sound great, too. They boast clear, balanced audio with crisp high notes and powerful low notes that make music feel alive. In addition, the Adaptive Equalizer (Adaptive EQ) dynamically adjusts the sound to the unique shape of your ears providing a customized listening experience without manual adjustment of the EQ settings.</p>



<p>But that’s not it, because there are some customization options, too. Each pair comes with multiple ear tip options so you can choose the one that provides the most comfortable fit for your ears. Once fitted correctly, the earbuds sit comfortably against your ear without being overly tight and can accommodate extended periods of use, whether for listening or working out. In addition, the AirPods Pro 3 Wireless Earbuds are water-resistant and sweat-resistant, ensuring they can withstand minor exposure to rain or sweat during a workout or other physically demanding activities.</p>
<p>In terms of battery life, these AirPods boast several hours of playback per charge and the compact charging case can give you plenty of additional power. In addition, when you need to recharge the earbuds, simply place them back in the case and they begin charging immediately. Then charge up your case and do it all again when it’s all depleted.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">For just $199, you really can’t beat the latest Apple AirPods model.</a> They’re a smart investment for anyone looking for great audio, especially if you’re already a part of the iOS ecosystem.</p>

<p><em>“But... the future refused to change.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> is a chirpy, cheery game. It’s lightning in a bottle, a magical experience full of joy and excitement. Yet, there are few endings as gut-wrenching as Chrono Trigger’s 'Bad' ending.</p><div><figure data-videoid="I2fL0wP73Io" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytI2fL0wP73Io" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed58d513qkwmyi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>You’ve spent hours travelling between time periods, rescuing innocent people, gathering allies, and seeing firsthand the evolution of Lavos, the cause of the apocalypse in 1999 AD and the origin of evil throughout history - throughout millions of years of history.</p>
<p>Travelling to 1999 AD and taking on Lavos right before it causes the apocalypse, only to fail, is devastating. “The future refuses to change,” and Lavos takes all life, including yours. Life and the world collapse and grey out before your very eyes. This beautiful world you’ve become acquainted with — that you’ve seen in six different times and witnessed the spirit of humanity change, adapt, grow, and evolve — is <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>But the future <em>refuses</em> to change; it’s not that it can’t. The words on the screen, in front of that greyed-out image of Earth and Lavos’ blood-curdling scream blaring out of the speakers, might feel like a gut punch, but it also serves as the fuel, the motivation, to get back in the fight to save the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0decd5dafb8dd"><a title="Chrono Trigger Lavos 1999 AD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0decd5dafb8dd/chrono-trigger-lavos-1999-ad.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But you already know that, right? In the 30 years since its release, everything that can be said about Chrono Trigger has been said. You don’t have to accept the world as it is. Pursue your dreams. Fight for change. You can’t change everything, but you can change some things.</p>
<p>Where many time travel stories are cautionary tales that preach the dangers of changing the course of history, Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s message is poignant and, importantly, timeless. Things are crap right now, and I can’t really get through a day without feeling like the world is going to collapse in some way. If I had my own Epoch, I’d hop in it right now, travel through time, and do something to change the future. That’s what Crono, Marle, Lucca, and friends did. All because they love the world, and they love the people in it. And I do, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s depiction of Earth is special, and it does something that very few RPGs manage to achieve – it makes its setting a character through its use of time travel. Over the course of millions of years, you get to: experience a <a href="https://www.snesmaps.com/maps/ChronoTrigger/ChronoTriggerMapSelect.html">world’s make-up physically changing</a>; spot similarities between continental shapes and town locations; see where certain islands have fused together, broken up, or even been completely wiped off of the map. The further you get through the game, the more similarities you’ll spot.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s obvious when you compare 600 AD and 1000 AD. The Middle Ages and Present Day only have a gap of 400 years to contend with, and many locations are in the exact same places. Truce, Guardia Forest, Porre, the Hero’s Grave, and a few other places have barely changed, and even where islands have merged, their locations match. The Sun Shrine is present in every single time period. Even the Tyranno Lair’s reappearance in the Middle Ages (as the Giant’s Claw), after millions of years, hammers home the importance of the world.</p>

<p>There are smaller details in all of the maps, too. The mountain range behind the Dactyl’s Nest in 65,000,000 BC remains all throughout history, even if it changes. Of course it would; rain, weather, and even human influence would erode the natural structures. The Ice Age alone seems to have created a more jagged range of mountains, compared to the lush green plateau of the nest millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Traditions have even survived Earth’s turbulent history, just as in real life. Ioka Village is home to a small festival where the people dance. Crono, upon visiting the village, is challenged to a soup-chugging contest by Ayla, the chief. This is in 65,000,000 BC. At the beginning of the game, in 1000 AD, Crono can take part in a prehistoric dancing game at the Millennial Fair. He can also imbibe in a drinking contest – not as safe as soup-chugging, kids, don’t try that one at home.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too. The events of 12,000 BC and the collapse of Zeal more than amplify that message. Because of Queen Zeal and the (aptly named) Mammon Machine — because she tried to <em>use</em> Lavos — humanity’s innate ability to use magic was lost to time.</p>
<p>There are people that want to correct that mistake, like Melchior, one of the three Gurus and the architect behind the Mammon Machine. He warned Queen Zeal of the dangers of using Lavos’ power, but was thrust forward to 1000 AD. He <em>wants</em> to change 'history' – Antiquity’s future, the Present Day’s past, and the apocalyptic future of 2300 AD.</p>

<p>Even Chrono Trigger sets limits to what you can and can’t affect, though. You can destroy Lavos at the Ocean Palace in 12,000 BC – probably not until a second playthrough, mind you. But doing that doesn’t <em>change</em> the future, it just thrusts you back to the End of Time where Gaspar, another of the three Gurus, resides, and allows you to talk to the staff who worked on the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defeating Lavos before killing the Black Tyranno doesn’t really change much besides two things: Lavos is dead, obviously; and, oh, everyone is a reptite now and forever – they never died out in this timeline. Otherwise, everything’s largely the same. In another ending, if you defeat Lavos while Crono is dead, then eventually Gaspar will intervene in the celebrations and insist that there’s still a way to revive Crono. There are many good and bad constants in <em>all</em> of these timelines, things that the party doesn’t have the power to change.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7cc8fb14139c"><a title="Chrono Trigger Epoch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7cc8fb14139c/chrono-trigger-epoch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it’s also not fair to call catastrophic events like the summoning of Lavos in 12,000 BC, or Magus’ attempt to summon the creature again in 600 AD, a blip in the timeline, because of the suffering those events inflict. History can be painful, and things that happen in the past ripple. We feel the after-effects of events from over one hundred years ago; they wound people, physically and mentally, and can alter paths. All we can do is bear the sins of the past and do something with that information, to change the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s that undercurrent of history's weight and the power of change that makes storylines like Fiona’s resonate so strongly. Despite only being a sidequest, how important it is to change the 'little' things has stuck with me, too. Restoring a forest might seem like nothing in the grand scheme, but to Fiona, it’s everything. And to you, who has seen firsthand what happens, you want to give that one person a spark of hope. You have to go back, convince someone to plant a seed, defeat the monsters in the Sunken Desert, then have Robo stay and water and care for the forest.</p>
<figure data-uuid="780c1d88c206e"><a title="Chrono Trigger Forest Camp" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780c1d88c206e/chrono-trigger-forest-camp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the present day, you can see the fruits of your labour at Fiona’s Forest, a beautiful, lush woodland which is home to the game’s timeless campfire scene, and is an example of Crono, Robo, and the others giving back. It’s a small, positive change, and a beacon of hope. If we can do this one little thing, perhaps we can make a difference. Because we love this world, and we can make those ripples more beautiful, more positive. We <em>can</em> change the future.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s world is what sets it apart from almost every other RPG. It’s small, but we become intimately familiar with it. Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for: a better future.</p>
<p>Yet even in the face of the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger can make time for a joke or two. It stands as a beacon of light against tyranny and evil, and its message resonates now more than ever before. Instead of “The future refused to change”, consider the words of a random nun in the Middle Ages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In our world, every storm has an end. Every night has a new morning. What's important is to trust those you love, and never give up. We must all keep hope alive…”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Action-Adventure Game of the Year 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-best-action-adventure-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Action-Adventure category gets more intense and serious year on year. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S capable of delivering high-end games that no one thought possible two decades ago, we’re seeing the best of the best in the genre. This year’s Insider Gaming Action-Adventure nominees are incredible, and one stands above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Combining exhilarating action you’d normally associate with a Hollywood blockbuster epic with the storytelling and nuances of an adventure movie, book, or game is a difficult duality to master. Masterfully succeeding at two genres means you’ve created the ultimate hybrid, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has picked out four key contenders for this award.</p>







<p>The breakdown begins with the winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Action-Adventure Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Insider Gaming got a chance to play Silksong before most, and claimed: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait</a>.” Come release day, this statement aged very well. Silksong is an all-time Metroidvania great, and its intricate level design pairs up beautifully with the usual tropes of dropfeeding abilities and blocking your way with tough bosses.</p>







<p>Unusually, Silksong offers more freedom than the typical Metroidvania. There are multiple optional areas and bosses; you don’t have to go on the same path each time, and there are so many side quests and gambits to consider. Sometimes this is to get away from the game’s excessive difficulty, mind, as Silksong is certainly not an experience the casual gamer will enjoy. It requires a gut full of fortitude and patience to beat, but the alluring graphics and beautifully designed enemies and environments make it worth it.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong took longer than anyone would’ve liked to arrive, but it’s earned its place.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima wasn’t perfect, but it sure was pretty and plentiful. Ghost of Yotei is an improvement in most areas, but still stumbles into the same pitfalls as its predecessor, and the story perhaps doesn’t quite live up to the first game. Still, this is a PlayStation 5 exclusive worth the money, and further flexes Sucker Punch’s creative muscles.</p>



<p>The studio has admitted it might move onto <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly, inFamous</a>, or something new entirely moving forward. If this happens, Ghost of Yotei is a good note to end on (or briefly put on hiatus) and was a strong contender for the Best Action-Adventure prize.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another in the ‘sequel to the original that basically does it better’ department. Hideo Kojima’s schedule is busy with OD and Physint, but Death Stranding 2 was always going to be the focus. With returning cast members and another glittering array of video game royalty joining the action, there’s no expense spared for Death Stranding 2.</p>



<p>As with any Kojima title, there’s an unbelievable sense of grandeur and pomp in DS2. The game sometimes crumbles under its own lofty premise and vision, but take nothing away from what Kojima Productions has achieved here. It’s a technical marvel and one worth the price of admission for <em>that </em>spinning lights section!</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hazelight Studios has quickly gained a reputation as a studio that can’t do any wrong. The new-ish studio already has A Way Out and It Takes Two under its belt. When you win Game of the Year in only your second try, every subsequent release comes with the unenviable burden of expectation. If there was one way to describe Split Fiction, it’s more of It Takes Two: Two-player-only gameplay, two different characters going through a host of mini-games and new and innovative mechanics, and a heartwarming story to pull them together through the adventure.</p>



<p>Split Fiction is near-enough on par with It Takes Two, but there might be an argument that it’s a trick we’ve already seen before—lessening its spectacle and impact. Hazelight’s newest work is still a GOTY contender—one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gamings-the-game-awards-2025-winner-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming think was cruelly overlooked by The Game Awards 2025</a>—and needs to be played.</p>



<p>Was Hollow Knight: Silksong the clear and oustanding candidate in this category? Or has IG made a misfire on this list somehwere? There’s an ideal place to let us know: The free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="470">If you’ve been considering upgrading your smartphone, now is the perfect time to treat yourself to something fresh and exciting. Amazon has just made it even easier for you to do so, with the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro being offered at some hefty discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6590/">The Pixel 10, featuring 128GB of storage, has dropped from $799 to as low as $549</a>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage is now available for just $749, down from its original price of $999.</a></p>
<p data-start="472" data-end="1445">Both the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro come equipped with a 6.3-inch display that boasts a resolution of 1280 x 2856. While this isn’t quite as large as the Pixel XL’s 6.8-inch screen, it still provides an optimal viewing experience, making it perfect for reading tex messages and watching videos alike. The display is bright, vibrant, and remains clear even under direct sunlight. Plus, it supports a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate, which makes gaming and general use feel fluid and responsive. The Pixel 10 Pro is available in a range of colors, and regardless of the option you choose, they are all part of the deal that brings the price down to just $749. For the standard Pixel 10, the frost and obsidian (white and black) colors are available for $599, while the funkier lemongrass and indigo options are discounted by an additional $50, bringing them down to $549. Though, you were likely planning to slap a case on it right away, so who needs to worry about color, right?</p>

<h2 data-start="1447" data-end="1481">Pro-Level Photography Features</h2>
<p data-start="1482" data-end="2068">When it comes to photography, the Pixel 10 Pro stands out with its impressive triple rear camera system. The 50 MP main camera is paired with a 48 MP telephoto lens, offering pro-grade zoom capabilities. You can now take photos or record videos at up to 100x Pro Res Zoom, which delivers the best zoom quality the Pixel series has seen to date. There’s also a 48 MP ultrawide camera that allows for macro focus, making it easy to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots of small subjects. On the front, a 42 MP camera ensures your selfies and video calls are crystal clear and sharp.</p>


<p data-start="2070" data-end="2427">The Pixel 10 Pro also comes with built-in Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, which seems to be getting baked into everything these days whether you want it or not — including in smartphones. Gemini is designed to help by doing things like creating group shots from multiple photos, generating images, summarizing unread emails, and other stuff of the like. It’s powered by Google’s next-gen chip, which enables the phone with the processing power needed to fully utilize AI.</p>
<p data-start="2429" data-end="2784" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">As for cellular service, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are both unlocked, meaning you can choose the carrier and data plan that best fits your needs—whether that’s Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, or any other major carrier. Currently, you can save up to $250 on either the Google Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro, making this an ideal time to upgrade your device.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The days of video games playing second fiddle to films, comics and cartoons are far behind us. If anything, it’s often games that are now leading the way and providing source material to be adapted into anime, books and billion dollar films.</p>
<p>But what if you take a more holistic approach with a transmedia project planned from the off?</p>



<p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby took the world by storm earlier this year, when this free-to-play athlete-management &amp; deckbuilding hybrid experience about anime girls with horse ears finally got its global release. While the franchise is only just beginning to explode in popularity for English-speaking audiences this year, it’s been one of the hottest multi-media property in Japan for years, spawning manga and anime tie-ins galore.</p>
<p>One of those tie-ins, the currently airing Umamusume: Cinderella Gray, is a breath-taking blend of hot-blooded anime action, endearing horse girl silliness, and some of the sharpest animation you’ll ever see. It tones down the cutesy and silly vibes that usually drive most of the Umamusume experience, instead going for a cool, tense, and gripping origin story for one of the many characters in the series that ends up skewing closer to a traditional sports anime or even action classics like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Naruto in terms of tone and pacing. It’s an incredible reflection of one of the many layers of the Umamusume franchise, and I’ve already got some new favorite characters to unlock and train in the game after watching this anime.</p>

<p><em>– MIguel</em></p>
<h3>Devil May Cry (Netflix) – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The streamers have been ravaging the gaming world for IPs they can turn into animations with mixed results, for every Arcane: League of Legends there is a Tomb Raider, and while Devil May Cry may not be the cream of the crop it is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>The Netflix series pulls storylines and details from almost every incarnation of DMC, including characters found in the DMC novels and Manga, and mixes them up to create a lighter version of DMC. There are still dark moments, especially when it comes to the main antagonist, Rabbit, but Dante is portrayed as rather young and goofy, with none of the brooding or trauma found in the games. There are some great needle drops throughout the series, all from the 2000’s when DMC was at it’s height, along with a few classic tracks from the games, and while the mix of 2D and CG animation can clash somewhat, there are some spectacular sequences.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry is gory, sweary, funny, and packed full of action, and while it may not be what you personally think DMC is, it’s a darn fun ride. Series 2 lands on Netflix in May 2026.</p>
<p><em>– Tuffcub</em></p>
<h3>A Minecraft Movie – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Is A Minecraft Movie a good movie? It probably depends on who you ask. If you’re a kid who’s grown up playing Minecraft, whose understanding of it is as deep and creative as any other physical building system, then the answer is likely a categorical ‘yes’.</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is silly, irreverent, and often nonsensical, but it’s also playful, creative and built to specifically reference every aspect of the game that inspired it. Cinemas were filled with all sorts of crazy Minecraft-inspired behaviour, inspiring joy and fervour in a shared pop culture moment, although that occasionally spilt out into extremes, such as the fans who unleashed live chickens into a theatre in reaction to the Lava Chicken song.</p>
<p>Households, streets and school playgrounds were filled with the sound of that song, and it epitomised the union between the game and the movie. Nobody could have expected Jack Black’s shenanigans to hit the right notes with fans, but they absolutely did.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable Mentions</strong> (in alphabetical order)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gnosia</strong></li>
<li><strong>The Last of Us (Season 2)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Twisted Metal (Season 2)</strong></li>

			<p>With <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> being almost a year away, fans of the popular Rockstar Games series have no other option than playing older entries in the series, or GTA Online, to get their fix.</p>



<p>While many of the older games haven't aged too badly, some of them are starting to show their age, prompting fans to seek new ways besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"><strong>official remasters</strong></a> to enjoy some of these all-time classics with improved visuals and gameplay, such as <strong>an upcoming modding project that will bring the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas experience to the latest iteration of the series' engine.</strong></p>



<p>Revolution Team, the modding team behind the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/"><strong>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition project</strong></a>, revealed Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Nextgen Edition, a Grand Theft Auto V overhaul mod that will bring <strong>the entirety of the game</strong> initially released on PlayStation 2 to the <strong>latest iteration of the RAGE engine</strong>. This means that all content, from main missions to side missions, will be playable within Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>At this time, <strong>very little information is available</strong>, and for a good reason. <em>"This time, we will be sharing details more cautiously,"</em> the team stated, <strong>possibly to avoid what happened with their Vice City project</strong>, which faced significant legal pressure and social media takedowns from Take-Two Interactive earlier this year, eventually leading the mod to be released as a standalone package to ensure its survival. With the promise of <em>"something truly special"</em> in the works, however, <strong>there are definitely some exciting times ahead for fans of the series.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>At this point, the question is: <strong>"Will Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Nextgen Edition release <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">before Grand Theft Auto 6?</a>"</strong> Revolution Team did not say so, but there's no denying that fans of the series have a great 2026 to look forward to!</p>

<p>Marvel’s Blade development team has been hard at work, and they have called the title ‘a special game.’</p>



<p>The next big title that players are looking forward to from Arkane Lyon is Marvel’s Blade, and players have really been hoping to learn more details about the title. All we learned earlier this year was that the production phase of Marvel’s Blade commenced at the end of 2024 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-survives-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not impacted by the layoffs</a>. Now, a developer has provided another minor update. </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-blade-dev-provides-small-update">Marvel’s Blade Dev Provides Small Update</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/upcoming-xbox-games-blade-development-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, an Arkane and Bethesda-focused content creator recently asked the developers for an update on Marvel’s Blade as a Christmas Gift. To everyone’s surprise, the studio/co-creative director, Dinga Bakaba, arrived with a minor update on Marvel’s Blade via a reply on <a href="https://x.com/DBakaba/status/2003458441139118463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), confirming that development is indeed progressing well. </p>



<p>Bakaba stated that the team is working hard to develop the title and that “everyone is super proud and outdoing themselves.” The developer also asked players to be patient, as this “will be a special game,” and hopes it will meet the “high standard” they have set for themselves and the players. </p>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Marvel’s Blade will be a single-player, third-person game set in the heart of Paris. Players will be able to embody the role of the legendary Daywalker, Eric Brooks, as they explore an original story set in a quarantined zone in Paris, where a supernatural emergency is unfolding. </p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda wants players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play Fallout 5 for ‘600 hours’</a>. Also, the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">needed a decade to ‘feel comfortable’</a> with creating ‘new stuff’ in Fallout.

<p>Larian says that it isn’t necessary to play the older Divinity games before starting the upcoming game. </p>



<p>The Baldur’s Gate 3 developers have been in the news a couple of times lately, most recently for their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments on AI</a> and the reveal of the new Divinity title at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. Since then, we have heard some new details about the upcoming title, and now the developers have revealed that we don’t need to prep by playing previous games in the series. </p>



<h2 id="h-players-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-only-for-the-lore">Players Should Play the Older Divinity Games Only for the Lore</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Larain founder Swen Vincke elaborated on playing the older Divinity: Original Sin games. Vincke first spoke about how the upcoming title will reference events from the original games, including Ego Draconis, the same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, and more. However, these events are now “just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>



<p>Vincke adds that players who tried Baldur’s Gate 3 for the cinematic experience shouldn’t try older Divinity games unless they “want to know the lore”. If the player likes “tactical combat, or co-op multiplayer, or really having lots of freedom,” then they should definitely try out Original Sin 2, as that title served as a blueprint for Baldur’s Gate 3. Vincke concluded, stating that players who want to know everything, “there are games that came before, but they’re a bit outdated by now, they are quite old.”</p>



<p>In other news, Divinity will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as previous Larian games. Additionally, the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn-based and co-op gameplay</a>. Will you be playing the older Divinity or jump directly into the new one?

Two characters, who a few days earlier learned something particularly shocking--one of several moments in the game that recontextualizes the whole experience--get up early and end up watching the sun rise together. It's a little moment of tranquility, of two people bonding over natural beauty amid a particularly rough string of days, and it landed beautifully. It felt like the game was tapping into something a little deeper, a little more melancholic, than what I'd seen before.</p><p>According to online estimates of the game's total length, at the point I saw this scene, I had another 90-120 hours to go until I could really say that I'd "finished" the game, depending on my speed and patience. The name The Hundred Line refers to the number of days the students of Last Defense Academy have to defend their school for as waves of invaders periodically force them into tactical combat. But the name actually has another meaning that you uncover once those 100 days pass for the first time, about 30 hours into the game: This game has 100 unlockable endings, and to get the full picture, you'll want to see all of them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-: Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The promise of 100 endings feels like the sort of marketing mistruth that pops up in a press release to play up how much the game is shaped by your choices. A game that claims to have 12 endings might actually mean four endings, each with a few minor potential variations. And yes, some of the endings in The Hundred Line are kind of cheating, or are very similar to each other--not every ending is created equal. But there really are 100 of them, consisting of 21 different "routes" that can all end at various different points.</p><p dir="ltr">At the point that these two characters took in the sunrise, I had seen eight endings; I was still a good five hours from getting my ninth (although endings 10-12 were all unlocked within an hour after that). Seeking out these endings had revealed new information about the game world: The paths leading to those endings had shown characters in a new light, and several of them had poked at new corners of this game world or revealed new lore. They'd been silly, sad, a little scary, and alternately funny and tragic. Different characters died each time, and the emotions I felt over each one were different. As I wrapped up the pathway that, I believe, is the closest thing the game has to a "canon" ending, I knew that I'd keep going, and that knowing everything I'd learned on my way to that ending would only deepen my understanding and appreciation of the many paths I still had to take.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is co-directed by Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi, best known, respectively, for the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games: two series known for their huge twists, hyperactive narratives, and penchant for killing off cast members. This new game has all of that too, and it throws in a pretty competent Fire Emblem-style combat system on top. That's not to mention the bonding stats with each individual student, the board-game-like "exploration" mode, or the RPG-style character stats and loadouts you can gradually tweak as the game progresses.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, in games that promise a story shaped by the choices you've made, a major appeal is the notion of getting to the end and experiencing the conclusion of the story that you have co-authored with the game's writers and designers, finding the conclusion that represents the pathway you forged through the experience. Maybe you'll play again and make different choices to experience some different scenes; more likely you'll simply take it as a given that if you <em>did</em>, the story would be a little different next time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hundred Line takes a different approach: It's a choose-your-own adventure story, but instead of needing to keep one finger back on the page where you made your last choice in case it doesn't pan out, you have a neat timeline that lets you revisit every single choice in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The most empowering thing about this game is that your own choices don't really matter, because the best way to play the game is to make all of them and see every outcome. There are certainly some pathways that give you more information or a deeper story, endings that feel "good" or "bad" or some shade between, but there's no sense of punishment, or of being denied certain story beats because of your choices.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a rare, exciting feeling that I don't experience often with games of this scale: the sense that the developers were able to pursue their exact vision through to the end. The Hundred Line is the kind of game that no business strategist or market expert would advise a company to make and release in 2025. A game this huge, with no additional monetization, with a pointed focus on storytelling, with a $60 price tag and a lot of strange and challenging themes: It could be a potential recipe for disaster, especially when it relies on 3D models for its tactical combat system and numerous cutscenes. It's a game that many media and influencers are going to be a little scared to touch, too, since it's so lengthy and text-heavy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626292"></a><figcaption>The Hundred Line</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Hundred Line took over five years to develop, and the script--which must contain something in the ballpark of one million words--would have made localization extraordinarily expensive, especially when you factor in voice acting. In a pre-release interview with </span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/if-the-game-does-not-sell-well-we-may-be-done-its-do-or-die-for-too-kyo-games-and-the-hundred-line">Nintendo Life</a><span>, Kodaka admitted that if the game did not sell well, the studio "may be done" after taking out loans to fund development. A week after the game came out, in response to a fan on Bluesky, Kokoda </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loa6no5b2c2j" rel="nofollow ">stated</a><span> that the company was "still on the brink of going under."</span></p><p dir="ltr">And yet, The Hundred Line has been a success. By July, three months after launch, the game was selling well enough that Kodaka told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-11/-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-nearly-bankrupted-too-kyo-games" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, "I don't see bankruptcy as a serious future." Exact sales figures have not been released, but it seems that the risk Too Kyo Games took in spending so much time and effort on developing this behemoth paid off.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of it, I think, is that Kodaka and Uchikoshi have built up good will with their previous series: the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series amassed global fanbases over a long period. The Hundred Line is also audacious in a way that is undeniable and uncommon: the sheer size of the thing is exciting, more so than a game that offered, say, 30 different endings. It also helps that the tactical battles are quite enjoyable, with just enough depth and originality so that going into battle never feels tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond all of that, though, the storytelling in The Hundred Line is--to boil down an immense quantity of work into a simplistic sentiment--very good, with excellent character dialogue, fantastic voice acting, and a great many "what if" scenarios you can explore. The characters are all interesting, developing and deepening over time, and seeing how they change and adapt to the vastly different stories you can explore is fascinating--it's impressive to see the game maintain consistency across different paths.</p><p dir="ltr">As reports continue to come in of developers tightening their belts as the industry shifts towards more conservative, proven tactics to turn a profit, seeing a company taking a huge risk to make something both enormous and unusual, and having it pay off, is heartening. Even without that context, though, The Hundred Line would still be my favorite game of 2025. It's a breathtaking achievement in narrative design, a truly wild example of just how much you can do with player choice, and one of the most ambitious visual novels ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Is The Insider Gaming Community’s Most Anticipated Game Of 2026]]></title>

<p>While the games that are released bring the joy of being able to experience something new, there’s something about the build up to a game that can be just as, if not more, exciting as the release itself. In 2026, the gaming calendar is loading with titles like Marvel’s Wolverine, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero that could be in contention for Game of the Year. However, no game has the community talking and is more anticipated than Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).</p>



<p>A poll hosted exclusively on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> saw GTA 6 get 29.8% of the votes. That may be far less than the 87% it received last year, but that can be blamed, if you will, on the other games in development.</p>







<p>But why did GTA 6 win for the second year in a row? It’s kind of obvious, really. </p>



<p>It’s the first game in 13 years for the nearly 30-year-old franchise. It also sees the series return to Vice City and the state of Leonida as a whole in what looks, based on the information released so far, to be the largest region in the history of GTA. </p>



<p>Two trailers have been released so far, both doing well over 100 million views, showing just how excited players are to get this game. It’s expected to be the highest-grossing game in the series and could very well beat the sales numbers for GTA 5, which made $815 million in just 24 hours. </p>











<p>As mentioned, GTA 6 received 29.8% of the votes this year. Where things got interesting, though, is in the rankings that followed.</p>



<p>Second place saw a tie between a game confirmed for next year and one still a year or two away. Both Marvel’s Wolverine, which releases next fall, and The Witcher 4 received 18.2% of the vote. That was followed by another tie for fourth between Resident Evil Requiem and the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake at 9.9%.</p>



<p>Other games receiving votes included 007 First Light, Phantom Blade Zero, Pokémon Pokopia, Saros, and Fable.</p>



<p>What do you think about GTA 6 being voted the most anticipated game of 2026? Is it something you agree with or are you more excited for a different game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in February. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s no question that Nintendo makes some of the best video games in the world thanks to its incredibly skilled and passionate in-house and partner developers. But how often does the company let those developers speak freely about the games they make?</p>
<p>Last year we got the opportunity to chat with the legendary artist <strong>Takaya Imamura</strong>, famous for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, Captain Falcon and the many machines in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora’s Mask</a> itself. He was with Nintendo for over 30 years working on countless games until leaving the company in 2021 to pursue something different. So, naturally, we said 'Yes!' and flew thousands of miles to sit down with the man himself.</p>
<p>Imamura-san is now coming back to gaming with his new project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">OMEGA 6: The Triangle Stars</a>, an adventure inspired by his own manga. In this interview, we speak about the upcoming game, his days working on games like Zelda, and why he left Nintendo after all those years...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): Omega 6 looks a lot like a long-lost Super Famicom game. How long have you had the idea for this game in your head?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takaya Imamura:</strong> So it’s actually pretty new as a concept. It’s derived from the manga. The idea wasn’t there from the beginning. I wrote the manga, then the chance to create a game based on it came up.</p>

<p><strong>In that regard, what do you love about working outside of Nintendo and how is developing a game different now for you?</strong></p>
<p>Now I enjoy it. I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>Did we hear correctly that you’re a professor as well? How do you juggle all of that?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, as a professor I’m teaching students, they come to class at a certain time, there’s summer holidays and I know when I need to work and when I don’t. Like Indiana Jones. [makes whip-cracking sound]</p>
<p><strong>Are you a big Indiana Jones fan?</strong></p>
<p>Yea, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to play <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">The Great Circle</a> when that comes out?</strong></p>
<p>Ahh, of course!</p>
<p><strong>What has it been like being a teacher and a famous game developer? Do you have students that know of and are fans of your work?</strong></p>
<p>There are some like that, but the majority don’t really know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>Wow! That’s so interesting! I feel if you were a teacher in the US or the UK people would react differently to you being their teacher.</strong></p>
<p>Even students who really look up to me tend to hold back during class. It’s when we go out for a meal or drinks then they ask if I’ll sign or draw something!</p>
<p><strong>It’s nice that there’s a time and place for that sort of thing. To get back to Omega 6, what was your biggest inspiration for the art direction?</strong></p>
<p>Once I left Nintendo, I was thinking, 'How can I do something on my own as a creative?' The easiest and first thing that came to mind was to make a comic since I can draw. I really wasn’t thinking of how I could sell the comic and make money, I just really wanted to draw this comic. If I can put it digitally on Kindle and a few people buy it? Great!</p>
<p><strong>The game itself has a massive roster of characters, and I love how there’s a list of them all that you can flip through. Are you sharing design duties with anyone else or are they all created by you?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you! Basically it was all me except there are four characters in there that my students designed. I did the pixel art for those few characters but my students came up with the original designs.</p>

<p><strong>That’s amazing! You directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/steel_diver">Steel Diver</a> and have worked on plenty of other games with Nintendo over your many years there, but when’s the last time you’ve gotten to express yourself in this way?</strong></p>
<p>It’s the first time I’ve been this free, because there’s nobody to tell me 'No', or to tell me when to stop. I just do what I want as much as I want.</p>
<p>When I was at Nintendo, or when you’re doing something in a professional environment and the project has milestones that people have to check off, you get senior people like the producers and managers that say, “Alright, you need to reel this one in,” or, “Let's not do this.” Ya know, I really never liked that. I think for pretty much anybody who is a professional game developer, this is something they’ll go through. Of course, you know, when you’re at a company, the company has to make money!</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember what it was that made you want to leave Nintendo? You’d been there for many years, but it’s a dream for many to work there.</strong></p>
<p>It’s actually pretty simple. I quit when I was 65. This is the same for anybody, but life is short. We’ve only got a number of years on this earth and there’s a limit to the amount of things you can do with that time. I was kind of mulling over that and at the same time I got an invitation from the university to come and teach and I thought, 'Whoa, this is an opportunity to change things.'</p>
<p><strong>This was three or four years ago, right?</strong></p>
<p>I left in 2021!</p>
<figure data-uuid="4424d263ea05b"><a title="Takaya Imamura outside Nintendo HQ in Kyoto" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4424d263ea05b/takaya-imamura-outside-nintendo-hq-in-kyoto.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1351786503815397376">Nintendo Life / @ima_1966</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What are a few things you miss working at Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p>For the first six months or so after leaving Nintendo, I kept dreaming I was still going to work. I’d start developing a game and then I’d wake up and go, “Oh, oh. Okay that’s weird.”</p>
<p>I actually met with Shigeru Miyamoto once after I left and I said, “Hey, long time no see!” But I actually didn’t feel like that was true since I was seeing him in my dreams all the time. He got a good laugh out of that.</p>
<p><strong>You were at Nintendo for such a long time, so were you pretty close with a lot of your colleagues?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I still keep in contact with all of them. For example, the director of Animal Crossing, Aya Kyogoku, is coming out to see me teach in the classroom in October.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, really?! Is she going to be speaking or just sitting in to observe?</strong></p>
<p>She’s just coming over for a chat! If I have her give a lecture or something like that, then she’s gotta ask Nintendo and it has to be approved.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel for you to be able to pass on all the things you’ve learned to a newer generation?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very difficult because if I was to host a speech, lots of people would come and listen, I think. When we turn it into a formal lecture, then there’s people who are like, “Ughhh, I don’t wanna be here.” People sleep in class, so it’s like any lecture in school.</p>

<p><strong>So I know you’re very famous for creating Tingle - was there anything specific that really inspired you to make him?</strong></p>
<p>The background and the lore of the character was decided beforehand and I was only responsible for the visuals. Basically, I found a guy on the team and drew a caricature and there was Tingle!</p>
<p><strong>That seems to be a running theme for you, taking members of your team and putting them in the game! You did this with Star Fox, Falco and Slippy too, yeah?</strong></p>
<p>I’m pretty good at caricatures. With Star Fox, it wasn’t a direct caricature but instead I was taking inspiration from different people. But yeah, that is one of the ways I do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="652e38f36eafb"><a title="Star Wolf characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/652e38f36eafb/star-wolf-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So you’re saying there’s a real-life Tingle roaming around in the world?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>We know there were a lot of character designs that were carried over from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to Majora’s Mask but did you design any other characters in that game?</strong></p>
<p>The only real NPC I made was Tingle, but I designed the Moon and Majora’s Mask and that was kind of iconic. I was the art director, so I wasn’t designing the actual characters, more setting the overall theme and direction for the art.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember why you were tasked with designing Tingle then? Did someone on the team want you to do it?</strong></p>
<p>It was just a coincidence really. Everyone else was busy so someone asked me, “Hey, could you do this one?” and I said, "Sure!"</p>
<p><strong>Majora’s Mask was developed in a very short amount of time, which sounds like it could be really stressful, but when you think back to that time making that game, is there anything that stands out? A funny moment, maybe the way you bonded with a coworker, or a way you made yourself proud?</strong></p>
<p>It was a really short project compared to general Nintendo timelines, so everybody was really focused on getting it done. So there really wasn’t much room for fun, games, and hijinks. But, near the end of development, I had a homepage at the time and I was drawing caricatures on it just for fun and a TV company got in contact. There’s a program in Japan where they get people on and they compete by drawing caricatures and they’re judged and everything, and I got invited to go on that!</p>
<p>And I thought, 'Huh, okay!' It’s a pretty famous program in Japan, so I thought I’d ask Nintendo and they said, “Yeah, go ahead, why not!” Nintendo said okay, but I was planning to go on without making a big deal about the fact I worked for Nintendo. Then I heard the date the program was going to go live, and it was the release date for Majora’s Mask in Japan!</p>
<p>So I thought, 'Well, in that case, I’ll go on and say who I was!' Then the program ended up coming down to the studio and filmed us developing the game a little bit, and there was me at my desk drawing some pictures. It was such a happy coincidence.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b88936f5a41cc"><a title="Tingle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b88936f5a41cc/tingle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you know if that is available online to watch?</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t been able to find it actually.</p>
<p><strong>Oh really?! I would personally do so much to see that!</strong></p>
<p>The program was called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Champion">TV Champion</a></strong>. *<em>picks up phone and starts looking*</em> It’s a knockout competition and I made it through to the final!</p>
<p>By the way, are you a fan of Tingle?</p>
<p><strong>*shrugs and shakes head*</strong></p>
<p>[Laughs] I know there was a fan campaign to get rid of Tingle at one point, much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars!</p>
<p><strong>I was quite young when the game came out, I think I played it when I was eight. I remember wanting to be Link when I was a kid, so when I saw Tingle, I was like, “Oooo, who is this guy?” He doesn’t fit in the suit, flying around on balloons, letting out a funny scream when you shoot him down. I’ve grown to love him now, but as a kid I always wanted to be the 'cool guy.'</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Stardew Valley is officially available, with a shadowdrop landing today, December 25th. It’s priced at just $14.99, but existing owners can take advantage of a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>It boasts several innovations to boost the game up to spec on Nintendo’s latest flagship console, including ‘intuitive mouse controls’ and online multiplayer that supports up to eight players.</p>







<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-on-switch-but-2">Stardew Valley on Switch, But 2</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe has delivered everyone a neat Christmas gift and launched Stardew Valley’s Switch 2 edition without any warning. It’s available to download <strong>now </strong>through the Nintendo eShop, but if you already own Stardew Valley on the Switch, you can download a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>This new version of the game introduces mouse controls, four-player split-screen co-operative multiplayer, and, as mentioned, eight-player online support. If you lean on GameShare, four friends can play together even if only <strong>one of them </strong>has the game.</p>



<p>While we knew about the version upgrade for Stardew Valley thanks to an announcement made months ago, a release date was never confirmed. It was given a <strong>window </strong>of Fall 2025, which it missed. Here’s the trailer that was published to announce the upgrade several months back:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Back in July, Stardew Valley shattered a record held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years on Steam</strong>. It became the highest-rated game on the entire platform, out of tens of thousands of games. That’s nothing if not indicative of how universally beloved Stardew Valley is.</p>

<p>Here’s to raising a glass to RPG games that continue to bring deep, detailed worlds for everyone to lose hours in. 2025 delivered its fair share of world-class role-playing games, and Insider Gaming is celebrating these outstanding feats with the RPG Game of the Year 2025 award, and the winner might surprise you.</p>



<p>What another year it’s been for the RPG market—you’re simply spoiled at this point. It’s been so overwhelming that even remasters have been some of the most popular launches, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-9-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;Tactics&nbsp;–&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ivalice&nbsp;Chronicles. Plenty of fresh meat has been thrown onto the market, and picking a winner for dinner was tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-role-playing-game-of-2025-winner-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Best Role-Playing Game Of 2025 Winner—Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a pure role-playing game standpoint, with a primary emphasis on quests, world-building, exploration, and deeper, meaningful RPG fundamentals and mechanics, it would be wrong not to award RPG of the year to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios is not here to placate casual users: This is a serious RPG requiring immersion, concentration, and attention to your actions, as one false step or bad choice can be the end of a quest or even your game! There’s so little bloat in KC2, and you have limitless paths to choose from in how you tailor your version of Henry to meet your needs.</p>



<p>The realistic gameplay won’t be for everyone, but who cares when the experience is this rich and full? This is years of hard work and dedication, making a unique RPG. Progression is a multi-layered cake of voluminous ingredients, and well over four million of you have been subjected to its unabashed brilliance. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the RPG game of the year, and an all-time great role-playing game. </p>



<p>If you disagree, you might be branded.</p>

<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a superior, cleaner, and better-perfected game compared to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s just <em>not </em>a better RPG. While Sandfall’s adventure doesn’t hold your hand, it simply doesn’t have the diverse range of freedom KC2 offers, not even close, to be honest.</p>



<p>That said, there’s no disputing how good Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is. It will forever go down as the game that took home a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine The Game Awards 2025</a> honors.

It’s a rightful GOTY contender, and will be talked about for decades, but it can’t be recognized as 2025’s best RPG from a genre standpoint.</p>

<p>It’s hard to argue against Monster Hunter Wilds being the most open and inviting release in the franchise yet. You might have the odd Monster Hunter purist disagree with some of the changes in Wilds, but the fact is that Capcom has done it again. Wilds and World have helped the series transcend the joy and satisfaction of slaying monsters for a select audience and opened the franchise up to the mainstream.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds switches to a living, breathing open-world design, you have a dedicated mount, there are tweaks to the combat and modes of attack, and if you invest now, expect a constant stream of updates between now and the end of the game’s lifecycle—look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 4</a>, as an example.</p>

<p>Obsidian’s calendar has been exceptionally full in 2025, and it’s had another RPG to release and support—Avowed. However, the focal point of the company’s year was always likely to be The Outer Worlds 2. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain</a> helping, the developer has released the perfect follow-up to 2019’s The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>Almost everything has been overhauled and improved in some capacity or another. There’s also a plethora of fun weapons—Wham-Bam!, take that—and even quests feel like you (the player) have been unshackled. You can approach missions and play them in different ways, and between its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-trolls-players-who-buy-the-games-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious trolling Flaws</a> and progression trees, it’s a must-play RPG!</p>
