Discord have belatedly confirmed that they're working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an "experiment" involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an "experiment", isn't it? Never mind that Discord assured us earlier that "identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." Discord haven't yet said what the "experiment" is supposed to explore or prove. I'm sure it's fine, though. It's not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord's new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>"If you're located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used."</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new "age assurance" system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona's involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona's lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren't responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir's UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley's grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification "experiment" bearing Thiel's fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.

            <p>"You will get anywhere between a fairly surgical battle with the more simple moves and synergies, to a downright-drunken-disaster run. [They] act with basically zero understanding of enemy mechanics, no regard for their ability order, and they couldn't give less of a damn about tile hazards." This is a section taken from the description of a mod which turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> into an auto-battler, but turning the controls over to an AI chessmaster. That AI chessmaster just happens to play almost exactly like I have in my seven hours with it thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Seriously, modder Bigbrotherjakeb appears to have found a way to clone me out of sheer desire not to have to play Mewgenics' fights themselves. Their creation, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/8">Auto-Battler Mode</a>', applies the Uncontrollable passive to all of the cats in your party. So, the computer will handle moving them about, targeting enemies, and unleashing abilities. Not that it'll do a good job of any of that. "This is effectively a challenge mode with how dumb the default player AI can be with this implementation (simplest I could quickly find)," the modder wrote.</p>
<p>Cool. Bigbrotherjakeb has hopes of teaching the stupid computer how to pick suitable movement strategies based on the specific class of cat it's controlling in future. I should probably get around to master the same thing.</p>
<p>A couple of other early Mewgenics mods which've caught my eye are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/24?tab=description">Less Cats</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/32">good poop</a>'. Contrary to what its name might suggest, the first one actually results in you having more cats by lowering the number of moggies the game's coterie of weirdos ask for in return for upgrades. As someone who's been a bit sad to part with my retired bois not long after they return from their sole adventure, that sounds good to me.</p><p>Good poop, meanwhile, leaves no room for misinterpretation. Poop now adds two pints to both your cats' health and comfort, rather than dragging it down by the same amount. A relatively small tweak, unless you find a way to play in smellivision further down the road, in which case you might get a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the auto-battler mode or less cats a go, both require the Mewgenics Mod Manager dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/1">Mewtator</a>.</p>
<p>Also among the roguelike cat breeder's early mods are a couple which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/29?tab=description">swap around the audio files</a> for in-game meows. This follows criticism directed at the decision of developer Edmund McMillen to include meows voiced by internet personalities such as Ethan and Hila Klein. You can read McMillen's response as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate">our report on the topic</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410</link>
            <guid>1437199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies across tech are freaking out about the worsening memory chip shortage. It’s already delayed pre-orders for <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">Valve’s Steam machine</a> and could torch Sony’s planned rollout for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">upcoming PlayStation 6</a>. The unannounced console was rumored to be arriving in late 2027, but a new report suggests Sony is considering delaying its next hardware generation until 2028 or even 2029.</p> <p>That’s according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, whose latest report on the AI-fueled memory crisis includes two sources familiar with Sony’s “thinking” who claim the console manufacturer is already “considering” pushing its PS6 launch plans back by a year or two. The report claims the delay would have big consequences for the company’s “carefully orchestrated strategy” to transition <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">users from PS5 to the upcoming hardware</a>.</p>

 <p>Alleged specs for the PS6 began <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">leaking last summer</a> and suggested Sony was prioritizing trying to keep its hardware affordable even as it ramps up power in a solo console arms race with ever diminishing returns. Speculation was that more moderate spec improvements could keep the PS6 priced at around <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">$400-to-$600 instead of $700-to-$1,000</a>. Sony is also believed to be currently working on a handheld that would be able to play PS5 and some cross-gen PS6 games, potentially scaling down performance to keep up with higher-end blockbusters.</p> <p>Why would a single component price shock delay an entire console generation? In the past, Sony might have released a much more expensive machine to compensate. But in recent years as the total footprint of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">console gaming market has plateaued</a>, companies have faced pressure to be more aggressive on price to compete with free-to-play ecosystems that are still thriving on old hardware and weaker devices like smartphones. Sony actually ended up winning the recent holiday sales quarter against the newly released Switch 2 in part by slashing the price of PS5 with big Black Friday discounts.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the Switch 2, whether Nintendo will be forced to raise the price of its new console is another big question posed by the memory shortage. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">has previously told investors</a> it has inventory and contracts to help it weather volatility in the first half of 2026, but if conditions persist it will have to re-evaluate its pricing strategy with an eye toward balancing profitability with maximizing install base. Bloomberg’s report reiterated that Nintendo is already “contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 this year.</p>

<p>Pearl Abyss has stated that Crimson Desert’s premium price is “not something for microtransactions.” </p>



<p>Pearl Abyss’s upcoming action-adventure, Crimson Desert, is all set to release next month on March 19, 2026. Ahead of the release, we have heard a lot of information about the title, including the fact that it has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone gold</a>. Now, we have understood the developers’ views on microtransactions. </p>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-doesn-t-have-a-microtransaction-shop">Crimson Desert Doesn’t Have a Microtransaction Shop</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dropped Frames</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Okami</a>), Crimson Desert PR director Will Power addressed microtransactions. Powers stated that he can definitively say there is no “cosmetic shop.” Powers added, “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world and not something for microtransactions.” The PR director concluded, “this is a premium experience, that is the transaction, full stop.” </p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It is fair to say God of War creator David Jaffe is less than enamoured with the series' newest entry, 2D side-scroller Sons of Sparta.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced during last week's PlayStation State of Play, coming from Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It's a canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<p>At the same time it was announced, Sons of Sparta released on PS5 consoles. And, well, Jaffe is not impressed.</p>
<p>During a nine minute YouTube video, Jaffe quickly laid into the series' latest offering. "This is the kind of game I have always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War… but this to me is not what I was talking about," Jaffe begins, before stating in no uncertain terms: "I don't like it, I don't recommend it."</p>
<p>That was fairly gentle, though, compared to the rest of the video, where Jaffe calls Sons of Sparta "crap", "dumb" and even "stupid".</p>
<p>"What the f**k are they thinking," Jaffe expressed. While the original God of War director did say the gameplay in Sons of Sparta is "fine" and "servicable", he still can't wrap his head around why the game is "in existence" at all.</p><p>"I don't understand, I don't understand," Jaffe said with his face in his hand, reflecting on a conversation he had had with a former Sony Santa Monica developer about the scene in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> where Atreus and Angrboda chat while riding along together. Allegedly, the developer told Jaffe Sony Santa Monica is "these days driven primarily by story", which Jaffe seemed less than enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>"In Sons of Sparta, what I played – which was only about an hour of it, and I'll never go back to it – it's just like 'get over yourselves, man,” the God of War creator said. "They just kept stopping over and over and having the characters just talk and talk and talk. And the voice acting's not very good, the story - at least what I played… maybe it gets really good… - [but] who the f**k wants to play [Sons of Sparta]. This is not God of War."</p>
<p>He continued: "I want you to think about this for a minute, and the choice this team had… the idea of saying 'hey, we want a 2.5D metroidvania God of War game'. Most gamers would say 'oh my god, yes please'. [But] the idea of 'aaand, we don't want it to be the Kratos that you know and love from either 2018's God of War, or the Greek trilogy God of War. F**k it, that character's boring, no one likes that Kratos, that we've built billions of dollars franchises on. Let's make him just some generic f**king kid'... it makes no f**king sense."</p>
<p>Jaffe then said Sons of Sparta's origin story for Kratos as a "dumb idea", and suggested fans would have rather played a game like the much bloodier and violent Metroidvania title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. This, Jaffe said, has the "tone" of the earlier God of Wars. "I'm pretty sure when people said they wanted a 2D God of War, they meant [like Blasphemous]", not Sons of Sparta. "Who the f**k greenlit this? Who thought this was what the audience wants?"</p><p>Meanwhile, if that wasn't enough, Jaffe also laid into Sons of Sparta's production quality. "Compared to what we got just this last year," he said, "if you look at the gameplay variety and just the joy of playing a game like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, if you look at the art and level of detail and just genuine interesting scenarios at a moment-to-moment gameplay level of Neon Inferno – which also came out towards the end of last year, which is just an excellent shooter by the way, I highly recommend it - if you of course look at the production value of the 2D Shinobi, I mean look at that thing.</p>
<p>"People want this production value, and they want this vibe, and they want it to be classic Kratos."</p>
<p>Jaffe suggested that if you "pulled God of War" out of Sons of Sparta, and instead said "hey, we are making a game about this kid", people wouldn't be interested. "I want to know who at Sony thought this was what people wanted," he said. "By the way, I don't need the big budgets. I would have loved bigger production value, smoother animations, this, that, and the other, but I don’t need that, right? If the gameplay was interesting, if it was violent, if it had personality, if you opened immediately and the players were like 'oh my God, I've never thought of that kind of mechanic in a game like this', or 'this is so fun to do', you could make it super inexpensive like this seems to be. I can't imagine this cost that much money to make.</p>
<p>"But why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption."</p>
<p>Jaffe said this whole thing "shows such a collapse of the great executive work that Sony in the past has done", and "the fact that they would think this is what people want from God of War… I just don't know what to f**king tell you".</p>
<p>You can check out Jaffe's increasingly - erm - impassioned speech in full below.</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade (which will hopefully not receive the same reception from Jaffe on its release). However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>Like it or not, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> was a hit. Developer Shift Up (and PS5/PC publisher Sony) has been trying to avoid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">all sorts of drama</a> since its release, but with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/as-stellar-blade-reaches-3-million-sales-shift-up-ceo-rewards-all-300-employees-with-a-switch-2/">over 3m copies sold</a> overall by mid-2025, it's safe to say the action-adventure game found an audience.</p>
<p>Shortly before its PC release last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">Shift Up confirmed the game would get a sequel</a>, and that plans were already underway. Now, thanks to the Q&amp;A section in <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">the company's last financial report</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sounds-like-stellar-blade-may-launch-on-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">IGN</a>), we've gotten confirmation that the powers that be are looking at expanding to platforms beyond PS5 and PC... which essentially means current-gen Xbox consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are in their sights.</p>
<p>The Korean studio has once again described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> as a "steady, long-tail IP" which will be capitalised on in the coming years. Since the sequel is (predictably) a way off, we don't find the news of tentative Xbox and Switch 2 ports particularly shocking. Again, this doesn't mean they're 100 percent happening, but the move makes sense and is definitely on the table. "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up added, before explicitly mentioning advances on that front will happen as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits">Project Spirits</a>, an all-new "flagship title" which will be published by Level Infinite and is targeting consoles, PC, and mobile. Whether the new versions of Stellar Blade would be self-published is up in the air too, but if I had to bet, I'm not expecting Sony to be involved after helping out with the PS5 and PC launches.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shiftup-ceo-receives-presidential-commendation-for-stellar-blade-and-nikke">Shift Up's CEO received</a> "a presidential commendation for boosting the South Korean games industry" following the game's exceptional financial performance and its impact on making the Korean games industry another heavyweight to watch out for in the AAA space, with Neowiz and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">Lies of P</a> also adding to that conversation.</p>

<p>The new project's music will be composed by legendary Japanese violinist and composer Taro Hakase, whose "dexterous...violin" helped to "kick-start the project", according to CyberConnect2.</p><p>Outside of these details, we don't know too much about <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>, but we do know it'll be the first full <em>.hack </em>RPG since 2010's <em>.hack//Link</em>, which was released for the PSP (which should tell you just how long it's been).</p><p>In the interim, a fighting game, <em>.hack//Versus</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hackgu-last-recode-hits-north-america-on-november-3rd" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a8c65b9d-94a0-406f-9822-3dd79877c7ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a remaster</a> of the <em>.hack//GU </em>trilogy have been released, but <em>.hack </em>fans have been waiting quite some time for the continuation of the core series.</p><p>If you're not familiar with the <em>.hack </em>series, the games revolve around a game-within-a-game known simply as <em>The World</em>. It's not dissimilar to anime and manga properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2cb237f6-edfc-48d7-83cb-b6bc1d2f5bf9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Solo Leveling</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Sword Art Online</em>, although it predates both.</p>
<p>We don't yet know when we can expect <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>to launch, although if the game wants to arrive in time for CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, then a release this year would probably be advantageous. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-dlc-console-sales-steam-edmund-mcmillen-2000669404</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mewgenics</em>, the new roguelite RPG battler from <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>developer Edmund McMillen and&nbsp;<em>The End Is Nigh</em>‘s Tyler Glaiel, has proven to be an extraordinary success. Launched February 10, during less than a week on sale has hit the #2 spot on Steam’s bestsellers and seen an extraordinary 115,428 simultaneous players—extraordinary because this is a single-player, offline game. At the time of writing it has more people playing than&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Given this, McMillen has announced that the game will be coming to consoles <em>and </em>receiving DLC. Oh, and it’s incredible soundtrack is now available to buy.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><em>Mewgenics</em></a> is the bastard child of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, <em>X-COM</em> and&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em>, a game about taking a team of cats on an adventure to fight in a series of turn-based RPG battles, then breeding the victors to create your next crew. And while we don’t know officially sales numbers yet, it’s fair to say they’re not small. On launch day, just three hours after the game came out, Glaiel posted that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-steam-best-seller-strategy-roguelike-2000667706">the seven-year development budget</a> had already been recouped. Glaiel has also posted that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3mermwjydf22m">650,000 people had played the game by Friday</a>, and assuming those are all legitimate sales, that’s over $12 million&nbsp;<em>after</em> Steam’s cut.</p>   <p>There was also a moment of excitement for the pair when the game showed more players than&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>   <p>All this means there’s budget and an assumed audience to bring the game to consoles. There are no specifics yet, with updates promised for later, but given the game works well with a controller it’ll be a natural fit for Xbox, PS5 and Switch. I also cannot fathom why this isn’t already on mobile, given it’d be the perfect medium.</p>

 <p>The success also means DLC is in the works, and that’s no small feature either, given the core game is so big that the developers reckon still no one’s finished it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mewgenics updates: <br>-OST is live on the steam page <br>-it’s coming to consoles ( updates later )<br>-there will be dlc <br>-update with some bug fixes soonish<br>-mewgenics merch here &gt; <a href="https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8">https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8</a></p> <p>— 🜏 Edmund McMillen 🜏 (@edmundmcmillen) <a href="https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Certainly not least, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4415490/Mewgenics_ULTIMATE_Original_Soundtrack_Of_All_Time/">the OST is now up on Steam</a>. It contains an astonishing 82 tracks, and only 27 of them are instrumentals. That means you can hear all the originally recorded songs that pop up while playing, with all their barmy lyrics, even if you can’t reach the second act.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of the God of War series has shared his views on the recently released Sons of Sparta title, and it is evident he is not pleased with the game. </p>



<p>Fans of the God of War franchise had an exciting State of Play event last week. Santa Monica Studio not only confirmed that a God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake is in development</a> but also revealed that <span>it&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank">shadow-dropped</a>&nbsp;a</span> game exploring Kratos’ childhood. However, the newly released title is facing harsh criticism from the series creator.</p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trashed-by-original-series-creator">God of War: Sons of Sparta Trashed by Original Series Creator </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/god-of-war-creator-david-jaffe-sons-of-sparta-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, God of War series creator, David Jaffe, has gone off on Sons of Sparta on two separate occasions. The first time was after playing the game for just an hour, where he ended up saying things like “this is not God of War”, “who the f**k greenlit this”, and “who thought this is what the audience wants”. Jaffe also went on to say that the “production quality is not very good,” comparing it to games like Ninja Gaiden, Ragebound, and Neon Inferno.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The series creator released a 32-minute video echoing the sentiments expressed in the previous video. In this new video, he critiques the gameplay using clips from the title. It’s evident that the creator is dissatisfied with this installment, particularly because he feels that the character of Kratos, beloved by fans, is not accurately represented. Instead, players are presented with a different character. </p>

"The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC.

In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third instalment," he concluded.

It's a permanent PS4 exclusive publisher by Sony Interactive Entertainment</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/879913482845511681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, nearly nine years after that tweet, Sony not only publishes games on PC, but on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Arrowhead’s record-breaking Helldivers 2, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-officially-getting-halo-odst-content-but-its-first-legendary-warbond-is-going-to-cost-you">launched on Xbox Series X and S complete with a Halo crossover</a>. And Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is coming out on Xbox as well as PC and PlayStation. The times have changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man, though, does feel like it would be crossing a thicker line to get to Xbox, and Insomniac’s tweet suggests that to be the case. In the shorter term, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine is due out later this year — exclusively on PlayStation 5. Meanwhile, Insomniac fans expect another Spider-Man game eventually, a continuation of the story as set out in 2023’s Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which launched on PC in January last year. (Last year, Yuri Lowenthal suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-3-actor-says-peter-parker-wont-be-relegated-to-the-couch">Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 will see Peter Parker doing his Spider-Man thing</a> despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 suggests.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Spider-Man Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s approach contrasts with that of Microsoft, which has fully embraced multiplatform for pretty much all its first-party video games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026"><u>When Microsoft finally announced Playground’s Forza Horizon 6</u></a> and confirmed it would launch on PlayStation 5 <em>after </em>Xbox and PC, it came as a surprise. Nowadays, Xbox Game Studios is one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Microsoft said the idea of a video game exclusive locked to a single storefront had become “antiquated for most people,”</a> but Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day-one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei). Multiplayer games, however do tend to launch on PC at the same time. Guerrilla’s recently announced co-op action game Horizon Hunters Gathering is set for PS5 and PC. Marathon’s day-one multiplatform launch is something of an outlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

In this new sale, an unknown buyer placed the winning bid of $13 million to secure the card, with the further $3.49 million added in auction fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why has it sold for such a huge amount? Well, at a base level, the Pikachu Illustrator is one of the rarest Pokémon cards out there, and its eyebrow-raising PSA 10 grading makes it truly unique and technically flawless. But Paul himself has done a lot to personally try and raise the card's value — and very successfully so. Minus the auction fees, Paul likely stands to make more than $7 million in profit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/maxresdefault-1-1771237895791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Logan Paul and the $16.49 million card. Image credit: Logan Paul.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Paul has mounted the card in a $70,000 jewel-encrusted necklace (also included in the auction) that he then wore for his WWE debut at WrestleMania 38. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/logan-paul-says-hell-hand-deliver-the-most-expensive-pokmon-card-if-you-buy-it-from-him-at-auction-and-the-price-is-already-more-than-2-million">Announcing the auction last month</a>, Paul then promised to hand-deliver the card — which he billed as "the Mona Lisa of collectibles" —  to its eventual owner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the course of the auction, several other incidents ensured the card (and Paul) remained in the public eye. A brief, bizarre drama involving OnlyFans content creator Emmie Bunni — including a phantom $10.2 million bid and an AI photo of her holding the card — prompted a claim by Paul that her actions had put off further interest. Last week, the influencer-wrestler also got involved in the controversy surrounding Super Bowl LX half time show artist Bad Bunny, and at loggerheads on the issue with his brother Jake Paul. Just days later, the auction reached its climax with a flurry of late bids.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And in general, there's the fact that Pokémon cards have rarely been hotter. This auction has been well-timed, in the run-up to Pokémon's big 30th anniversary celebrations. (Fans are expecting the future of the franchise to be announced on the series' actual anniversary next week, on February 27, alongside more details of the promising-looking Pokémon life simulation spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a>.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Logan Paul.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That "next chapter" is, of course, sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans"><u>Stellar Blade 2</u></a>, which is now in development. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We expect 2026 to be a year in which more users experience the existing title while momentum and anticipation builds toward the next phase of the Stellar Blade franchise," Shift Up added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shift Up is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Spirits</a>, to be published by Level Infinite.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/16/gear-club-unlimited-3-review/</link>
            <guid>1437109</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch was not home to many great racing games, especially ones that didn’t feature karts and moustachioed drivers. So far, that’s continued to play out for the Switch 2, but there are some key signs of change with the arrival of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/grid-legends-switch-2-review/">GRID Legends</a> last month. Drafting directly behind it is Gear Club Unlimited 3, an arcade/sim-cade racer that also boasts its own storyline, licensed vehicles and updated visuals, hoping to snatch its own place on the podium. While it puts up a valiant effort, it feels like it’ll remain firmly in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gear.Club Unlimited 3 | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6KrxPMV8Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As we’re seeing more and more on Switch 2, Gear.Club Unlimited 3 gives you the choice between a 30fps Graphics option and a considerably smoother Performance mode with a 60fps refresh rate. Ideally, racing games need to be 60fps – though 30fps is fine if its stable – and it’s definitely snappier and more responsive. The Graphics option here targets 30fps, but it does not manage it by quite some margin. Stutters and lag happen throughout races in this setting, so much so, that I’d say it’s currently unusable. It doesn’t really seem to make all that much difference to the visuals, either, other than the quality of tyre smoke at the start of races.</p>


<p>In the world of Gear.Club, winning is everything. The story mode sees you joining the organisation as a rookie, before trouncing one of the old pros and stealing his slot on the tour to Japan. Thankfully, everyone is thoroughly amiable, and he comes along as your mentor instead, narrowly avoiding some genuinely interesting conflict and drama. All the story dialogue is told via text boxes and static character art, which serves to emphasise the game’s budget leanings, while the suit and shirt-wearing bigwigs feel completely out of place in a tournament of underground racers. The story is, at best, a fairly forgettable frame to the racing action. At worst, it’s just explaining the next menu you’ve unlocked.</p>


<p>The cars make a better first impression. They are extremely well modelled, shining and glistening in their metallic glory, and striking a tone that will have you feeling pretty positive about Gear.Club Unlimited 3’s chances, though with a roster of 39 cars, it’s relatively slim pickings.</p>
<p>Actually racing them isn’t quite as positive. Gear.Club Unlimited 3 offers a couple of options to tailor your experience, with different levels of brake assist and anti-skid. Whichever option you go for, the cars are relatively well grounded, and pretty reliable in the way they manoeuvre, if a bit lifeless, though there’s still a nagging sense of worry and uncertainty if you go for Expert settings and turn off anti-skid. </p>
<p>Where it comes unstuck is drifting. At no point does this become natural, easy, or enjoyable, and you’ll find you can launch it round curves like a terrible NASCAR driver without losing too much time. That’s all exacerbated by the lack of analogue triggers. We can lay some of that at Nintendo’s door, but when GRID Legends gives you right analogue stick throttle control, and supports the Gamecube controller’s analogue triggers, there’s little excuse for not having it in place. </p>
<p>It all doesn’t come together very well. Rubber banding in races sees you fly past the entire pack, only to have them inexplicably reappear in your mirrors and pass you at the last moment. There’s a Kudos-like scoring system for keeping it clean, and achieving various other feats of vehicular control, but it feels pretty perfunctory and uninvolved.</p>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3 is at its best when it’s trying to emulate Tokyo Xtreme Racer. Battles and duels that take place on packed Japanese highways are the most fun events here, and nipping your way through traffic is a blast. Well, it’s a blast till you clip somebody and invariably end up facing the wrong way.</p>

<p>Upgrading your Club is a pleasant little diversion. You’ve got a massive garage to work with, filling it with technicians as well as designing areas to relax in, and stuffing them full of arcade machines. Upgrading your cars is tied to which workshops you’ve unlocked, and then adding engineers to unlock higher tiers within each one, and that’s interesting enough, giving you a reason to take part in an additional race or two, to fill things out.</p>
<p>The problem is that the engineers and upgrades dry up at points, with little to do but persevere with the ‘story’ mode, and just keep on racing across a map that you can barely tell has changed.</p>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3 is a largely solo experience, with the main story mode taking you from a rookie to the leader of the Gear Club Japan arm of the racing company, while taking in time racing across the roads of France. It’s a shame that progress feels so slow, and the upgrade system so lacklustre, because there are elements of the game that work pretty well. There is a Free-Roam mode too, which I hoped might suddenly turn Unlimited 3 into an open-world racer. Unfortunately, it just lets you – or you and a friend – drive the tracks without any constraints, or you can do some two-player racing, which is a nice thing to have. Being able to explore the world might have been more impactful, if there were more sights to see, beyond the occasional train racing by.</p>

<p>The music is horrendously repetitive. I managed about an hour before I turned off in the races, and maybe a couple more before wanting to cull it in the menus too. Besides that, it hard crashed at points too, dumping you back to the Switch 2’s main menu. It’s just another thing to chip away at Gear.Club Unlimited 3’s potential.</p>

While this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">multiplatform pivot</a></strong> has been welcomed by Switch 2 and Xbox players, many have voiced concerns that the final part of the trilogy will have to make some compromises in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">visual quality</strong> due to the lower specifications of the Nintendo Switch and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, besides continuing to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, this will not be the case, as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong> development team's approach takes platform differences into consideration while scaling down from the lead version of the game: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC version</strong>.</p>



<p><em>"The quality of the trilogy will not be diminished, and that's not the kind of development structure we have in the first place,"</em> said <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in a fresh interview with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7f-20260216-421552/">Automaton</a></strong>. <em>"I think I have no choice but to keep saying this."</em></p>



<p>Realizing that the concerns may be justified, as he never went in-depth on why <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't be dragged down</strong> by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S, Hamaguchi-san provided a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">thorough explanation</strong> on why this won't happen, breaking things down by component, starting with potential <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ROM limitations</strong> deriving from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges</strong>. As the game will launch at retail on a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game-Key Card</strong>, file size will not be an issue on the other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-managing-ram-on-nintendo-switch-2-vs-xbox-series-s">Managing RAM on Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Xbox Series S</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-RAM.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With proper RAM optimization, Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 will not be dragged down by the Switch 2 and Xbox Series S versions.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM</strong> is among the biggest difference between modern consoles, but this too won't be a concern for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The Nintendo Switch 2 has plenty of RAM, so it shouldn't be affected. It's true that it will struggle with the Xbox Series S, but that's been addressed by fine-tuning each platform to the utmost. So, RAM issues won't restrict other platforms,"</em> Hamaguchi-san explained.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-npc-density-will-be-critical-for-cpu-optimization">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 NPC Density Will Be Critical For CPU Optimization</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-part-3-NPCs-Density.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3's world may feel a little less lively on lower-end platforms</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The differences in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU</strong> between the systems are unlikely to be a cause for concern. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The way we currently make games is that if a game runs at 30fps on PS4, Nintendo Switch 2, or Xbox Series S, then it should be able to run at 60fps on a high-end platform. In other words, we don't design games with the assumption that it will run at 30fps on a high-end CPU and use all of its available capacity,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"For hardware with CPU power to spare, we use a method of scaling only the density of NPCs in towns, such as the number of NPCs. This means that towns may feel more lively on high-spec hardware, while the number of NPCs may be lower on other hardware."</em> As such, the director of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 believes the team is unlikely to encounter <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU-related issues</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gpu-optimization-and-asset-reduction-from-leading-pc-platform">GPU Optimization and Asset Reduction From Leading PC Platform</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-PC-leading-platform.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Those with high-end PCs will be able to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 at their best, according to Hamaguchi-san.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The final concern fans have, and the one Hamaguchi-san recognizes is the biggest, is related to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">GPU</strong>. Even in this case, however, the Final Fantasy VII Remake series director believes there won't be issues, thanks to <span>the team's development approach, which&nbsp;<strong>scales down from the leading PC version</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>focuses on&nbsp;</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">optimization</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The FFVII Remake series has been purchased by a huge number of customers on Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we are also conscious of creating assets for the wider PC market during development. That's why we create 3D asset data with the highest asset quality based on PC,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em>"As a basic data design, we don't conform to low standards, but create assets for even higher-end use. We call this reduction, and the design involves adjusting and tuning the asset level to suit each platform. In that sense, it's a design philosophy that basically doesn't affect high-spec platforms. This isn't just something we do, but is a relatively common way of thinking in game development environments these days."</em> As such, those with high-end platforms will be able to enjoy the game at its best, while console players will still have a <strong>great experience tailored to their hardware</strong> of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-is-now-playable">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Is "Now Playable"</h2>



<p>After the end of this exhausting explanation, Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">update on the yet-to-be-revealed Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Development is proceeding almost exactly on time, according to the schedule and milestones set at the beginning of development, and the game is now playable. As a team, we are in the final push to continue developing the game, so the quality is improving day by day, and as a repeat player, the scenery changes every day, making it exciting. So, I think that in the not-too-distant future, we will have an opportunity to share some information with you all."</em> </p>



<p>Hopefully, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/">it really won't take much longer</a></strong> to finally see this highly anticipated game in action.</p>

              <p>Given the current extended wave of Pokémon card lunacy began with Logan Paul in 2020, perhaps this weekend’s sale of the YouTuber’s Illustrator Pikachu card for a completely deranged <strong>$16.49 million</strong> could be the end of it? Bookend this nonsense with the same awful man.</p> <p>Logan Paul’s Illustrator Pikachu is without doubt one of the rarest Pokémon cards in existence. The special card, created in 1997 as part of an illustration contest in Japan, has a unique image of Pikachu with a paintbrush and saw only 41 printed. Of those, only one has ever been graded by PSA (a company that grades all sorts of memorabilia by incredible high standards) to be a 10—a card in perfect condition—and this is the one Paul bought as a stunt in 2022. He paid, in total, $5.275 million, of which $4m was in cash, and the rest in the form of a PSA 9 version of the same card. He then, infamously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">wore the card around his neck for his appearance at Wrestlemania</a> in 2022.</p>

 <p>This was not the first time Logan Paul had pulled this stunt. In 2020, as the world collectively lost its mind during covid, Paul began spending millions on Pokémon packs for attention-seeking streams. At one point he bought a Gem Mint 10 1999 first edition holo Charizard (one of the most sought-after cards) for $150,000, then wore it around his neck to one of his pretend boxing matches against Floyd Mayweather, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-wore-a-pokemon-card-to-mayweather-fight-say-1847044171">claiming at the time that this act had caused it to become worth a million dollars</a>. Thankfully that wasn’t true, and despite the massive hike in prices across the rest of the hobby, you can still pick up the same card in the same quality <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-4-charizard-psa-gem-mtvzj4m">for not much more</a>.</p> <h2>Illustrator Pikachu’s peculiar path</h2> <p>Since 2022, the fate of the Illustrator Pikachu has been bizarrely mixed. In 2022 an Las Vegas Raiders linebacker sold a CGC (rival grading company to PSA) 9.5 for $672,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-pokemon-card-illustrator-blake-martinez-nfl-retire-1849803410">and celebrated by resigning from the NFL</a>. He’s likely kicking himself still, given in the same year <a href="https://kotaku.com/illustrator-pikachu-pokemon-card-most-valuable-record-s-1848598145">someone bought a poorer quality PSA 7 version for $900,000</a>, which at the time made it the most expensive Pokémon card sale ever, before Logan Paul got one later that year. However, a year later in 2023 a PSA 8 went up for auction at $480,000 and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">didn’t receive a single bid</a>. Then last year, all sense was lost as <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-psa9-auction-2000625686">a PSA 9 Illustrator Pikachu sold for a ludicrous $4,000,000</a>. Why was this card suddenly worth nearly four times more than Paul had sold his for three years earlier? Or six times more than the CGC 9.5? Because these small pieces of floppy cardboard are only ever worth what someone is willing to pay for them.</p>

 <p>But forget all of that now, because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/logan-paul-pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-auction-final-sale-price/">as&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> reported this weekend</a>, Logan Paul just sold his one-of-a-kind PSA 10 Pikachu for $16,492,000.</p> <p><a href="https://goldin.co/buy/?Auctions=202512-1918-3018-925819e2-7bfc-4e60-a624-05d1e2f2d4a3&amp;page=1&amp;sort=Featured&amp;number_of_lots=24">Auctioned by Goldin</a>, alongside Paul’s PSA 10 1999 Charizard, a matching Blastoise, and a factory sealed box of Base Set 1st Edition cards, and a whole bunch of others, they all sold for wildly inflated prices. The headline is obviously <a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjAsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">the Pikapainter which went for that $16.5 million</a>, but everything else is equally ridiculous. The Charizard, as described above usually worth $150,000, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-4-chajdvc5?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjEsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">went for $954,800</a>; the Blastoise sold <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-2-blaejo67?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjIsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">for $138,880</a> despite another identical card <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/397613597277">selling for $2000 on eBay yesterday</a>; the matching Venusaur <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-15-vegq3n7?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjMsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">fetched $75,640</a>; and that box of Base Set went for nearly half a million, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-factory-sealed-booster-box-36-packsmrlo2?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjQsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">$496,000</a>. So why did the Base Set starters fetch so much higher? Because for some reason PSA agreed to mark the labels on these gradings with “1ST ED—LOGAN PAUL BREAK,” thus in the eyes of collectors making them unique. As for the Pikachu, there’s no rational explanation.</p>

 <p>Obviously this $16.5 million sale smashes all previous records to pieces, and surely—<em>surely—</em>will never be beaten. There has to come a point where humanity recognizes that shiny cardboard is of limited value. At approximately 1.85 grams, this card is worth 55,370 times the price of gold. Which is silly. It’s all incredibly silly.</p>

<p>The ongoing shortage of memory chips has reportedly led Sony to consider delaying the PS6’s release to 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>The shortage of memory chips is impacting the gaming industry significantly. We have already seen GPU manufacturers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raise prices</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue</a> certain products. <span>It seems <span>the impact will reach next-gen consoles as well, as first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>&nbsp;and now corroborated by Bloomberg: RAM price increases will delay the next-gen console of PlayStation</span>.</span></p>







<h2 id="h-ps6-could-be-pushed-to-2029-and-switch-2-price-increase-being-contemplated">PS6 Could be Pushed to 2029 and Switch 2 Price Increase Being Contemplated</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> states that “people familiar with the company’s thinking” have revealed that Sony Group has thought of “pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029.” That’s not all; people familiar with Nintendo’s plans have also stated that the company “is also contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 in 2026. However, neither Sony nor Nintendo has officially commented on these plans. </p>



<p>When <span>discussing the impact of memory prices on current-gen consoles, Nintendo has already stated that it will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-carefully-evaluate-switch-2-price-increase-as-memory-costs-rise/" target="_blank">carefully” evaluate</a>&nbsp;Switch 2’s price amid&nbsp;</span>rising memory costs. Sony, on the other hand, has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-holiday-stock-wont-be-impacted-by-ram-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 stocks won’t be affected</a> by memory shortages until the end of the holiday 2026 season. At the same time, PS6 and PlayStation handheld are claimed to have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impressive memory specs</a>, so Sony seems to be in a pickle for their next-gen console. </p>

<p>There was never any doubt that the <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> would bring some heat in the merch department on the run-up to launch. Nintendo may have its Talking Flower primed and ready to go as a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-bros-wonder-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-meetup-in-bellabel-park">Mario Wonder Switch 2</a> tie-in (brand synergy, and all that), but we dare you to take one look at the 'Nintendo The Super Mario Galaxy Movie: Hatchin' Yoshi Interactive Toy' (catchy, right?) and <em>not</em> tell us that it's adorable.</p>
<p>The name is pretty self-explanatory on this one. Hatchin' Yoshi is an interactive toy that sees our beloved dino 'hatch' from his eggshell casing and then respond to touch and voice commands. He can rock back and forth, shake his little head, say his name — come on, what else do you expect from the little fella?</p>
<p>All of this cuteness doesn't come cheap, mind you. The Yoshi toy is now available to pre-order from <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Ftoys%2Ffashion-and-dolls%2Finteractive-pets%2Fnintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg%2Fp%2F254238&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Smyths Toys</a> here in the UK for <strong>£59.99</strong>, with <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/205546/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FYSH-INA-Interactive-Hatching%2F17692502283" rel="sponsored noopener">Walmart</a>'s <strong>$49.88</strong> pre-orders opening in North America soon. According to the Smyths listing, the toy is expected to launch in early April, which perfectly lines up with the Galaxy Movie's new release date.</p>

<p>This is the latest 'hatching' toy from Spin Master, the company behind the similar '<a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.smythstoys.com%2Fuk%2Fen-gb%2Ftoys%2Ffashion-and-dolls%2Fhatchimals%2Fc%2FSM06010426&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Hatchimals</a>' and '<a href="https://www.spinmaster.com/en-US/brands/primal-hatch/">Primal Hatch</a>' ranges. Hey, the kids are clearly all about eggs these days.</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will arrive in cinemas on 1st April. Nintendo came in hot with some fresh posters last week, and short TV spots and official trailers continue to show us more of what's in store. Let's hope Nintendo and Illumination still have a few surprises up their sleeve in time for the premiere.</p>

            <p>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has become the latest game to have its initially listed recommended RAM requirement yanked down by a substantial amount, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">following in the footsteps</a> of fellow 2026 release 007: First Light.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers TT Games announced in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2215200/view/509605417596223740">Steam post</a> that the recommended RAM number for da bat's latest adventure now sits at 16GB rather than the initially announced 32GB.</p>
<p>"Please note, our PC specs at this stage are not final," the studio added, citing this revision as being the product of some ongoing testing. "We will be continuing to optimize and make improvements as we move closer to launch." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215200/LEGO_Batman_Legacy_of_the_Dark_Knight/">rest of the specs</a>, including an Intel Core i7-12700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and GeForce RTX 3080 with 10GB or Radeon RX 6800 XT with 16GB, remain as they were for now, An SSD is also still listed as a hard requirement in both the recommended and minimum specs.</p>
<p>The RAM revision comes amid what our hardware and occasional kitchenware guru James has dubbed RAMnarok. Basically, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">RAM prices have gone through the roof</a> thanks to vast swaths of it being hoovered up for AI-related uses. So, those selling RAM for use in consumer PCs have had to jack up their prices to offset the beefier sums they're having to fork over to fill up their parts conveyor belts during this RAM shortage or simply to take advantage of the scarcity meaning you'll struggle to get ahold of some at a cheaper price elsewhere.</p><p>It's bad, especially when the knock-on effects for hardware like the recently delayed Steam Machine are taken into account. Hence games like Legacy of the Dark Knight dropping their RAM requirements where testing reveals they can, making them a more attractive proposition to folks who don't want to face the potential of paying through the nose for an upgrade to their existing rigs just to play. If RAM prices weren't soaring, such tweaks wouldn't be as big a deal, but they are, so here we are.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, all! It’s time once again to load the Maw up with new PC games, that we may stave off the apocalypse till next Monday. This week covers a wide spectrum of flavours and textures: papery, Dodo-ish, ducklike, inky, formaldehyde-y, pasty, furry, feculent, and fishy. Once you’re done throwing up, get back here and run your protesting eyes over the full list. As ever, we welcome your urgent suggestions.</p>
<h2>Monday 16th February</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720940/Book_Smugglers/">Book Smugglers</a> is a point and click adventure about circulating forbidden texts in 19th century Tsarist Lithuania.  </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362750/Stormbridge/">Stormbridge</a> is a strictly horizontal blend of tower defence and city builder in which you stretch out a settlement rightwards, while raising defences against an encroaching tempest on the left.</li>
<li>For people who want more randomisation and playdough faces in their Ogre Battling, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622820/Dobbel_Dungeon/">Dobbel Dungeon</a> is a turn-based tactics affair in which characters roll dice each turn to determine the moves they can perform.</li>
<li>Out this day in early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720920/ASTROBOTANICA/">Astrobotanica</a> is a somewhat Crash Bandicoot-esque puzzle ‘n’ survival game in which you are an extra-terrestrial botanist making sense of prehistoric Earth, feat. Neanderthals and Dodos.</li>
<li>Let’s savagely rebut the chonky ‘take me to your chief mammoth hunter’ bonhomie of that last entry with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3885910/Alien_Morgue/">Alien Morgue</a>, in which you do autopsies on little green men. (You don’t appear to be playing a Neanderthal or a Dodo.)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 17th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Time to once again dust off those parched and abraded Zelda memories with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1583520/Under_The_Island/">Under The Island</a>, a top-down island dungeon puzzler featuring six biomes replete with grass you can slash to reveal health hearts.</li>
<li>Friendslop’s bottomless chum bucket has claimed Cthulhu in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3140720/Ritual_Party/">Ritual Party</a>, which is about four buds (or <em>are</em> you?) trying to perform a hellish ritual. Please, somebody help me think of a non-pejorative word for “friendslop” that rolls off the tongue as easily. The best I have are “Overcookie” and “Lethalcomp”.</li>
<li>No time for friendslop, actually, for today marks the dawning of duck-builders. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510020/Placid_Plastic_Deck__A_Quiet_Quest/">Placid Plastic Deck: A Quiet Quest</a> (pictured) is a deeply suspicious card-battler.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714150/Beyond_the_Doors/">Beyond The Doors</a> is a finicky surveillance sim in which you accept mysterious requests to bug your neighbours, while probing the enigmas of the architecture itself.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3514630/Roach_Post/">Roach Post</a> is a cheery roguelite puzzler in which you stick together postage stamps with the help of an army of cockroaches.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2059570/Forgotlings/">Forgotlings</a> is a posh-looking, VA-heavy action adventure set in a world of discarded sentient objects.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 18th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Nice cavernous origami world you’ve got there, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4240550/Blank/">Blank</a>. Shame if somebody were to platform all over it.</li>
<li>Equal parts horny, despairing and whimsical, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878760/KILL_THE_WITCH/">Kill The Witch</a> is an early access 2D action platformer in which you are a witch with a baseball bat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781470/The_Killing_Stone/">The Killing Stone</a> is an Inscryptic confection from the makers of The Blackout Club. You are in the Arctic, playing a cursed boardgame to save the souls of a noble family from the Devil.</li>
<li>The criminal absence of licensed music notwithstanding, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a> looks to be a pleasant “what if”-driven strategy management port of TV’s definitive trip to the Delta Quadrant. Off to the Transporter room with you, Neelix - you’re doing a one-man-raid on the Borg Cube.</li>
<li>People who pre-fur the Star Foxy breed of space sim might want to throw their pennies at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/"> FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>. Neelix’s tufty mug wouldn’t look out of place here, now that I think of it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 19th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Today brings quite the haul. Let’s barge through them at pace. Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701440/PARANORMASIGHT_The_Mermaids_Curse/">PARANORMASIGHT: The Mermaid's Curse</a> is a sun-baked mystery horror novel in which an ensemble cast wrangle with some ghastly fishwomen.</li>
<li>The N64-to-Gamecube era lives on in “expressive” platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585890/Demon_Tides/">Demon Tides</a>, which casts you as a transforming devil princess.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a> is your latest helping of putrid and snarky open world goblin stealth.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">Love Eternal</a> is an introspective horror platformer we might blithely summarise as Playdead X Celeste. </li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878580/Key_Fairy/">Key Fairy</a> is a “hand-drawn, pacifist, folkloric, bullet-hell” game in which you grapple past monsters, salvaging their shattered stars, and solve riddles in a forest of scratchy blood and ink.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4341390/Nightsoil/">Nightsoil</a> is possibly the first turd collection game I’ve covered, and certainly the first emotive turd collection game I’ve covered.</li>
<li>Get the sense that all is not well on this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622230/MOONROT/">particular gas giant moon</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 20th February</h2>
<ul>
<li>Just a couple more before we go gently into that good Friday night. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949290/Ys_X_Proud_Nordics/">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> is an updated version of a 2023 entrant in the sprawling Ys series, best known (to me, anyway) for popularising the concept of bumpslash combat.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3525970/Horripilant/">Horripilant</a> is an incremental dungeon clicker about an old knight in a world of Junji Ito-esque filthbastards.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s going on in the Treehouse this week? James is biffing several larger hardware stories, and threatening to educate the rest of us about teraflops. Mark wants to walk the desert – hurting, longing, dancing to disco music. Julian may have an awkward tale to tell about a PC game he shouldn’t admit to have played. I am thinking about open worlds and city builders, because I am nothing if not shackled to genre. Callum is biding his time before the Requiem, and Ollie is eyeing the months ahead through a telescope (and also, possibly playing more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>). Jeremy ain’t in yet. How about you?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Become is a Ballsy Indie Game That Has You Play as Sperm]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/become-game-ballsy-indie-sperm/</link>
            <guid>1437082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>That’s right, the game you always wanted but never knew it is about to be made by two people. It’s called Become, and it tells the tale of a single sperm (called a spermatazoon) seeking to make his mark and fertilize an egg, accomplishing what he was put on this Earth (or in a pair of balls) to do.</p>



<p>It’s a third-person adventure-survival game that has been created by two developers, and it’s set to launch on Steam later this year. Needless to say, it’s <strong>ballsy</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-become-one-of-millions">Become One of Millions</h2>



<p>Become is a unique game that takes players and throws them into the role of a spermatazoon, hellbent on beating hundreds of millions of competitors to achieve the ultimate goal, kick-starting a new life. It has a few customization elements, a two-to-three-hour story, and impressive visuals, considering the whole game takes place inside… Well, you know.</p>



<p>Per the game’s blurb on Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience life’s fantastical journey as one of millions of sperm. Survive the microcosm dangers, wiggle, dash and compete through the human reproductive system and create new life.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Become, players must navigate treacherous terrain, swimming through currents and upgrading themselves through the collection of sugars and proteins, all with the goal of being the hardiest and most efficient little swimmer.</p>



<p>It’s educational, too. The duo of developers has stressed that Become allows players to ‘learn about the reproductive microcosm’. However, it’s done in a way that isn’t as crude as you might think, as the disclaimer mentions nothing more than ‘humorous references to sperm and conception.’</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for Become:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Become - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hb4Pjyfs6IQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In a world of gargantuan AAA (and AAAA) games, Become might just be about to prove that size doesn’t matter, and you can still get a nice amount of bang for your buck by shooting out and giving this game a go. Who knows? The price for Become hasn’t been revealed just yet, but it shouldn’t be too much, all things considered.</p>







<p>How much would you pay to give the gift of digital, animated life? Let us know if you’re interested in Become on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-delay-2028-2029-nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-2026/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you have been following tech news <span>over the past few months, you are well aware of how the&nbsp;<strong>widespread adoption of AI</strong>&nbsp;is causing many</span> issues for consumers, with <strong>prices of components</strong> such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ram-prices-are-flattening-out-over-the-past-few-days-but-dont-be-fooled/"><strong>RAM</strong></a> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sandisk-wd-black-sn7100-sn8100-1-tb-ssds-have-risen-to-246-366/">SSDs</a></strong> <strong>skyrocketing</strong> in a matter of days. </p>



<p>These price increases and the limited availability of components for anything that is not supposed to be used in an AI data center is making things difficult even for console manufacturers, so much so that <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Sony is reportedly actively considering a delay of its PlayStation 6 system.</strong></p>



<p>In a new report posted today on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a></strong>, according to people "<em>familiar</em>" with the company's thinking, <em>"Sony Group Corp. is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029."</em></p>



<p> While this isn't the first time we have heard of a possible <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/">delay for the PlayStation 6</a></strong> beyond the expected 2027 release window, the number of reports in the past few weeks suggests <strong>this is no longer a last-case scenario but a concrete possibility.</strong></p>



<p>Things are not any easier for the manufacturers who managed to release their hardware before this <strong>chip crisis</strong> showed its ugly head. According to people familiar with the company's plan who spoke with Bloomberg, Nintendo is also <strong>contemplating raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2</strong> in 2026. </p>



<p>Again, this isn't very surprising. Back in November, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 price</strong></a> was expected to remain stable in the immediate future unless "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected event</em>." Still, this is an unfortunate turn of events that will eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">price many gamers out of current-generation systems.</strong></p>



<p>The PlayStation 6 may not be the only next-generation console to see a consistent delay over its expected release window. The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/amds-semi-custom-soc-thatll-power-the-next-gen-xbox-is-progressing-well-to-support-a-launch-in-2027-says-amd-ceo/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">next-generation Xbox may launch in 2027</strong></a>, but that is reportedly a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-gen-might-launch-2027-but-its-best-case-scenario/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">best-case scenario</strong></a>, and with the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-cost-double-playstation-6/">Magnus APU being more expensive</a></strong> than the chip powering Sony's systems, the system would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">commercially</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">doomed</strong> if it launched at a very high price that would be in complete contrast to the concept of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">affordability</strong> that makes <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">consoles enticing to consumers.</strong></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> is one of those multiplayer games that continue to thrive without making much noise outside their core communities. In fact, last year brought a number of substantial changes to the game through the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-x-update-detailed-as-game-goes-free-to-play">Rainbow Six Siege X update</a>. Shame about those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rainbow-six-siege-still-struggling-after-ubisoft-was-forced-to-briefly-intentionally-shut-it-down-following-third-party-hack">massive attacks from hackers</a> though.</p>
<p>In any case, a new year brings new opportunities, and this next content drop had probably been brewing for a long while. The rumours were true: Solid Snake as seen in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> is coming to the game on 3rd March. Yep, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-finally-frees-mgs4-from-the-ps3-with-august-release-date-sony-state-of-play">Konami has gone beast mode</a> and is even doing a huge collaboration now with a publisher that was a major competitor years ago.</p> <figure>

<p>The reveal trailer is self-explanatory: Sam Fisher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> series) and Solid Snake in the same game? Working together? Time-travel back to the mid-2000s with this trailer and you'd blow the gaming industry's collective mind. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-ification of every franchise big enough is real, but if that's the future of entertainment, we might as well enjoy team-ups that always were destined to happen.</p>
<p>Fisher joined Rainbow Six Siege a few years back, when it was starting to embrace the potential of crossovers with other IPs. Of course, it's far more shocking when those big collabs happen with different publishers, and even more special when we're talking about stealth game legends. And if you were thinking Solid Snake is just a skin or a lazy operator design, you'd be wrong:</p><figure>

<p>As thoroughly described by <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/7wYca8Fw674NP93tZe9uDe/solid-snake-joins-rainbow-six-siege-in-operation-silent-hunt">the blog post on Operation Silent Hunt</a>, "Solid Snake excels at tracking down Defender positions and scavenging supplies on the battlefield to adapt to any situation" thanks to the familiar Soliton Radar MKIII gadget and an "On-Site Procurement ability." The battle pass for this season instantly unlocks Snake and includes cosmetics for other operators, like the Psycho Mantis outfit for Smoke. Later, a mystery new mode will be added alongside more MGS outfits and the long-awaited team-up with Sam Fisher, which is a limited-time mode of sorts.</p>
<p>Beyond the fan excitement surrounding Snake's arrival to R6 Siege, it's safe to say this new addition to the roster will shake the meta up in big ways, as the stealth legend is a master of controlling movement in the battlefield and can carry more secondary gadgets. Can he be a lore-friendly <em>and</em> balanced operator? Let's hope so.</p>
