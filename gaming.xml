            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2%E2%80%99s-next-update-will-target-crashes-quest-issues-and-ui-bugs.1043862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-next-update-fixes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>STALKER 2 has been on the market for three days, and it seems that for every person ranting about the game, there’s someone there singing the title’s praises. It’s a divisive game, that’s for sure – but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>, I gave it a 9/10 and recommended gamers everywhere invest at least a little time in the post-apocalyptic epic.</p>



<p>GSC Game World is hard at work patching up the game, addressing the bugs that have caused some users to leave negative reviews or order refunds of the game that took more than a decade to piece together.</p>



<p>The next update is said to be a doozy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-changes-incoming">Changes Incoming</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878203415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, GSC Game World revealed that the next STALKER 2 update is a hefty one. It’s going to target some of the stickiest issues players have been dealing with since the game was released on November 20 on Xbox and PC.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issue and memory allocation failures (PC)</li>



<li>Main quest progression fixes (game-breaking bugs)</li>



<li>Gameplay balancing and adjustments (trader prices and NPC behaviour)</li>



<li>Cutscene fixes (facial animations and clipping)</li>



<li>‘Softlock’ fixes (menu freezing)</li>



<li>UI improvements (quest notifications, interaction prompts)</li>
</ul>



<p>In a future update, the team will work on ironing out bugs in the ‘A-Life’ system that powers the game’s AI-driven NPCs. It has been a notorious issue since the game dropped, with the intelligent, realistic AI that was promised not having been delivered.</p>



<p>GSC will also work to address controller-based issues, such as dead zone bug fixes.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to reassure you once more that we will make every effort to constantly improve your S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl experience. We are truly grateful for your feedback and suggestions for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr Disrespect Teases Relocation to Rumble in Recent Stream]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-relocation-rumble-youtube-stream/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dr-disrespect-teases-relocation-to-rumble-in-recent-stream.1043856/</guid>

<p>Dr Disrespect, the disgraced content creator who found himself at the centre of a dire scandal in recent months, has teased a departure from YouTube in favour of Rumble, a competing platform.</p>



<p>It all started with a new ‘DrDisrespect’ profile cropping up on Rumble, which according to <a href="https://streamscharts.com/platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">StreamsCharts.com</a> is the sixth largest streaming site by viewer numbers. From there, Rumble’s CEO posted a cryptic message on social media that many saw as a connection to Dr Disrespect.</p>



<p>This move has come from Dr Disrespect’s failure to regain monetisation on YouTube, which he lost when he admitted to using Twitch to inappropriately message a minor in 2017.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-home-same-old-doc">New Home, Same Old Doc</h2>



<p>Rumble’s CEO has been flying in the face of controversy, refusing to acknowledge Dr Disrespect’s wrongdoing and seemingly teasing the scandalous creator’s impending arrival several times on social media. In a post on October 26, Chris Pavlovski, Rumble’s CEO, said that he’s securing the ‘biggest gaming streamer’ with a contract in 2025.</p>



<p>At the end of <a href="https://x.com/layer_cake/status/1860133482930094342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dr Disrespect’s most recent stream</a>, the veteran creator faded out with a cryptic sequence. His broadcast dropped to bars and tones before pivoting to a loading screen that read ‘Connection Redirected’. </p>



<p>Fans and critics alike have surmised that Dr Disrespect is about to announce a move to Rumble which could kickstart in 2025.</p>



<p>In June, the infamous streamer admitted to messaging a minor on Twitch several years ago but stressed that nothing criminal took place and that the business was long since settled. Regardless, he lost the support of hundreds of thousands of followers, had ties with other content creators cut, and was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-studio-cut-ties-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropped by sponsorship partners</a>.</p>



<p>Despite the scandal, he returned to streaming in September and pulled in substantial numbers, with his core following standing firm in the face of blatant issues.</p>

			<p>Modder HalkHogan has finally released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-nextgen-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition</a>, the final version of his texture overhaul for CD Projekt RED's next-gen version of the open world RPG masterpiece. According to HalkHogan, though, the improvement is far more extensive than just a texture upscale.</p>
<p><em>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project NextGen Edition is a project created from the heart that improves and reworks a huge amount of game assets (textures, models, materials and more), and the number of these changes can be counted in thousands. Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent, and as faithful as possible, reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of The Witcher. Now you can experience the most beautiful adventure yet with The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt!</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ultra quality detailed lore-friendly textures (many of them are reworked to 4K)</em></li>
<li><em>Implemented relief mapping on many surfaces, making them look much more realistic and 3D now</em></li>
<li><em>High quality smooth and more detailed models</em></li>
<li><em>Better object LODs (level of models details from distance) and increased draw distance for many objects</em></li>
<li><em>Specially customized materials and shaders for all reworked assets, that give the objects and surfaces a more realistic look</em></li>
<li><em>Everything consistent with the original CD Projekt RED artistic vision of The Witcher 3</em></li>
</ul>

            <p>Developer Asobo has advised <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> players to "move your community packages" if they experience persistent stability issues or long loading times.</p>
<p>In a notice appended to the 1.1.9.0 Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-update-1-1-9-0-available-now">release notes</a>, Asobo noted that outdated packages in the Community Folder could adversely impact performance, adding that relocating the packages to another folder and relaunching the game should help.</p>

<p>"If you are playing on PC, outdated packages in your Community Folder may have an unexpected impact on the title’s performance and behaviour," the statement said. "If you suffer from stability issues or long loading times, move your Community package(s) to another folder before relaunching the title."</p><p>The patch itself also addresses a crash when you select "As Arrival" in the EFB, a crash that could occur when "closing and invoking the Camera menu after changing the Drone focus mode option to a value other than undefined", as well as "various" other crashes across the title".</p> <div>

<p>A few other "general" bug fixes have also been resolved, including the missing cursor on Xbox Live sign-in popup, a problem where you could lose focus when creating a new input profile, and a bug wherein the aircraft selection is accessible via the control menu, but can only be changed from the home page.</p>
<p>It also fixes an issue where you could get stuck when accessing the menu bar from any help page.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-studio-apologises-for-issues-as-it-increases-server-capacity">the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 team apologised to its community</a> for the game's less than perfect debut, admitting, "this is not the launch experience we want for our players", admitting it vastly underestimated how many of us would be looking to take to the skies in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 at launch.</p>
<p>In related news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-borrowed-all-its-animals-from-planet-zoo">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 borrowed all its animals from Planet Zoo</a>.</p>
<p>"I called my friend, the CEO. His name is Jonny [Watts], and I said, 'Hey, Jonny, I'm working on Flight Sim, can I have your animals from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-zoo">Planet Zoo</a>?' And he's like, 'Yeah, why not?'," said Flight Simulator boss Jorg Neumann. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Intel is preparing to reveal its next generation of graphics cards, and it looks like some early specs have been leaked thanks to a, now removed, store listing.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gxp8e0/amazon_has_leaked_a_few_intel_arc_b580_gpus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">accidently listed</a>, then removed, what appeared to be two Intel Battlemage GPUs from ASRock. According to the store listing, the Intel Arc B580 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory with a speed of 19Gbps. The card also features a 192-bit memory bus which would result in a 456 GB/s or so bandwidth.</p>







<p>A couple interesting bits from the listing were the cards being PCIe x8 only as opposed to x16. Regarding boost frequency, the listing suggested a 2.8 GHz boost frequency compared to a 2.0 GHz from the Arc A580.</p>



<p>When reached for comment in the past, Intel has declined to comment on any rumor or speculation. That said, a store listing adds credence to rumors that an announcement of their new graphics cards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was set to come in December</a>.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Intel Arc B580</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Battlemage BGM-G21</td></tr><tr><td>GPU Clock Speed</td><td>2.8 GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>12GB GDDR6</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bus</td><td>192-bit</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Speed</td><td>19 Gbps</td></tr><tr><td>Memory Bandwidth</td><td>456 GB/s</td></tr><tr><td>PCIe</td><td>5.0 x8</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> fan believes they've discovered a hidden message that adds further credence to a long-held fan theory about the seminal horror game.</p>
<p>The player believes that on two television sets found in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> – the TV in the hospital cafeteria, and another in the nurses' lounge – a secret message is being played via Morse code.</p>

<p>"A message is playing on the TV in Brookhaven Hospital, transmitted in morse code," YouTuber Shiba explained.</p>
<p>"The sound is mostly drowned out by the static from the TV, making it difficult to hear clearly. However, the Morse code is distinct, with a clicking sound that resembles a telegraph. The loud clicks mark the beginning of a signal, while the softer click signal its end. If we listen closely, we can decipher the following message."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another fun Silent Hill 2 Remake discovery, a TV in Brookhaven Hospital in morse code repeatedly says, "Again and Again and Again and Again" endlessly: <a href="https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb">https://t.co/v1OcX7r8tb</a></p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1859864583252607265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The message itself is pretty short, consisting of just two words and played on a loop: "Again and."</p>
<p>Coupled with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team">hidden message discovered hiding behind the mysterious photos found in Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, the morse code message adds further validity to the popular fan theory that James Sunderland is trapped in the town of Silent Hill, reliving his search of Mary on a loop "again and again and again and".</p>

The “game-aware” overlay lives in the Microsoft Game Bar and is designed to automatically find and show you links to tips and guides for the game you’re playing, using the Edge browser.</p><p>Game Assist uses the profile you’re logged into in Edge, so it’ll give you access to your data, like cookies, autofill, and favorites, so “you don’t need to log into sites again.” Like other Game Bar widgets, you can pin it above your game as you play. Game Assist is currently available in English, and you’ll need to opt into the preview and set Microsoft Edge Beta 132 as your default browser to use it.</p><p>Here’s a video of the feature in action: </p><p>You’ll have to find content yourself for most games for now, but the game-aware part of Game Assist will surface information automatically for a few games, including <em>Baldur’s Gate 3, Diablo IV, </em>and <em>Hellblade II: Senua’s Saga</em>. Microsoft says it’ll be adding support for others “throughout the preview and over time.”</p><p>In a second video, Microsoft shows how the overlay looks when used to follow along with video guides:</p><p>Microsoft says it’s collecting feedback in a few ways: </p><div><blockquote><p>You can share your feedback in Game Assist by going to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Send feedback</strong>. You can also vote on which features you want to see added to Game Assist using the new&nbsp;<a href="https://feedbackportal.microsoft.com/feedback/forum/9612778f-73a0-ef11-8a69-000d3a4e63db">Game Assist Community feedback portal</a>, and we’ll be monitoring feedback on&nbsp;<a href="http://reddit.com/r/MicrosoftEdge">r/MicrosoftEdge</a>, X, and other social channels as well.</p></blockquote></div><p>Game Assist only supports mouse and keyboard input for the moment, but Microsoft writes it’s adding support for handhelds and gamepads in the future. Compact Mode support is also coming later, the company says.</p><p>Below are Microsoft’s instructions for getting started with Game Assist.</p><div><ul><li>Make sure Windows 11 and Game Bar are up to date.</li><li>Game Assist requires the Beta or Preview channel of Microsoft Edge. If you’re running Windows Insider builds on your PC or have opted into Edge Preview, you already have Edge Preview and can skip to Step 3. Otherwise:</li><li>Install the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/">Microsoft Edge Insider Beta channel</a>&nbsp;(you can also use the Dev channel for the latest updates, but things may be slightly less stable).</li><li>Set Edge Beta as your default browser: go to&nbsp;<strong>Windows Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Default apps</strong>, search for&nbsp;<strong>Edge</strong>&nbsp;and, at the top of the page, click&nbsp;<strong>Edge Beta</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Set as default</strong>.</li><li>To opt-into Game Assist (Preview) and install the Game Bar widget, in Edge, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, then search for&nbsp;<strong>Game Assist</strong>&nbsp;in the search box, find the Game Assist option (above the&nbsp;<strong>Page zoom</strong>&nbsp;setting), and select&nbsp;<strong>Install widget</strong>.</li><li>If you haven’t used Edge Beta/Preview before, in Edge, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings and more</strong>&nbsp;(“…”) &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Close Microsoft Edge</strong>, and then re-open the browser. You may have to repeat this step a few times for the Game Assist option to appear.</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Appreciate you bringing this to our attention," wrote brand lead for Riot Games and Arcane, Alex Shahmiri.</p>
<p>"We have a strict stance of no AI for anything relating to Arcane 'cause it's disrespectful to the incredible artists who worked on the show," he added. "This image was a mistake and has since been removed. [Thank you] again for calling it out."</p><div>

<p>ICYMI, indie game platform<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-game-platform-itchio-now-requires-developers-to-tag-ai-content"> Itch.io now requires developers to disclose whether generative AI has been used in their work</a>. The platform recently detailed its new tagging requirement, specifying it is a required field for asset creator pages "to ensure buyers are aware of the origins of the material they are obtaining".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen. This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is calling for an investigation into Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/22/apple-and-google-could-face-uk-competition-probe-over-app-store-rules.html">CNBC</a>, the CMA may use its powers under the new Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC) to examine possible anti-competitive behaviour from the two companies given their dominance of the UK's mobile markets.</p>
<p>However, it proposes that no further action be taken on cloud gaming given "primary concerns have been addressed".</p>
<p>Following a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-publishes-provisional-findings-in-mobile-browsers-and-cloud-gaming-market-investigation">preliminary investigation</a>, an independent inquiry group has recommended a review into the UK mobile ecosystem and assess if the two megacorps have Strategic Market Status (SMS) which potentially gives them a self-preferential position in the market.</p>

<p>The independent inquiry group alleged Apple's App Store rules "restrict other competitors from being able to deliver new, innovative features that could benefit consumers" and makes it difficult for smaller developers to operate without having to use the App Store.</p><p>The investigation also looked at mobile cloud gaming but said that as Apple made changes to allow cloud gaming apps to be sold via the App Store during the course of the investigation, "the group has provisionally concluded there is no need for intervention by the CMA in mobile cloud gaming".</p>
<p>The group also alleged Google and Apple have a revenue-sharing agreement to make Google the default search engine on iPhone which "significantly reduces their financial incentives to compete in mobile browsers on iOS".</p>
<p>"Markets work best when rival businesses are able to develop and bring innovative options to consumers," said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group. "Competition between different mobile browsers is not working well and this is holding back innovation in the UK."</p>
<p>Apple dispute the claims and said inteventions made under the DMCC "would undermine user privacy and hinder our ability to make the kind of technology that sets Apple apart".</p>
<p>"Apple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish," Apple said in a statement to CNBC. "We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users."</p>
<p>The CMA expects to make a final decision in March 2025. Google, Apple, and other interested parties have until 13th December to respond to the inquiry group's provisional report. The DMCC will come into effect in January 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cma-closes-its-investigation-into-apples-app-payments-on-grounds-of-administrative-priority">The CMA closed its investigation into Apple's in-app payment system</a> back in August "on the grounds of administrative priority".</p>
<p>At the time, the CMA said it no longer considered the investigation a priority but stressed that the case's closure "does not constitute a decision by the CMA".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apple-reportedly-working-on-new-game-focused-ios-app-integrating-store-social-features-achievements-and-more">Apple is reportedly set to continue its slow and steady expansion into gaming</a> with the launch of a new game-focused iOS app that'll gather the likes of a store, recommendations, achievements, and social features into one place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
