			<p>Exciting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct was last week, even as it ended on a high note with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay-shows-how-its-more-than-just-a-dk-version-of-super-mario-odyssey/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, fans remained cautiously enthusiastic. We all recognized that Nintendo had left out the price of everything from the direct.</p>
<p>There was no price for the Nintendo Switch 2 or the games, which made even more sense when we found out, shortly after the direct was over, how expensive the Switch 2 was and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like Mario Kart World would be jumping up to $80 USD</a>.</p>
<p>But before we even get into how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">tariffs</a> could further change the pricing of the hardware and the games, Nintendo feels that Mario Kart World and every other Nintendo Switch 2 game that will cost $80 are worth that price point.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">IGN</a>, Nintendo of America vice president of product and player experience Bill Trinen discussed how Nintendo arrived at its new pricing structure and was adamant that Mario Kart World, the Nintendo Switch 2, and everything else that Nintendo reveals that now costs more are justified in that price.</p>
<p>"<em>I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, [...] I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out."</em></p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had."</em></p>
<p>Trinen's answer about the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom being $80, or the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Party Jamboree also being $80, followed the same line of thinking.</p>
<p>"<em>Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?'"</em></p>
<p>"<em>[...] I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that."</em></p>
<p>As a senior executive at Nintendo, Trinen is expected to defend the price hikes. Ultimately, everyone buying or not buying a Nintendo Switch 2 and any of the exclusive games for it will make that judgment for themselves.</p>
<p>And who knows, Trinen could end up being right in many players' eyes. We'll have to see how the upcoming Mario Kart World Direct fares with fans and if what's revealed there really showcases why it is worth the $80 price tag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chief executive officer and head of Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-tim-sweeney-says-apple-and-google-run-gangster-style-businesses/">Tim Sweeney</a> has taken to X to shut down rumors about an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2-goes-live-bringing-back-tilted-towers/">Fortnite</a> movie.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/epic-games-boss-shuts-down-fortnite-movie-rumours-1525313/">GameReactor</a>, film insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK">DanielRPK</a> claimed that the idea of a Fortnite film had been floating around Hollywood but was unable to find a studio willing to take it on to start actually developing it. Which isn't all that surprising to hear if that was the case.</p>
<p>Fortnite is incredibly popular, but not for any narrative through-line. Epic has been able to keep going since its inception. Also, the inclusion of pretty much every character from the majority of the current popular intellectual properties across genres would make the film a logistical nightmare, should any proposed Fortnite film try to capture that aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the recent box office success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> had DanielRPK speculating that studios would change their tune. Minecraft has about the same amount of narrative to it that Fortnite does, and even though it's been critically panned, the power kids have over their parents' spending money remains undefeated.</p>
<p><span>Families continue to flock to the theater to see it, though a now-viral&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'chicken jockey'</a> moment suggests that those same parents ought to bring earplugs with them to the theater if they want to keep the use of their ears after they walk out. </span>Regardless, it doesn't seem like that's a rabbit hole worth jumping down, as Sweeney simply replied to DanielRPK's claims with the word <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632">"<em>false</em>."</a> DanielRPK later deleted his post.</p>
<p>Sweeney's dismissal of DanielRPK's claims does seem to end the conversation right there, but his one-word reply also leaves a bit of ambiguity as to what he's dismissing. Is he dismissing that a Fortnite movie was ever being shopped around? Is he dismissing that the movie was being reconsidered after the success of the Minecraft film? Is he dismissing all of DanielRPK's claims because a Fortnite movie is already in development and is entirely separate from DanielRPK's speculation?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps the simplest answer, he's just dismissing all of the above, and there is no Fortnite movie. Which, again, is not an unreasonable thing to suspect, because of how difficult it would be to navigate making that movie. Even in today's renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations (with a new box office record <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just broken</a> by A Minecraft Movie), there remain plenty of games that would simply not translate to the silver or small screen in a way that anyone would want. Including some of gaming's biggest franchises, like Fortnite.</p>

The company acknowledged this price could change due to tariffs — even before the recent, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">stock market-crashing import taxes</a> were announced. That means it may not actually cost $549.99 when it comes out, so consider this monitor, with its higher resolution, higher refresh rate, and more features, a very good value for just $200 more.</p><div><p id="more-deals-and-discounts"><h2>More deals and discounts</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Lego Icons Atreides Royal Ornithopter set</strong> from the Dune films is down to its lowest price ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGXZS3J6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. A 20 percent discount may not seem like much (a final price of $131.95), but it’s the cheapest we’ve ever seen for this 1,369-piece kit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There were many surprises at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct from last week, but one of the strangest was the reveal of Welcome Tour, a paid tutorial that lets players explore the console itself. Nintendo insists that the price is worth the experience, but the early impressions have not been eye-opening.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-cost-9-99-at-launch">Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour Will Cost $9.99 at Launch</h2>



<p>Earlier today, Nintendo officially confirmed that Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour would cost $9.99 at launch, and that it will be sold exclusively as a digital title.</p>



<p>While confirming the price, several Nintendo higher ups spoke about the game itself, making a case to consumers that it’s worth the price. Nintendo of America’s VP of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told IGN</a> it was a robust piece of software that will appeal to people really interested in the specs, adding that the “amount of care and work that the team put into it” made it worth the price. Nintendo of America Senior VP of Development and Planning Nate Bihldorff shared similar sentiments <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-paying-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Comicbook.com</a>, adding that it features “lots of really fun mini games.”</p>



<p>But the initial impressions of the game have not been very positive. Gaming YouTuber Jake Randall <a href="https://x.com/Jake_Randall_YT/status/1909255510844391707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that someone at the Switch 2 event in New York City “almost fell asleep” playing it, and compared it to an “instruction manual” with mini-games. Many fans online point toward Nintendo’s inclusion of Wii Sports with the Nintendo Wii for free in comparison, as well as the free Astro’s Playroom on PS5. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc9a52fM2UA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full gameplay video</a> of Welcome Tour on the Nintendo of America account has 13,000 dislikes compared to only about 1,700 likes.</p>



<p>The negative feelings towards the cost of Welcome Tour are perhaps exacerbated by the higher price of both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-why-switch-2-so-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch 2 itself</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its games</a>. And for U.S. fans in particular, the worry that the price could somehow get even higher due to tariffs has already got consumers concerned about how much they’re spending.</p>



<p>Is Nintendo making a mistake by charging for Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour?</p>



<p>Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

It’s a groundbreaking glimpse at a brand new way of interacting with games, turning cutting-edge research into a quick and compelling playable demo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that <em>sounds</em> pretty impressive, but the demo itself is... well, less so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After The Game Awards boss Geoff Keighley shared a brief video of the demo in action <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on X / Twitter,</u></a> hundreds of people responded, with few having anything positive to say.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"Man, I don't want the future of games to be AI-generated slop," said one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1jteaze/microsoft_unveils_aigenerated_demo_inspired_by/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Redditor</u></a>.

"It's a demo for a reason. It shows the future possibilities. Having an AI that is able to create a coherent and consistent world is crazy. But this cannot be used to create a full game or anything enjoyable. You cannot play this. Seems like a tool for early concept/pitching phase. This can also bring improvement in other fields in AI as what it is doing is impressive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is not even a product yet but a demo showing how much they've improved from just a few months ago."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney had a rather different response:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/XidCvhLDTI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XidCvhLDTI</a></p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908594898003243501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen"><u>Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</u></a> as part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form">Horizon actor Ashly Burch addressed a controversial AI Aloy video that leaked online</a>, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter, critic, columnist, and consultant.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-music-wont-be-returning-for-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sorry fans of the Nintendo shop music circa the Wii era, but we won't be getting a catchy jingle to shop along to on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release this summer. And it doesn't seem likely the music will be coming back in the future either.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto, there is a very sound (no pun intended) reason for not having music on the storefront. In short, nowadays many of the titles listed on the eShop have videos accompanying them, which showcase gameplay to potential customers, and Nintendo "didn’t want to intrude on that".</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On Preview: Is It Good?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jri6l4Tz8xI?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>So quite simply, "we don't have music there" Kawamoto told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why">Polygon</a>, although the Switch 2 producer did add that he still gets the Wii Shopping Channel music stuck in his head. He said he "probably booted the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any application [on the Wii]".</p>
<p>But, while we may not be having a little boogie in our seats as we browse the Nintendo Switch 2's own eShop, it should at least me be more pleasant even if not musical experience compared to what we have now.</p>
<p>"I wanted to make sure that it was a smooth experience," Kawamoto said of Switch 2's eShop. "That the scrolling of the list doesn't stall, that it's very smooth, pages load fast."</p>
<p>I guess the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and we will know for sure on Switch 2's release. As to when that is, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 is launching Thursday 5th June</a>, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>For more on the console, our Tom has already been hands-on with the Switch 2.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-has-great-difficulty-options.1157334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/south-of-midnight-difficulty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like a lot of folks, Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight </em>had me intrigued since its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Z-8Y8r5ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a>, with its folklore-tinged world and painterly look. I’ve been playing it this weekend (the game became available last week for people who purchased its “Premium” edition, and comes out officially on April 8) and so far its world lives up to what I’d hoped from its trailers, alongside some unique difficulty options that let me enjoy that world even more.</p><p>I’ve been sort of rooting for <em><a href="https://compulsiongames.com/games/south-of-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em> developer Compulsion Games: I was fond of 2013’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbXPYygyC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Contrast</em></a>, and I had such high hopes for 2018’s <em>We Happy Few. </em>That <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-happy-few-has-an-ambitious-mix-that-i-m-having-troub-1828253945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychedelic survival game</a> changed a lot during early access, sanding many of its survival edges off until I ultimately found it disappointing. It felt like such a good idea, set in such a unique world, but I found it hard to enjoy much of what I actually <em>did</em> in that world. I worried that <em>South of Midnight</em> might stumble into that same problem, looking lovely but not holding up when I actually played it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’m only a few chapters into the game so far, which follows a woman named Hazel who’s on a rescue mission in a version of the deep South that seamlessly weaves fantasy and reality. The experience of moving through the game’s world feels magical: I’m wandering through grimly derelict shacks, only to suddenly realize that the swamp that stretches around them is full of impossible giant peaches. Every corner feels stuffed with details, from interiors cluttered with human possessions to outdoor areas where foxes and herons and muskrats dart across my path. One moment I’m talking to Hazel’s neighbors; the next I’m talking to a giant multicolor catfish. The game’s excellent soundtrack undergoes a similar transformation, with instrumental tracks subtly morphing into lyrics about story events. Cutscenes are done with a stop-motion style that’s trippy and beautiful. The way the game shifts from the mundane to the magical makes me feel like I can never predict what’s around the next corner, but it’s also never disorienting.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside this, a lot of the gameplay works. There are collectibles to find, charmingly-titled “floofs” that you use to level up Hazel’s combat abilities, but they’re never that onerous to look for. Hazel has a magical ability called “weaving” that lets her interact with the world of folklore to affect the real world and help people heal the pain of their past, and those abilities also feature in how you traverse the game. Gossamer threads let you swing and glide; you can manifest objects and pull and push them to reach new areas. There’s some platforming that can be slightly floaty, and some puzzle-solving that’s never challenging, but there’s also just regular walking and climbing, and you switch between all these kinds of movements pretty easily.</p><p>There’s combat too, which so far has been confined to telegraphed arenas against creepy enemies that… well, just feel like enemies. I'm finding it less interesting than everything else <em>South of Midnight</em> has going: You have some attacks and some magical powers you can use, and while I sometimes found myself a little turned around when too many enemies were on screen, especially if I had target lock on, the fights feel more like they exist to break up your wandering than events in their own right. I don’t <em>hate</em> it, but I’m not finding it nearly as cool as moving through a field of wildflowers or exploring an old church. I appreciate the way combat changes the pace, but it’s definitely not the best part of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the standard sorts of difficulties you can select, which include both a “story” and “easy” option on the lower end, you can also select the option to be able to skip boss fights, regular fights, and chase sequences. This doesn’t do away with them; you still enter into combat like normal, but at any time during the fight you can press a button and just be done with it.&nbsp;</p><p>I love this option. Booting up the game early on Sunday, pumped full of my morning coffee, I was happy to bash through some enemies; later in the evening, with the upcoming week looming in my mind, it was great to be able to lose myself in <em>South of Midnight</em>’s arresting world instead. Sometimes choosing a “story” mode in a game over a combat-focused one makes a game feel a little unengaging, or like I don’t always have enough to do; here, I feel like I can pick my experience in the moment. Since turning the option on out of curiosity, I’ve played through almost all the combat encounters, but in a couple instances when I’d enter a fight and think “ugh, not now” because I didn’t want to stop exploring, I’d press the button and boom– the enemies slumped to the ground, and I could get back to the story.</p><p>I haven’t hit a boss fight yet to try out the option there, though I get the sense I’m close to one. At the risk of having yet <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular</a> take, I <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-should-stop-quitting-games-at-boss-fights-1837813273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t tend to enjoy boss fights</a> personally; I find it interesting to solve the puzzle of how to beat a boss, but once I know what to do, I sometimes lose the energy for actually doing it. (No shade if you like them!) But I'm finding myself looking forward to my first one in <em>South of Midnight</em>, eager to see the design of the boss I've been pursuing up close but also bolstered by the fact that if I fall into the frustration or tedium boss fights sometimes bring out in me, I can just move on instead of feeling stuck. </p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> also has a custom difficulty option that allows you to tinker with enemy damage, aggression, your own invincibility, and other factors. All of this flexibility makes the game more accessible, and I appreciate how much you can change things up as you play. So far, I'm enjoying <em>South of Midnight</em> a lot, and I'm into the ways it gives me options that let me focus on whatever I'm most enjoying in the moment. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders"><h3>Nintendo’s Long Line Of Hits Followed By Misses Might Continue With Switch 2</h3></a><p>"The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit"</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-quimera-release-date-ex-metro-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reburn, the studio staffed by several ex-<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>developers, has announced the release date for its story-focused first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera" rel="nofollow">alongside Reburn's rebrand</a> back in February, will be launching for PC via Steam on April 25th. There's no word yet on whether the shooter will be coming to consoles or not.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get a chance to test out&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>early, you can apply for a place on the game's upcoming closed beta, which will take place on April 12th and will run for 24 hours (starting from 7am Pacific/10am Eastern). Slots are "limited", according to Reburn, so you should be quick if you want a place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/la-quimera-release-date-firefight.jpg?itok=NRNxFUJK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/la-quimera-release-date-firefight.jpg?itok=UdjISgMR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>launches later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Just in case you're unaware, Reburn is the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, which was one of the overarching 4A Games' offices in Kyiv. 4A Games Ukraine, as it was then known, helped out with the development of 2019's&nbsp;<em>Metro Exodus</em>.</p>

<p>4A Games remains intact under its original moniker, and in a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studio update</a> posted around the time that Reburn decided to rebrand, 4A confirmed once again that it is, in fact, still working on a new&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>game alongside publisher Deep Silver.</p>

<p>All of this follows Embracer Group's sale of Saber Interactive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>, and although it was widely expected that Saber would purchase 4A, that didn't end up happening, meaning 4A remained with parent company Embracer.</p>

<p>If you're confused by this, rest assured that you're not the only one. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the game currently in development by the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, and it's coming to PC in April.</p>




<p><i>La Quimera&nbsp;</i>lands on PC via Steam on April 25th, and you can head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the game's Steam page</a> to get a chance to join the closed beta right now.</p>

            <p>In these days of combing online imagery for symptoms of genAI “hallucination”, it’s easy to forget that once upon a time, mutant video game visuals were beautiful. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">a whole genre of art</a> dedicated to them. Here to remind us is Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal, a gorgeously scruffy 2D platformer in which an old lady explores a big magic cellar, hitting graphics card malfunctions with a broom. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, but both you and the simulation aren’t as young as you used to be.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal is the work of Jakeonaut, who is <a href="https://jakeonaut.itch.io/">partial</a> to busted pixels. It launched on Saturday and still has a demo on Steam, which I encourage you to try. The world is made up of fizzy, marbled terrain tiles, wavering clots of white noise, and anomalous 3D fixtures. It's like the game's carcass is being feasted on by a bunch of different aesthetics. More literally, the geography also teems with critters such as frogs, crickets and chickens who can be meddled with to various end. I walloped a cricket and it chewed a hole through some scenery for me, which almost never happens in real life.</p>

<p>The protagonist is no less delightful for her determinedly low-tech method of making headway. Ah, if only I could fix my old iBook’s addled GPU by smacking it with a dustpan and brush. Mind you, it's not all flailing broomsticks. You can also learn "hag magic" spells from totems, switching between them with spacebar. </p>
<p>These include higher jumps, the ability to climb up walls, and walking on air. It’s a familiar collection of platformer abilities, perhaps, but there’s the promise of others that let you “glitch” the levels more adventurously. You can only remember two spells at once because, as a tutorial NPC politely explains, you’re old. You also forget spells when you walk through certain errors, which feels like a device the developer will use to bookend the game’s puzzles. There's a gloomier undertow: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876850/Babushkas_Glitch_Dungeon_Crystal/">the Steam page</a> mentions themes of "aging, senescence, and fear of mortality."</p>

<p>Microsoft is going to enter the handheld gaming market. It’s just a matter of when, not if, and it’s something that Xbox head Phil Spencer is excited about.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvYRQxIaJ-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iJustine</a>, Spencer was asked about the Xbox’s plans for handheld gaming. While Spencer didn’t fully commit to anything specific, he did drop another tease about what’s to come.</p>



<p>“[We’ve] teased and talked about handhelds and I’m very excited because we both travel, and sometimes you can’t always take your console or your whole gaming desktop with you,” Spencer said when asked specifically if there was anything “exciting” coming from Xbox in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Spencer didn’t confirm it, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-seemingly-teases-project-kennan-xbox-handheld-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to release</a> an Xbox-branded handheld PC in partnership with ASUS. The handheld, while not a full Xbox mobile system, is expected to have a heavy Xbox presence , including an Xbox guide button and “more prominent grips”. The system, however, will be a mobile PC that doesn’t run Xbox games natively. </p>



<p>Regarding an official Xbox handheld, that’s not rumored to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>Are you excited about Microsoft and Xbox getting into the handheld gaming space? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

Speaking to GameSpot, Trinen said Nintendo looks at each game on a case-by-case basis when it comes to pricing, which is why Mario Kart World is $80 and some other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games might cost less.</p><p>"We'll look at varying prices and things like that for software based off of just how robust the experience is," Trinen said, reminding us that there is an upcoming Mario Kart World Nintendo Direct on April 17 that promises to show off more of the game and its features.</p><p>Trinen went on to say, "People will get to learn more about that game.

rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> about the same subject, Trinen said said Nintendo priced Mario Kart World at $80 as part of a calculation of the game's overall value.</p><p>"It's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?" he said.</p><p>"This is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had," he added.</p><p>Of course, Trinen would do whatever he can to hype Mario Kart World--that is his job. Time will tell if people embrace Mario Kart World at $80.</p><p>Mario Kart World is not the Switch 2's only $80 game, as the Switch 2 editions of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom also carry that higher price point. Some games are less, as Donkey Kong Bananza is priced at $70. </p><p>According to one retailer, video game prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">need to go up</a> to maintain the overall stability of the market.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, arriving alongside the system on June 5.

Though burgers are commonly made of beef, it's not the only possibility. A burger is just one of many items that players can obtain at Mario Kart World's Yoshi's diner locations. Some of the others are steak kebabs, pizza, and donuts.</p><p>Another oddity is that while we saw Mario eat the burger and transform, when the cow eats the burger, nothing seems to happen, except for the cow getting pretty excited about it. One then wonders if the cow <em>likes</em> the taste of beef. Or perhaps it was never a beef burger at all.

		<p>One of the many small facts that has been picked up on since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct last week is that a physical <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> of an upgraded game for the new console won’t necessarily have a Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge inside the box.</p>
<p>While this decision will be down to the publisher, Nintendo’s chosen the route that a physical copy of Breath of the Wild: Switch 2 Edition or the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> with have a Nintendo Switch 1 cartridge and a download code for the Switch 2 Edition upgrade.</p>


<p>This has been confirmed by dummy packshot imagery distributed by Nintendo:</p>

		
		


<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1js9s09/nintendo_support_says_that_switch_2_enhanced/">This decision has been widely decried by gamers</a> that still champion physical media and the second hand market. Many have noted the similarity to online passes that were common in the early 2010s, which were partly designed to as a way to extract a toll from second hand game sales. This will have a similar effect, so that a second hand copy of a Switch 2 Edition game will need the buyer to separately purchase the Switch 2 Edition upgrade… at which point, you might as well see if a standard Switch version of a game is available for a lower price.</p>

<p>By contrast, it’s been confirmed that Rune Factory’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will be a Switch 2 specific card:</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>
<p>The one upside of Nintendo’s approach is that a physical Switch 2 Edition will be usable with both generations of console, but it is a shame that Nintendo hasn’t produced a cross-gen cartridge as well – in fairness, games might have textures and game data re-encoded for Switch 2, and so balloon the size of a combined game install.</p>
<p>However, this is in contrast to the cross-gen strategies of Xbox and PlayStation. Sony’s PS5-upgraded remasters have then had PS5-specific discs printed for the purpose, while Microsoft pushed hard with cross-gen Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One discs in many instances (though typically also requiring large game updates and downloads to actually install a game).</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it’s been confirmed that Switch 2 game cards won’t necessarily have a copy of the game on the card itself. These <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-Game-Key-Cards-2785635.html">Game-Key Cards will be labelled on the box</a>, and act as a physical license key to let you download a game to the internal storage. This honestly isn’t an uncommon sight to see with modern games on other platforms, where there’s been games like Halo Infinite where the disc is effectively just a license key. This is potentially preferable to the ‘Code in Box’ physical releases for Nintendo Switch, which include an eShop key to download, as there will still be trade-in value for the game.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this is a reminder of the impermanence of digital games, and there’s always the potential risk in years and decades to come that access is removed one way or another.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support NVIDIA DLSS, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>, but the AI-powered upscaler won't be the only option available, nor will it be mandatory to use upscaling in any way.</p>
<p>Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-developers-discuss-the-consoles-tech-and-iwatas-lasting-legacy-on-its-development"> IGN</a>, Nintendo’s Entertainment Planning and Development Department's Kouchi Kawamoto and Takuhiro Dohta and Technology Development Division's Tetsuya Sasaki talked about upscaling options for the new system, revealing that, while NVIDIA DLSS will be the "easiest" upscaling option to use in games, the company is planning on providing other software-based upscaling solutions. In addition, the Nintendo representatives highlighted how not using any upscaling solution is also an option. Considering how using DLSS has a cost, we are likely going to use a wide variety of upscaling solutions to hit whichever frame rate targets developers aim for in their games.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will also support ray tracing, but much like NVIDIA DLSS and other upscaling solutions, developers won't be required to implement it in their games, as Nintendo considers ray tracing just another tool that can either be used or not depending on the situation. Considering how demanding ray tracing can get and how the console won't be the most powerful gaming system around, this isn't particularly surprising.</p>
<p>Besides supporting NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing, one feature that sets the Nintendo Switch 2 apart from its predecessor is the mouse functionality of the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Speaking with<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen"> IGN</a>, Nintendo of America's Vice President of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen commented on the new functionality, saying how, having been added on top of the other unique features of the Joy-Con 2 controllers, it is different from that of a regular PC mouse, opening up some interesting possibilities like using dual mouse controls that he hopes third-party developers will take advantage of to evolve their gameplay. He also hopes that having this control option will make PC developers a lot more eager to want to bring their games to the console, as they wouldn't have to revamp control schemes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches worldwide on June 5th. You can learn more about the system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">hands-on preview.</a></p>

            <p>Microsoft have developed a playable version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> that runs on generative AI. The "game" cannot currently run for longer than two minutes, has a very low frame rate, unresponsive controls, and is full of blurry textures. But Microsoft's artificial intelligensia are proud enough of the prototype that they have made it playable online. Would you like to experience a novel type of anguish? Come with me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The demo is playable on <a href="https://copilot.microsoft.com/wham">Microsoft's Copilot site</a>, where they note that "Copilot may make mistakes". It operates with keyboard controls only and will prompt you with a pop-up message after two minutes to say that the timed demo is over. You can reload the page to play it again.</p>
<p>"In this real-time tech demo, Copilot dynamically generates gameplay sequences inspired by the classic game Quake II," reads a blurb on <a href="https://copilotlabs.microsoft.com/experiment/copilot-gaming-experiences/">a neighbouring Microsoft website</a>. "Every input you make triggers the next AI-generated moment in the game, almost as if you were playing the original Quake II running on a traditional game engine." </p>

</figure>
<p>What that actually looks and feels like is a lot of staccato strafing through a surreal slosh of not-quite-right 90s shooter levels. Enemies sometimes appear and you must shoot them an unspecified number of times before they die, although will sometimes seem to reanimate. Approaching a wall and then stepping back will result in a trippy reconfiguration of your surroundings. It is like playing a bad dream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>. It is like being trapped in the sad nightmares of John Carmack after an intense binge of VR. </p>
<p>If you'd rather just watch it being played, marketing mogul Geoff Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1908593030141202635">tweeted a demonstration</a> of the technology, as our sister site Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-unveils-quake-2-inspired-ai-created-demo-but-its-practically-unplayable">point out</a>. Unsurprisingly, he didn't get a positive response from his followers, many of whom work in an industry where jobs and livelihoods are threatened by this technology.  </p>
<p>The demo is powered by Microsoft's Muse tech, which is the result of the corporate giant's research departments fiddling with AI so that it might help with "game ideation". Modelling an AI on Quake and its sequel makes sense from one perspective, since it is a quintessential shooter with concrete rules for enemy encounters and level design. The fundamental rules of the modern first-person shooter were founded by these games. </p>
<p>Yet as a fan of the long-lived Quake mapping scene, I play this demo and feel something that oscillates between curiosity and disgust, and it's probably 90 percent the latter. I like it better when the "ideation" is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-quake-singleplayer-map-pack-remixes-multiplayer-levels-from-counter-strike-mario-kart-and-more">done by people</a> capable of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-goes-brutalist-again-in-another-free-map-pack-celebrating-concrete">very cool work</a>, who have come together in recent years to create a legit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quake-renaissance-where-is-quake-and-how-did-it-get-here">Quake renaissance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The 2017 edition has still never gotten a price drop and remains $300. The Switch OLED is even more at $350. If Nintendo continues selling them, it’s not shocking that the Switch 2, a generational leap, would be $100 more. “You want to consider pricing relative to the Switch since we still have that in distribution,” Bowser said. </p><p><em>Mario Kart World</em>’s $80 price tag <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-kart-world-physical-game-tariffs-prices-1851774317?_gl=1*1wwkjyf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDAzMzc2NS43OS4xLjE3NDQwMzY1OTQuMTAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-kart-world-physical-game-tariffs-prices-1851774317?_gl=1*1wwkjyf*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDAzMzc2NS43OS4xLjE3NDQwMzY1OTQuMTAuMC4w">is arguably what’s been upsetting fans even more</a></span>, and leading them to spam Nintendo Tree House Live demos of the game on YouTube with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530">wall-to-wall “drop the price” comments</a></span>.

But why make <em>Mario Kart World</em> the canary in the $80 mine right at launch? “We just look at what is the experience, and what’s the content, and what’s the value?” Nintendo of America’s VP of product and player experience Bill Trinen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span>.</p><p>He also suggested that there are tons of new details about the game that haven’t been revealed yet that will win fans over. “<em>Mario Kart World</em>, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, but I did read your article this morning and I think you had mentioned that you didn’t find a lot to discover when roaming around. So I would say tune into our <em>Mario Kart </em>Direct to see what, maybe you’ll be able to find out about that,” he said, referring to a deeper dive into the game slated for April 17.</p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast and you will find so many little things in it to discover. And there’s still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they’re going to find this to be probably the richest <em>Mario Kart </em>experience they’ve ever had.</p></blockquote><p>Trinen also confirmed <em>Welcome Tour</em>, the Switch 2's <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>-style mini-game explainer for the new hardware, is a $10 digital-only download. Why not a pack-in for the console, like <em>Wii Sports</em>? “Just the amount of care and work that the team put into it, I think it was decided that, ‘Yeah, this feels like $9.99 is not an exorbitant price. It feels like a good value for what you’re getting out of the product,’ he said. <br></p><p>The veteran Nintendo employee also weighed in on why games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> will be $80 on Switch 2 for their upgraded content, despite having been released several years ago at this point. “Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, ‘what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?’ What I would probably counter to some of that is that really what you’re looking at is for the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, that’s the physical price for somebody that has not bought the base game,” Trinen said.</p><p>Poor <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. At just $70, Nintendo must not think it’s as good or just not the same “value” as some of its other games. One big question remains, then. Is $70 the new $60 on Switch 2, or the new $50? I hope Welcome Tour has a<em> The Price is Right </em>mini-game. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sabrina Carpenter is surfacing in Fortnite tomorrow, and her skins have been revealed on social media. She’s appearing as the Fortnite Festival ‘icon’ for Season 8, and fans are fawning over her sparkly outfits. On April 4, Epic Games started teasing the arrival of Carpenter in the popular battle royale game, and tomorrow, they’re delivering on the promise.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-style-over-substance">Style over Substance</h2>



<p>Die-hard Fortnite fans have questioned why Sabrina Carpenter has found her way into the Fortnite ecosystem, but we’re far beyond questioning that. Fortnite has long had a strong relationship with musicians and has hosted many live events and performances in the game – Sabrina Carpenter is the latest addition to that industry-wide collaboration.</p>



<p>On social media, images of the Sabrina Carpenter skin set and a touch of bling were revealed:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Season 8 update goes like at 6 AM ET (3 AM PT) tomorrow, April 8. It’s then that you can unlock the Sabrina Carpenter skins in Fortnite. The whole pack was revealed recently in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fortnite blog post</a>.</p>



<p>Along with the skins, Sabrina enters the world of Fortnite with two instantly recognisable Jam Tracks – Nonsense and Juno. When you purchase the Sweet Little Bundle from the Fortnite Store, you’ll also unlock Please Please Please as another Jam Track.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-sabrina-carpenter-in-fortnite">How to Unlock Sabrina Carpenter in Fortnite</h2>



<p>To get the Sabrina Carpenter outfit in Fortnite, you need to purchase the Season 8 Music Pass. This will automatically unlock a base skin for Carpenter, as well as a LEGO style. The first outfit you get for Sabrina will be her Victoria’s Secret babydoll dress.</p>



<p>As you progress through the Music Pass, you’ll get the SC Electric Guitar and a second outfit – the embellished bodysuit.</p>



<p>There’s a third and final outfit for Sabrina, though – and you’ll need to buy this one.</p>



<p>It’s called the <strong>Tour-Ready Sabrina Carpenter </strong>outfit, and it will be available in the Fortnite Store throughout Season 8, along with:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>SC Heart Purse Back Bling</strong></li>



<li><strong>Taste Emote</strong></li>



<li><strong>Please Please Please Emote</strong></li>

<p>Coming from Reburn – the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, which is best known for its work on the Metro franchise, but has rebranded for this new original IP – La Quimera is a narrative-led FPS set in a futuristic Latin American megalopolis of Nuevo Caracas&nbsp;and a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren. The game casts&nbsp;you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>Playable solo or with three-player co-op, you’ll be able to coordinate combat tactics and complimentary skills, while your exosuit gives you &nbsp;things like a multitarget electric shock, scanning for hidden enemies, dodging and more.</p>

<p>Reburn as a studio naturally carries forward a lot of talent from the Metro series. The project lead is Oleksandr Kostiuk, who was Metro 2033, Last Light, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Exodus</a> gameplay and AI designer, but throughout the team, there’s experience that even goes back to before 4A’s founding by ex-STALKER developers. The company is newly rebranded in an effort to distinguish itself from 4A Games Cyprus – it’s this half of the brand and this studio that is owned by Plaion, and which is presumably continuing on with the Metro franchise.</p>
<p>CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar said, “As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry. Through it all, we stayed focused on what we love: Creating immersive, story-driven experiences. Our work wouldn’t be possible without the bravery and sacrifice of those defending Ukraine, and we’re profoundly grateful for their strength and resilience. We’re also truly thankful to everyone who supported and believed in us along the way.”</p>
