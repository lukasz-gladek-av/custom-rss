            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-player-count-not-announced/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Deadlock, the rumoured hero shooter from Valve that’s set to rival Overwatch 2, hasn’t been officially announced, but that hasn’t stopped almost 20,000 players from enjoying the game. Per the latest data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, 18,254 concurrent players were recorded on Deadlock as recently as yesterday, and over time, the number of people finding their way into the game is growing.</p>



<p>Since May 2024, the Deadlock player count has been rising, hitting more than 1,000 players as of May 30. At the start of August, that number started climbing rapidly, hitting 10,000 concurrent players on August 9 and falling just short of 20,000 yesterday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-it-s-not-real">But It’s Not Real</h2>



<p>Several weeks ago, Deadlock suffered from a series of high-profile leaks that revealed gameplay segments, the lineup of heroes, and details regarding the core gameplay loop. Despite that, and more than 18,000 concurrent players being logged in and actively playing the game, Valve has yet to formally announce the title. </p>



<p>It has been claimed that Deadlock is in the midst of an intense testing period that has adopted a unique operating model. </p>



<p>Through Steam, Valve is inviting <strong>some </strong>users to play the game and those users are then free to invite others, but the whole thing is under NDA and embargo, which is why we’ve not seen anything of the game since it was leaked back in May.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped players from discussing their experiences on social media, though.</p>



<p>How long will it be before Valve acknowledges Deadlock’s existence?</p>

<p>It has just been discovered that there’s a reference to Red Dead Redemption on PC on the PlayStation Network, of all places. Despite having been released 15 years ago, Red Dead Redemption has never officially been released on PC, regardless of how many players have begged Rockstar Games to make it happen.</p>



<p>Now, a reference to that very thing has appeared on the PlayStation Store, with a tagline stating that RDR is ‘now on PC for the first time ever’.</p>



<p>Is this an editing error or a potential leak?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>This tidbit was discovered by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823224534159196470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> who posted an image of the store page to social media. In the shot, a breakdown of the story for Red Dead Redemption sits front and centre, but it’s the opening line of that listing that’s most important:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation — now on PC for the first time ever.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It then walks through <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blurb explaining</a> that this version of the game is a PC port of the ‘upgraded’ version of the game that was released in 2023, along with some ‘PC-specific enhancements’. This is where we start to doubt that it’s just a typo or an editing error, as the page mentions a lengthy assortment of upgrades that’ll go hand-in-hand with a PC release of Red Dead Redemption, including boosted framerates and multi-display support.</p>



<p>It also stresses that the game won’t feature any multiplayer content, but it will include all bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition.</p>



<p>Strangely, the release date is listed as 08/17/23, and the platform is named as PS4, despite there being references to PS5 on the page.</p>



<p>Let’s wait and see where this goes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Revealed by Farm 51, Coming 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-coming-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chernobylite-2-exclusion-zone-revealed-by-farm-51-coming-2025.951588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-coming-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2021, The Farm 51 released Chernobylite, a borderline post-apocalyptic survival game set in a gorgeous and harrowing representation of Chornobyl and the surrounding area of Pripyat. It was a reality-skewing game that took players on a dark and twisted journey through a rapidly deteriorating environment, forcing them to combat monstrous entities, human enemies, and their own psyche.</p>



<p>Now, the team at The Farm 51 has revealed the follow-up title – Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone. It’s set to be released on PC and console in 2025, and I for one am <strong>very </strong>excited.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-apocalypse-never-looked-so-good">The Apocalypse Never Looked So Good</h2>



<p>Chernobylite (2021) is a stunning game with sumptuous visuals, plenty of freedom, base-building elements, and resource management. It has more than a few jump scares littered throughout, and the story is winding and unpredictable. In my opinion, it’s one of the most underrated survival games to emerge in recent years, and I’m happy to see that The Farm 51 is expanding on the universe with a full-fledged sequel.</p>



<p>In Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, players will be exploring a vast open-world environment, following an epic path built on the foundations of a non-linear story, allowing them to take on the game at their own pace. They’ll assume control of a ‘Planewalker’, an individual who can transcend our reality and phase into other realms, which builds on a similar concept explored in the first game.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone will feature online cooperative elements for the campaign, which is a huge win for anyone wanting to explore this massive and haunting game alongside a friend.</p>



<p>From what we know about the story, it seems that the first game’s efforts to contain an apocalyptic spread of a resource called Chernobylite failed, and now the player must seek out survivors in the Exclusion Zone and fight to carve out a space in a twisted reality between worlds.</p>



<p>In a twist, it looks as though Chernobylite: Exclusion Zone will pivot to a mixed first- and third-person model, which is a potentially divisive split from the first-person exclusive style of the first game. </p>



<p>Presently, the game is slated to be released in 2025 – I’ll be sure to keep a spot in my calendar for this one.</p>

			<p>There have been countless rumors of Red Dead Redemption <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> on PC, but we might finally be on the verge of an official announcement. Chief leak spotter Wario64 <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> a PlayStation Store page that includes the following description:</p>
<p><em>Experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation — now on PC for the first time ever.</em></p>
<p><em>When federal agents threaten his family, former outlaw John Marston is forced to hunt down the gang of criminals he once called friends. Experience Marston’s journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico as he fights to bury his blood-stained past in the critically acclaimed predecessor to the 2018 blockbuster, Red Dead Redemption 2. Also included is Undead Nightmare, the iconic horror story that transforms the world of Red Dead Redemption into an apocalyptic fight for survival against a zombie horde.</em></p>
<p><em>Featuring the complete single-player experiences of both games, including bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition, Red Dead Redemption features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound.</em></p>
<p>Weirdly enough, the product page lists PlayStation 4 as the platform and August 17, 2023 as the launch date, which is when the game was actually released on PS4. Still, the description leaves no room for interpretation: Red Dead Redemption is coming to PC, probably very soon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it does seem like a simple port rather than a major remaster. Not only did Rockstar not use RDR2's engine, but the only enhancements listed are high resolution and frame rate and multiple displays. It's certainly a bit underwhelming, as such a glorious game would have warranted a substantial touch-up before presenting it to a large new audience, such as the PC gaming community. Still, beggars can't be choosers, and modders may yet enhance it in a number of ways.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Most Successful Esports Players]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-players/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-successful-esports-players.951582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Being a professional esports player is a career path many choose to explore, but few end up finding immense success in. It is similar to professional sports, as being the best in a video game is just not that easy. It takes dedication and sacrifice to make it to the top. So, who are the most successful esports players out there?</p>
<h2>The Top Esports Players</h2>
<p>Being one of the best in esports depends on titles won and earnings, as many players compete in large-scale tournaments, but always seem to walk home empty-handed. However, some gamers have certified themselves as champions within their game’s competitive history, making them one of the best esports players of all time.</p>
<p>But, who are some of the winningest esports players?</p>
<h3>1. N0Tail</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $7.18 million</strong></p>
<p>It is no secret that Johan “N0Tail” Sundstein is one of the greatest esports players of all time. The popular Dota 2 competitor still reigns as number one for the most earnings within all of esports. The gamer even has had back-to-back championship titles at The International.</p>
<p>While the competitor has recently been pursuing the business side of esports, he still claims that he is not retired from competing, and could be back any day.</p>
<h3>2. JerAx</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $6.48 million</strong></p>
<p>Jesse “JerAx” Vainikka is a Finnish Dota 2 competitor, with the second most amount of earnings in esports history. The gamer has also won two titles in The International, with various other first places in different Major events throughout the years. JerAx also played alongside N0Tail, where they became two-time champions at The International in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>JerAx currently does not reside in the Dota 2 scene at the moment, after he left Team Liquid as a coach back in 2022, claiming he does not feel the same about the popular game anymore.</p>
<h3>3. Ana</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $6.02 million</strong></p>
<p>Another Dota 2 player and teammate to JerAx and N0Tail, Anathan “ana” Pham has certified himself as one of the greatest esports players of all time, with his many Dota 2 championship titles and high amount of prize earnings. The competitive player moved from Melbourne to Shanghai back in 2015 to pursue a career in competitive Dota 2.</p>
<p>While ana is technically retired, he has been seen countless times competing in the last few years, meaning he hasn’t let go of the game just yet.</p>
<h6>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-tournaments/">Top Esports Tournaments | What Are The Best Esports Tournaments?</a></h6>
<h3>4. Ceb</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $5.95 million</strong></p>
<p>Yep. You guessed it. Ranking as number four for the most successful esports players of all time is another Dota 2 competitor. Sébastien “Ceb” Debs first began competing back in 2011 and is easily one of the most decorated players in the scene. His multiple The International wins are only a small fraction of the first places that he has under his belt.</p>
<p>Ceb currently still competes as a member and co-founder of OG.</p>
<h3>5. Topson</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $5.85 million</strong></p>
<p>Last, but not least, is another Dota 2 player. It would seem as if this game has conquered the world of esports when it comes to prize pools and success. Topias “Topson” Taavitsainen is a Finnish competitor who is currently competing for Tundra Esports. The competitor has gotten first in multiple The Internationals and just recently placed fourth in Riyadh Masters 2024.</p>
<p>Despite being in his 30s, Topson still continues to hold the title as one of the best and most successful esports players of all time, making him number five on our list.</p>
<h3>Dota 2 Reigns Over All</h3>
<p>Curating a list of the best esports players primarily revolves around the Dota scene, as many of the top 20 highest-earning players consist of <em>all&nbsp;</em>Dota 2 players, except Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, who has $3.72 million earnings from Fortnite.</p>
<p>It would seem as if Dota 2 continues to provide the biggest prize pools in all of esports, rewarding players with more than any other game in the industry.</p>
<h2>But It Doesn’t End There</h2>
<p>It’s important to stress that Dota 2 isn’t the pinnacle of the esports industry and it doesn’t account for&nbsp;<strong>every successful esports player</strong>. There are plenty of competitors worth mentioning as we break down the most successful esports players:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter – Call of Duty (37 championships, 3 rings)</li>
<li>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok – League of Legends (20 championships, 4 rings)</li>
<li>Nicolai ‘dev1ce’ Reedtz – Counter-Strike (59 championships)</li>
<li>Niclas ‘Pengu’ Mouritzen – Rainbow Six Siege (21 championships, 2 rings)</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971514/valve-announces-half-life-alyx-its-first-flagship-vr-game">nearly five years</a> since Valve announced a truly new game — and counting. Valve has still not announced <em>Deadlock</em>, its new hero shooter that takes cues from <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em> and more. But that hasn’t stopped <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">nearly 20,000 people</a> from trying the game, including me. </p><p>And I’m not under NDA. I have signed no contracts, made no verbal agreements; I haven’t even clicked through a EULA. </p><div><figcaption><em>This message does pop up when I launch Deadlock, but I didn’t click OK; instead, I hit the Escape key and watched it disappear.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Earlier today, I received a no-strings-attached invite to play <em>Deadlock </em>on Steam. Steam claims the game is made by Valve. It displays Valve’s copyrighted logo when it launches, and its executable is digitally signed by “Valve Corp.” The game’s directories contain Valve legal notices and numerous other text files that reference Valve, and it feels like a Valve game. Though Valve didn’t respond to my requests for comment, I’m completely convinced that it’s legit. </p><div><figcaption><em>The Deadlock main menu. It reads “Early Development Build.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>So: what is <em>Deadlock</em>? </h3></p><p>It’s a 6-on-6 shooter, like original <em>Overwatch</em>, where your team of heroes attempts to dominate a map by slowly wearing down the opposing team and pushing them back. But you’re also leading an army of NPC grunts down four different lanes to destroy the opposing team’s stationary defenses, a little like <em>Dota 2</em> or other MOBA games. </p><p>There’s no downtime. It’s a constant war between your team’s Troopers (the grunts) and the enemy team’s Troopers, which keep respawning and advancing on enemy positions, wave after wave. But they can’t break through unless the human-powered heroes lend them a hand with powerful weapons, abilities, and upgrades. </p><p>Nor can humans easily break through without their NPC army — or at least, that’s what I saw in my first match. To take down the flame-headed, energy spewing Guardians or hulking Walkers that block your passage, it takes at least a somewhat coordinated effort by one human and their little autonomous friends. Each match culminates in an all-hands-on-deck fight against the enemy’s Patron, a gigantic floating orb with arms and death rays.</p><div><figcaption><em>I’ve gotten most of the way around the right lane, but now I have to contend with a Walker. My Troopers need help.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>A Patron.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>When I say “coordinated,” I’m not talking about aiming. This isn’t a <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Apex</em> <em>Legends</em>-like game where snappy aim is key. It feels like <em>Overwatch</em>, or maybe even more so <em>Team Fortress 2</em> in its floaty, wear-down-their-health gameplay. You can tank, heal, and retreat even if a tremendous amount of enemy fire is coming your way. </p><p>Each match does get deadlier and deadlier as you unlock your heroes’ abilities and buy skills, many of which give you more damage per second. Others provide life steal, shielding, and more. Every character also has strong and light melee attacks, and you can parry an incoming melee attack to stun your opponent.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><p><figcaption><em>You can spend your souls on all sorts of perks — including “active” ones you bind to a key, triggering (for example) a burst of speed.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It help that there are a <em>lot</em> of ways to dodge enemy bullets and traverse the map: you can slide, dash, air dash, dash jump, double jump, and mantle up to ledges. Each of the game’s four lanes also has an aerial tramway that lets you hitch free rides into (and out of) the fray. </p><div><figcaption><em>Hopping onto a zipline.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The ziplines don’t feel overpowered; after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24159222/valve-new-game-deadlock-multiplayer-hero-shooter">an earlier leak,</a> I’d once heard them compared to <em>Titanfall</em>’s attack-from-any-angle traversal gameplay, but Valve keeps them away from the actual firing lines. You have to retreat to territory you own before they’ll work. </p><p>They also look like they’ll lead to a fascinating give-and-take mechanic as games progress. To power up, I needed to take my hero back to a shop to buy new perks with the souls I’d accumulated by destroying enemy troopers and heroes, but that left my territory undefended. By the time I returned, the front lines had been pushed back further than I would have liked. </p><p>Even in this “early development build,” there are already 20 different heroes, plenty of which look like ones I’d enjoy playing. Yes, some of them are common archetypes like the archer, swordsman, sniper, and shotgun teleport specialist, but it’s not all that simple: have you ever seen an Infernus who literally finger-guns his foes to pieces?</p><p>I initially gravitated towards Wraith thanks to her style and the tremendous <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/more-dakka">dakka</a> of her rapid-fire tommygun, then switched to McGinnis when I found out she’s the<em> Team Fortress 2</em> engineer and heavy weapons specialist in one: turrets, barrier walls, <em>and</em> a giant minigun that fires faster the longer it goes. </p><p>I haven’t played enough yet to even begin to tell if the game’s well-balanced, or if there’s any kind of backstory for its heroes, but I’m eager to give it a go with my friends — and it seems like Valve will be just fine with that. </p><p>While Valve has yet to announce or even acknowledge this game’s existence publicly, the current build lets anyone with a copy invite as many Steam friends as they like to give it a try, too. That’s why I have an invite, and that’s why my friends now have an invite. </p><p>It’s an unusual way to release a game, but this is Valve we’re talking about — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">it’s an unusual company</a>. </p><p><em><strong>Update, August 12th: </strong>Turns out Valve was </em>not<em> fine with me trying Deadlock with friends; I’ve been banned from matchmaking! Oh well. Please feel free to make fun of me in the comments!</em></p><div><figcaption><em>Hey, that’s me! </em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>
Shadows of Doubt entered Steam early access last April, challenging players - in the role of a private investigator - to snoop and sleuth their way around a noir-ish open-world sci-fi city, aiming to complete enough investigations that they're able to hang up their trilby and retire.
</p>
<p>
It's the procedural generation at the heart of the game that makes all it so nifty, though; everything - from the simulated city and the daily routines of its citizens to the murders and odd jobs players can tackle - is different each playthrough. And it's coupled with an immersive-sim-like level of freedom that lets players hack, lock-pick, shimmy, snoop, explore, break-and-enter, interrogate, and more in order to solve its unscripted cases.

"The biggest [mystery] rattling around my brain right now," former Eurogamer editor Martin Robinson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-doubt-is-a-head-scratching-wonder-of-an-immersive-sim">wrote</a> back in 2020, "is how is this possible? This is a work of staggering ambition and no small amount of artistry, presenting an evocative, fully-functioning cityscape for you to explore, complete with several intricate systems underpinning your sleuthing. I've played 20 minutes and I'm simply staggered."
</p>
<p>
Shadows of Doubt has continued to expand throughout its early access development - last September saw the arrival of infidelity investigations, for instance - and there's still more in the works for its 1.0 release. ColePowered Games is promising a "big update that would make any private investigator twitch with intrepidation", and more details are due "in the coming weeks".
</p>
<p>
Shadows of Doubt will make its <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010521">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/shadows-of-doubt/9n7kt8fk0qhh">Xbox Series X/S</a> debut on 26th September, the same day it leaves early access on Steam. ColePowered Games notes its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/986130/Shadows_of_Doubt/">Steam price</a> will rise from $19.99 USD to $24.99 on 23rd August, a few days before its full release, so if you've been eyeing up a purchase, you might want to do it sooner rather than later.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-ii-ray-traced-is-a-stunning-path-tracing-mod-now-available-for-download.951501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A stunning Doom II: Ray Traced path tracing mod is now available for download, turning the classic second entry in the series into something unreal.</p>
<p>The path tracing mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-2-ray-traced">here</a>, utilizes GZDoom, adding features like global illumination, ray-traced shadows, voxels, and fluid-based blood simulation. Needless to say, path tracing turns the classic game into something else, vastly enhancing its atmosphere and bringing its experience to new heights. You can check out how path tracing enhances the game before downloading the mod in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Doom 2: RAY TRACED – Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mhdGeQ9NHo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's really interesting how the Doom II: Ray Traced mod was released only a few days after the base game was made available on modern gaming platforms alongside its predecessor, complete with many <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-and-doom-ii-re-release/">new features</a>, such as online cross-platform Deathmatch for up to 16 players, in-game mod browser, new accessibility options, and the Legacy of Rust new episode. Given how beautiful the path tracing makes the game look, it wouldn't be surprising for some players to experience the classic FPS with it rather than going with the newly released edition.</p>
<p>Doom + Doom II are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXld-FJOqHE&amp;t=1s"> BBC</a>, the team project lead, Dean Carter, reiterated that this mod is free. He added, however, even though the team loved working on it, "free doesn't pay our bills."</p><p dir="ltr">"We should hopefully launch our own indie games company, which will allow us to come up with our own ideas, create our own games, and work--without having to speak to anyone above us, such as Bethesda, or anything like that," Carter said. "It'll be completely our own thing and we can create a game that we want, that we think the community will enjoy. Fallout London has been a great springboard for that."</p><p dir="ltr">As for Fallout London, the team still plans to release content for the mod. Not all of it made it into the final cut. This includes a new ending, which the team refers to as "the wild card ending." But it's worth mentioning that this won't come out anytime soon because the team sees itself "working until the end of the year."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're still deciding whether to download Fallout London, check out our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/"> story explaining whether the mod is worth your time</a>.</p>

Following Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-again-now-arriving-in-november">recent delay to November</a>, developer GSC Game World has rewarded patient fans with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLJ3lV-_V8">35-minute deep dive</a> into the post-apocalyptic horror shooter sequel - showcasing a mission across its bleak, beautiful open-world.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's "huge" world - officially known as the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone - consists of 20 regions, each with its own residents, anomalies, and nature. It's also said to feature few barriers, meaning players are free explore locations as they choose - with the goal being to "give the feeling of freedom, to give the feeling of loneliness, to give the feeling of anxiety".
</p>
<p>
While GSC's deep dive offers a good look at Stalker 2's strikingly varied enviromental work, the bulk of it is focused on the swamp - a formerly inhabited region, free of Stalkers but home to many other dangers, that plays host to a quest in which players must disable deadly, repurposed psi-beacons in order to reach the Clear Sky base.

<p>
As the quest plays out, GSC emphasises the freeform nature of its mission design, explaining it's impossible to see all content and every character in a single playthrough - players will get a slightly different story, slightly different quests, and meet different people depending on the choices they make.
</p>
<p>
Some of those choices might be tied to missions - at one point we see the player opting to approach a key location from the comparative safety of a rat-infested wine cellar rather than the potentially deadlier overground - while others are more organic. GSC says it's encouraging exploration by placing new equipment, weapons, weapon attachments, and upgrades out in the world - many of which can't be acquired through the story.
</p>
<p>
In total, Stalker 2 will feature 35 weapons, and each can be equipped with different upgrades and attachments for greater diversity. They'll be used against the likes of zombies, Pseudodogs (which roam in packs alongside phantom versions of themselves), and mutant pigs known as the Flesh. GSC notes its AI doesn't cheat by knowing where the player is at all times, and will instead hunt them by first hypothesing where they'll be.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, players will want to keep an eye on their hunger levels and tiredness to ensure their efficiency doesn't dwindle, and they'll also need to be mindful of their equipment load, as overburdening will limit their movement. GSC says it's deliberately avoided making Stalker 2 easy for players, as this would "kill the grip of reality" - an attitude reflected in the decision to forego a levelling system in favour of more naturalistic pogression, with players improving as they grow more familiar with the environment, or gain faster reactions through experience.
</p>
<p>
GSC's full 35-minute deep dive features plenty more tidbits of information - including a little about the routines of different people in the Zone, and the dynamic nature of factions, which can sometimes change their leader, even break up - and it's well worth a watch, if only to goggle at its gorgeously bleak environments.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is now set to launch on 20th Novmber, when it'll be available on Xbox Series X/S, PC (via  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en#editions">GSC's website</a>), and Game Pass.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Is an actual announcement imminent?</h2></div><section><p>We've <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-game-reportedly-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter-called-deadlock">known since earlier this year</a> that Valve was quietly working on a new game, a sort of cross between hero shooters and MOBAs called Deadlock. But we never got an official announcement. Now, it looks like thousands of people are already playing the game in some sort of early play test, with the game reaching over 18,000 concurrent players earlier today.</p><p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a>, Deadlock playercount started slowly climbing earlier this month, reaching a peak of 18,254 earlier today and expected to climb further. IGN understands that the game's current early access period is operating under an invite system, where certain Steam users are receiving invites and can then suggest other individuals to also receive invites.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Sreenshots and video footage of the game available to the general public remain minimal, given that players are required to sign a strict NDA before being permitted to play. However, players are free to discuss their experiences with the game, with a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"DeadlockTheGame" subreddit</a> already accruing members and discussion of early impressions.</p><p>What we know so far is that Deadlock seems to be a mishmash of hero shooter ala Overwatch and MOBA with lane-based gameplay like DOTA 2 and tower defense elements. It takes place in a fantasy/steampunk setting. While we haven't gotten good looks at its hero cast just yet for the reasons outlined above, everyone currently playing seems to really love one character in particular:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Me: I don't' get attached to things that easily!<br>Also me after 0.2 seconds of playing Deadlock: <a href="https://t.co/1EUfO0AK4d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1EUfO0AK4d</a></p>— Moirai Agar'el ♻️💚 Slime Mom - S̶c̴u̴f̸f̸ ̸A̵R̶c̴ (@MoiraiVT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoiraiVT/status/1821942558873833840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 9, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>With the growing playerbase and invites seemingly available to anyone willing to ask, it seems likely that an actual for-real official announcement of Deadlock may be imminent. Valve's been on a bit of a spree with stealth releases lately, having <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/counter-strike-2">quietly dropped Counter-Strike 2</a> last year and Half-Life: Alyx being announced just a few short months before its eventual release.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

However, he did explain that he would have some questions before hopping on board a new <em>Fallout </em>sequel.  <br></p><p>“I mean with any project I think it has to do with: what are we doing? What are the boundaries that we’re working within? What am I allowed to do and not allowed to do?” explained Sawyer.<br></p><p>For Sawyer, the big thing seems to be freedom. He said he would only step up to make a new <em>Fallout</em> (or any game based on a pre-existing IP) if he wasn’t too constrained by the IP holder. </p><p>“I think that with any IP, especially one I’ve worked with before, the question is what do I want to do this time that I wasn’t able to do last time. And if those constraints are just really constraining, then it’s not very appealing because who wants to work on something where the one thing they want to explore is not possible to explore?” said Sawyer. <br></p><p>He then reiterated that he still loves the <em>Fallout </em>franchise, adding: “I think there’s still a ton of stories that can be told in there and questions that can be asked about society.”</p><p>Sawyer ended his answer by pointing out that working with any IP is like that and ultimately it comes down to “what are we allowed to do and not allowed to do” with the characters and world. </p><p>So is it possible that Sawyer could lead the charge on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-interview-fallout-teases-show-starfield-1851449078&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-interview-fallout-teases-show-starfield-1851449078">a new <em>Fallout </em>game, maybe even a <em>New Vegas</em> follow-up</a></span>?

The reprints are identical to the original versions--Link's Amiibo features the adorable doll-like art style from the Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening remake that launched on Nintendo Switch back in 2019, while the Zelda figure captures her appearance from The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. The reprints officially launch on September 26, and you can preorder both for $16 each at Best Buy. We recommend grabbing them quickly if interested, since we don't know how many figures Nintendo made for this reprinting and most Amiibo figures sell out before launch.</p><p dir="ltr">This Link's Awakening Link and Wind Waker Zelda Amiibo reprints drop alongside the next game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>. The Switch-exclusive adventure features the same top-down presentation and toy-like art style of the Link's Awakening remake but mixes things up in big ways, most notably making Princess Zelda the main playable character for the first time.

In a new <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nacon announced that it will now delay the Terminator: Survivors launch until 2025, previously expected to release in October 2024.



Nacon broadly cited the need for “some additional time” in order to realize its vision for the game. The studio also wants to “deliver the game that fits your expectations.”



Nacon did not break down the exact cause for delay, nor offer a more concrete release window.



However, the devs say they are impressed by fan enthusiasm, and thanked the community for their understanding and support. Although fans are dismayed by Terminator: Survivors’ delay, they did support the decision to await a smooth launch.

&nbsp;



Nacon first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed Terminator: Survivors</a> in February 2024, during the Nacon Connect showcase. A couple of months later, Nacon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-offline-story-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed more details</a> about the game during a Q&amp;A session.



Terminator: Survivors is an open-world survival game and first-person shooter, built in Unreal Engine 5. It will support co-op, as well as offline single-player gameplay.



According to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, players will “meet iconic characters of the franchise as well as original ones.” It will also feature “an unexplored storyline” about Judgment Day.



Terminator: Survivors previously planned to launch on PC on October 24, 2024, with console versions releasing later on. Most recently, Nacon shared a development video late last June, explaining the game’s inspiration from James Cameron’s original two films.

I don’t consider myself an achievement hunter. I see the appeal, and I’m excited to watch one of those videos on YouTube of someone achieving one of the rarest trophies in a game, but I don’t want to put in the work myself. I’m happy just playing the game. That said, if you fall into the former camp, here’s a look at all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong!

<figure><figcaption>Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>


Seriously, I’m right there with you. I want to get my hands on Black Myth: Wukong! But if you’re looking to track down and unlock all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, you must wait until August 20 to play the game.



Black Myth: Wukong launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, but sadly, there’s still no word about the Xbox Series X|S release date. It’s coming; the studio just doesn’t know when.



</p><hr><p>



To help you unlock achievements, it’s nice knowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-open-world-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is mostly linear</a> so that you won’t have to run far and wide. What do you think? Would Black Myth: Wukong be better as an open-world game or a linear one?
