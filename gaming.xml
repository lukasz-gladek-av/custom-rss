            <p>Scadutree Fragments are critical for levelling in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>, but one savvy player believes they've found a way to find enough fragments to reach level 14 without taking on a single boss.</p>
<p>Redditor Galdiuz2 posted their method to the Elden Ring subreddit earlier this week, including an image depicting where, exactly, Tarnished can locate Scadutree Fragments without encountering any bosses.</p>

<p>Interestingly, u/Galdiuz2's post says you could use this map to get to level 12, but u/gilgabroVII points out that you can actually get to 14 – "17, before any remembrance boss" – as there's at least one more fragment in the starting zone not indicated on the map, "two more in the Scadu Altus, and two in the [Cerulean Coast]."</p>
<p>Later, Galdiuz22 returned to the post to acknowledge that there were "even three accessible in the south, for a total of six extra not on [the] map".</p>
<p>Be careful if you choose this route, however; doing this may mean you'll end up perma-skipping interesting NPC quests.</p>

<p>Another commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dodp8f/comment/lab38tv/">added</a> that you could get 20 Fragments without fighting anything or entering a legacy dungeon, 34 without killing a boss, and 44 Fragments by taking down just three main bosses and one remembrance (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-level-14-no-bosses/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>ICYMI, a patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings. The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.</p>
<p>Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has reached 5m sales worldwide</a>, in just three days of release.</p>

More than two decades, in fact. But there's a new ray of light on the Nosgoth horizon in the form of a graphic novel called Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise.</p><p>As the first new Legacy of Kain content since 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance, The Dead Shall Rise serves as a prequel to the Soul Reaver games. The book flashes back to Raziel's human past as a Sarafan warrior and reveals how he came to be a vampire serving under Kain. The goal is to answer some long-running questions about the Legacy of Kain/Soul Reaver mythos while also introducing a major new vampire character with close ties to both Raziel and Kain.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/30/placeholder-logo-1719713665411.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Crystal Dynamics/Bit Bot Media</figcaption></figure></output><p>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise is a collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Bit Bot Media. The book is written by Joshua Viola (True Believers, It Came From the Multiplex) and Angie Hodapp (Unioverse, Shadow Atlas), with interior art by Juan Samu (Star Wars, Godzilla), letters by Jeremiah Lambert (Masters of the Universe, Transformers), covers by Dave Rapoza (Destiny, Magic: The Gathering) and Aaron Lovett (Monster Train, Inkbound). The book features additional art by Jonny Bush (Rob Zombie, Ghost) and Ninja Jo (Star Wars, Stranger Things), with Brent Friedman (Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Call of Duty) providing narrative guidance, and Crystal Dynamics has also provided creative direction based on unreleased elements of Soul Reaver lore.</p><p>“In college, I created a Soul Reaver poster for a class project, never imagining I would one day officially contribute to the franchise,” said Viola in a statement. "Even today, Raziel graces my tattoo sleeve—a testament to my deep connection with this universe. Fans can expect a project infused with that same passion. Working directly with creatives from Crystal Dynamics and reuniting with former collaborators makes this a truly special endeavor."</p><p>The Dead Shall Rise will be crowdfunded on Kickstarter. <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/ec6d71d7-3906-45d4-aaab-40fc1a372416/landing?preview_mode=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans can sign up on BackerKit</a> to be notified by email when the campaign launches later this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With any luck, this won't be the only new Legacy of Kain content fans can look forward to in the years ahead. Embracer Group, which currently owns the IP, received an overwhelming 100,000 responses to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-asking-fans-new-legacy-of-kain-game">a 2022 survey about the franchise</a>, suggesting that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-legacy-of-kain-looks-likely-as-embracer-receives-strong-fan-response">new Legacy of Kain games could be in the works</a>.</p><p>"We saw the news of our survey shared across social and press platforms and really felt this was a great way to reignite this passionate fan community with this legendary PC console game series," said Phil Rogers, CEO of Embracer's 12th operative group. "Rest assured, we hear you loudly and clearly and will continue to update you on the 'What if?' possibilities ahead for Legacy of Kain in the future." </p><p>Are you excited for this new chapter in the Soul Reaver saga?

					<p>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally heading toward its long-awaited release, this article will bring you up to speed on every facet of the action RPG, from its troubled development to its confirmed features, story beats, and setting.</p>
<p>The project has had multiple iterations over time. Shortly after the successful release of Dragon Age: Inquisition in late 2014, BioWare's Game Director Mike Laidlaw outlined plans for a new installment codenamed Joplin. This would have been a smaller game focused on a 'heist' in the region of the Tevinter Imperium magocracy. This iteration was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mike-laidlaw-bioware-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in late 2017 (with Laidlaw leaving the company around the same time) as Electronic Arts attempted to pivot the game to a live service design. Back then, this new Dragon Age (codenamed Morrison) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as 'Anthem with dragons'.</p>
<p>That wasn't the last major change in direction. Following the massive failure of Anthem and the success of Respawn's single player game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, EA eventually reconsidered its own stance and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed BioWare to ditch live service elements</a>, resuming development as a single player only title.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>, but the team has recently decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change the name</a> to reflect the game's focus on the player's companions rather than on one of the (supposed) villains.</p>
<h2>Release date, platforms, pricing, editions</h2>
<p>BioWare and Electronic Arts have not announced a definitive launch date (nor pricing or the available editions) yet. However, they confirmed the game will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X this Fall.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-officially-in-alpha-playable-from-beginning-to-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached the Alpha milestone</a> nearly two years ago, allowing a far longer time for polishing than any previous BioWare game. Between that fact and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows already securing a November 15 date (which would have been near the 10-year anniversary of Inquisition), there's speculation that the developers may be targeting a launch in late September or early October. More official information may be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As with all EA games, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be playable right away (probably even ahead of the official release) with the EA Play Pro subscription.</p>

<h2>Genre, setting, and story premise</h2>
<p>The new Dragon Age installment is a single player third-person action roleplaying game. Unlike Inquisition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-mission-based-rather-than-open-world-sex-scenes-will-have-nudity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it won't feature open world-like zones</a>. BioWare said it is a highly curated and handcrafted experience to better serve the needs of the narrative, which has been central to this project. That said, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-opens-up-dramatically-after-a-certain-point-says-bioware-rpg-skill-tree-is-enormous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the game would 'open up dramatically' after a certain point, allowing exploration off the beaten path within some 'fairly wide spaces.'</p>
<p>The setting may be the only leftover from earlier stages of the project. For the first time in the franchise, players will head to the Tevinter Imperium; in fact, the very beginning of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as shown in the 15-minute gameplay</a>, takes place in the capital of Minrathous. However, players can expect to visit a greater amount of the continent of Thedas than ever before, including locations like Weisshaupt (the fortress of the Grey Wardens, located in Anderfels), Rivain, the Arlathan Forest, and the Deep Roads.</p>
<p>The story of Dragon Age: The Veilguard picks up around eight years after the events seen in the Trespasser DLC for Dragon Age: Inquisition. Solas, now fully unmasked as the elven trickster god known as Dreadwolf, is hellbent on tearing the Veil to restore immortality to the elves, no matter the consequences for the world. The player character named Rook (the surname will vary depending on the race, selected between Qunari, Dwarf, Elf, and Human) gets wind of the situation and rushes alongside Varric, Harding (the female Dwarf scout from the previous game), and a Mage detective called Neve to stop Solas. Rook successfully disrupts the magic ritual but, in so doing, frees two extremely dangerous elven deities previously stuck behind the Veil: Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain. It will be up to Rook and their Veilguard (composed of seven companions: Harding, Neve, Lucanis, Bellara, Davrin, Taash, and Emmrich) to protect Thedas from the aftermath.</p>
<p>In Dragon Age: Inquisition, players imported save states from previous games via the dedicated Dragon Age Keep software, allowing them to maintain the world states spawned by their choices and consequences. For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare opted for a different approach. Players will build key choices from previous games directly in the new character creator, with tarot cards providing context for each decision. They'll even get to recreate their own Inquisitor (the main character in the third installment), who will appear in the game in some capacity. The character creator itself was described as the most powerful ever made by BioWare, featuring extensive body customization options (including 40 different skin complexions and as many Qunari horn types, as well as more than 30 makeup styles), the ability to choose pronouns separately from gender, and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine. Character creation also includes background roleplaying options such as the faction, with six available options: Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Shadow Dragons, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and Veil Jumpers.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The combat system is more action-focused than in previous Dragon Age games, and the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-lets-you-switch-between-2-weapons-mid-combat-is-about-being-in-control-of-every-single-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> the goal of letting players feel in control of every action, be it parrying, dodging, or blocking.</p>
<p>Players will select three active abilities per character to bring in their weapon loadouts (two can be swapped mid-combat), in addition to Ultimates (which change based on specialization) and runes. However, some skills have been baked into the core moveset for all classes. Each class now has light and heavy attacks, which can be used strategically depending on the situation, and some abilities can be charged. Moreover, there are combo opportunities between certain abilities, and combos can be 'paused' to dash away when needed and resumed afterward.</p>
<p>Players will select their main character's class between three options: Warrior, Rogue and Mage. Each of the classes comes with its own set of specializations. Warriors can become either Reapers, who use night blades to siphon health from foes, risking death to gain supernatural abilities; Slayers, who wield two-handed weapons for straightforward but strong attacks that deal increased damage; or Champions, who are equipped with one-handed weapons and shields, focusing on tactical defense and taking hits from enemies on the group's behalf.</p>
<p>Rogues can pick between Duelists, who dual wield blades for rapid strikes and have the fastest movement with a focus on dodges and parries, Saboteurs, who use a mix of traps and tricks to control the battlefield, and Veil Rangers, a more classic ranged style of combat to hit enemies from afar with a bow. Lastly, Mages can be either Death Callers (basically, necromancers), Spellblades (warrior mages who infuse their melee attacks with magic), or&nbsp;Evokers, masters of elemental fire, ice, and lightning magic. Blood Magic won't be available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard for a narrative reason, according to BioWare.</p>
<p>Players can customize their character to their heart's content thanks to the 'enormous' skill trees that the developers said were inspired by Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid. With every level up (the max level is 50), the game will provide a skill point that can be used in the tree to unlock active abilities, traits, minor passives, and major passives, which can include jump attacks and guaranteed critical hits after specific triggers. BioWare also said that players would be able to branch out of their chosen specialization around mid-game to pick other stuff from the skill trees to complement their playstyle.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has reduced the group from four to three characters due to the increased action focus. You also won't be able to control companions directly, but you can issue them orders to execute specific abilities against specific targets via the ability wheel, pausing the action. The companions can act on their own, but at harder difficulties, strategic play of the whole party is recommended.</p>
<p>Speaking of the main character's allies, they will gather at a social hub called Lighthouse (located in the Fade). It's here that most of the conversations between them and the player character will occur. Each companion can be romanced regardless of gender and race, and if you won't romance them yourself, they may find their match elsewhere in the group.</p>
<p>Lastly, crafting and transmogrification (the ability to wield some gear and show a cosmetic skin instead) are confirmed to be in the game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Dragon-Age-The-Veilguard_Screenshot_04_RookWarrior_3840x2160_v4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Technology &amp; Specs</h2>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by the Frostbite engine, like Dragon Age: Inquisition, Mass Effect: Andromeda, and Anthem. BioWare said this is the first game in which they've felt in control of the engine. On consoles, the game will offer performance and quality mode options.</p>
<p>We don't have any details on the PC version yet, including system requirements. However, BioWare's Mike Gamble has <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1800665572042236364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that PC-related announcements are coming soon, hinting at a collaboration with either Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki "Youshi P" Yoshida offered his "sincere apologies" for "issues" identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published on the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/09598d1b4efffdc7cdc3360d32bf2086026761b6">official website</a>, Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed an issue in the Xbox version where the game client may become unresponsive when transitioning between locations, such as field areas and cities," Yoshida explained. "Our preliminary investigation suggests that this issue is likely due to a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation.</p>
<p>"We are currently conducting a comprehensive investigation into the matter, which we have prioritised to ensure a swift resolution. However, rectifying this issue requires the deployment of a patch to update the client. This process involves rigorous checks by our QA team, among other procedures, which means it may take several days to address."</p>
<p>Yoshida said that the team was working to expedite a patch to address this, but as "this process will take some time", he "apologised for the inconvenience caused".</p>
<p>Similarly, issues in the Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate), the Minstrel’s Ballad: Shinryu’s Domain, and Delubrum Reginae (Savage) where "mechanics related to freezing are not functioning correctly" will be resolved via a "client patch", although it's not yet clear when that will be deployed.</p>
<p>"The aforementioned issues are being classified as a high priority," Yoshida added. "They are under investigation on our development server and are being addressed in a systematic manner. We are considering the release of a hot fix, which is likely to occur sometime this week, which would be accompanied by a brief maintenance period.</p>
<p>"I would like to extend my apologies once again for the occurrence of these issues. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing issues such as these that occur after the release of an expansion and will continue to promptly correct any urgent issues that may arise."</p>
<p>"So far, Tural's environments feel rich and warm, existing in a perpetual summer haze," Ed wrote in his wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail preview</a>. </p>
<p>"Zoom in close, though, and the real difference from the graphical update is apparent. The texture work on armour and weapons is a vast improvement, while animal races - like the new female Hrothgar - seem more realistically furry."</p>
<p>In 2015, the MMO had four million players for the Heavensward expansion; this has grown to 30 million registered accounts by 2024's Tokyo Fan Fest. Even by 2021 it had become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">the most profitable game in the long-running series</a> and that will only have increased since, not to mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-purchases-on-xbox-require-an-extra-currency">game's release this year on Xbox</a> and the likely boost to sales Dawntrail will provide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-no-chance-of-final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-launch-server-woes-naoki-yoshida-says-after-endwalker-issues">Yoshida told Eurogamer there's "almost no chance" of server woes at launch</a>" when the expansion goes live on 2nd July, 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-to-shutdown-in-june-private-server-version-incoming">Velan Studios may have shuttered its competitive "dodgebrawl" game, Knockout City, a year ago</a>, but it still "loves that world and can't imagine not going back to it at some point".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.velanstudios.com/post/a-big-week">update</a> primarily focussed on the reveal of Midnight Murder Club – described as a blend of "hide-and-seek in the dark with shooter gameplay to make a truly thrilling playground" – and new VR pinball game Bounce Arcade, Velan founders Karthik and Guha Bala insisted they still "love Knockout City as much as you do and want to bring it back".</p>

<p>"We know that some of you are waiting for Knockout City to return and are disappointed that we didn’t announce any news about that this week," the brothers said.</p>
<p>"As an indie studio, we love our ability to lean into ideas that excite us, and rest assured we love [Knockout] City as much as you do and want to bring it back, *just not yet*.</p>
<p>"We spent over four years crafting Knockout City the first time around, and we don’t want to rush the process for the next game in that universe," the statement continued. "We love that world and can’t imagine not going back to it at some point, when the time is right."</p>
<p>Knockout City, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knockout-city-has-officially-gone-free-to-play">free-to-play</a> "dodgebrawl" game, shutdown in June 2024.</p>
<p>"This was an extremely difficult decision for us, but a necessary and important one for our studio," game director at developer Velan Studios, Jeremy Russo, said at the time.</p>
<p>It was initially published on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last May under the EA Originals label, but Velan announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-published-knockout-city-going-free-to-play-this-spring-without-ea">assume publishing duties</a> and shift to a free-to-play model just a few months after it launched.</p>

Gameplay also took center stage and we got to see some of the unique abilities each character has, including Majin Vegeta's Final Explosion that deals a ton of damage but leaves the player with 1 HP for a chance to fight on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While we didn't get to learn a ton more about the story mode and its branching paths - you can alter parts of the canon Dragon Ball story with your decisions - we did get to see certain scenes like the battle against Raditz. For those unfamiliar, Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero will take players through both Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super and star eight characters, including Goku and Vegeta. </p><p>Bandai Namco revealed to us that Goku has the largest number of stages, beginning with his fight with Raditz and going all the way through the Tournament of Power Saga. </p><p>If that wasn't enough, Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/between-us-weve-spent-%C2%A314bn-on-steam-games-weve-never-played.915564/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/between-us-weve-spent-14bn-on-steam-games-weve-never-played<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Steam users have collectively amassed £14bn ($19bn) worth of unplayed games.</p>
<p>That's according to new research from <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/pile-of-shame">PCGN</a> and SteamIDFinder, which has put the full cost of the number of unplayed games sitting in our Steam libraries as "about the same as the gross domestic product of Nicaragua".</p>

<p>Admittedly, the research hasn't polled every single one of the millions of us who have a Steam account, but the numbers were calcuated by anaylsing the 73m  accounts in the SteamIDFinder database that are set to public.</p>
<p>By using the data from those public accounts, the research opines we've spent £1.4bn on games we haven't played even once. Presuming that figure is representative of all Steam accounts, scale that figure up and it's estimated that across the whole Steam user community, that equates to a staggering £14bn of unplayed games.</p>
<p>If you want to know exactly how much cash is tied up in your pile of shame, head on over to <a href="https://www.steamidfinder.com/#pileofshame">SteamIDFinder</a>.</p>
<p>Valve recently revealed it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-launches-new-background-gameplay-recording-and-sharing-feature-into-beta">expanding Steam's already teetering tower of built-in features with a new background gameplay recording and sharing system</a> that's available in beta now.</p>
<p>As detailed on Valve's Game Recording beta page, Steam's new suite of console-like video features begin with two distinct recording modes. A Background Recording mode continuously saves gameplay to a preferred drive - users can set duration and storage limits - while an On Demand Recording mode enables users to start and stop recording as they choose.</p>
<p>A new timeline feature and player-added event markers are intended to make it easier to find key moments (achievements, screenshots, and in-game events in supported games can also auto-generate markers if desired) and recordings can be clipped using new "lightweight" tools.</p>

			<p>Saber Interactive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4225021101189985804?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a community update about its upcoming game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-6-minute-gameplay-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2</a>. First and foremost, the studio informed fans that the previously announced online beta will no longer take place.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2 is almost ready. We are now entirely focused on optimization, polish and fixing remaining issues ahead of launch on September 9. This means we will not run a public online beta, as it would take the development teams away from preparing for the full launch, and our priority is to ensure the best possible experience at release.</em></p>
<p><em>We know this is disappointing news for some of you. As a thank you to those interested in participating, players who registered via the online signup before June 28, 2024, midnight Paris Time, will receive the limited Bolt Pistol skin.</em></p>
<p>The development team also recapped the main modes available in Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, revealing that the campaign is around 12 hours long. Playable either solo or in co-op, it features Lieutenant Titus fighting alongside his Battle-Brothers Chairon and Gadriel against swarms of Tyranids and Chaos.</p>
<p>In the co-op Operations mode, players may also play solo or with two friends in an endlessly replayable PvE action where they face swarms of Tyranids on six different maps to defend the Imperium. Finally, in the PvP Eternal War mode, players will fight in 6v6 matches in three different classic game modes: Annihilation, Seize Ground, Capture &amp; Control).</p>
<ul>
<li>Annihilation is a Team Deathmatch mode in which two teams compete against each other. Each takedown earns your team 1 point. The first team to reach 50 points wins the match.</li>
<li>Seize Ground is a Domination mode where two teams compete to keep control of one zone that’s moving throughout the match. Keeping control of the zone grants your team points. The winner is the team that reaches the total amount of points given.</li>
<li>Capture &amp; Control is a King of the Hill mode with three specific zones in the arena. Each team fights to control them. Gaining and keeping control of a zone grants your team points. Be the first to obtain a certain amount of points to win the match.</li>
</ul>
<p>Saber also confirmed that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 will run its online modes on dedicated servers across the North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Oceania regions, allowing for optimal multiplayer experiences. Ahead of the game's launch in early September, eager fans across North America can get their hands on a game demo at expos in Denver (July 4-7), Indianapolis (August 1-4), Chicago (August 16-18), and Toronto (August 22-25).</p>

<p>A remake of <em>Riven: The Sequel to Myst</em> launched this week, made by the original game's developers. It strikes a fascinating balance between re-creation and reinvention, and based on a couple of hours of playing it, it's a resounding success.</p>
<p><em>Myst</em> was the classic most people remembered fondly from the early CD-ROM era, but for me, its sequel, <em>Riven</em>, was the highlight. After that, the sequels declined in quality. The sophomore effort was the apex.</p>
<p>It was certainly more ambitious than <em>Myst</em>. Instead of a handful of tightly packed theme park worlds, it offered a singular, cohesive one that felt lived in and steeped in history in a way that <em>Myst</em> couldn't quite match.</p>
<h2>A worthy presentation</h2>
<p>That was thanks to outstanding art direction but also to its iconic musical score.</p>
<p>For the most part, the remake nails both of those things. While the original game resembled the first <em>Myst</em> in that you had to click to scroll between static images to explore the game's world, the new one follows the 2020<em> Myst</em> remake (and 2000's oft-forgotten <em>realMyst</em>) in giving the player full movement, akin to contemporary first-person puzzle games like <em>Portal</em>, <em>The Witness</em>, or <em>The Talos Principle</em>. Since it's easy to re-create a lot of the original camera angles this way, it might have been cool if there had been an option to control the game as you did originally, but I can see why that wasn't a priority.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Riven-room.png" data-height="1440" data-width="2560" alt="The environments are just as atmospheric and detailed as they used to be."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Riven-room.png" data-height="1440" data-width="2560">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The environments are just as atmospheric and detailed as they used to be.</p><p>Samuel Axon</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It just so happens that today's graphics hardware does an outstanding job of replicating previously static visuals in full 3D. (There's even VR support, though I haven't tried it yet.) And the music is just as good as it used to be.
</p><p>There are only two downsides on the presentation front. First, I've heard that folks running on older machines may struggle to achieve satisfactory fidelity and performance. I played it on both an M1 Max MacBook Pro and a Windows 11 desktop with an AMD Ryzen 9 5900X and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080. The MacBook Pro ran the game at maxed-out settings at the laptop's native resolution at around 30 frames per second. The desktop did the same at 4K at 120 fps. But those are both high-end, recent-ish machines, so your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Second, the full-motion video performances in the original game have been replaced with full 3D, video game-looking characters. It's a necessary concession, but I feel some of the character was lost. They did a pretty good job matching the motions of the original videos, though.</p>

		<p>We’ve got a great summer of gaming coming up with 2024 seemingly keen on keeping us inside rather than letting us damage our skin in the sun that we’re not getting. Flintlock: Siege of Dawn is one of the more promising of those titles we’ve got coming up, with it set to release on July 18th for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. While console players won’t be remotely concerned, those on the PC side of the fence will likely want to know whether their rig meets the minimum specifications, or whether a trip to the graphics card shop might be in order.</p>

			<p>PlayStation's Returnal studio, Housemarque, is looking for a Senior Game Designer for its next AAA action title.</p>
<p>The Finish Studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-returnal-has-officially-joined-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became part of PlayStation Studios in 2021</a> shortly after the successful release of Returnal. Last year, the roguelike third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-pc-launch-weak-peak-concurrent-10th-god-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also made its way to PC</a>. It's been three years since the global launch of Returnal, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/senior-game-designer-at-housemarque-3962842467/?originalSubdomain=fi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as spotted</a> on Linkedin, the PlayStation-owned studio is now hiring for its next "big" game. Although the job ad doesn't necessarily include details about the studio's next title, it mentions that the game designer will focus on enemy and boss design.</p>
<p>"If you wish to join us for our next journey, apply today!", the ad reads. "We are looking for a Senior Game Designer focusing on Enemy and Boss design for our next big game!"</p>
<p>Other interesting tidbits from the job offer include a "passion for action games" as well as "enemy and boss design". In addition, the offer mentions "proficient in the use of Unreal Engine". We've covered a screenshot of the job offer below.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Housemarque is hiring for its next "big" AAA action game</figcaption></figure>
<p>As covered back in 2022, we know that Housemarque is <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-is-working-on-a-new-ip-after-returnal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working on a new IP for PlayStation</a>. "We had our stint working on multiplayer games because a few years back it seemed like you needed to have some kind of multiplayer experience". Housemarque's Managing Director Ilari Kuittinen said in 2022. "We tried that, and we really didn’t do it as well. But it’s early days with us starting a new game, a new IP, concepting it out. We’ll see what comes with that."</p>
<p>Further details about Housemarque's new project are unknown, but from the looks of it, we're looking at a new AAA action title. We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the studio's upcoming new project.</p>
<p>Returnal was released for PlayStation 5 in 2021 with a PC version being released in 2023. Here's what we wrote about the PS5 version in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/returnal-in-my-restless-dreams-i-see-that-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a>:</p>
<p><em>"Save for an ending that crashes nearly as hard as Helios' entry onto Atropos, Returnal checks all of the marks for what a best-in-class roguelike should aim for: a gameplay loop that rewards the player for innovation and mastery, loot that can synergize to create some unstoppable character builds, and most importantly, weapons that simply feel right in the player's hands. Without a doubt, Returnal is one of the finest PlayStation 5 exclusives available in 2021 and those that are eager for the next great challenge can find plenty to look forward to with Selene's first steps onto the alien planet again and again."</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-player-count-soar/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld%E2%80%99s-player-count-soars-by-700-following-new-update.915456/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-player-count-soar/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Palworld’s latest update has added a new island – Sakurajima – along with a series of new Pals, enemies, and items. It’s the most sizeable update the game has received since being released in January 2024, and it has caused a surge in popularity, with player counts booming across all platforms.</p>



<p>Using Steam as a representative example, we can confirm that Palworld’s player count skyrocketed by more than 700%. It went from a peak concurrent count of around 15,000 users before the update to a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1623730/charts/#1m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 130,000</a> once the update had dropped.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-former-glory">Former Glory</h2>



<p>It might have seen a sudden surge in players, but Palworld likely won’t ever be restored to what it once was. In January, when the Palworld hype train was in full flow, the game peaked at 2.1 million concurrent players on Steam, putting it near the top of the leaderboard for the most-played game ever on the platform. It was an overnight sensation driven by the ‘Pokémon with guns’ trope that pulled so many users into it.</p>



<p>Things have gone relatively quiet for Palworld since then, but this latest update has stoked the embers a little. </p>



<p>According to Pocket Pair, the game’s developer, there’s plenty on the horizon. Coming later this year is an arena mode that’ll see players fight against other users, much like they would in a traditional Pokémon battle. Only, as it’s Palworld, it’ll be fused with assault rifles and grenades.</p>



<p>Are you returning to Palworld with this latest update?</p>

<p>The First Descendant is set to be released in just a couple of days, and with each passing hour, more information is being uncovered. Recently, eagle-eyed users identified a character model variant in the game that’s even more risque than Stellar Blade’s Eve – ‘Ultimate Bunny’. In The First Descendent, ‘Ult Bunny’ has a lore-driven, incredibly skimpy outfit, leaving almost nothing to the imagination.</p>



<p>Marketing, right?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-ultimate-outfit">The Ultimate Outfit</h2>



<p>In The First Descendant, players can assume control of a Standard or an Ultimate character. Over time, more Ult characters will be added to the game, but there are a few available at launch to kick off the roster, including Lepic and Viessa. The core difference is that Ultimate characters are ‘boosted’, boasting a unique appearance and better stats than their Standard counterparts.</p>



<p>To give a little context, Stellar Blade was released in April to a relatively positive reception, but many players got on board because of the marketing campaign that shed plenty of light on the voluptuous main character, Eve. As they explored the post-apocalyptic slasher, players could unlock and find a series of outfits, almost all of which were highly revealing – with some being extremely controversial.</p>



<p>In The First Descendant, players can assume control of Bunny, who has a figure-hugging bodysuit and a bizarre helmet with – you guessed it – <strong><em>bunny ears.</em></strong></p>



<p><em><strong>However, </strong></em>the Ultimate version of Bunny is adorned in an outfit that may as well not be there, offering almost no real protection and showing off a fair portion of her body. Per the lore, it’s because the suit was never finished – or ‘restored’ – and originally, the plan was that it’d be a complete suit. Go figure, right?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The First Descendant will be released on July 2 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has laid off 33 members of its Ubisoft Toronto staff.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Ubisoft said the layoffs were part of a "targeted realignment" necessary to ensure it can "deliver on its ambitious roadmap.</p>

<p>"Ubisoft Toronto has decided to conduct a targeted realignment to ensure it can deliver on its ambitious roadmap," a company representative said in a statement to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/less-than-a-month-after-joining-work-on-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-33-employees-to-ensure-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap/">PC Gamer</a>.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, this will impact the roles of 33 team members who will be leaving Ubisoft. We are committed to providing comprehensive support to them, including severance and career assistance, to help through this transition."</p>
<p>It's unclear what departments have been affected by the cuts, or how this may impact Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake that Ubisoft Toronto was recently brought in to support. However, Ubisoft insists "our plan remains unchanged, and our teams are working to deliver on the Splinter Cell remake and other projects at the studio".</p>
<p>This is just the latest in an long line of studio shutdowns and redundancies, and marks an unflinchingly miserable time for games and the people who make them. By the end of May 2024 – so not even halfway through the year – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people had been laid off from their jobs this year across the industry</a>.</p>
<p>When Ed wrote the article above at the end of May, 10,000 people had lost their jobs in the games industry. Now, that total has increased to 10,800. For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning more devs have been impacted by the layoffs so far in 2024 in less than half the time.</p>
<p>"The layoffs will slow down. Most of the big companies have made their moves now, and hopefully they won't need to go further (some analysts speaking to GamesIndustry.biz believe companies may now need to hire back up within a few years). But the pain isn't over," wrote GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring for Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">the state of video game layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot had spoken out to condemn "the malicious and personal online attacks" directed at its developers</a>, in the wake of the online fallout from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' reveal.</p>

We’ve all been there. The barrier to entry for many tabletop, card, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> can sometimes be high, with some games’ starter kits starting well <a href="https://zdcs.link/KKR4j" target="_blank">over $100</a>. It can be intimidating to get into certain board games due to budget, and that’s a shame. </p><p>Whether you’re getting that special gamer in your life a birthday gift or hosting a casual game night with close friends, plenty of budget options exist that are sure to scratch that itch. And we’ve compiled some of our favorites right here!</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best Cheap Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><u></u><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bdy2v" target="_blank">Qwirkle</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#boss-monster"><u>Boss Monster 10th Anniversary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#chameleon"><u>The Chameleon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#decrypto"><u>Decrypto</u></a></li><li><u></u><a href="https://zdcs.link/vdk12" target="_blank">Targi</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/V0w3L" target="_blank">Hand Games 21</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#betrayal"><u>Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#old"><u>You’re Getting Old</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#coup"><u>Coup</u></a></li><li><u></u><a href="https://zdcs.link/OdpJB" target="_blank">Say Anything</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#taco-cat"><u>Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#poop"><u>Poop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cheap-board-games#couch"><u>Couch Skeletons</u></a></li></ul><h2>Board Games Under $30</h2><h3>Qwirkle</h3><div id="202576" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Qwirkle</h3></p></div><p>Qwirkle is one of a tiny handful of games that have won the biggest trophy in the scene, the Spiel des Jahres, and gone on to become a mainstream hit in its own right. And what’s more, you can now pick up a copy for under $30. Its success is down to a combination of intuitive gameplay and addictive tactical smarts. The game pieces are tiles with differently coloured shapes on them, and on your turn you can play any number that share a colour or shape, into a line or column that shares the same colour or shape. You then score a point for each tile in the sequence, plus a bonus if you complete a set of six shapes or colours. The result combines the familiar spatial strategies of Scrabble with all sorts of head-spinning opportunities to set up future plays or block opponents.
</p><h3 id="boss-monster">Boss Monster</h3><div id="197937" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Boss Monster 10th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p>A personal favorite of mine, Boss Monster is a love-letter to a bygone era of early pixel art RPG video games, filled to the brim with heroes, dungeons, spells, and of course, boss monsters. In it, <em>you</em> are the boss monster, building your dungeon and setting various traps to kill the heroes before they slay you first. Each Boss card has unique abilities that will inform your dungeon-building strategy, and you can even disrupt your opponents’ dungeons by buffing heroes adventuring through them. Boss Monster is designed for 2-4 players, and the 10th Anniversary edition of this replayable classic also comes with 15 brand new cards.</p><h3 id="chameleon">The Chameleon</h3><div id="197938" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Chameleon</h3></p></div><p>The Chameleon is an easy to pick up, quick-to-play social deduction game. At the beginning of the round, players are dealt face down cards, one of them being the Chameleon. Players not dealt this card are then issued a secret code word, unbeknownst to the Chameleon, and must use tricky wordplay and conversation to oust the Chameleon, all while that player tries their best to blend in. This is great for quick rounds, parties, or the local brewery.</p><h3 id="decrypto">Decrypto</h3><div id="162032" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Decrypto</h3></p></div><p>Decrypto is another clever wordplay game -- make sure you have plenty of extra paper and pencils ready to go just in case. Each round consists of two teams, with one player from either team working to decipher a secret code and pass it onto their team. The other team has the opportunity to steal if you fail to pass along the code. Set up is quick and easy, and the secret code pieces are plentiful enough that you won’t have much overlap for multiple games. Highly team-oriented and fast-paced rounds make Decrypto a must-play for larger gaming groups. </p><h2>Board Games Under $20</h2><h3>Targi</h3><div id="202577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Targi</h3></p></div><p>Sometimes cheap games are fairly light affairs, great for family time, but less so for long-term investments that grow on you over time. Targi is a rare exception, a two-player only title that comes in at around 20 dollars, but which can last a lifetime of exploration. Play involves a grid of randomly placed cards around which you place pieces against a row or column, locking that position up from your opponent, and you’ll eventually gain the cards at the intersections where your placements meet. Some give you resources, while the point-scoring cards you’ll need to win cost them, but there are severe limits on how much of either you can collect. Combining tense tactical placement with head-scratching hand and resource management, this is a gem you can pick up for a bargain price.</p><h3>Hand Games 21</h3><div id="202578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Hand Games 21</h3></p></div><p>Games don’t come much cheaper than those you can play with your hands alone, like Rock, Paper, Scissors. And for the modest entry fee of fifteen bucks, you can add 21 new hand games to your repertoire, all of which are much better and more creative than that hoary old chestnut. Your hands will be transformed into those of a wizard, hurling spells at your opponents, or those of a banker, grabbing and counting wads of cash at lightning speed. If you want something a little less action-oriented, there are puzzle games involving hidden fingers and social deduction games that eschew the traditional cards and dice. It’s an impressive feat of design chops, and it doesn’t involve your feet at all. And of course, once someone’s invested the price of the book, you can spread the games to your friends for free.</p><h3 id="betrayal">Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls</h3><div id="197343" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Betrayal Deck of Lost Souls Card Game</h3></p></div><p>A Tarot card-inspired <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror-themed board game</a>, Betrayal: Deck of Lost Souls is a cooperative strategy game in which players must work together to defeat the numerous monsters and horrors they’ll face. The catch: one player is secretly a traitor, trying to bring about the one true Curse. Highly stylized and macabre art makes this a great gift for horror fans. This standalone card game consists of over 90 Item, Curse, Character, and Omen cards, creating endless potential for a fresh and exciting experience each time you play. Also check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-board-game-buyers-guide">Betrayal at House on the Hill buyer's guide</a>.</p><h3 id="old">You're Getting Old</h3><div id="197940" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>You're Getting Old</h3></p></div><p>Best enjoyed by skinny-jean-wearing, avocado-toast-eating, will-never-be-able-to-afford-a-house Millennials, You’re Getting Old is a classic “never have I ever” style card game that tells you that yes, you are in fact getting old. To start the round, each player draws a card with prompts that make them old and ones that redeem them. If you can answer what “deadass” means, you’re redeemed and move down a space using your avocado token. The player who gets to the highest space first by being old ends the game, and whoever has the lowest position wins. Quick and easy set up, and great for making fun of your friends.</p><h3 id="coup">Coup</h3><div id="197941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Coup Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Looking to test out your lying abilities? Coup is the game for you. In it, players fight over gaining or losing influence as they struggle to be the last one standing. Take actions to steal currency from another player, or counteractions to block foreign aid or stealing. Subterfuge is at the forefront here, as you’ll often have the opportunity to use character card abilities you may not actually control, but be warned: other players can challenge you, and if you’re caught, you lose influence. When you lose your two influence cards, you’re out of the game and the next round begins until one player is left. </p><h2>Board Games Under $10</h2><h3>Say Anything</h3><div id="202584" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Say Anything</h3></p></div><p>If you want to thrill a big group of players with a brilliant party game you can pick up on the cheap, you won’t do better than Say Anything. Players take turns drawing a question card and picking one to ask: everyone else then writes and reveals their answer. Once they’re all public, everyone secretly bets on which answer the question-asker will like the best before the big reveal, when you’ll find out who’s hit the jackpot and who’s going empty-handed into the next round. Like all the best party games, it’s a very simple formula that’s likely to inspire some big laughs and some spicy table chat, and at this price it’s entirely worth adding to your after dinner party repertoire.
</p><h3 id="taco-cat">Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</h3><div id="197942" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza</h3></p></div><p>A quick, easy, and insanely addictive card game, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza is perfect for families and will put your reflexes to the test. The goal is to get rid of all the cards in your hand, and doing so requires focus and concentration. Players take turns in a clockwise order, and you say aloud either taco, cat, goat, cheese, or pizza in that order while playing your card. If the word you say and the face-up card match, players must slap the card and the last player to do so adds the face-up pile to their deck. This makes for great laughs and all-around competitive silliness that is well worth its price.</p><h3 id="poop">Poop</h3><div id="197943" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Poop The Game</h3></p></div><p>Similar to Uno, Poop the Game is a numbers-based strategy card game where the goal is to dump (no pun intended) your hand to win. Each round has players take turns pooping but be wary not to clog the toilet: if you play the card that makes the poop pile exceed the number on the toilet card, you take all of those cards, and the round starts over. There are also special cards that reverse turn order and color-based strategies to “flush” the toilet. Thankfully, Poop the Game has no scratch and sniff components.</p><h3 id="couch">Couch Skeletons</h3><div id="197944" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Couch Skeleton</h3></p></div><p>Super quick and easy set up and short play time makes Couch Skeletons a great pick for a small gift or travel game. You and another player take turns placing numbered skeletons on one of five couches, with the card you play being either one number higher or lower than the skeletons in play. If you have no cards to play, you then discard your hand, and the next round starts by drawing three cards. The goal is to get rid of all your cards from both your hands and empty the draw decks, and you win when you’ve played all your cards and aren’t able to draw.</p><p>Be sure to also check out our recommendations for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">best party games</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games"><u>best 2-player board games</u></a>.</p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.
