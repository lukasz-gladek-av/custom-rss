		<p>Around a year after its debut, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lego-fortnite">LEGO Fortnite</a> is getting its biggest update yet, with a big update for the existing experience (now rebranded as LEGO Fortnite Odyssey) and a whole new social roleplaying game LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. Both will be available through the regular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> client later this week on 12th December, with LEGO Fortnite now a permanent unique category for all the modes and UGC within.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Odyssey - Storm Chasers Update Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EMI5CLx2IA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s start with Lego Fortnite Odyssey and the new update for the game, dubbed Storm Chasers. The Storm King has kicked off a quest to consume the whole world, and it’s up to you and your friends to find Storm Chaser Village, make new friends, and build up the strength to stop him.</p>
<p>Storm Chaser Village is the new hub, with a bunch of Storm Chaser characters to meet and grab missions from. These will take you out into the Storm where you’ll look for Storm Dungeons to take on – these are regenerated and randomised every 24 hours.</p>

<p>There’s some new gameplay mechanics, and overhaul of progression and component-based crafting that will have you scavenging for resources of higher rarity. Enemy difficulty has been equalised across biomes to help improve balance through the game, as well. LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is compatible with split-screen across PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Brick Life Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KoF7Xfp-ako?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life is something completely new, though. Ever wanted to live in a Lego city? Because now you can, hopping onto servers alongside 31 other players and hanging out in restaurants, parties and clubs in what looks a little more like the social side of GTA Online.</p>
<p>You’ll have your own home to decorate, but affording all that will require you to get a job, which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courier – Deliver parcels to other Brick Bay residents!</li>
<li>Academy Professor – Share your knowledge with the class at Moundale Academy.</li>
<li>Security Officer – Make sure crime doesn’t pay.</li>
<li>Scoundrel – Prank fellow city-goers.</li>
<li>Sushi Chef – Serve up the tastiest fish in Brick Bay!</li>
<li>Bobom Milk Tea Bobarista – Serve Brick Bay’s most refreshing beverage.</li>
<li>Fortune Teller – What does your future hold? New furniture!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can swap careers whenever you like.</p>
<p>With cash in your account, you can buy and then customise your own home at one of several empty lots in the city, whether that’s in the suburbs or the heart of the city. Just open your phone and use the furniture catalogue to personalise it, or visit the furniture shop for more bespoke items. If you own any Decor Bundles and Builds from the wider Lego Fortnite, you can use these as well.</p>
<p>You can visit locations including the town square, the beach, Durrr Burger, and Mourndale Academy to socialise with other players. The Rooftop Club will open on 18th December with an in-game event. Importantly there’s the standard Fortnite chat restrictions to keep a lid on interactions, which can take place using text chat, or through the use of emotes and jam tracks.</p>
<p>It sounds really interesting, finding yet another new direction to push Fortnite in and reviving some of that early 2000s social game space vibe in the process.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs.1055799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/covenant-is-new-first-person-dark-fantasy-combat-game-from-halo-battlefield-destiny-doom-devs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Legion Studios is a relatively new and small studio that contains a team of 12 people who all have a significant amount of experience. The team consists of developers from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-playstation-5-ports-halo-gears/">Halo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">Destiny</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/">Doom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-from-the-rift-update-available-today-adding-new-cosmetics-launch-royale-more/">Apex Legends</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-development-studios-working-on-new-battlefield-game/">Battlefield</a>, all of which are announced in the first gameplay trailer that they revealed. They have just announced their new and upcoming game called Covenant, which is a first-person dark fantasy combat game. To get a glimpse at what the game will be looking like, check out the first gameplay trailer below. The trailer is just under three minutes long.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GxeAuWTduC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Covenant will have a Metroidvania and Soulslike world, where players will get to explore a vast, interconnected world, where you'll get to go on a long and arduous journey to discover the fighting stances, weaponry, spells, and armor that can help you become powerful in the game. The footage seen in the trailer shows that Covenant will be developed using Unreal Engine 5, with the footage in the video being from a pre-alpha, in-engine build of the game. Despite that, the quality looks great, and the world looks incredibly detailed and reminiscent of FromSoftware games. Even the narration that sets the tone of the video feels very much like a Soulslike. However, it is pretty rare to see a first-person Soulslike, so it'll be interesting to see how Covenant will shape up and whether it'll be closer to a game like Remnant. However, even that title is in the third person. With how quick movements and attacks are in a Soulslike, it seems like being in first-person will provide an additional challenge that may not sit well with those who are fans of the genre.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no sort of ETA or release window for Covenant, which is to be expected, considering this is really the first time anyone is hearing about the game. They shared some relatively generic PC specs for the title, which can be found on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3333990/Covenant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>. If this game is something you are interested in, you are able to wishlist this game now on Steam.</p>
<p>Much like many Soulslike or Metroidvanias, you will be able to play alone, as well as play with friends in co-op, if that is your preferred method for these types of games. There are also plenty of PvP opportunities, as you will be able to battle in 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 arenas.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this reveal?</p>

            <p>
Epic Games has announced a second major <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> mode, Brick Life, that's set to arrive within the main <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> game on 12th December. 
</p>
<p>
The arrival of Lego Fortnite Brick Life means the game's original Lego Fortnite mode, launched last December, is getting a slight rebranding - to Lego Fortnite Odyssey.
</p>
<p>
So, what is this new Brick Life offering? Well, it's described as a social experience set in an ever-evolving city where you can hang out with others, take on jobs (courier! professor! sushi chef! fortune teller! scoundrel!) and build a Lego home.

<p>
Lego components for your home will come from the Decor Bundles and Builds you've unlocked within Lego Fortnite so far.
</p>
<p>
There's lots new in the rebranded Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile. The mode's latest update, Storm Chasers, adds a fresh village to build up alongside new allies, and storms that strike until you defeat the Storm Dungeon at their centre. 
</p>
<p>
These dungeons - which will shift around the map - look to be an attempt at providing more of a different experience each day you play. Storm Dungeons will reform after 24 hours, as will the boss behind it all: the Storm King. 
</p>
<p>
I've always felt that, beyond village progression, Lego Fortnite lacks a proper end game. Now, similar to the Ender Dragon in Minecraft, the mode has a final boss you can work towards being powerful enough to defeat.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
Fresh vehicles in the update include an aquatic barge, new items include the healing Slurp Launcher, while NPCs can now revive you upon defeat.
</p>
<p>
Other welcome enhancements include melee attacks having increased range, stamina consumption being reduced, and another buff to your inventory size.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, we reported on leaks that suggested virtual popstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">Hatsune Miku was headed to Fortnite in 2025</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Deck13 and developer Umami Tiger have announced&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the first major story DLC for JRPG homage&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>. It's due to arrive sometime in the second quarter of next year.</p>

<p><em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will bring a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf (no, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production" rel="nofollow">not that one</a>), an anthropomorphic wolfman character who looks to be a close combat melee specialist.</p>

<p>It's not just the White Wolf, though;&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will also introduce new story segments to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, as well as new areas to explore, more than 40 new enemies and bosses to take on, and more equipment to collect, plus lots more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=qdSZ8wIM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-white-wolf.jpg?itok=4g1diigx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC will add a new playable character and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Story-wise, Umami Tiger (previously known simply as solo developer Matthias Linda) hasn't revealed too much about what you can expect, which is par for the course for a story-driven RPG.</p>

<p>However, we do know&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will take place just before the finale of&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, and that it'll involve a "new call for help" being sent to the Crimson Wings. Answering that call will lead to uncovering "more about the origin of the Order of Leonar and Lenne's past".</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have to play&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>in order to learn more. We don't have a release date for it yet, but the DLC is set to arrive sometime in Q2 next year, so you can likely expect it sometime around spring or summer.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, it's a throwback JRPG created by German solo dev Matthias Linda. The game features deliberately retro-style pixel art visuals, as well as turn-based combat and a story that revolves around multiple characters.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/chained-echoes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is set to launch in Q2 next year.

A year after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic"><em>Lego Fortnite</em> launched a new era inside of the game</a> — one based on the idea that <em>Fortnite</em> is a collection of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">many game experiences</a>, rather than just a battle royale — Lego is expanding its presence with a new title that sounds reminiscent of <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> roleplaying as well as a rebrand of its core survival game.</p><p>First up is a game called <em>Brick Life</em>, which is billed as “an all-new social roleplay experience.” Players explore a Lego-ified city location with 31 other people and can take on specific jobs like courier, security guard, or sushi chef. Players can design their own homes and explore locations like a magical school and rooftop club, and there are missions to take on as well. From the sounds of it, <em>Brick Life</em> is a more family-friendly take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">the enduring popularity of roleplaying servers in <em>GTA V</em></a>, and Epic isn’t being all that subtle about the connection:</p><p><em>Brick Life</em> is launching inside of <em>Fortnite</em> on December 12th, though it won’t be available for players in South Korea.</p><p>As part of the announcement, <em>Lego Fortnite</em> — the <em>Minecraft</em>-style survival experience that launched last December — is being renamed <em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>. From now on, “Lego Fortnite” will be the name of the hub inside of <em>Fortnite</em> that houses all of the Lego experiences. Epic and Lego have been steadily expanding their partnership over the last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun">launching new games</a> and also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106477/lego-fortnite-user-created-games-epic">letting <em>Fortnite</em> players build their own Lego games</a>.</p><div><p>The ongoing collaboration between Lego and <em>Fortnite</em> could provide a hint at what to expect from the upcoming “persistent universe” that Epic and Disney are making together, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24065281/disney-epic-games-investment-fortnite-metaverse">following a $1.5 billion investment from Disney in February</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">we’ve heard very little specifics</a> about what the virtual world might look like.</p></div><p>Meanwhile, Epic has also announced that <em>Fortnite</em> is getting support for a revamped version of text chat, which will be available as an option across all of its experiences starting on December 10th. There will be three kinds of text chat available: party channel for talking with your squad; game channel for a public conversation with people on the same island; and DMs with people on your friends list.</p><div><p>Epic says there will be two kinds of chat filters — one that removes personal information, and another that filters out “various kinds of mature language and toxicity” — which will be on by default for any players under the age of 13. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/16/23962354/epic-games-fortnite-report-voice-conversations">The feature will also include a reporting system similar to the voice reporting tool Epic launched last year</a>. Here’s an example of what text chats look like in the game:</p></div><div><p>All of these announcements come at a particularly busy time for <em>Fortnite</em>. The battle royale game is currently in the midst of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306403/fortnite-minus-one">a brand-new chapter</a> that kicked off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24288014/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-snoop-dogg-times-square-music">following an ambitious music-themed season</a>, and Epic also recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date">brought back the nostalgia-filled <em>Fortnite</em> OG as a permanent mode</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">Epic just announced “Ballistic,”</a> a multiplayer first-person shooter mode that launches inside of <em>Fortnite</em> on December 11th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-player-count-reaches-10-million-in-just-72-hours.1055718/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced that its online superhero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major player count milestone just a few days after its initial release.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>X account, the game has crossed the 10 million player mark already, which is particularly impressive given that the announcement was made almost exactly 72 hours after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' launch on Friday.</p>

<p>In the post, NetEase thanks "each and every one" of the people who have checked out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>so far and shares a special piece of artwork depicting some of the game's interpretations of classic Marvel characters like Wolverine, Hawkeye, and, uh, Squirrel Girl.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=1oOjPhrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=UlZJaAp8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>seems to have proven pretty popular among players.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting this player count doesn't necessarily translate to revenue for NetEase;&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is free-to-play, after all, and all of its heroes are unlocked for all players at the start of the game, although a battle pass is up for sale if you do want to shell out some real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, a quick look at <i>Marvel Rivals</i>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a> shows that the game still appears to be going pretty strong. Its 24-hour player count peak sits at 480,990 at time of writing, with 296,557 players currently playing the third-person hero shooter.</p>

<p>That's without taking into account player numbers on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Naturally, many of those 10 million players will have jumped in to check the game out and will have no intention of sticking around, but it's still safe to call&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>a success, I think.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a third-person multiplayer hero shooter created by NetEase Games.</p>

<p>Bearing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">more than a passing resemblance</a> to Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>sees teams of Marvel heroes and villains competing against one another to complete objectives like holding territory or escorting a moving object to its destination.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

That’s happening again today, as the Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1 launches, joining the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event and the Bulbasaur-themed Wonder Pick Event. And while it’s strange, it makes it a great time to pick up the game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Emblem Events are, in my opinion, the best of the current rotation of special challenges the mobile card game offers. They’re focused on battling other real-world players rather than the game’s mediocre AI, and with far better rewards than the standard for-the-hell-of-it battles that’ll only net you thimbles of XP. The current Venusaur Drop event against the CPU certainly gives you something to do, but go into it with a half-competent fire deck and you’ll have won all the good loot within half an hour. Emblem Events, named for the badge-like prizes rewarded that you can display on your profile, offer a tastier challenge against real people, with decks you don’t know in advance.</p><p>With <em>Pocket</em>’s signature bemusing lack of clarity, the new event is titled “Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1.” And if you’re thinking, “Hang on, I’m pretty sure that already happened,” then no, silly, you’re thinking of “Genetic Apex Emblem Event 1,” which took place in November. Don’t you look daft.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s New Venusaur Event Features The Most Beautiful Card</a></span></p><p>SP stands for...ummm...“consecutive wins”? Yeah, no, it doesn’t make a lick of sense. But that’s the goal here: winning multiple matches in a row, which is so much juicier than anything that’s come before. Last month’s version was just about accruing wins overall, but this is much tougher. <em>And</em> it’s also uncharacteristically generous in its first handful of prizes, awarded just for participation!</p><p>For playing once, whether you win or lose, you get three of the coveted Pack Hourglasses, then another three for playing three battles, and once you hit five matches, you get six more hourglasses! That’s enough for a whole new pack, just for playing five times. Then there’s another 12 for battling ten times! Two packs, just for goofing around in the event, is—pleasingly and also miserably—better than the challenge rewards you get for paying the $10 a month for the god-awful Premium Pass. (There’s also 150 Shinedust for winning three battles, but that’s <em>rubbish</em>.)</p><p>The gloat-worthy prizes are the emblems, with four on offer, each increasingly more grand than the last, awarded for winning from two to five battles in a row. So having that crowned picture on your profile comes with some earned bragging rights.</p><p>It’s a short event, only lasting seven days, so get cracking. And don’t forget to gather Bulbasaur and Magnemite cards in the current Wonder Pick Event, and all the promo cards dropped in the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event. Woo! This is <em>Pocket</em> at its best, I reckon, and it’s looking likely to go quiet again on all fronts in a week.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And who can forget God of War rip-off War Gods Zeus of Child, which appeared on the Xbox store back in 2022?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Grand Taking Ages VI, its appearance on the PlayStation Store is likely not long for this world. “In memory of those who didn't have a chance to live till this moment (and those who gave up waiting and bought a PS6 instead),” the description concludes. “PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6, meanwhile, launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in the fall of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">Scuf has announced a new Squid Game-themed version of its Instinct Pro wireless controller for Xbox and PC. The gamepad will launch for $240 on December 20, and fans can <a href="https://howl.link/3a0w69zwbvtnb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17335361778507?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder it now at Best Buy</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from the unique visual design, the rest of the controller matches the features of the standard Scuf Instinct Pro, including four rear remappable paddles and the ability to save and swap up to three mappings with the press of a button. The controller also offers interchangeable thumbstick styles--including a taller stick with a domed top--and Scuf's Instant Triggers (trigger locks). It supports Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Windows PC via wireless and wired connections.</p><p dir="ltr">At $240, the Squid Game Pink Guard Edition is just $10 more than the standard Instinct Pro, so if you're in the admittedly niche overlap of Squid Game fans looking for a pro-style controller for Xbox or PC--or you really like the color pink--this is a good option. That said, if the feature set caught your eye but you would prefer a different color option, you can grab the Scuf Instinct Pro for just $190 (was $230) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Instinct-Custom-Wireless-Performance-Controller-Mobile/dp/B0BB3CG33L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/osymo21vg5ee4?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17335363731871?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

It's available in Steel Grey, White/Gray, and White/Black color schemes.</p><p dir="ltr">The Scuf Instinct Pro is one of many pro-style controllers competing with Microsoft's Elite Series 2 Pro, our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/" data-ref-id="1100-6473486">best premium Xbox controller</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's worth noting that the Elite Series 2 is on sale for its best price of the year at multiple retailers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Right, let’s get this out of the way early, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind sadly isn’t very good. I know, I know, I’m as disappointed as you are as this felt like it would be the second coming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> just with Power Rangers – who are probably, maybe, just as awesome as our friendly neighbourhood heroes in a half-shell. A 2D side-scrolling beat ‘em up with retro arcade visuals and shoot ‘em up sections, I mean, what could go wrong? As it turns out, quite a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off though, in terms of what it <em>does</em> get right, Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind absolutely nails the aesthetic. The opening theme-music drips nostalgia and superbly sets the tone, giving you all of the retro feels. For people of a certain age, this is your childhood, but in 2024. Even better, the game itself has the sheen of a coin-up arcade screen overlaying the visuals, really cementing the sense of playing this game in your local arcade – you know, the one that no longer exists.</p>


<p>The chunky pixellated characters have a lot of charm, the Rangers themselves ninja flipping smoothly across the levels, whilst the never-ending horde of Putties you face are decent, if rather bland, punching bags. Thankfully, the look of the bosses is much more like it, correctly channelling the Saturday-morning TV shoddiness of the original much-loved Power Rangers series.</p>
<p>Smartly, the game is subdivided into a TV episode structure. Your team of Rangers face reams of goons, before battling a boss who, of course, runs off. You give chase in your Dinozord, blasting away in shooting sections that honour the almost-3D sequences of Sega’s classic game Afterburner. Then the boss gets biggified and your Dinozords combine to build the mech-like Megazord, resulting in a ginormous scrap.</p>


<p>Sadly, once you get to actually playing Power Rangers: Rita’s Revenge, things fall apart pretty quickly. Beat ‘em up sections are dull and pedestrian, with lacklustre collision detection proving a constant irritation. Think you’re lined up on the correct parallel plain to punch a Putty? Well, the game is pretty sure you are wrong, every time. Resulting in your Ranger unleashing a devastating flurry of fist-based pain on some innocent thin air.</p>
<p>Next to nothing of interesting or note happens across a level either; you pummel the same small selection of goons again and again and there are no weapons to pick-up or vehicles to control. Even local co-op fails to elevate proceedings, due to the Rangers themselves playing exactly the same. Sure, their disappointingly limited range of attacks look a bit different, but they have identical form and function. Unlike, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge you won’t find any levelling up or new attacks to unlock here, just the same paltry selection of attack combos, jumps and throws.</p>
<p>Even the ultimate attacks are basically just colour-pallet swaps; the lack of imagination here, considering the rich and varied source-material, is truly disheartening. Indeed, the only interesting occurrence as you walk from left to right is when a Putty comes out with a green time crystal that rewinds time – admittedly accompanied by neat VHS effects – until you destroy it. Though this one good idea is itself rewound and reused so many times that it is soon rendered dull.</p>

<p>Whilst the beat ‘em up section are serviceable but uninspired, the shoot ‘em-up sections are a mess. Visually incoherent with a smorgasbord of explosions and effects, it’s almost impossible to tell where your Dinozord is as it runs towards the horizon, let alone navigate all the obstacles and enemies heading your way. Unlike Afterburner, Outrun or other arcade titles from the era, these shoot ‘em up section fail to recreate any sense of depth, resulting in even more confusion as everything is given a flat appearance. Good luck trying to tell to how close a runaway truck is, as it supposedly careens its way into your path. Irritating and pointless, the shoot ‘em up levels of this game should have been made skippable.</p>
<p>Which just leaves the Megazord smackdowns, which, frankly, suck. Played from a first-person perspective, the players pass the controller and take it in turn to battle the villain of the week. Dodging attacks, finding an opening, punching the big baddy and charging up your sword is the format. It’s kind of interesting in your first encounter with Goldar, but the same boss-fight structure with a different character model is repeated ad-nauseum.</p>

<p>Controls here are loose and inexact, and the whole thing is frustrating and poorly conceived, with little sense of satisfaction if you emerge triumphant as your victory was likely more down to luck than any skill or intention. You know when players are choosing to skip their go, that this part of the game is a dud.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/itch-io-taken-offline-for-several-hours-over-bogus-funko-phishing-claim.1055676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie storefront Itch.io was taken offline for several hours earlier today owing to what the site's owner describes as a "bogus phishing report" for a fanmade page based on the Funko toy property.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Itch.io says its site was "taken down by Funko" due to "trash 'AI Powered' brand protection software called BrandShield", which flagged a page on the site as fraud, leading to domain registrar IWantMyName to "ignore" Itch.io's response, "just disabl[ing] the domain".</p>

<p>Over on YCombinator's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News portal</a>, Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran provides some additional context. He says that someone "made a fan page" for Funko video game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion</em>, and that page contained "links to the official site and screenshots of the game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=6hgGTbKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=MFg27tw3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A fan-made&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>Itch.io page is apparently what led to the site being shut down for several hours.</figcaption></figure><p>Corcoran speculates that the aforementioned BrandShield software is "probably instructed to eradicate all 'unauthorized' use of [Funko's] trademark", and so the software sent phishing and fraud reports to Itch.io's domain registrar.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he first received reports of the alerts from IWantMyName and host Linode "about 5 or 6 days ago", and that he had removed the offending page and disabled the associated account. The matter was settled with Linode fairly swiftly, while IWantMyName "never responded" to Corcoran's actions.</p>

<p>The Itch.io site owner says he's "assuming no-one on [IWantMyName's] end 'closed' the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days".</p>

<p>The whole debacle rather sounds like a series of automated systems being set off for circumstances they should probably never even have raised an eyebrow at, but at any rate, Itch.io is now back up, so there's that, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=nAKf0auw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=wwMs9_5I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran lays the blame for the site's outage squarely at "brand protection" suite BrandShield's door.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, several developers and industry figures have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/djlink.bsky.social/post/3lcuf4dlf2s2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Itch.io's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3lcuiisohfs2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">outage</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lcuf5bqfwc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disappointment</a> at Funko and BrandShield, which isn't hard to understand given that the outage meant many indie devs couldn't sell their products for a number of hours.</p>

<p>Given that Itch.io routinely raises quite a lot of money <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-ukraine-bundle-raises-63-million" rel="nofollow">for charity</a> -&nbsp; as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-black-friday-sale-gives-creators-all-revenue" rel="nofollow">developers themselves</a> - with its bundles and fundraising efforts, it's probably in Funko and BrandShield's best interests to make sure this doesn't happen again, assuming they are the ones at fault.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now available alongside today’s full launch of the game. It’s a big one for PC gamers, with the addition of path tracing (AKA full ray tracing) for NVidia GPUs, but there’s also bug fixes across the game.</p>
<p>Path tracing completely replaces the game’s lighting and reflections using the ray tracing tech built into Nvidia GPUs, where the fallback mode is a hybrid that includes ray traced global illumination and more traditional techniques for light, reflections, shadows and the like. It will be equivalent to the path tracing option that was patched in for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>… and it’s similarly expensive on the GPU, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/indiana-jones-and-the-giant-circle-minimum-specs-recommended-ultra-pc-requirements-4k-ray-tracing/">MachineGames recommending GeForce RTX 40 Series cards</a> and requiring the use of upscaling.</p>


<p>Speaking of which, the only upscaling techniques are currently Nvidia’s DLSS and a generic TAAU, but AMD FSR will be added in a future update. Oh, and a pesky dynamic resolution bug that affected us when playing with an AMD GPU has also been fixed by this update.</p>
<p>Out now across PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and via certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances. There’s a fun new story here as well, wrapped around its blend of exploration, puzzles and pugilism.”</p>

<p>Here’s the full patch notes:</p>

			<p>Bloodborne's emulation on PC is continuing to get improved almost daily, thanks to new updates to the ShadPS4 emulator and mods that improve the game's visuals to provide a truly remastered experience.</p>
<p>The latest work-in-progress build of the ShadPS4 emulator, version 0.4.1, addresses some of the issues that have been causing frequent crashing while playing the PlayStation 4 exclusive on PC, such as RAM usage spikes, and excessive VRAM usage, as reported in a new video shared by tabeneru on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>. The new version of the emulator seems to reduce VRAM usage considerably, so the game should now run better on a variety of system configurations.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 0.4.1 WIP - Bloodborne PC Huge Improvement (RAM SPIKE FIX &amp; VRAM USAGE REDUCED)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYN56lE-Fi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides general emulation improvements that are also benefiting the game, Bloodborne is getting improved by the hard work of modders. Today, a new version of the Enable Dynamic Shadow mod was released on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/160?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, further improving the dynamic shadows the mod introduces. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-visual-improvements-video/">fromsoftserve's remastering project</a> also does the same, this mod is being manually tuned for the best results. You can check out how much dynamic shadows improve the game's visuals in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Bloodborne is only one of the games that the ShadPS4 emulator can run reasonably well on PC. More information on the emulator that is making it possible to enjoy the popular PS4 exclusive at its best can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <p>The big question a Tekken player always wants to know is: which DLC character is coming next? Well, you'll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley's winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they've just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

<p>You see the helicopter chasing Nina Williams at 2:12? It has a lipsticky kiss mark on the missile, a nod to scrappy sister Anna Williams, the red roughhouser to Nina's purple pugilist. That puts Anna a good bet for the reveal, but who knows? It could all be a scarlet red herring. The developers are planning to reveal all on Thursday evening (that's the wee hours of Friday morning for us in the UK).</p>
<p>More concretely, the trailer promises new moves for every chracter, in case the hundred attacks of the average character aren't enough for you (I see my favourite coffee baroness Azucena performing a freshly brewed sweepy kick). There's also going to be a "major balance update", which for Tekken often means a lot of changes to frame data for various attacks across all characters. Finally, the trailer pumps up the Tekken World Tour - the annual fraternal fisticuffs that is often interesting but I most fondly remember for 	<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-tekken-player-in-the-world-is-a-panda">crowning a Panda as the globe's best bare-knuckle brawler</a>.</p><p>But that's all Season 2 stuff. Players will get the winter update before all that, and it is slightly less dramatic. It'll offer the gift of extra photo mode features, for example. This will let you add "wetness" and "grime" to fighters' faces (it's just what I always wanted!). You'll also soon be able to search for other players online by username. Extra slots for customised characters will get added early next year too, say the devs.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Iron Fist Tournament is pretty slick, as I judged in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>. But it's also missing the characters I love most (Lei, Miguel, Josie), which is ultimately why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> is the bruiser that got onto our list of the best games, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the RPS 100</a>. Anna, she's cool and all. But can she pretend to be drunk and roll around on the ground to freak out her opponent? No. </p>
