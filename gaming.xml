		<p>With the full game’s launch a little over a month away, Square Enix has released a free demo for Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven, a full 3D remake of the early 90s fan favourite. The demo is available now across PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch and Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven | TGS 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRWoyq8bozU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven demo will be a great opportunity to preview the work done to revive this game for modern audiences, giving players access to the beginning of the game. You’ll step into the shows of Emperor Leon as he and his second son, Prince Gerard, embark on the multi-generational story that runs through the game. The demo will build up to and conclude with the battle against Kzinssie, one of the Seven Heroes.</p>
<p>In a touch that’s always nice to see, you’ll be able to transfer any demo progress across to the full game.</p>
<p>The new trailer for Tokyo Game Show, meanwhile, showcases the fallen Seven Heroes and gives hints of their past. It also shows off two new classes, the&nbsp;Imperial Blacksmith and Dancer.</p>

<p>Romancing SaGa 2, the fifth game in the SaGa series when including the Final Fantasy Legend trilogy, originally launched in 1993 for the Super Famicom, building on the nonlinear narrative structure of the previous game. The game was previously remastered in its original form back in 2016, but this remake – coming from the team behind the 2020 Trials of Mana remake – will bring a lot of more modern flourishes to the classic adventure.</p>
<p>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven launch is set for 24th October 2024.</p>

			<p>Torn Banner Studios, the masterminds behind Chivalry 2 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-resurfaces-3-5-years-later-early-access-launch-slated-for-halloween/">the upcoming</a> No More Room in Hell 2, has announced that the eight-player, co-op horror will be launching in early access on October 22. Those interested in the game can purchase it for $29.99 on both Steam and the Epic Games Store. So far, No More Room in Hell 2 has over 750,000 wishlists on both Steam and the Epic Games Store, with there being an outpouring of support from the community as well as new players being enticed after the unveiling at Summer Games Fest and Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>No More Room in Hell 2 is a sequel to the 2011 award-winning Source mod, with players starting in an isolated, dark environment, where they have to meet up with their friends and try to survive in a never-ending zombie apocalypse. As you progress, you'll be able to get your hands on powerful weapons, such as assault rifles and explosives. Much like a roguelike, if you die, the character's progress is lost altogether, meaning there are choices to be made in order to succeed.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F62dQidOOJM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This upcoming title is powered by Unreal Engine 5, with veterans at Torn Banner Studios working in conjunction with Lever Games, the original creator of the franchise. Lever Games has now been fully acquired by Torn Banner Studios and is integrated fully into their team to help make No More Room in Hell 2 a terrifying experience for all horror fans.</p>
<p>In No More Room in Hell 2, players will get to explore a massive replayable map. It's not stated yet whether there will be more maps added in the future, but for now, players will be able to utilize proximity voice chat to try and find each other in the zombie apocalypse. When you first start out in the game, you start with only a beer bottle, and have to work your way up to obtaining powerful weapons.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.nmrih2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, why they are going into early access rather than a full release at a later date is discussed. "Releasing the game through Early Access will allow us to open the game's production and growth so our community of players can join us in the journey! More than bringing players in, we want a community who are willing to give us constructive feedback."</p>
<p>The title is expected to remain in Early Access for at least a year, with the possibility of that being extended should the title need more work.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-metaphor-refantazio-f1-team-partnership-was-not-on-my-bingo-card.985608/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-f1-team-partnership<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Of all the partnerships Atlus could have pursued as part of its&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>promotion, an F1 team was not on my bingo card, but it looks like I'll have to add another space.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>is teaming up with the MoneyGram Haas F1 team ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, which takes place this weekend.</p>
<p>The game's logo will apparently "adorn the top nose" of cars driven by F1 racers&nbsp;Nico Hülkenberg and Kevin Magnussen, and each car will feature a slightly different design. I'm betting a lot of folks watching that race won't have a clue what they're looking at.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-f1-team-partnership-gameplay.jpg?itok=Alye0-mO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metaphor-refantazio-f1-team-partnership-gameplay.jpg?itok=6fkT5i4h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't know about you, but when I see a screenshot like this, I think F1.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the press release,&nbsp;Hülkenberg’s car will bear a logo featuring Hulkenberg (that's a character from the game and not the driver in question, believe it or not), while Magnussen's car will feature the game's protagonist.</p>
<p>Atlus marketing director Irvin Ducournau says that since "overcoming fear and anxiety" is one of&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>'s central themes, teaming up with two drivers who are "known for defying the impossible" makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Additionally, he says that teaming up with MoneyGram Haas makes sense because the game's "competitive election mechanic" is essentially a "race for victory". Well, he talks a good game, I'll give him that.</p>
<p>For his part, meanwhile, MoneyGram Haas marketing director Mark Morrell says that&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>is "filled with all the speed, suspense and excitement you would expect from a Grand Prix weekend".</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, it's a JRPG developed by Studio Zero, a company formed by&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>staffers Katsura Hashino, Shigenori Soejima, and Shoji Meguro, which would probably explain why it looks like a&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>game despite not being one.</p>
<p>The game takes place <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-reveals-new-details-about-story-and-characters-screenshots-and">across the real world</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaophor-refantazio-screenshots-details"> and a medieval fantasy world</a> that acts as its mirror, and you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-reveals-new-details-about-story-and-characters-screenshots-and">play as a character</a> who must lift a curse placed on the medieval realm's prince.</p>
<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-release-date">on October 11th</a>.

        <blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>As fledgling curators, you have the task of designing and refining your very own museums to create the ultimate guest experience. Coordinate Experts on far-flung expeditions to discover new Exhibits, generating Buzz to entice droves of knowledge-hungry guests who will expect top info-tainment if they’re to leave impressed. This is all while you keep your Exhibits safe, rooms clean, staff happy… and children off the dinosaur bones.</p><p><strong>Exploring for Exhibits</strong></p><p>As Curator, the design and management of your expanding museum is in your hands! Send your team of partially trained Experts on Expeditions in search of rare and mostly well-preserved artefacts. When (and hopefully not if) your Experts return from their <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,762 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>, proudly display their fantastic finds in your museum.</p><p>You’ll unlock new locations as you decide where the next adventure takes you, and complete a sticker book to document your journey as a souvenir of your discoveries.</p><p>Your work doesn’t end there; Exhibit maintenance is crucial. While some Experts are gallivanting across Two Point County and beyond, you’re in charge of managing staff back home to ensure Exhibits and the museum stay in tip-top condition. If taking care of the carnivorous Chomper isn’t enough, there are also meddling thieves to watch out for. Thieves, and more frequently, children, are known for touching and grubbing up the displays, so make sure enough security is guarding your prized collection!</p><p><strong>Design-osaurs</strong></p><p>Get creative to design your museum layout your way! You have decorative freedom, so design thematic areas to guide your guests’ visit. Splash paint and lay carpet as you lovingly arrange each prehistoric fern, potentially melting iceman, and dinosaur remains wherever you see fit.</p><p>Once you’ve created the perfect atmosphere, arrange guided tours with custom routes led by a charismatic Expert. Tours are a fantastic way to enrich your guests’ experience. To keep guests enthused, showcase Exhibits with the highest Buzz—those that are top quality, provide ample info and beautiful decorations are likely to attract the most donations!</p><p><strong>Guest-ertainment</strong></p><p>Guests know best! The different types of guests who will frequent your museum may have different interests, but they do have some things in common… they expect the place to be kept clean, have plenty of refreshments, ample toilets, and a gift shop filled with goodies. And, of course, they need to be dazzled with knowledge of your Exhibits, which are kept well-maintained… or else you could make them sick.</p><p>Two Point County will bring a variety of guests to your museum, and they all hope to discover their new favorite Exhibit… From dino fanatics and botany buffs to haunted horror seekers, you’ll need to cater to their personal preferences to meet their needs. By exceeding their expectations, you can keep them engaged, leading to longer visits, increased donations, and glowing reviews!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <p>The new owners of mobile game revival Flappy Bird have released a statement to "clear the air" on their intentions, but are yet to acknowledge claims it's based on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>If you missed it, last week the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-makes-a-return-this-year-thanks-to-dedicated-fans">Flappy Bird Foundation announced the game's return</a> as it had newly acquired the official rights.</p>
<p>Afterwards, original creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-birds-original-creator-does-not-support-its-revival">Dong Nguyen stated he had nothing to do with the revival</a>. "I did not sell anything," he wrote on social media. "I also don't support crypto."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-dev-is-removing-popular-app-for-some-reason">Nguyen pulled the original game from sale in 2014</a> despite it generating a reported $50,000 a day in advertising revenue. His reasoning, he said at the time, was the game had "become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything. <br>I also don't support crypto.</p>— Dong Nguyen (@dongatory) <a href="https://twitter.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>With the reveal of the game's revival, the Flappy Bird Foundation - a team of self-proclaimed fans who claimed they were "committed to sharing the game with the world" - stated it had acquired the official rights from Gametech Holdings, as well as the rights to Piou Piou vs Cactus - a mobile game long credited as the inspiration behind Flappy Bird.</p>
<p>Now the group has doubled down on this statement.</p>
<p>"The Flappy Bird Foundation is a team of passionate fans of the Flappy Bird game published in 2013," it wrote. "After the game was pulled from stores in 2014, like many others, we found ourselves unable to stop thinking about the game. The Flappy Bird trademark and brand was abandoned following the game's takedown. Wanting to revive the game, we filed an application for the trademark and set out to bring the Flappy Bird game back to the community."</p>
<p>It added, in fine print, that The United States Patent and Trademark Office granted Mobile Media Partners Inc. the Flappy Bird trademark registration in 2018. This was acquired by Gametech Holdings in 2021, before the Flappy Bird Foundation acquired the trademark in August 2024.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We’ve seen questions circulating online and we’re here to provide the Flappy Bird community with all the answers.</p><p>Let’s clear the air we’re currently flying through ⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/fdtjfcZBn6">pic.twitter.com/fdtjfcZBn6</a></p></div>— Flappy Bird (@flappy_bird) <a href="https://twitter.com/flappy_bird/status/1836525841037087127?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>Kek, the developer of Piou Piou vs. Cactus (and now a core founding member of the foundation), added: "I love that through the Flappy Bird Foundation we are able to breathe new life into the games I built and inspired. It's incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate."</p>
<p>However, there's no mention of cryptocurrency in this new statement.</p>
<p>Michael Roberts, the chief creative behind the Flappy Bird revival, is the Head of Studio at 1208 Productions (according to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelrrobertrs/">LinkedIn</a>), a mobile game developer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240320044417/https://1208productions.com/">previously described on its website</a> as "a pioneer in the Web 3 space". Projects have included multiple <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFT</a>-based games (thanks <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/how-crypto-bros-wrested-flappy-bird-from-its-creator/">ArsTechnica</a>).</p>
<p>Then there's an <a href="https://x.com/MichaelRRoberts/status/1835670559134556656">article acknowledged by Roberts on Blockchain Reporter</a>, which states Flappy Bird's return "takes a boost from strategic collaborations with chief names in the Web3 sector". What's more, the game's first season on Telegram gives players "the chance to take part in a free-of-cost mining event".</p>
<p>Flappy Bird will return this autumn, with dedicated mobile apps on iOS and Android due next year. Yet fans have been left confused about the true intentions of its new owners.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hands-on-ps5-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ask any Dragon Ball Z fan in the mid-00s who the strongest fighter is, and you'll probably hear a million different answers. If you ask them instead to name the best Dragon Ball game, it would almost certainly be a unanimous call for Budokai Tenkaichi 3. In all of the years since the PS2 release, there hasn't quite been a fighting game featuring Goku that's captured that high (although <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-playstation-5-and-xbox-series-versions-announced-will-include-rollback-netcode/">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> certainly came close). As the 40th anniversary of Dragon Ball as a whole is rapidly approaching, Bandai Namco has revived the fighting tournament with the first new title to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Budokai spinoff series specifically. Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO aims to revive the trash-talking of the late 2000s and have fans decide just who the strongest Saiyan really is.</p>
<p>The rise of Goku from spunky youth to family man to the strongest gold/blue/red-haired fighter in the universe is a tale that's been told innumerable times across both games and anime alike, but Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO hopes to keep that tale on the lips of Akira Toriyama fans once more through the abundance of story modes that go beyond just throwing a few punches back and forth.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO offers a few different story modes depending on where in the Dragon Ball Z timeline you're interested in revisiting, starting with Goku's first encounter with Nappa and Vegeta and beyond. While the story initially focuses on Goku, additional stories unlock, including Frieza and a few other familiar faces. These fights appear to branch off in different paths, based on win/lose conditions and other hidden criteria that might need a couple of extra playthroughs to get the full story or at least some secret unlockables.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/custom-battle_scene-edit-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If all you're looking for is an excuse to match fists with faces, Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO features a wide array of buffet options depending on your hunger for battle. If you're itching for a tournament, that's readily available to the player. If you want something more customizable, you can create unique scenarios that feel ripped straight from a VHS copy of the Namek Saga. The tools are there to come up with everything from intro cards based off the original anime to unique combat scenarios and win conditions. There are a few preset options to play with out of the box, but the real experience will be getting to connect to other players and trying out what custom scenarios they've come up with.</p>
<p>Nearly the entire roster of Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO was playable in our preview, leaving little surprises to know what's to come and how they may be unlocked. Like any good Budokai fan, I wanted to focus on collecting a full set of Dragon Balls to make a wish and perhaps unlock another character in the roster. Sadly, I came up one short because I didn't have the time to beat down enough invaders during Goku's story mode and thus couldn't make a wish, perhaps for another character to add to the roster of already 180+ (I did make an effort to make a personal entreaty with the game's producer to include the Power Level 5 farmer with a shotgun in their possible DLC plans).</p>
<p>No matter who you pick to back in Sparking! ZERO, they'll have a few tricks up their sleeve when it comes to melee combat. There's a lot going on at once onscreen and that's not including the various explosions and ki blasts being flung around. Players will have to manage not only their HP and Ki Gauges but also a separate skill and transformation system that will lead to the more flashy and devastating mechanics. The Ki Gauge remains the single most important tool in a Saiyan's belt. Without it, you're stuck standing around or throwing weak punches, but with it, you can launch Ki blasts from halfway across the map, evasive and speedy movements, and, of course, the signature superattacks for each character.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/custom-battle_bonus-battle-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There's a delicate balance to meter management and true to the source material, many fights will feature moments of either player standing stationary and charging up their Ki Gauge when safely out of harm's way. In a way, this mechanic could be considered the most important callback to the source material. Beyond managing your precious resources, combat in Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is relatively simple in practice with its limited inputs and attacks per character but being able to chain them together and create some flashy combos is where the real excitement is. The other crucial mechanic this title takes its namesake from is the Sparking! Mode where abilities get powered up to peak performance for a short time and that's where the real damage will come in.</p>
<p>While my time with the folks at Bandai Namco and their preview event was brief, I walked away feeling quite confident that this new development team understands what made Budokai Tenkaichi 3 such a dorm room staple growing up. Akira Toriyama's legacy will live on in this storied fighting game franchise in the most appropriate way possible: another World Martial Arts Tournament.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1790600/DRAGON_BALL_Sparking_ZERO/">Steam</a>) starting October 10th, 2024, or three days early on the 7th if you pre-purchase the Deluxe or Ultimate Editions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-of-war-ragnarok-finally-lets-you-tone-down-puzzle-hints-on-pc.985563/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>lands on PC today, and it looks like Sony has been listening to some of the feedback from players over the last couple of years, as the PC version will finally let you shut your companions up during puzzles...for a while.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/18/god-of-war-ragnarok-brings-a-host-of-new-features-to-pc-available-tomorrow/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>, one of the new features you can expect from&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>on PC is a new option in the Settings tab that will "reduce the frequency with which you hear puzzle hints from your companions".</p>
<p>Given how straightforward many of&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s puzzles were, this feels like a very welcome change indeed. If you're a PS5 player and you feel left out, don't worry; Sony says this change, along with others, is "soon to be added to the console version".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints-winch.jpg?itok=urb3s2zH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-puzzle-hints-winch.jpg?itok=DaEJ4eDR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"I am figuring out this puzzle by myself, boy. Please be silent."</figcaption></figure><p>Two other new features are also being introduced in&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>'s PC version. The first, Cinematic Audio Description, is an accessibility feature that plays "audio descriptions of visual events during cinematics".</p>
<p>If you're a streamer, you'll appreciate the other new feature, which consists of custom&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok</em>-themed alerts you can use for your stream. They feature Kratos, Atreus, Thor, and Fenrir.</p>
<p>Sony is also handing out some&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>wallpapers and social media banners to commemorate the launch of the PC version. You can grab the&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>Fan Kit, as Sony is calling it, <a href="https://sms.playstation.com/stories/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-fan-kit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>is the followup to the 2018&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>reboot, and as the title suggests, it sees Kratos and his son Atreus attempting to deal with the impending arrival of the titular apocalyptic scenario.</p>
<p>The game was released on PlayStation consoles in 2022, garnering critical acclaim (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation">not least from us</a>) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies">selling 11 million copies</a> into the bargain.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>on PC when it launches <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnarok/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Steam</a> later today (as long as you've got <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements">the machine to run it</a>), and it's also available on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts is celebrating its 5-year anniversary today, September 19, 2024. Below, we examine how it feels to revisit the game and its soundtrack time and time again.</em></p><p dir="ltr">The more time passes, the more nostalgic I grow for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sayonara-wild-hearts-review-falling-star/1900-6417325/">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a>. The "pop album video game" by developer Simogo--known for the likes of Year Walk and 2024's moody <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-a-mastery-of-illusions/1900-6418228/">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a>--is an atemporal arcade cabinet. The structure of bite-sized levels, paired with a steep scoring system engulfed me back in 2019 and hasn't let go since. The presentation is encouraging enough to return to it sporadically. Five years later, however, I'm still surprised by how the experience gains more significance with each revisit.</p><p dir="ltr">Sayonara Wild Hearts is one of the few games that have remained installed on my PC since launch. At first, I'd hand-pick one or two levels whenever I had some downtime for a quick play session of something other than a roguelike. Over time, it became my go-to escape to clear my head or wind down after a long week. Sometimes I play it from start to finish, which can be done in about an hour. But even when I'm not, I always finish the session playing the last two stages, resulting in a euphoric gut punch.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of the allure, I believe, is that each level has a unique spin that doesn't require a massive effort to enjoy--something that Simogo painstakingly <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/paring-down-the-elegant-control-scheme-of-i-sayonara-wild-hearts-i-" rel="nofollow ">iterated on</a> during development. You only need to control the main character's movement and use a single action button to perform attacks, dodges, or snap your fingers. Across the span of 20 minutes, you fight against a three-headed mecha wolf, drive a sports car on a dreamy highway, and play a shoot-'em-up inside somebody's VR headset.</p><p dir="ltr">At the heart of everything, it's the emotions that these sequences evoke, paired with the soundtrack and overarching story about a woman going through a heartbreak, that stuck with me. I've memorized which member of the Dancing Devils I'm facing during each verse of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZtqSafbIuQ">Begin Again</a>." I could tell you when the needle drop of "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0taSGlREf5c">A Place I Don't Know</a>" will occur with the sound off. I know which songs to resort to if I'm looking to be soothed by melancholy or if I need to be uplifted.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="795404903" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

The first time I revisited Sayonara Wild Hearts on New Year's Eve of 2019, now a yearly tradition, I was <a href="https://intothespine.com/2019/12/31/begin-again/" rel="nofollow ">getting over the breakup</a> of a three-year-long relationship. Doing so last week in preparation for this piece, I kept looking back on my personal growth, ready to reflect on and share the experiences I've had with dating since. But that same evening, my replay session gained unexpected significance yet again.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire team of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher of not only Sayonara Wild Hearts but dozens of other titles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resigns-from-the-company-report/1100-6526463/">collectively resigned</a>. As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, this was the result of internal disagreements over the future of the division, which included a failed deal that would have spun out the gaming section as a standalone company. Annapurna Interactive's president Nathan Gary, as well as division co-heads Nathan Vella and Deborah Mars, and the rest of the staff left the company.</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement, Annapurna founder Megan Ellison said that supporting "developer and publishing partners during this transition" is a "top priority." A spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/annapurnas-entire-gaming-team-has-resigned" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a> that the company plans to continue its existing contracts while replacing departed staff. In the following days, a few developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/13/24243824/good-news-from-annapurna-developers" rel="nofollow ">shared updates</a> on their projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-stanley-parable-dev-reveals-upcoming-cozy-turned-dark-game-wanderstop/1100-6524050/">Wanderstop</a>, Mixtape, and We Kill Monsters, reassuring that partnerships remain in place.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, Simogo is yet to issue a statement about its plans. The team announced a <a href="https://simogo.com/2020/03/10/simogo-annapurna-interactive-the-future/" rel="nofollow ">publishing deal</a> with Annapurna in 2020, which entailed "future Simogo projects" for the foreseeable future. Back then, Simogo was working on "Project Fuzzy Optics," AKA Lorelei and the Laser Eyes. Now, aside from there being no plans of releasing Sayonara Wild Hearts on iOS or macOS separately after it was delisted from Apple Arcade on August 15th, what awaits in the future is uncertain. Even as the publisher attempts to reassure the public that the Interactive team will be rebuilt, so to speak, the people who made this partnership and countless others happen under a joint vision won't be a part of it.</p><p dir="ltr">It's no overstatement to say that Simogo's work was one of Annapurna's recognizable staples. In a way, Sayonara's collection of different experiences co-existing in tandem mirrors the publisher's diverse games selection, with the likes of If Found…, Outer Wilds, Kentucky Route Zero, What Remains of Edith Finch, Neon White, and many others under the same umbrella.</p><p dir="ltr">As the soundtrack's lyrics constantly allude to, Sayonara Wild Hearts places importance on the fragments we leave behind. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45-rI25B6jk">Fading Memories</a> cassette tape will remain a historic recollection of demos and unused tracks from the composers and musicians behind it. Games like Open Roads, Florence, and Wattam are fragments of a sour side to Annapurna, after a 2022 investigation by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDPzZkx0cPs">People Make Games</a> alleged that the company was aware but didn't act more decisively on reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/emotional-abuse-at-indie-studios-undermines-the-importance-of-auteurs" rel="nofollow ">toxic work environments</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Simogo has always excelled in doing something different with each new project. Any lessons learned along the way aren't used to inform sequels but inspire sometimes polar-opposite aesthetics and ideas. It's hard to predict what the studio's next game will look and play like--as much as it's hard to know what sort of new significance a revisit of Sayonara Wild Hearts will take.</p><p dir="ltr">Next time, I might ignore the collectible in the middle of the road in "Doki Doki Rush" and take a side path instead-just to see what's in there. Perhaps I won't even look at my previous score and choose solely to enjoy the music. No matter how many months or years pass, a story about a person going through a heartbreak will always be easy to relate to, and even more so one that encourages us to reflect on the passage of time--to reflect on how, no matter how many years pass, there's always a chance to begin again.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a> likely won't be able to live up expectations from fans, according to Bethesda veteran Bruce Nesmith, who was the lead designer on The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Nesmith, who left Bethesda after Microsoft bought the company, said in an interview that it will be "almost impossible" for The Elder Scrolls VI to live up the hype.</p><p>The issue, Nesmith believes, is that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls series is held in such a high regard thanks to a number of critical and commercial successes over the years. Bethesda's history of making great games is a "blessing and a curse," Nesmith told <a href="https://youtu.be/IA5HhtGdZMo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kiwi Talkz</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/skyrim-lead-designer-says-it-will-be-almost-impossible-for-elder-scrolls-6-to-meet-fan-expectations-marketing-departments-just-put-their-heads-in-their-hands-and-weep/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>.</p><p>"Elder Scrolls 6 is undoubtedly going to be an amazing game, but it's going to be compared to all the previous games that Bethesda made," Nesmith said. "The fans who want to buy Elder Scrolls 6, their expectation is going to be almost impossible to meet. And marketing departments just put their heads in their hands and weep at this. Because it's like, 'Okay, if it isn't perfect, it doesn't get a 95-plus on Metacritic, we're a failure.'"</p><p>Bethesda isn't the only company facing this kind of champagne problem, Nesmith said, pointing to Larian Studios as an example. The company released one of the most highly regarded RPGs in a long time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and following that up with something similarly great will be a tall task, he said.</p><p>"What are the expectations going to be on that studio's next project? Larian was not a studio that was uppermost on everybody's mind, didn't fall off the lips of the vast majority of people buying video games ... They weren't what everybody considered to be a top-tier publisher. Well, guess what? They are now. They're on the map now, and that means the expectations are sky high for them," he said.</p><p>Nesmith is known for being outspoken following his departure from Bethesda. Prior to this, he said Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6 so early--back in 2018--because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-announced-elder-scrolls-6-so-early-because-fans-came-with-pitchforks-bruce-nesmith-says/1100-6518603/" data-ref-id="1100-6518603">fans were coming with pitchforks</a>. But announcing so early comes with its own set of issues, he said. "Those companies that start touting their games years ahead of time? Actually, they screw themselves."</p><p>For The Elder Scrolls 6, many assumed the early announcement was in part to assure fans that the game was coming and to help recruit staff to work on the project (and the same logic could apply to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/" data-ref-id="1100-6504615">early reveal of Fallout 5</a>). In 2023, Bethesda boss Todd Howard said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">often wonders if it was the right thing to announce The Elder Scrolls 6 so early</a>. "I have asked myself that a lot," he said. "I don't know. I probably would've announced it more casually."</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said the platforms for The Elder Scrolls VI are not yet decided, in part <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-doesnt-have-confirmed-platforms-yet-is-5-plus-years-away/1100-6515460/" data-ref-id="1100-6515460">because the game's release is so far off.</a></p><p>"With Elder Scrolls VI, it's so far out--it's hard to understand what platforms will even be at this point," Spencer said in 2023. "It's the same team that's finishing Starfield, which [came out in September 2023]. So we're talking about a game that's like five-plus years away."</p><p>Microsoft is working on new Xbox hardware, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-console-generation-may-start-in-2028-xbox-court-docs-say/1100-6515423/" data-ref-id="1100-6515423">next console generation could begin in 2028</a>, so it's possible that The Elder Scrolls VI shows up on whatever the next Xbox turns out to be.</p><p>The Elder Scrolls VI is in development at Bethesda Game Studios, the same team that made Starfield. That game's first expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfields-shattered-space-expansion-launches-this-month-features-handcrafted-locations-and-new-enemies/1100-6526512/" data-ref-id="1100-6526512">Shattered Space</a>, launches on September 30.</p>

            <p>Krafton's acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> studio Tango Gameworks was motivated by the desire to maintain its legacy, rather than actually make money.</p>
<p>Krafton boss Changhan 'CH' Kim spoke to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-krafton-ceo-says-tango-gameworks-acquisition-is-about-legacy">Game Developer</a> about the "last minute deal" after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">studio was closed by Microsoft</a> alongside Arkane Austin and Alpha Dog Games back in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">Tango was acquired by Krafton last month</a>, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-acquisition-will-transfer-around-50-out-of-original-100-staff">only 50 out of the original 100 staff will transfer over</a>.</p>

<p>"We wanted to maintain their legacy," said Kim. "Although they did not have a big success in their games, we saw many creatives worth pursuing. That's why we wanted to work with that organisation."</p>
<p>Kim also confirmed Krafton has acquired the IP rights to Hi-Fi Rush, because "fans really want to see sequels", but the deal does not include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-evil-within">The Evil Within</a> or Ghostwire Tokyo.</p>
<p>"If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated," he said. "We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially Hi-Fi Rush. When I think about our fans, I think what they really care about is Hi-Fi Rush sequels."</p>
<p>Kim also discussed the transfer of staff and how the studio will now rescale.</p>
<p>"I think a minimum of 100 people [is what we're aiming for]. We have to scale it to around that size. That's a minimum requirement to continue developing the franchise. Or perhaps they'll need a bigger team. We haven't decided on that, but we don't plan to reduce the size of the team at all," said Kim. "They have to work on new projects as well, so there is a great possibility the team will scale up even further."</p>
<p>However, the CEO doesn't actually expect a Hi-Fi Rush sequel to make money.</p>
<p>"We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank," he said. "But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying [to develop games] in the spirit of challenge-taking.</p>
<p>"Tango Gameworks are creative. They want to try something new, and we want to do more of that. [Making] video games is really a hit or miss industry, and that is risk taking. But having more project lineups is actually a way to mitigate risk, because one of them might work out."</p>
<p>As such, Kim believes game corporations shouldn't unrealistically aspire to constant hits, but should "break even" while nurturing creativity.</p>
<p>"The big hit shouldn't be your goal," said Kim. "If you think about it that way, Hi-Fi Rush might have brought in a little bit of a minus in terms of the financials, but it's a team that should be encouraged to create something new and continue their journey. We want to have more teams like that under our umbrella."</p>
<p>It seems, then, a sequel for Hi-Fi Rush is on the cards for Krafton, which is good news for fans of the game.</p>
<p>Even Tango Gameworks founder (and Resident Evil creator) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shinji-mikami-thought-tango-gameworks-would-be-safe-from-closure-if-it-made-more-hi-fi-rush-games">Shinji Mikami thought the studio would be safe from closure</a> "as long as they continued to make Hi-Fi Rush games".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/">Tango Gameworks</a> being shut down after the huge success of Hi-Fi Rush came as a massive shock to a lot of people, and it was a shame to see such a powerful studio be erased. However, Tango Gameworks was then saved by Krafton, who acquired the studio from Microsoft in a "last-minute deal." By acquiring the Japanese studio, they also got the rights to the Hi-Fi Rush franchise. CEO Chang Han 'CH' Kim spoke about their choice to acquire the studio, saying it was creatively motivated rather than commercially.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-krafton-ceo-says-tango-gameworks-acquisition-is-about-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with Game Developer</a>, Kim says Krafton wanted to acquire the studio and "as many people as possible from Tango to continue their legacy " after Microsoft shuttered it in May. Krafton is most well known for developing PUBG, but it also wanted to acquire Tango Gameworks due to its love for Hi-Fi Rush and wanted to be able to develop sequels.</p>
<p>"Because Hi-Fi Rush fans really want to see sequels, we negotiated with Tango Gameworks' parent company to acquire that IP as well." Krafton also pushed for the deal to go through as fast as possible, as Tango Gameworks employees were left feeling anxious as the studio was shut down so suddenly. Because the move felt time-sensitive to Krafton, they consciously decided to purchase the Hi-Fi Rush franchise exclusively instead of Tango's entire IP collection, which also included The Evil Within and Ghostwire Tokyo.</p>
<p>"If we were to acquire all IPs, I think it's going to complicate the deal too much. Krafton is a pretty big company, but Microsoft is very complicated. We wanted to help the team continue developing their games, but especially Hi-Fi Rush."</p>
<p>Although Krafton has been trying to hurry the process, the acquisition is still being finalized, which means they cannot disclose how much they spent on acquiring Tango Gameworks. <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1823815934458650940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game File reports</a> that Krafton has brought over 50 employees from Tango Gameworks, representing roughly half of the development team at Microsoft. Kim states that they are aiming for a minimum of 100 people and want to scale the studio up and even expand in the future.</p>
<p>"We can't acquire Tango Gameworks based on their financials or their numbers, right? We don't think Hi-Fi Rush 2 is going to make us money, to be frank. But it's part of our attempt. We have to keep trying in the spirit of challenge-taking."</p>
<p>Even though Krafton seems unsure whether Hi-Fi Rush will be a financial success, they want to continue to acquire more studios in need, much like Tango Gameworks. This is so they can increase their portfolio lineup and create innovative rather than derivative titles.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-to-let-pc-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-of-war-ragnarok-to-let-pc-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints.985506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-to-let-pc-players-reduce-intrusive-puzzle-hints/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>God of War Ragnarok officially releases on PC today, two years after its release on console. While the game was well received by both critics and the general population, one of the biggest gripes was how invasive the puzzle hints were. This is something that was also similar in the first game but wasn't as bad as it is in God of War Ragnarok. With the release of the title on PC, players will be able to reduce the frequency of puzzle hints from companions in the gameplay settings.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarök - Launch Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nBwxyqq1ON4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it's nice that there is an option to receive hints in the game, it was commented on frequently as a form of criticism once the game was released. You'd walk into a room and see a puzzle and would already be given hints before you had a chance to really investigate what was going on. There was the "Puzzle Timing" setting in the accessibility options, which gave players more time for timed puzzles, but there was nothing in the settings to reduce the hints.</p>
<p>At the time, the only solution was to turn the volume down and make sure the subtitles were off so that the puzzles weren't immediately spoiled and given away. With the release of God of War Ragnarok on PC, Sony Santa Monica has released a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/18/god-of-war-ragnarok-brings-a-host-of-new-features-to-pc-available-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detailed blog post</a> about the new features that were arriving in the game on PC and would also be implemented into the console version of the game in the future.</p>
<p>New accessibility features will also be coming to both PC and console, including Cinematic Audio Description. This provides contextual information during cutscenes alongside the dialogue for those who may need a refresher. As a 'thank-you' to the players who have supported them, they've also added some free animated Twitch alerts that streamers can use to showcase the games or their love for the franchise during their streams.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. To install and play the game, players must have at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">190 GB free on their PC</a>. Additionally, it has launched with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-to-boost-performance-in-god-of-war-ragnarok-final-fantasy-xvi-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-and-enotria-the-last-song/">DLSS 3 support from NVIDIA</a>, allowing players to get a smoother experience if they have an RTX graphics card.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla will be included in the purchase of the game, as it was a free DLC created for the title in 2023.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-krafton-ceo-says-tango-gameworks-acquisition-is-about-legacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Game Developer</a>, Kim says that&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em>potentially not being profitable is "part of our attempt", and that Krafton has to keep trying to make games "in the spirit of challenge-taking".</p>
<p>He describes <em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks as "creative", saying that the studio wants "to try something new" and that Krafton wants "to do more of that". Kim says developing games is about taking risks, but that having more project lineups "mitigate[s] risk, because one of them might work out".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-combat-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=OP_H7S0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-combat-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=UaIDp-nU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hi-Fi Rush 2&nbsp;</em>likely won't be profitable, Krafton says, but that's A-OK.</figcaption></figure><p>Kim goes on to say that while he doesn't know how much&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>made for Microsoft (even though Aaron Greenberg <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-was-break-out-hit-for-microsoft-according-to-aaron-greenberg">described it as a "break out hit"</a>), "the IP itself was very fresh", featuring "new types of gameplay".</p>
<p>For Kim, it sounds like that's the more important element here; that&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>was "not a game a lot of studios were making". He says Krafton shouldn't be aiming to deliver what Game Developer refers to as an "infinite procession of chart-topping hits".</p>
<p>Instead, remarkably, Kim says Krafton should be looking to "break even" and "recoup the production costs". He says he doesn't "trust people" who say a game is going to be a hit; rather, he wants "someone who can try something new".</p>
<p>I can only speak for myself, but Kim's comments fill me with a mixture of elation and suspicion. It's incredibly refreshing to hear an exec talk like this in the modern era, which, in turn, makes me wonder what the catch might be. Hopefully, there isn't one!</p>

Can it be?</figcaption></figure><p>If you need reminding,&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>developer Tango Gameworks was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">ostensibly shut down</a> by former parent company Microsoft earlier this year, along with&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>studio Arkane Austin. Incidentally, Xbox followed this by saying publicly that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">needed "smaller games" on its slate</a>. Good optics!</p>
<p>All seemed lost for Tango and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, but in August,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion">swept in and purchased Tango Gameworks</a>, along with the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP, declaring plans to have Tango create more&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>works in the future.</p>
<p>Given Krafton's comments about&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em>, it seems a sequel to the smash hit rhythm-action game is an inevitability.

            <p>Rather sheepishly, I must admit that my own experience with Armenian art begins and ends with System Of A Down.

<p>According to the creators, the game lets you “play as Prince Areg through mystical realms to awaken a celestial bird and restore harmony, blending ancient myth with enchanting music by Tigran Hamasyan, stunning visuals by illustrator Khoren Matevosyan and director Ruben Van Leer.”</p>
<p>"It was a huge task to create a style that would work across vinyl, books, and computer games,” says artist Koren Matevosyan of the project. “The style we chose represents a time period where you can't tell if it's the future or the past. If you look closely, you can find electronic elements, suggesting a time when the future becomes the past.”</p>
<p>"The game reimagines an ancient Armenian legend seeking to preserve and share Armenia’s rich cultural heritage, which is at risk of being forgotten, with younger generations," said the nice email that arrived in our inbox.</p>

<p>The game director for Kingdom Hearts 4, Nomura Tetsuya, has stated that this instalment has been made “with the intention” of heading to the conclusion of the series.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://youngjump.jp/yj45_interview/02/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Young Jump</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1836427263614816332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">aitaikimochi</a> on X), Nomura Tetsuya discussed how he envisions Kingdom Hearts 4 and Missing Link as fresh titles rather than sequels. Tetsuya stated that he “wanted to kind of reset the story” after Kingdom Hearts 3, which is why the team brought on new writers and revamped the logo, making it easier for newcomers to join the series.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>When asked about Kingdom Hearts 4, Tetsuya Nomura mentioned that he plans to retire in a few years. Fans are curious whether his retirement will come before the conclusion of the Kingdom Hearts series. However, he clarified that Kingdom Hearts 4 is a game intended to eventually move toward that conclusion.</p>



<p>Talking about <a href="https://x.com/aitaikimochi/status/1836430742106313034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">resetting the story</a> for Kingdom Hearts 4, Tetsuya stated, “For those who know how KH3 ends, the reason why Sora ends up like that in the ending is because we wanted to reset the story in a way” This decision has made it easier for newcomers to join the stories directly from KH4. Testuya concluded by stating that fans who have been playing the KH series will feel “Oh, it’s like this” when starting the new game, but this will allow the new players to enjoy the experience, too.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket.985491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With the influx of digital card games gaining popularity over the years, it’s unsurprising to see a new one pop up here and there. With that said, seeing Pokemon releasing a new digital card game with Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket has had some fans confused – including myself. With the existence of Pokemon Trading Card Game Live, the crossover is quite apparent, but the team at The Pokemon Company and Creatures have a different goal in mind for this new game. From what I’ve seen so far, Pocket is less about the competitive meta of the physical Pokemon trading card game and more about the collecting aspect of the beautiful cards fans know and love – and that’s not such a bad thing. </p><p>After a brief presentation, I was given a phone with Pocket installed and played with it for about two hours. Much of the early parts are similar to many mobile games. This includes completing tutorials to better understand the menus, in-game currency, and the gameplay loop for both opening packs and battles. It can be daunting learning all these new menus and currencies, but it’s not too out of the norm regarding mobile or Gacha games. As you level up through various tasks, other parts of Pocket become available and you accrue more free goodies to get your card collection rolling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>First and foremost, the focus of PTCGP is indeed the card-collecting aspect. Keita Hirobe, who is the Executive Corporate Officer at The Pokemon Company, mentioned to me in a video call that one of the goals of this new digital card game is to have players “focus on the fun of opening packs and collecting cards” and eventually get to know the card game. A lot of the commitment to playing any physical card game is the cost of getting cards and the experience of playing matches often, which are large barriers of entry. So being able to just land on Pocket’s home page and see a big button to open up a free pack is an easy way to get into the Pokemon TCG world. From picking a booster to sliding your finger across the  top to slice it open, all the feelings of opening a pack and seeing what you get are all there. If you come upon a very rare card in your pack, the music changes and the card does a little twirl showing off the digital card effects. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the coolest experiences of the event was seeing someone pull an immersive card and everyone crowding around to see the full card effect.</p></div><p>Currently, the first set consists of over 200 cards, and this particular set has three booster pack versions representing Pikachu, Mewtwo, and Charizard. The versions matter because certain cards will be unique to a specific booster pack version. For instance, if I choose to only open up the Pikachu booster pack, I have a chance at pulling the Pikachu immersive card, which brings the player into the card in a cool little cinematic tour of the card’s art. One of the coolest experiences of the event was seeing someone pull an immersive card and everyone crowding around to see the full card effect. It was very reminiscent of being a kid and everyone showing off their foil Pokemon cards to each other or when someone pulls a rare full art card in draft with friends. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket Cards</h3></div></output><p>That’s not the rarest card in the game though, as I quickly learned through Pocket’s pity system, Pack Points. For those that don’t know, a gacha game’s pity system allows players to guarantee a particular character or item if they have failed to pull it through normal means. If you gain enough Pack Points through opening packs in Pokemon TCG Pocket, you can use those points to create any card you want for your collection or maybe your deck. I found out that the highest rarity so far are crown rarity cards, which are gold full-art cards. These crown cards cost a whopping 2500 pack points, so players have to commit to saving if they want to guarantee one of those cards. Another interesting option for getting cards is the Wonder Pick. Players can get one card at random from a booster pack that was opened by another player. These players’ packs also rotate, so it’s yet another incentive to check into Pocket daily. After pulling any sweet-looking cards, Pocket has options to show them off in a binder or display board as part of your profile. The personalization options are very similar to Pokemon TCG Live like swapping out your coins, sleeves, and playmats, but there is a new option to add custom animation to the cards, similar to what Marvel Snap does. These custom animations, or flairs, can be made using Shinedust, a currency accrued by converting duplicate cards. Otherwise, getting new cards to fill out your card dex seems to be a wait-and-see approach.</p><p>When it comes to getting booster packs, you have various opportunities to do so, but the main free-to-play option is checking in for your free booster every 12 hours. Players can accumulate two free packs this way at most, so you have to open them up as often as you can. With that said, there is an in-game currency called Pack Hourglass that helps reduce the refresh time of your next booster pack, which can be attained through normal play. If you run out of these for any reason, Poke Gold or the real money currency covers the rest. In my demo, I could fake purchase Poke Gold, which I then used to rip open packs to see what I could get. Five hundred gold at $99.99 was the highest available option in the store so I spammed that a few times for the sake of seeing if I could pull a rare immersive card unique to Pocket. In addition to opening one pack at a time, you have the option to open ten in one go if you choose to hoard your pack hourglasses or use 60 Poke gold. For me, I ripped open about 50-80 packs before I ran into my first immersive card. It felt like I opened up fewer packs before I eventually got my second immersive card. Pocket does show the pull rates of cards, with some of the rarest having a 5% chance of being pulled. In the end, it’s a lot of luck, which is not a fun factor to base your primary gameplay loop on.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On the other hand, one feature that I finally got a chance to see more in-depth is the battle system for Pokemon TCG Pocket. Unlike the physical Pokemon TCG, Pocket has simplified the TCG rules to keep gameplay swift. It focuses on teaching you the basics of the Pokemon TCG without the complexity of some meta cards or routes of play. For instance, instead of six prize cards, the player who gets 3 points or defeats 3 points worth of Pokemon first wins. Another departure is that a deck is only 20 cards vs the normal 60-card deck, so decking out is not a losing condition here. There are also no energy cards to bloat the deck. Instead, energy is automatically generated giving players the chance to always add one energy to any of their Pokemon once a turn. If you plan to use multiple types of energy, the max is three types and energy is randomly generated in battle. Among those changes, the cards themselves have also been altered for this format. It’s not easy to one-shot Pokemon and even Poke Abilities and Trainer cards have reduced effects. For instance, a trainer can draw you two cards, but in the core physical game, you usually discard your hand and draw seven. All these changes can effectively shorten a normal game, but there’s still room for matches to go a little longer, with each player given 20 minutes to make moves in PvP. I honestly don’t see matches ever going to time, but I thought it was interesting that there was room for such lengthy games. </p><p>Being a fan of competitive card games both digitally and physically, I was excited to check this out. At a certain point, I do see folks who ultimately want to lean into the Pokemon TCG switch over to the Live digital game or play the physical card game. But that just leaves Pokemon TCG Pocket to mainly be a card-collecting destination, and maybe that’s all it needs to be. Pokemon Go already sees a similar collecting behavior with their players, so this is just a card version of that. So as someone who has recently revisited the Pokemon TCG meta, especially with the recent Worlds Championship, I’m looking forward to checking out more of Pocket later in the year. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tetsuya-nomura-kingdom-hearts-retirement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>creator Tetsuya Nomura has declared that he's yet to decide whether he'll finish the long-running series prior to his retirement, so it's entirely possible future&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>games could be released without Nomura's involvement.</p>
<p>In an interview with YoungJump (for which we're using machine translation), Nomura says he "only [has] a few years left until [he retires]", and so he has to "decide whether to retire first or finish the series first".</p>
<p>He goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-announced">announced all the way back in April 2022</a>, will be "a story that will be completed". It's not entirely clear whether Nomura means that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4&nbsp;</em>won't end on a cliffhanger or that it will conclude the series as a whole.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-tetsuya-nomura.jpg?itok=7mqm--gI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-4-quadratum-tetsuya-nomura.jpg?itok=tS9yi4hW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts 4&nbsp;</em>is being made with the intention of being a "complete" story, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, Nomura says that he intends the upcoming game, as well as smartphone title&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>, to be a "reset".</p>
<p>Nomura says he wanted a reset after&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em>, so he "<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-4-adds-akiko-ishibashi-probably-coming-to-ue5">appointed new writers</a> and even made a new logo" so that new players who weren't familiar with the series would find it easier to play&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>.</p>
<p>He also gives some insight into his creative process with regards to the series as a whole, saying that although he's "had the idea of going in this direction" (i.e. the overall series direction) since&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, but that if "something doesn't fit, I'll improvise on the spot".</p>
<p>According to Nomura, he also has documents pertaining to elements of the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series that haven't been explored or explained, and he "keeps that a secret". That would honestly explain a lot.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts 4&nbsp;</em>still doesn't have a release date yet, unfortunately. Stay tuned for more info on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts</em>-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/19/24223570/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hits-ios-and-android-october-30th"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></a><em> </em>was first teased a few months back, it looked like yet another mobile app meant to capitalize on the physical card game’s <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hunting-for-pokemon-cards-has-become-a-different-kind-o-1846622862">recent wave of unexpected popularity</a>. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/3/23709584/pokemon-trading-card-game-live-release-june"><em>Pokémon TCG Live</em></a><em> </em>already on the market, it was hard to suss out how The Pokémon Company envisioned <em>Pocket </em>fitting into the larger franchise. And while titles like <em>Marvel Snap </em>and <em>Hearthstone </em>have proven to be big hits, it wasn’t clear that <em>Pocket </em>would be able to appeal to newcomers and hardcore <em>Pokémon</em> fans alike.</p><p>We’re still a few weeks out from <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s general release. But during the hands-on time I recently spent testing the game out, it felt like a promising — if slightly daunting — attempt at reinventing the classic card collecting experience for a new generation of budding pokemaniacs. The battles are quicker, flashier, and clearly designed to be picked up with relative ease as you fill up digital binders with immaterial cards that look like the real thing.&nbsp;</p><p>At times, the game’s emphasis on making its virtual cards look and feel real makes it seem like The Pokémon Company’s foray into the NFT space. The big difference here, though, is that you can actually <em>do </em>stuff with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s collectibles besides staring at them on your phone.</p><p>At its core, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is a game focused on giving people a new way of collecting cards, showing them off, and using them to battle other players in fast-paced matches. For free, players can log on every day to receive two booster packs containing five cards apiece and then show them off in customizable digital binders or specialized display boards. Like the physical card game, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s cards differ in rarity (indicated by a new diamond and star rarity system) and feature a range of increasingly elaborate illustrations from a variety of artists.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than relying on different physical textures or holographic foil to convey a card’s value, though, <em>Pokémon TCG </em>introduces a number of new 3D effects to make rare pulls pop. <em>Genetic Apex </em>— the first expansion players will be able to access at launch&nbsp;— features over 200 cards, many of which reuse art from previously released physical sets. But the pulls most players will likely be keen on hunting for are the new immersive cards, which allow you to essentially dive into their art in order to see details that wouldn’t normally be visible.</p><p>Because collecting (rather than battling) is what initially draws a lot of people to the physical card game, Creatures Inc. and game developer DeNa wanted that to be the game’s main selling point, particularly for folks who haven’t been tapped into the franchise for a while.</p><p>“There’s a kind of a wide audience out there of people who, in general, maybe aren’t interacting with Pokemon cards right now,” Creatures creative director Ryo Tsujikawa explained during a Q&amp;A session. “That’s what we were thinking about with [<em>Pocket</em>] being in a game / app form — that we would be able to reach a wider audience including people who might have played when they were younger.”</p><p>Though <em>Pocket </em>shares a number of similarities with <em>Pokémon TCG Live </em>— another mobile game where users can redeem codes from physical packs to receive digital copies — the idea for an app focused entirely on digital cards began coming into focus right around the time <em>Pokémon Go </em>was first released. Executive corporate officer Keita Hirobe said that making the game more approachable and keeping its barrier to entry low were two of The Pokémon Company’s biggest priorities during development. And for those simply looking for a casual way to dip a toe into the <em>Pokémon </em>waters, it can be as simple as opening the app and seeing what the RNG has in store.</p><p>Ripping into a pack by sliding your finger across its top edge is actually a pretty satisfying experience, accompanied by a soft rumble intended to replicate the feel of tearing into a packet of foil stuffed with shiny bits of cardboard. The packs themselves (which aren’t guaranteed to contain rare cards like their physical counterparts) can be flipped over before you open them, giving you the choice of revealing the last (rarest) card first. And while you can reveal the cards one by one to build suspense, the game also allows you to tilt them while they’re still stacked in order to sneak a peek at their borders, which are one of the indicators of a card’s rarity.</p><p>Even though <em>Pocket </em>will give players two packs a day (one every 12 hours) for free, folks coming from the physical card game where booster packs contain 10 randomized cards may balk at the mobile pack’s five — a number that may change in the future. But for those looking to fill out their card-dexes more quickly, the game will also offer players the option to purchase Poké Gold — an in-game currency that can be used to buy more packs or reduce the countdown timer between receiving your free packs for the day. Bundles of Poké Gold start at 99 cents. Additionally, there will be an optional monthly Premium Pass $9.99 subscription that grants players a free third daily pack and access to promotional cards.</p><p>Though Poké Gold and subscription sales sound like key components to The Pokémon Company’s plan for <em>Pocket</em>’s profitability, from what I’ve seen, there’s still quite a bit available to players who don’t spend. You can start learning the basics of the game’s new streamlined battle system using premade Rental Decks and fighting against computer opponents. And once you have enough cards of your own, you can start building customized decks to use against other players in the game’s online mode.&nbsp;</p><p>Whereas the traditional <em>Pokémon TCG </em>involves two people facing off with decks consisting of 60 cards each, <em>Pocket </em>streamlines things by making decks much smaller and simplifying battle mechanics in order to keep things moving at a brisk pace. Damage is now automatically calculated by the game’s computer, and the first player to earn three points by knocking out their opponent’s pokémon (regular pokémon count for one point while EX monsters count for two) wins.</p><p>Though Tsujikawa stressed that <em>Pocket</em>’s development team is mainly focusing on the game’s collection aspect at launch, they understand that more competitive play is something users may be interested in as new expansions are introduced. There are no concrete plans just yet for <em>Pocket </em>to become a new fixture at the Pokémon World Championships, but it’s not hard to imagine the app fitting in right alongside <em>Pokémon Go </em>and the physical card game.</p><p>That could be necessary for giving the game some longevity once the initial lure of pure collecting wears off. And when <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> launches on October 30th, that might be enough to make the app a hit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
