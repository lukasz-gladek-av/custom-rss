			<p>Hello Games is back today with a new No Man's Sky update called RELICS. As you might assume from its title, this patch introduces a way for players to become palaeontologists. They'll be able to excavate the skeletal remains of alien creatures that once inhabited the various worlds. As they discover new bones, players can then assemble them according to their own designs. They can even create their own museums or share their collections with other players.</p>
<p>There is a huge variety of procedurally generated prehistoric bones of all shapes and sizes to excavate and collect. It's up to the No Man's Sky community to assemble them, and the studio reckons fans will have a lot of fun creating increasingly outrageous skeletons to display in their bases-turned-museums or share with other players.</p>
<p>The relics out there to be discovered vary in rarity, so you never know what you're going to unearth. There's a real thrill when you find something really rare. The most unusual finds are worth a lot, too, and for those looking to complete the collection, Hello Games introduced a specialist to barter with at the Space Station.</p>
<p>A new RELICS themed community expedition will be launched soon, focusing on palaeontology and challenging players to compete for the rarest finds. This expedition also unlocks an exclusive living fossil companion, which was described as a loyal, fleshless creature of animated bone.</p>
<p>That said, it won't be just a simple matter of collecting old bones. Sometimes, there might even be dangerous creatures guarding some of these treasures, such as Stone Spirits, the Stone Golem, and the skeletal Titan Worm.</p>

<p>Hello Games then said the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/massive-update-releases-for-no-mans-sky-adding-new-storyline-deep-sea-diving-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Worlds Part II</a> update saw No Man's Sky spike to some of its highest player figures at this time of the year. Overall, the game continues to improve and expand at a steady rate. Meanwhile, the community's sentiment grows ever stronger, as evidenced by the fact that its user reviews <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-finally-reaches-very-positive-overall-user-review-rating-on-steam-8-years-after-disastrous-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are finally 'Very Positive'</a> on average after years in the Mostly Negative and Mixed ranges.</p>

According to a report in <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/">Ars Technica</a></em>, Blizzard made the pronouncement in response to a string of DDoS attacks that seemed specifically targeted to cause the in-game deaths of members of a high-profile raiding guild.</p><p>Hardcode mode was introduced with <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em>. It’s a super intense, extremely difficult style of play where a character’s death is permanent no matter how it comes — whether it be falling in a mythic difficulty dungeon, getting ganked in PvP, or simply getting overrun by level 1 boars — is permanent. In regular <em>WoW</em>, characters can come back from or cheat death with a variety of mechanics which are disabled in Hardcore. The game mode has other adjustments, like requiring players to manually set their PvP flag, that Blizzard made to make the mode slightly less punishing.</p><p>Until now, there were no exceptions to the policy even in situations outside of a player’s control such as a death suffered during disconnection from the game server. And it seems like malicious actors were exploiting that strict policy to cause the deaths of members of a popular streaming guild OnlyFangs. According to <em>Ars Technica</em>, DDoS attacks seemed to coincide with the guild’s raiding attempts causing the permadeath of several members. The attacks were so frequent that soadapoppin, a popular Twitch streamer and OnlyFangs’ member, suggested that the guild might need to shutter operations indefinitely unless some kind of protections were put in place.</p><p>Blizzard addressed the issue on the <em>World of Warcraft</em> forums saying that it is aware of the targeted nature of the DDoS attacks and are taking steps to rollback some player deaths</p><p>“We’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks,” wrote <em>WoW Classic</em> associate production director Clay Stone. “In the future, Blizzard may elect — at our sole discretion — to revive Hardcore characters that perish in a mass event which we deem inconsistent with the integrity of the game, such as a DDoS attack.”</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But now we’re getting a long, drawn-out cast announcement confirming which MCU heroes will be facing off against Doctor Doom next year.</p><p>The stream is lingering on shots of director’s chairs featuring different actors’ names on them. The first one was Thor actor <strong>Chris Hemsworth</strong>, who was last seen in <em>Thor: Love and Thunder </em>in 2022. After several minutes of hanging out on his chair, the camera panned right to reveal a chair with <strong>Vanessa Kirby’s</strong> name printed on it. Kirby is playing Sue “Invisible Woman” Storm in <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps, </em>which will premiere on July 25. However, she was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/07/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-marvel-comic-con-1236021939/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already confirmed for the film last year</a></span>, so that’s not new. Third up is <strong>Anthony Mackie</strong>, the new Captain America, who just starred in <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> in February. Fourth revealed is <strong>Sebastian Stan</strong>, who plays the Winter Soldier, and will star in <em>Thunderbolts* </em>on May 2. Next is <strong>Letitia Wright</strong>, who plays Shuri, the new Black Panther who took on the title in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s all we’ve seen thus far.

            <p>The director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a>, Choi Ji-won, tried <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>'s network test and found it "refreshing", so while Lies of P remains a single-player game he's open to other ideas in future projects.</p>
<p>Lies of P is firmly inspired by FromSoftware's Souls games, but as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">Nightreign shifts into a multiplayer experience</a>, I wanted to ask Choi about developments in the genre when I spoke with him at the Game Developers Conference (GDC).</p>
<p>"I've tried [Nightreign] and it was very refreshing and new," he said. "So that obviously gave me the impression that they're good developers, they always push their boundaries, their imagination and vision, and it shows. In turn, that for some reason motivated me to deliver the Overture experience as good as it could be."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-prequel-dlc-revealed-named-overture">Overture is the forthcoming expansion to Lies of P</a>, revealed at Sony's State of Play last month. While it remains a single-player game, Choi is open to the idea of a multiplayer game in the future.</p>
<p>"Our primary focus from the concept of this game was to deliver a high quality, premium action game that is single-player," said Choi. "There were a lot of learnings for us [from the base game] and we did our best to reflect those improvements. The expansion is the completion of that.</p>
<p>"In terms of our future endeavours, we are definitely open to any sort of consideration in the future."</p>
<p>How, then, could the Soulslike genre grow and develop in future? "That's something we discussed internally quite a bit," said Choi. "Instead of trying to predict how the Soulslike genre is going to be in the future, what we are focusing on is to really find our own colour and the points of attraction. And by crafting our own game to better meet and satisfy the customers' demand, we believe that we will build trust and credibility with our fans.</p>
<p>"In the future, instead of pegging us into a certain genre, we want the fans to look at us and actually know what sort of unique components that we deliver that they look forward to. So they see our next work as a sort of projection of our trust and characters that we are building moving forward."</p>
<p>This differed a little from when I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fret-not-puppet-fans-lies-of-p-has-fixed-its-dodge">spoke to Choi previously at Gamescom</a>, where he stated the development team "wanted a challenge and to make the best game of that genre" as it competed with FromSoftware.</p>
<p>"I'm a big gamer, I play a lot of different games," said Choi at GDC. "And from [the release of Lies of P] until now, we've seen many wonderful games coming up into the market. That was a fantastic array of experiences I had where I developed further respect for those wonderful games. That became a very important pivotal point for my perspective.</p>
<p>"So instead of that goal [of competing with FromSoftware], it's actually our goal to develop our own unique experience. Instead of setting a goal to make a better game than some of the games out there, we want to continue making games our fans will continue to love."</p>

<p>In the announcement of Overture, <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1889811726478266637">Choi compared the game to a "director's cut" of a film</a>. He told me it's really a "developers' cut" as it's a "collaborative process" with the entire team. Moreover, it's providing a complete experience along with the base game.</p>
<p>"We never really saw the development of Overture as a separate entity," said Choi. "With the base game and the expansion together, we believe that the whole entire thing delivers the game of Lies of P as how it was supposed to be experienced. We just couldn't do that earlier on."</p>
<p>Choi confirmed to me the Overture expansion will be accessible seamlessly from around chapter nine of the base game, so is integrated into the narrative rather than separated. Not only will it elaborate on story hints already present in the game, it will expand on the diversity of weaponry used in combat - the trailer, for instance, features a bow and some nasty looking claws.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Lies-of-P_-Overture---Announcement-Trailer-1-3-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The bow is a new weapon for this expansion | <span>Image credit: <cite>Neowiz</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Beyond that, Choi was keen to avoid potential spoilers, but noted the expansion has allowed the developers to incorporate story elements they weren't able to in the base game as they focused on delivering a high quality release.</p>
<p>What, though, about difficulty? FromSoftware typically develops DLC that raises the challenge level of its games - will Lies of P follow suit?</p>
<p>"We wanted to really make the content accessible and enjoyable to the veterans of the game, as well as new users," said Choi. "So we made a game that satisfies both segments of customers. Our prioritisation is more focused on the overall game experience."</p>
<p>Lies of P has proven a big success for developer Round8 Studios and publisher Neowiz, selling a million copies less than a month after release and frequently considered one of the best games in the genre not created by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>Though we're yet to go hands-on, Overture is shaping up to offer a complete Lies of P experience that will surely appease fans of the base game when it's released later this summer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/26/theres-a-surprise-nintendo-direct-tomorrow-27th-march-thats-all-about-switch-and-not-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re just a week away from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/a-nintendo-direct-and-in-person-events-for-switch-2-are-coming-in-april/">the big Nintendo Direct Switch 2 reveal</a> on 2nd April, but Nintendo has decided to host <em>another</em> Nintendo Direct this week. Tomorrow, in fact. There’s around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch, but the company explicitly states, “<span>There will be no updates about Nintendo Switch 2 during this presentation.”</span></p>
<p>It’s broadcasting on 27th March at 2PM UK time – that’s 7AM PDT, 10AM EDT, 2PM GMT, 3PM CET, since we’re in that funny period where the US is already on daylight savings.</p>


<p>And you can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct 3.27.2025 – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9OqoRxXUjGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What kind of games will be shown tomorrow? Well, Nintendo just say that they’re upcoming titles, so it’s not specifically a first party stream, or an indie-focussed one, and so we could see a wide mix of new announcements and updates on existing projects from third parties. We’d expect Nintendo to be keeping their cards close to their vest, considering that Switch 2 will be the big talking point next week, though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/nintendo-finally-confirms-switch-2-backward-compatibility/">everything will also be playable with a Nintendo Switch 2 via backward compatibility</a>.</p>

<p>After literally years of rumours and build up, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-announcement/">the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> finally arrived back in January. It was a pretty abstract and brief look at the console hardware, showing lots of points of comparison for how the design has changed compared to the original Switch. It showed the added USB-C port on the top of the console, the new kick stand design, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>But the real highlight was the tease of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/">Mario Kart 9</a>, and we expect to see a lot more of that next week during the Nintendo Direct, in addition to seeing some more first party games, and details on pricing and release date. That’s all leading into a string of hands-on preview events around the world through April and May, and we can’t wait to go hands on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/636243/metaphor-refantazio-ui-menu-interview-koji-ise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Video game menus tend to fade into the background — but that’s not the case with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a></em>. Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"><em>Persona</em> games before it</a>, the fantasy RPG has an interface that’s slick, aggressive, and certainly not the kind of thing you’ll forget. And according to lead interface designer Koji Ise, the intent was to create menus that matched and enhanced what players were feeling at any given moment. “As long as we’re able to identify ‘at this point the player should be feeling this,’ we’re able to match our UI and animations to act as emotional accelerators,” he says.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em> is developed by Atlus, and it’s a spiritual successor of sorts to the <em>Persona</em> series. Both are turn-based RPGs, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262346/metaphor-refantazio-katsura-hashino-interview-persona"><em>Metaphor</em> shifts the setting from modern-day Japan to a new fantasy realm</a>. That turn-based nature means the menus are integral to the experience. You don’t skip past them to get to the action; they <em>are</em> the action. Since <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/2/24058364/persona-3-reload-review-xbox-ps5-steam">Persona 3</a></em>, the franchise has become highly regarded for its stylized menus, and that’s something Ise wanted to continue with <em>Metaphor</em>, though it was actually his first experience working in video games.</p><p>“Before this I used to work on website designs, and mainly used Flash to make various animations,” he explains. “It allowed us to make very interactive animations, which maybe you don’t see as much anymore. I thought that my forte with creating interactive animations would serve me well working with Atlus in trying to create UI there.”</p><p>The starting point was purely visual. Ise knew he wanted to create something intrinsically fantasy to match the game’s setting. Early designs included one made with parchment paper and another that tried to emulate the anxiety the lead character experiences throughout the story. “We started from ground zero,” Ise says, noting that he didn’t initially look at a game like <em>Persona 5</em> as a starting place. Here are a few of the early concepts:</p><p>But as game development continued, and <em>Metaphor</em>’s features became finalized, things shifted to the more functional aspects of the interface design. This is where the <em>Persona</em> connection came in. “As we were firming up the specification, there were certain elements from <em>Persona</em> that we decided to carry over,” he says.</p><p>The biggest challenge, according to Ise, was adding the emotional element. As an example, since combat can be very difficult in <em>Metaphor</em>, he wanted to heighten the feeling of speed and aggression with the menu design. “When players are smashing away at an enemy, we assume that emotions are running high and they’re experiencing exhilaration,” Ise explains. “Your life hangs in the balance with every fight. So we wanted to make sure that came across within the UI.” Nailing those feelings involved working closely with the other teams at Atlus.</p><p>Similarly challenging was balancing Ise’s vision for the visual style with the practical concerns of crafting a UI for a video game. “There were times in the development process when it seemed a little too lopsided on the aesthetic side of things, and there was feedback from the team that it went a little overboard or was too hard to understand,” Ise says. “So we try to strike that balance without killing the design or the visuals. Because if we lean in too much towards the functional side of things that would take away what makes us Atlus.”</p><p>All of this requires a great deal of work in terms of design, iteration, and coordination. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24262357/persona-metaphor-menu-design">As <em>Metaphor</em> and <em>Persona</em> director Katsura Hashino told me last year</a>, building these menus “is actually really annoying to do” because of all that time and effort. Ise agrees, saying “it was a lot of trouble.” But he notes that “we wanted to make sure that the menu became the face of the title, something where the design would be unforgettable for players.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since the launch of November 2024's set, Surging Sparks, the popularity of the 30-year-old collectible card game exploded, which in turn drew the attention of scalpers, which has rendered the products almost impossible to buy ever since.

With fan favorites like the pairing of Giovanni and Mewtwo, it’s going to make the already impossible situation <em>so</em> much worse, and the release of pre-orders for the set this week saw the Pokémon Center websites inaccessible for a day, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-destined-rivals-launch-ran-into-the-same-old-issues-with-scalpers-shortages-and-outages" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scalpers yet again scooping up everything before real customers could</a></span>. </p><p>But perhaps Journey Together could offer at least a moment of respite over the next two months? Because, despite featuring its own significant return of a long-lost aspect to the TCG, it’s such a bland, anticlimactic collection of cards that it should at least temper the feverish demand.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-recommend-id="image://b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Iono's Kilowattrel card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Iono's Kilowattrel card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-recommend-id="image://b5627816c96514fc04dbe5a9d359111a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Iono's Kilowattrel card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Journey Together brings back the concept of “Trainer’s Pokémon,” something first introduced in 2000's Gym Heroes expansion and not seen since 2004's EX Team Magma vs Team Aqua. These are cards on which Pokémon are identified as belonging to a specific named trainer, and which have specific abilities and interact in unique ways with various Tool, Trainer and Stadium cards. Bringing them back to the <em>TCG</em> 21 years later is an interesting mechanical shift, and one that makes sense given <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">the Scarlet &amp; Violet era of the card game is running a year longer than is normal</a></span>.</p><p>The four trainers in Journey Together are favorites N (<em>Black &amp; White</em>), Lillie (<em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>), and Hop (<em>Sword &amp; Shield</em>), joined by the most popular trainer from <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em>, online influencer Iono. So everything’s in place for a very appealing set of cards, and very importantly, with big changes for the table-top game. It’s just...where are the special art cards?!</p><figure id="" data-id="7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-recommend-id="image://7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hop's Zacian ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hop's Zacian ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-recommend-id="image://7974d2f53f814d939c0461de8ef8640a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hop's Zacian ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, I recognize the inherent contradiction here. I both want the game to be available for players to buy, while also lamenting the lack of collectible cards in the set. I want to believe the latter could improve the former, but caught as this set is between the impossibly popular (and still unavailable <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">despite promises from The Pokémon Company International</a></span>) Prismatic Evolutions and the forthcoming Destined Rivals, it’s hard to be optimistic. And given people will be paying ludicrous prices if they want to be able to get hold of any (I’m not just talking about paying resellers, which you shouldn’t—independent and online stores will also have to mark up prices to cover their own increased costs), it’d be nice if they at least had a chance of picking up something pretty.</p><p>But, having opened 50 packs (very kindly provided to us by Pokémon), I have very little positive to report.</p><p>Pull rates are, in my admittedly too-small sample, horrible. The worst I’ve experienced in the already extremely ungenerous <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> era. From 50 packs I managed seven basic ex cards (now so commonplace that they’re essentially considered bulk), and only <em>five</em> rare cards. That’s <em>dismal. </em>But it’s also not especially surprising, given just how few there were to pull. Journey Together has only 31 “secret cards” in the set, compared to the 61 in Surging Sparks and 59 in Twilight Masquerade, and it’s even lower than the previously disappointing 33 in Stellar Crown. Plus, despite there being some absolutely beautiful artworks in there (Lycanroc, N’s Reshiram, Noibat and Wailord really stand out), most are bizarrely dull. Obviously Iono’s Bellibolt ex Special Illustration Rare is going to fetch a hefty price, but it’s not a particularly attractive card. Compared to the extraordinary wealth of intricate art included in Prismatic Evolution, it feels weirdly despondent.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-recommend-id="image://a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Wailord card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Wailord card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-recommend-id="image://a8f60d5475c455f8f2ad806c405767ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Wailord card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In terms of the TCG itself, the Trainer’s Pokémon also feel lacklustre. That’s perhaps because this is just the beginning of the mechanic, a toe dip, before May’s Destined Rivals really gets into it.</p><p>For some reason, of the 20 different evolutionary lines of Trainer’s Pokémon, seven belong to N, seven to Hop, and only two each for Iono and Lillie. None is especially outstanding, although the ex versions are obviously the most powerful. N’s Zoroark ex is possibly the most interesting, letting you ditch one card from your hand each turn to pick up two more, and has two-energy attack that lets you use the attack of any other N’s Pokémon from your bench.</p><p>There’s a Tool called Lillie’s Pearl, which can be attached to either Lillie’s Cutiefly/Ribombee or Comfey, and prevents the opponent from getting a Prize Card when its defeated, which is neat! (There’s also a brand new Trainer called Ruffian, who can discard both Tools and Special Energy from opponent’s cards to counter this.) Meanwhile, Hop has a Choice Band Tool that reduces energy costs by one, and does 30 more damage, when applied to Hop’s Pokémon. </p><p>There are two new Stadia, too. N’s Castle removes retreat costs for all N’s Pokémon for both players, while Postwick adds yet another 30 damage to both players’ Hop’s Pokémon. It’s all enough that players will want to experiment with it, but it does seem like the big guns are being held back for now.</p><figure id="" data-id="0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-recommend-id="image://0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Furret card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Furret card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-recommend-id="image://0178bd452ce673add94ef2bbf8598624" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Furret card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is all academic, of course, since it’s near impossible to buy anything. Quick anecdote: my wife recently sold a massive sack of empty Pokémon card tins on Facebook Marketplace (don’t blame me) for a few bucks, and the lovely lady who bought them for her kids to store cards in explained how she was going to be lining up outside a local toy store on Friday morning, in desperate hope to be able to get a Journey Together ETB for her daughter, while knowing how incredibly unlikely it was to be successful. She looked so sad, knowing how likely her daughter was to be disappointed in the face of incorrigible excitement. (I obviously gave her a wad of the Journey Together cards I’d opened, because I’m not a total monster.) But this is ridiculous! It shouldn’t be like trying to buy a launch day console when looking to pick up a few packs of <em>Pokémon</em> cards! (Never mind that someone working in the same store told me that somehow scalpers are queuing up before they open on the days they receive stock, despite no one knowing how they know when that’s happening.)</p><p>Journey Together, while obviously not <em>really</em> an effort to be deliberately disappointing, is at least a set you shouldn’t be too fussed about not being able to buy. It’s so dull, and offers so few interesting cards, that it’ll likely end up sitting on shelves next to Stellar Crown in a few months anyway.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>OpTic Gaming announced a major change to their OpTic Texas Call of Duty roster today, but it’s one fans have seen before. For the second time in just a matter of months, OpTic Texas has removed Amer “Pred” Zulbeari in favor of Cuyler “Huke” Garland.</p>



<h2 id="h-huke-in-pred-out-of-optic-texas-to-kick-off-another-call-of-duty-rostermania-period">Huke In, Pred Out of OpTic Texas to Kick Off Another Call of Duty Rostermania Period</h2>



<p>OpTic officially said thank you (and goodbye) to Pred today, thanking him for his “passion and energy.” Back in December, just months after OpTic Texas claimed the CDL championship, Pred moved to the inactive roster, needing a break to “handle personal issues” and fix his mental health. Days later though, he confirmed that he was a free agent, though still under contract with OpTic.</p>



<div><article><p><span>A World Champion with passion and energy for the game that is truly special ⚡

Always a part of our legacy. Thank you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Pred" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Pred</a></p></article></div>



<p>In his place, Huke returned to the OpTic lineup after being away for more than a year. Following his CDL Championship with Dallas Empire in 2020, Huke had bounced around different spots, picking up stints with LA Thieves, LA Guerillas, the Seattle/Vancouver Surge. OpTic struggled early this season with Huke in the lineup, but even after Pred returned to the starting squad this past February, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the results got even worse</a>.</p>



<p>Before the Stage Two Major last weekend, OpTic Texas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought in Cesar “Skyz” Bueno</a>, after a struggling Kenneth “Kenny” Williams chose to step down. Now after a second major change, the OpTic Texas roster will look ahead to the Stage 3 Major Qualifiers at the start of April. However, don’t expect OpTic Texas to be the only teams to make roster moves before the next CDL stage begins.</p>



<p>Is this the right call for OpTic Texas? Let us know in the comments or on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 fans can jump into Season 3 content 24 hours early, it’s been announced. A free trial is also being offered, but Warzone fans are likely to be disappointed with the news.</p>



<p>Call of Duty’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-season-03-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 3 content was delayed</a> a while back. Activision needed more time to perfect the nuances of the content. There’s also a suspicion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-verdansk-coming-back-to-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> needed extra time and care.</p>



<p>But it seems the Black Ops 6 development team is looking for an early start. BLOPS 6 Season 3 launches a day earlier than planned on April 2—but it comes with a minor caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-amp-verdansk-still-launches-on-april-3">Warzone Season 3 &amp; Verdansk Still Launches on April 3</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Still have to wait. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s no doubting the star attraction of Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3, and that’s the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-warzone-2-verdansk-pois/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. However, players eager to jump back into the classic battle royale map have to wait for the previously announced delayed date.</p>



<p>“Season 03 of #BlackOps6 will be dropping early on April 2nd with a 24 hour free trial,” posted the official <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty X page</a>. This is great news for Black Ops 6 fans and potential newcomers eager to try the FPS out.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you want Verdansk a day early, you’re out of luck. The message also went on to say: “During that time Call of Duty: Warzone will go offline in preparation for the launch of Verdansk on April 3. Anyone who opens the Call of Duty: Warzone game menu during that time will receive the Kilo 141 for free.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/social-media-tiktok-instagram-notifications<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In both my professional and personal life, I take pride in being like a penguin. Through lurking on the occasionally educational app TikTok, I have learned that I, like the noble penguin, deepen my bonds with friends and colleagues through pebbling. On a David Attenborough level, <a href="https://www.today.com/life/relationships/pebbling-love-language-peguins-rcna155876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pebbling</a> is a gift-giving ritual where one bird brings pebbles to a mate to (hopefully) use as the cornerstone for building nests. It is a very romantic sentiment that stood no chance against being co-opted by TikTok-<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2W42xyk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speak</a> to explain why people can go days at a time without meaningful conversation but share memes, funny videos, or the dreaded news article just to show we’ve been thinking of someone. This brings me to my "old man yells at cloud" blog about how turned off I am by how I'm constantly pushed to connect when I don't want to.&nbsp;</p><p>It is not courageous to say that social media has lost the plot on why we use it: to connect to each other. These days, Twitter is mostly advertisements promoting right-wing politicians, AI-generated "art," or straight up porn sandwiched between bots copy-pasting the same comments to each other. However, I can withstand any challenge as long as I have small joys like fan art, memes, and videos to share with friends. But I’ve recently reached a point where I’ve avoided my friends because of how invasive the internet’s approach of constant connection has become.</p><p>Last week, I got into a weird little spat with my best friend over liking a Hasanabi reel on Instagram. This isn’t all that rare, and we’ve even stopped bringing him up to avoid arguments about the himbo’s approach to talking about socialist politics while being rich. But what was weird was how they even knew I liked the video in the first place. (For those curious, it was a video of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHjqfyYz0Bw/?igsh=MWNiMmpmNm91cXpmZQ==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hasan twerking with Kaho Shibuya</a>.) When I asked them about it, they told me it was because Instagram Reels has a built-in feature that shows you videos your friends have liked. When I looked up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/1i4u7o6/any_way_to_turn_off_that_new_friends_feature_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to opt out of the feature</a>, I was pissed to learn that I couldn’t and disheartened to read folks say they just don’t like videos anymore, entirely to avoid awkward conversations with friends.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>How it feels having notifications breathing down my neck to interact with my friends. <span></span><span>© Gainax</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the grand scheme of things, this is a very small drop in the pond for how invasive and all-encompassing internet culture has become, but it still pisses me off that I can’t even have the joy of pebbling anymore because Reels has a built in tab that shares post I’ve liked with my friends the moment I like them. Sure, there’s something funny about my friend seeing me thirst over Hasan throwing his double-wide ass in a circle, and it gave us an opportunity to talk about how my bisexual yearning led to our spat, but that doesn’t change the fact that even a friend I’ve shared plenty of kitchen conversations about life with has no business knowing about my likes without my saying so. If I didn’t share it with them, I didn’t want them to see it, regardless of whether or not the internet thinks it's doing me a solid by broaching the connection for me.&nbsp;</p><p>Hell, even the act of leaving a friend on read when they pebble posts to me comes with the sting of expectation thanks to the “seen” prompt. It used to be that you wouldn’t see a friend until you encountered them in the wild and gave a quick hi-bye or made plans to hang out. Now, I’ve been conditioned to worry I’ve betrayed a friendship by not replying the moment I get a notification that a friend sent me something.&nbsp;</p><p>Human beings are social creatures, and being able to connect with one another is one of the best parts about the internet. But the internet’s incessant need to streamline and optimize how I connect with friends by sending me notifications the moment they’re active on TikTok, posting new stories on Instagram, or liking the same video as me is has turned those real friendships into supervised ones and that fucking sucks.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gunzilla"><h3>Game Informer Relaunches With Original Staff</h3></a><p>Staff say the site is an independent entity of Gunzilla Games, which is making a game that includes NFTs</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released another new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's all about the past; you'll be unearthing bones, assembling fossils, and doing battle with giant stone guardians.</p>

<p>The Relics update follows on from previous updates like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-orbital-update" rel="nofollow">Orbital</a>, and like those updates, this one's pretty substantial. Its main addition is the ability to "design and assemble complete skeletons from your collection of ancient bones".</p>

<p>According to Hello Games, you'll be able to "imagine how ancient alien creatures might have looked, and re-assemble their bodies from their fossilized remains". There will also be "millions of possibilities for unique species" that you can assemble.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-relics-update-bones.jpg?itok=WZDhNdgK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-relics-update-bones.jpg?itok=TEu05Kcn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s Relics update is all about fossils.</figcaption></figure><p>While you're looking for the bones you'll use to reassemble these fossils, however, you'll need to contend with new stone guardian enemies, which "slumber by planetary fossil beds" and defend them from enterprising players.</p>

<p>A new Expedition will also see you signing up with the Galactic Paleology Society to "recreate ancient lifeforms and uncover secrets". If you've been waiting for a chance to discover the kind of creatures that inhabited&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s countless planets in the past, this update is for you.</p>

<p>Once you've assembled fossil exhibits, you can then visit Fossil Collectors aboard Space Stations in order to sell your creations or trade bones for other fossils.</p>

<p>Of course, this being a&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update, you will also find tons of other new features and things to look forward to. You can read the update's full patch notes, as well as a rundown of its more significant features, <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/relics-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>The Relics update continues Hello Games' quest to turn&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>into the most comprehensive space survival sim ever, and it's admirable just how focused on the game's ongoing development the studio still is all these years later.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<p>We’ve heard about Mortal Kombat content heading to Fortnite already. However, a new leak has pulled back the bloody curtain to reveal that March 28 potentially brings emotes, pickaxes, and skins to finish us (or anyone).</p>



<p>There was a time when I used to be shocked by Fortnite’s collaborations. It went out the window quickly once the likes of Kratos and Halo started dropping into Tilted Towers. Now, anyone who’s anyone can make an appearance—check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sabrina-carpenter-might-be-the-next-playable-fortnite-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a> dialog if you don’t believe me. </p>



<p>But there’s something surreal about the brutal nature of Mortal Kombat entering a new realm. Alas, after initial talk of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-mortal-kombat-mythics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat content turning up for a fight in Fortnite</a>, it’s reportedly the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-amp-mortal-kombat-crossover-content-reportedly-releases-march-28">Fortnite &amp; Mortal Kombat Crossover Content Reportedly Releases March 28</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get over here, Fortnite. Credit to NetherRealm</figcaption></figure>



<p>Renowned leaker <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a> has dropped a finishing blow on the MK and Fortnite conversation. They posted to their official X channel about the nature of the content coming to the battle royale shooter.</p>



<p>They provided a bullet-point list outlining some of the key inclusions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Scorpion (MK3) Skin: 1.500 vbucks</li>



<li>Kitana (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Raiden (MK3) Skin: 1500 vbucks</li>



<li>Scorpion’s Flame Skull backbling: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden’s Amulet backbling: 400 vbucks#</li>



<li>Raiden’s Staff pickaxe: 800 bucks </li>



<li>Scorpion’s Katana Duo pickaxe: included with the backbling</li>



<li>Kitana’s Steel Fan pickaxe: 800 bucks</li>



<li>Kitana’s Fan Bear: included with the pickaxe</li>



<li>Kitana’s Fan Fado emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>FLAWLESS VICTORY emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Toasty! emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Test your strength emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Guiding Staff Mark emote: 300 bucks</li>



<li>Raiden’s Victory emote: 300 bucks</li>
</ul>



<p>They finish by saying to expect the items on <strong>March 28</strong>. You can check out the full message here.</p>

<p>This may be the beginning of a fun and fatal partnership. Take the leaks with the usual punch of salt, but there’s every chance you can start preparing your best kombos to drop onto unsuspecting Fortnite players.</p>



<p>The Mortal Kombat collab isn’t the only rumored to be in the works: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-collaborating-with-dragon-ball-daima-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Daima</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-is-getting-a-kendrick-lamar-emote-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kendrick Lamar</a> might be boarding the bus soon enough.</p>

Truth is an illusion, paranoia is constant, and your humanity is an oddity.</p><p>You awake to find yourself a prisoner within a living nightmare. Your name, your past: gone, but not the record of your misdeeds. Your <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>es: beyond comprehension. Your conviction: incontestable. Your sentence: eternal. The need to escape and set things right: undeniable.</p><p>Fight your way out of a living, twisting labyrinth. Hone your skills as you take on dynamic combat encounters and absurd puzzles. Meet the Cosmic Engine’s most disturbing and grotesque inhabitants, all with unique and nonsensical personalities, who are just as likely to aid in your quest as they are to deceive you.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Escape means freedom, and in freedom, the truth.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Dark Fantasy Adventure</strong> – Descend through the surreal, twisting Spire as you recover from amnesia and slowly discover the morbid truth about your past and your hostile surroundings. Cling to your sanity as the very fabric of reality is unraveled before your eyes.</li><li><strong>Swiss Army <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [53 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">Hack-and-Slash</a></strong> – Take on the army of undead with an arsenal of unorthodox weapons and accessories. You may prefer the quick slices of the Chainsword for large hordes of enemies while reserving the devastating blows of the Power Hammer for boss fights. Or go all-out and replace your entire arm with a fully functioning cannon. Mix and match to find the build that best suits your playstyle.</li><li><strong>Puzzling Paranoia</strong> – Test your resolve with a myriad of environmental and logic puzzles. In a world devoid of sense and reason, you’ll have to stoop to your lowest if it means moving forward. Solve puzzles by drinking blood, forcing regurgitation, and digging through viscera. Fun.</li><li><strong>Will the Madness Ever End?</strong> – Designed especially to torment you, the Cosmic Engine will stop at nothing to keep you contained. Several playthroughs of <em>Moroi</em> will be required to experience all the game has to offer, from subtle changes within the story to the multiple fate-changing endings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Moroi - Official Release Date Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSsL82tpsTM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Square Enix has announced that War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius will be shutting down on May 30.</p><p>"Since War of the Visions: Final Fantasay Brave Exvius's launch on March 25, 2020, we've strived to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for our players every day that could exceed the day before," Square Enix said in a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "However, we've come to the conclusion that it would be difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience, and therefore to discontinue the app service."</p><p>An end-of-service roadmap was also provided. Players are now no longer able to purchase Visiore using real-world currency. However, any currently held Visiore can still be used until the game shuts down. Visiore is the game's premium currency that let players summon units, purchase items from the shop, and replenish NRG. Special Shop sales have ended too.</p><p>Any in-game events that have already been scheduled will be held until the game's end of service. Android players have until April 30 to exchange their Google Play points for items.</p><p>War of the Visions is yet another Final Fantasy mobile game that's shutting down. Back in September 2024, Square Enix announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-final-fantasy-game-is-shutting-down-later-this-year/1100-6526231/" data-ref-id="1100-6526231">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a> would end service in October. This game is not to be confused with War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, as War of the Visions is a spin-off of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.</p><p>Square Enix also suddenly ended support for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/support-for-this-final-fantasy-game-has-suddenly-ended-on-ios/1100-6529503/" data-ref-id="1100-6529503">iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a> due to a change in the version's in-app purchase model.</p>
