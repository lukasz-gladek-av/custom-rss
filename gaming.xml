<p>To celebrate the milestone, Marvelous has also showcased a new piece of artwork on social media, which depicts the protagonist's loyal partner and guide Woolby wearing a delightful party hat. Adorable.</p>

<p>Released on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> to coincide with the launch of the Switch 2, Guardians of Azuma gained high praise for its mix of RPG and simulation gameplay. We awarded it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">a score of 9/10</a> and said that it "manages to reinvent itself while still maintaining the bones that make the Rune Factory series feel like itself".</p>
<p>At the moment, Guardians of Azuma remains a console exclusive for the Switch and Switch 2, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/australian-classification-rates-rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-disgaea-7-complete">Australian classifications</a> indicate that it may soon come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, so that will no doubt boost its sales quite nicely.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hqlkrn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

              <p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-1-5-changes-censorship-game-pass-steam-2000617865"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> received a very controversial update</a> that made major changes to the Soulslike game, rendering multiple bosses impossible to kill, and formerly antagonistic characters into BFFs. The 1.5 update was seemingly a response to a negative reaction to the game’s reception in China, but this caused a whole other backlash in the rest of the world, seeing the game review-bombed on Steam. But over the weekend a fan-made mod has been released that will roll your Steam version of the game back to version 1.4.</p> <p>The whole situation of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang</em> is a peculiar one. Soulslikes are very big business in China, and games like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> from Chinese developer Game Science celebrate Chinese mythology while gaining tacit approval from the Chinese state. However, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, despite coming from Chinese developer Leenzee and clearly attempting a similar exploration of Chinese history, has fallen foul of public reception at home. The representation of various historical figures of the Ming dynasty, but not then including condemnation of the subsequent Qing dynasty, has been seen as inaccurate or disrespectful by some, and as such Leenzee updated the game to address these perceived issues, both changing how boss fights play out, and significantly affecting the later states of the game where far fewer characters will attack you. Thus, the enormous backlash. Well, the second backlash, after the game went through its first round of negative reviews <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feather-soulslike-pc-performance-patch-1851786948">due to performance issues on PC</a>.</p> <p>It’s very hard to appreciate the situation a Chinese developer will find itself, given the need for state approval to be able to sell a game, while their story stepped on controversial toes far less appreciable outside of the country. My understanding of the situation is rudimentary, but it appears analogous with the ongoing issues in the U.S. regarding how its history is represented, especially when it comes to race. With growing discontent surrounding the game in China, there would have been enormous pressure to make these changes, no matter how much the wider world might disapprove. It’s very much a rock and hard-place scenario for Leenzee.</p>

 <p>However, for those playing the game on Steam, there’s now a solution. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">“Rollback censorship patch” via&nbsp;<em>NexusMods</em></a><em>—</em>created by DarkmoonBlade<em>—</em>will undo the mandatory Steam update, taking <em>Wuchang</em> back to its 1.4 state, and as such no longer have many of the bosses become “exhausted” rather than dead. It’ll also restore the original story. You’ll also need to disable the auto-update feature for the game in Steam, or it’ll just reinstall itself immediately, and then run the game via the game’s .exe rather than through Steam.</p> <p>For all the response, there’s little evidence it’s changed anything with regards to the game’s popularity. The game’s Steam player numbers have maintained the same continuous descent they were already on before the patch, rather than showing any steep decline or widespread boycotting. While <em>Wuchang</em> peaked at a very impressive 131,000 simultaneous players in late July, that’s steadily dropped to the 16,000 or so who showed up over the weekend. Like so many Soulslikes, it seems to have had its moment, failing to cut deeper into the zeitgeist like the likes of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. (The August 2024 game broke records with its 2.4m players, but has settled to a steady 40,000 for months.)</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-petition-ceo-resignation-removal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/petition-calling-for-roblox-ceo%E2%80%99s-resignation-reaches-110-000-signatures-in-10-days.1272510/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As the controversial cacophony continues with Roblox, disgruntled gamers worldwide have poured into a petition to demand the removal or resignation of Roblox’s CEO, David Baszucki. In less than ten days, the petition has racked up more than 110,000 signatures, and more are coming in with every passing minute.</p>



<p>This is all in response to the recent (but not the first) complaints regarding Roblox’s handling of child safety protocols and the control of predatory action on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-roblox-s-ceo-going-to-resign">Is Roblox’s CEO Going to Resign?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to know what the strategy is for the Roblox team at present, but 110,000 signatures and counting can’t be ignored.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-david-baszucki" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the petition</a>, a clear explanation has been outlined:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Roblox is supposed to be a safe and creative space for children. But under the leadership of CEO David Baszucki, that safety has been repeatedly compromised. Instead of prioritizing the protection of young users, Roblox Corporation continues to allow harmful and exploitative behavior to thrive on its platform — with little accountability or transparency.</p>



<p>Children are being exploited and exposed to dangerous content, all while Roblox’s executive leadership turns a blind eye. If nothing changes, this pattern of negligence will continue — and more children will be hurt. This is not just about poor leadership. This is about child safety.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is far from being the first time that these criticisms and concerns have surfaced, but this is perhaps the most severe bout we’ve had yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-is-being-investigated-for-child-safety">Roblox is Being Investigated for Child Safety</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, Louisiana’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against Roblox, demanding that the company do more to protect children on the platform. Most recently, it was announced that Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-confirms-going-after-roblox/">is assembling a documentary</a> diving into the state of play in the world of Roblox, and is working hand-in-hand with the likes of Schlep.</p>



<p>Roblox remains arguably the most popular game in the world by the sheer number of active users within the ecosystem. Could that be set to change with a mass exodus and shunning sitting on the nearby horizon?</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve had any issues with Roblox on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded will provide a fresh boost for the franchise in a big push from Microsoft, with another new title also on the cards, and we’ve got all the details on the review embargo.</p>



<p>Set for release on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded is the second big remake for the franchise following Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and there’s an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gears-of-war-reloaded-free-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upgrade to the new version available</a>, while one of the big additions is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-crossplay-cross-platform-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossplay functionality</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence on whether to purchase Gears of War: Reloaded, you may want to wait to see how the review scores stack up. There is a review embargo in place, however, and we’ve got all the details on when it lifts.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-reloaded-review-embargo-date-explained">Gears of War: Reloaded Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Here we go again. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The official Gears of War: Reloaded review embargo ends on August 26, though no precise time has been announced.</strong></p>



<p>Confirmation of the review embargo date came from <a href="https://x.com/MrboomstickXL/status/1956428233785672132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MrboomstickXL on X</a> (formerly Twitter), who told followers they would “be able to give my thoughts on August 26th when the embargo is lifted.”</p>



<p>The embargo comes on the same day as the release, although given the code supplied to the source mentioned is a YouTube channel, there could be a separate review embargo for written content. We’ll update this article with any further details that might emerge.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-gears-of-war-reloaded-scores-can-we-expect">What Gears of War: Reloaded Scores Can we Expect?</h2>



<p><strong>As a remake</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: Reloaded will be marked heavily on the differences compared to the original time at the Ultimate Edition released in 2015, though scores should be high.</strong></p>



<p>The original Gears of War, released in 2006, has an impressive <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/gears-of-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a> score with 94 from critic reviews, with user scores averaging at 8.2. Those numbers did drop for the Ultimate Edition, however, with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">critic score of 82</a> and a user score of 7.8.</p>



<p>We’d expect scores to be in a similar range for the franchise, which usually lands with an 80-90 average score, including the much-maligned Gears 5, which has an 84 average score and 8.2 user review average.</p>



<p>Anything below the 80 mark would certainly be considered a blow for the title, particularly given that it is making the huge step of leaving Microsoft exclusivity and making a PlayStation debut.</p>

<p>EA is encouraging players to hop back into Battlefield 2042 after a chaotic few weeks in the Battlefield 6 beta. We’re all being tempted back in with new weapons, vehicles, and a rumored new map.</p>



<p>All good things must come to an end. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 beta</a> broke records and has been a big success. Battlefield might finally be back, but the irony of this statement is that it has to go away for another couple of months. But you can hop back into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042</a> while you wait as new free goodies await.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-guns-amp-vehicles-added-to-battlefield-2042">New Guns &amp; Vehicles Added to Battlefield 2042</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll be back, don’t worry. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>We recently reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 2042 could be getting a ‘Surprisingly Big’ update soon</a>. BF 2042 has largely abandoned the seasonal content schedule as it’s full steam ahead for Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>This hasn’t stopped <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 2042</a> from receiving the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lynx (Weapon)</li>



<li>F2000 (Weapon)</li>



<li>Warthog (Vehicle)</li>



<li>Frogfoot (Vehicle)</li>
</ul>



<p>As of writing, there are still items missing from the update that were initially rumored: The Prototype (another weapon) and the Iwo Jima map. This doesn’t mean they won’t be happening. We’ll keep an eye on things to see if they’re added to Battlefield 2042.</p>



<p>Are you returning to Battlefield 2042 before Battlefield 6’s full launch? Or are you interested in checking out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-5-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 5</a> again, for example?

<p>Arriving "This Fall"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Mega Evolution is the talk of the town for Pokémon in 2025, and it looks like it won't be long before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> gets in on the fun too.</p>
<p>As showcased in the weekend's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/round-up-everything-announced-at-the-2025-pokemon-world-championships-closing-ceremony">Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</a>, the next TCG Pocket expansion will introduce a batch of Mega Evolution cards to the mobile app. While the full lineup is yet to be revealed, we got a peek at the Mega Gyarados ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Altaria ex cards, which we're sure we'll all be chasing when the next expansion arrives at some point "this Fall".</p>
<p>These new Mega Evolved ex cards boast high HP stats and the ability to deal some tasty damage, but they come with their own risks. You see, if your Mega Evolution ex card gets knocked out, your opponent will take <em>three</em> points — in short, it's an insta-win.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how these high-risk, high-reward cards shift the meta when they arrive in the app in the coming months. We still don't have a name or a secure release date just yet, but we're going to start saving our Pack Hourglasses now, just in case.</p>

            <p>Every month Xbox gives and and it takes. While we get new games added to Xbox Game Pass throughout each month, in the middle and the end of the month we also see a bunch of games leave the service.</p>
<p>At the end of August the following games will leave Game Pass according to the recently updated Xbox App:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition</li>
<li>Sea of Stars</li>
<li>Paw Patrol Mighty Pups Save Adventure Bay</li>
<li>This War of Mine: Final Cut</li>
<li>Ben 10: Power Trip</li>
</ul>
<p>Of those games, there are a couple of standouts that you should try to play before they leave Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is a three-player co-op turn-based RPG that Eurogamer awarded 4 stars in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-review">Sea of Stars review</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a>: Final Cut is the game 11 bit made before going on to create <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and The Alters.</p>
<blockquote><p>In This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-3-review-bigger-better-and-even-more-polarising-than-ever-before">Borderlands 3</a> Ultimate Edition has its fans (not everyone enjoyed what Gearbox did with the third game in the series), and you might want to give it a whirl ahead of Borderlands 4 releasing in September.</p>

            <p>Last week, soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> got a patch that rendered a number of its bosses unkillable, seemingly in response to pressure from some Chinese players. For those who aren't keen on the patch's changes, which particularly transforms the challenge you'll face in the game's fourth region, there's now a mod dedicated to undoing them by letting you roll back to a previous version.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth view of the changes patch 1.5 made and what they mean for the game, it's well worth reading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses-made-unkillable">our Jeremy's story</a> on it from last week. The short version is that a number of big foes associated with the Ming dynasty have been made to fall down in exhaustion when you defeat them, rather than being killed. As you might imagine, this has implications not just in terms of the minute-to-minute experience of playing Wuchang, but also the story it tells.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s busted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4-gets-some-further-tweaks-to-its-mod-destroying-next-gen-update">next-gen update</a> last year, modders are trying to help players who're keen to roll their game back to a previous version. AVK95 has stepped up to the task with the self-explanatory '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">Rollback censorship patch</a>'.</p>
<p>"Wuchang 1.5 massively downgrades the game experience," its creator wrote in the mod's description. "Most late game bosses, NPCs and enemies now get exhausted instead of dying and give you meaningless banter instead of story advancing dialog from the original game. Basically patch 1.5 has ruined the game's story and immersion."</p><p>The mod will take you back to version 1.4 of Wuchang, which meas that in getting rid of patch 1.5's boss tweaks, you'll also be ditching more useful changes like quickened up healing animations and a revamping of how Wuchang gets back up after being knocked down. If you choose to download it, you'll get a file called WuchangRollback.exe, which it instructs you to extract and then run in your game's root folder.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you'll have to disable the game's ability to automatically update by heading into its properties menu via your steam library. Lastly, you'll need to start the game each time by clicking a file called 'Project_Plague-Win64-Shipping', rather than clicking play on Steam itself.</p>
<p>It's a fair amount of palaver to go through, but with Steam lacking a feature like fellow storefront GOG.com's <a href="https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/4419630535057-The-rollback-feature-reverting-to-a-previous-version-of-the-game">built-in rollbacks</a> for games that don't offer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/164mwsj/psa_how_to_rollback_to_a_previous_game_version_on/">previous versions as betas</a>, it's probably the best you'll get for now. As you saw with that Fallout update, there can be other ways to pull off rolling back a patch, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo4/comments/1ccxyxb/pc_players_here_is_a_guide_on_how_to_rollback/">re-downloading old depot files</a>, but that's usually no walk in the park unless you find some instructions you can follow to the letter.</p>
<p>There might end up being a better solution if someone develops a mod that only gets rid of patch 1.5's controversial changes or, ideally, developers Lenzee opt to offer a version of the game that does the same. As of right now, there's just AVK95's mod, which also doesn't work with the Xbox Game Pass version of Wuchang.</p>

<p>While you might not recognize David Hayter if you walked past him on the street, you’d certainly become wide-eyed if you heard his Snake voice. The legendary voice actor, who commanded the role of Snake for many years in MGS, recently revealed that he has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5—a tough ask, given he was replaced as Snake’s voice actor.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is the creative visionary behind Metal Gear Solid. There’s no denying MGS wouldn’t be what it is without him. But the gruff, roughness of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/david-hayter-mgs-konami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Hayter</a>‘s Solid Snake voice added to the character’s aura of the years. However, Hideo Kojima replaced Hayter with Kiefer Sutherland for Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain. This hurt Hayter a lot.</p>

<p>Hayter told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2016/03/25/david-hayter-playing-metal-gear-solid-v-would-have-been-60-hours-of-humiliation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> in 2016 that playing Metal Gear Solid V would have been “60 hours of humiliation.” He also added that Kojima had been trying to replace Hayter before The Phantom Pain, before ultimately doing so with Kiefer Sutherland—best known for the TV show 24.</p>



<p>As a result, Hayter didn’t play The Phantom Pain or Ground Zeroes: “Yeah. That’ll be 60 hours of humiliation that I can’t get to. I haven’t played the latest two iterations, because it’s just too painful.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/all-is-forgiven-after-being-dropped-for-metal-gear-solid-5-david-hayter-now-says-its-my-favourite-gameplay-of-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reports that David Hayter has finally played Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain: “And then I played it and I’m like, I think this is my favourite gameplay of the series. The fact that you can go into the same scenario each time, and the [enemy] soldier’s gonna be doing the same thing, but you can take on different routes or different strategies of attack, makes it feel like time travel.”</p>



<p>He added that the gameplay is “badass” and “all is forgiven.”</p>



<p>David Hayter was returned to the role of Snake in the upcoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The voice actor has new lines as the remake looks to provide new content for all fans. Are you happy to hear the OG voice actor is back for the Snake Eater Remake? What’s your favorite Snake line?

		<p>There’s a fresh new trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, showcasing the new Z-A Battle Club with up-to four player battles. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Z-A Battle Club completely mixes up the traditional flow of Pokémon battling that you’ve known since the very first games, putting a three minute timer in place and tasking everyone with knocking out as many opposing Pokémon as possible! The trainers who strike the finishing blow will earn a point, with the defeated trainer respawning back at the edge of the arena with another one of their Pokémon ready to go, though you can still switch Pokémon for a tactical change.</p>
<p>This is all possible thanks to Pokémon Legends: Z-A now having real time battles where you can move around the combat arena. It also make area of effect attacks much more impactful, such as when Mega Dragonite is summoned and unleashes a meteor strike to wipe out all three opponents at once in the final ten seconds.</p>
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is coming to both Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>&nbsp;on 16th October.</p>

<p>Launching next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Publisher Feardemic has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bad_cheese">Bad Cheese</a>, a new survival horror from developer Simon Lukasik, will launch on the Switch (with backwards compatibility on Switch 2) on <strong>1st September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bendy_and_the_ink_machine">Bendy And The Ink Machine</a> before it, Bad Cheese utilises old-school 'rubber hose' animation, which was perhaps most notably used in the 2D action-platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cuphead">Cuphead</a>. It's difficult to gauge exactly what the aim of the game is, but it appears that you'll be navigating a spooky 3D environment, interacting with various objects, and solving tactile puzzles to progress.</p>
<p>We have to admit, it doesn't necessarily look <em>scary</em>, but the atmosphere seems to be fairly effective, and there's definitely some creepy monster designs being utilised throughout the trailer.</p>
<p>Now let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Face your demons –</strong> You all live together. You, Dad, Mom, Brother, and the rest of the demons. Try not to cause problems so you don’t have to be punished<br>
<strong><br>
- Help around the house –</strong> Scrub, sweep, clean, make fries, kill spiders, bring Daddy his pills – essentially, be a good kid<br>
<strong><br>
- Find hidden treasures –</strong> Explore the house and look for treats and action figures scattered around. This might be the only fun part about living here<br>
<strong><br>
- Just try to get by –</strong> Visit various parts of the house, face difficult situations, and experience the gruesome reality of a child-mouse trying to maintain a sense of normalcy in an abnormal household</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Hello all! And a very happy This Week to you. I'm back from break just in time for Gamescom. Gamescom! *Broadway overture kicks in* A time of booths and blaggardry! Of queues and carousing! Of flinching away from cosplayers promising Free Hugs! Of getting caught in a human logjam between the major exhibition halls and the lavatories! Of miniature walled villages operated by triple-A publishers, hosting their own local culture of finger food! Of strung-out crypto investors filling the alcoves with their musical cries of "DOGECOIN FOR SALE, DOGECOIN FOR SALE!" Of waifu bodypillows and army recruiters! Of finding the event's secret best game tucked away among the b2b stands! Of long walks back to the hotel across the bridge of locks, wondering how it ever came to this!</p> <!--more-->
<p>Such are my terrible memories, anyway. James is attending the Cologne-based games convention for RPS this year. The rest of us will be stationed atop the Treehouse with telescopes and crossbows, scouring the skies for News with which to feed the exuberant and impetuous Maw. In advance of all that, here's a rundown of new PC games, together with the bare bones of a conference schedule.</p>
<h2>Monday 18th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stick-it-to-the-stickman">Stick It To The Stickman</a> entangles corporate careerism with punching with the golden era of Newgrounds animation. Mark has already been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stickbossman-i-think-youll-find-my-chainsaw-has-an-appointment">sticking it to the demo</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 19th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> is the latest Journey-me-do from Abzu and The Pathless devs Giant Squid. It's about doing ollies on a claymore. I was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-an-enveloping-but-not-cutting-meditation-on-flow-journey-and-vintage-tony-hawk">quite impressed</a> by the SGF demo.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/voidbreaker">Void/Breaker</a> is a glistening goldfish bowl full of robots, destructible buildings and moddable guns.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757940/Raygun_Gadabout/">Raygun Gadabout</a> is a retro-future sci-fi with splattery Rick &amp; Morty stylings. Possibly an Earthworm Jim for people who don't like Earthworm Jim since its creator went a bit Wrong.</li>
<li>They do the Geoffs in different voices at <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/onl">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, featuring Blandoman Extraordinaire and his Fashion Friends, plus some videogames. The main show starts at 11am PT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 20th August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896760/Azooma_Escape/">Azooma Escape</a> is a comedic stealth adventure about breaking out of an overbearing family gathering, from a Saudi independent team.</li>
<li>Xbox are doing their first Gamescom broadcast today at 6am PT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll share further details of the external inquiry Microsoft have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/microsoft-launches-inquiry-claims-israel-used-tech-mass-surveillance-palestinians">recently commissioned</a> into their alleged complicity with war crimes.</li>
<li>The Future Games Show is next up on the Gamescom schedule at 11am PDT, 2pm EDT, 7pm BST, and 8pm CEST. We can expect: the voice actors behind Solid Snake and Lady Dimitrescu. Now there's a fanshipping for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 21st August</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2631450/Bean_Beasts/">Bean Beasts</a> is a lushly pixelled tower defender in which your towers are Pokenots and your traps are upgradeable - truly, these are dark times for tower attackers.</li>

<li>It's time for Eggsbogs Gamecome All Ye Faithful round two at 6am PDT, 9am EDT, 2pm BST, and 3pm CEST. Perhaps they'll have another crack at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">justifying the mass layoffs</a> in this one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 22nd August</h2>
<ul>
<li>Let's leave Friday wide open and spotless as the freshly fallen snow, to catch any larger unexpected Gamescom revelations. Maybe somebody will wear another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">politically ill-advised hat</a> on stage. Maybe James will go full gonzo. According to my meeting notes, he's promised to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-know-ill-use-deep-rock-galactic-to-identify-the-mushrooms-in-my-palm-pot">eat all those mushrooms he found in his planters last week</a>. I think that would be a wonderful way to close the expo, personally. I'm sure you'll all remind him.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Broadway overture crackles and slows into a nightmarish series of undersea noises* Good luck with the Geoffalypse, all.</p>

<p>Mega Evolution will make a Pokémon TCG Pocket debut later this year, with the first cards also being revealed during the closing ceremony of the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is bringing Mega Evolution back to the mainline games when it releases on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, while the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolutions-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mega Evolution in the physical TCG</a> has already been released in Japan with the first English sets due later this year.</p>



<p>Now, Pokémon TCG Pocket is following suit with Mega Evolutions confirmed to arrive “this fall” as part of a “new season,” which could be in line with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-devs-plan-to-release-a-major-update-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update that has already been teased</a>.</p>

<p>A trailer shown at the Pokémon World Championships featured a recap of some of the additions to the game we’ve seen so far, followed by the reveal of the Mega Evolutions symbol and a first look at several cards.</p>



<p>Mega Altaria ex, Mega Blaziken ex, and Mega Gyarados ex were all featured, showing the art style for the cards and confirming how they will be utilized in the game.</p>



<p>Similar to the latest physical TCG sets, Mega Pokémon will not evolve from their standard forms. Instead, Mega Blaziken evolves from Combusken, Mega Gyarados evolves from Magikarp, and Mega Altaria evolves from Swablu.</p>



<p>Mega Evolution in Pokémon TCG Pocket will also be a high-risk vs reward strategy as, while they will be among the strongest cards in the game, with all the revealed cards having 210 HP and dishing out high damage, the opponent will secure three points if your Mega Evolution Pokémon is knocked out.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether the battle format will change for Pokémon TCG Pocket’s new season, but currently, securing three points ends the match. Therefore, a strategy is required on when to introduce them and when to retreat.</p>

<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Z-A Battle Club is ready for its newest Link Battle entrants! Up to four players can take part in battles where they attempt to defeat as many of each other’s Pokémon as they can within the three-minute time limit.</p>
<p>When any of your Pokémon faint, you will return to your starting point and reenter the battle with all your Pokémon fully recovered. Defeating an opponent’s Pokémon earns you a point, and those points determine your ranking. Mega Power orbs, which can be collected to Mega Evolve your Pokémon, may also appear around the stage, as well as items to boost your Pokémon’s stats temporarily.</p>
<p><strong>Real-time battling gets serious</strong></p>
<p>In this title’s new battle system, some moves may work differently than in prior games in the Pokémon series. Moves have a wide range of effects—launching attacks in a fixed radius to deal damage to multiple Pokémon at once, targeting distant Pokémon by attacking in a straight line, and more. Launch attacks from places your opponents don’t expect or sweep through groups of opponents as you lead your partner Pokémon to victory by making full use of a variety of moves.</p>
<p><strong>Climb the ranks to earn rewards</strong></p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo/The Pokemon Company</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Test your real-time battling skills against Trainers around the world in Ranked Battles. You’ll earn points based on your placement in four-player Link Battles, and may earn an additional kicker based on your performance. Similar to the main story, you’ll start off at Rank Z and can climb the ranks to the ultimate Rank A.</p>
<p><strong>Enjoy real-time battles with your friends</strong></p>
<p>Looking to settle who’s the best Trainer once and for all? Challenge your friends in Private Battles! You can input a Link Code to connect with nearby players using local communication or distant players online. Once you’re all connected, you can adjust the battle rules to your liking and battle against up to three other players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Link Battles can be played between Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Pokémon Legends: Z-A – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A with the upgrade pack applied.</li>
<li>A paid Nintendo Switch Online membership is required to participate in battles via the internet.</li>
<li>In order to enjoy online play, you will need to have downloaded the latest update data.</li>
<li>The Pokémon Video Game Championships at the 2026 Pokémon World Championships will be played on <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/">Pokémon Champions</a>.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A will feature online ranked battles and a four-player PvP mode, it has been revealed at the Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 16</a>, Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the next big release for the franchise heading into a huge year in 2026, where Pokémon celebrates a 30th anniversary and is widely expected to release the tenth generation of Pokémon.</p>



<p>Legends: Z-A follows on from the success of 2021’s Pokémon Legends: Arceus, which featured open-world catching mechanics for the first time, but big steps forward are being taken in the latest entry to the series with online support.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Big features. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the biggest disappointments with Legends: Arceus was the lack of online features, with no battling, trading, or Mystery Gift system. That all changes in Legends: Z-A, however, which will feature them all.</p>



<p>Ranked battles will provide competitive action for trainers around the world, with private matches also being available, while the trading mechanics suggest that trade evolutions will return—having been replaced by single-use items in Legends: Arceus.</p>



<p>Another piece of big news revealed at Anaheim was a four-player PvP mode, where trainers will compete within a time limit to secure the most knock-outs, with Mega Evolution confirmed to be available in the mode.</p>



<p>The four-player mode follows on from the four-player co-op introduced in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, though that was restricted to open-world exploration and did not include battle features. Instead, battles remained in the same one-vs-one format we’ve become accustomed to.</p>



<p>Introducing a four-player PvP mode in Legends: Z-A could mean big things for the tenth generation of the game, given Scarlet &amp; Violet took a lot of the mechanics from Legends: Arceus and introduced them to the mainline games—including open-world catching and exploration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trainers will be able to jump into the Z-A Battle Club in the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> game in the newly revealed Link and Ranked Battles. In the Z-A Battle Club (Link Battles), up to four players will race to defeat as many Pokémon as possible within the time limit to take the top spot.</p>
<p>In Ranked Battles, up to four Trainers can compete online from around the world to earn points. When players earn enough points, they will rise in rank. Trainers will start off at Rank Z and can be promoted all the way up to the ultimate Rank A.​</p>
<p>Players can earn in-game rewards when a battle ends or when their rank increases, with additional rewards granted based on their final rank when the season ends after a set time period. Since rewards vary by season, active participation is necessary to climb the ranks and earn rewards. Players will also be able to enjoy Private Battles with their friends using local communicationor with those farther away online.</p>

<p>The latest game in the <i>AI: Somnium Files</i> series arrived last month, and it’s shorter than the previous ones. <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is actually a spin-off that takes place between the first two games, <i>AI: The Somnium Files</i> and <i>AI: The Somnium Files -Nirvana Initiative-</i>, as well as sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date.</p> <p>This time around, Kaname Date must save our favorite idol Iris after she gets abducted by a UFO and is forced to play various escape games to survive. Directed by Kazuya Yamada supervised by original series creator Uchikoshi, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> implements escape room puzzles similar to that of the <em>Zero Escape</em> series, which Uchikoshi also created. These escape room scenarios help pad out N<em>o Sleep for Kaname Date</em> despite its much shorter length.</p>  <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname</i> has five chapters for you to play through, along with multiple “dead-end” endings.</p>

 <p>In the game, you’ll have to go through “Somniums” (different from the escape rooms) which are pseudo puzzles that you’ll need to solve in order to progress the story. During these Somnium investigations, you’ll be on a timer, so you won’t have time to examine every item. But examining every item unlocks “eyeballs,” which are in-game currency that lets you unlock bonus content for after you’ve beaten the main story (don’t worry, there are no real-world microtransactions). You can also earn more eyeballs by finding collectibles throughout the game.</p> <p>Some of the bonuses you can unlock include concept art and extra endings called “alternate alternate endings.” They cost a certain amount of eyeballs to unlock, and some of the bonuses may not appear until you’ve reached certain alternate endings in the story.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618125"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618125">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>You will have to replay certain chapters, Somniums, and escape room puzzles to find the alternate endings, but thankfully, the game’s flowchart notes which chapters have them. That way, you won’t have to blindly search for them.</p>

 <p>That being said, a full playthrough of No Sleep for Kaname Date should take you about 12-15 hours to complete, depending on how good you are at solving escape puzzles.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-achievements-does-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-have"></span>How many Achievements does <em>No Sleep for Kaname Date</em> have?<span></span></h2> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is available for Switch and Steam. While the former doesn’t have an achievement system, the latter does. Since this game is much shorter than the others, you’re looking at about an extra five hours to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <h2><span id="is-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-on-playstation-or-xbox"></span>Is No Sleep for Kaname Date on PlayStation or Xbox?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is only on Switch and Steam. While the previous two games are on all platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> has not been announced for PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618126"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618126">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, that doesn’t mean that developer Spike Chunsoft won’t bring them over later. 2023’s Master Detective Archives: Rain Code was a Switch exclusive until it came to all other platforms a little over a year later. Given <em>AI: The Somnium Files</em>, it’s definitely possible that <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> will arrive on other platforms in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date – From AI: The Somnium Files</i> launches on July 25 for Switch/Switch 2 and PC.</p>
