			<p>Additional information on the monsters, quests, and more that Monster Hunter Wilds will feature at launch may have been revealed thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-struggles-1080p-rtx-4070/">open beta</a> client.</p>
<p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterhunterleaks/comments/1glgv4p/brand_new_datamine_discoveries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TheNadei</a> reported that a friend of theirs took a good look at the beta client's files, discovering information that has yet to be revealed officially, including a list of monsters, the potential total number of quests, and more. <strong>There will be spoilers from here, so do not continue reading if you don't want any surprises spoiled.</strong></p>
<p>According to the information discovered by TheNadei, Monster Hunter Wilds should feature at least 30 monsters, including mainstays like Rathian and Rathalos, and some that haven't appeared in the series in a while, like Blangonga and Lagiacrus, as well as variations of monsters that recently appeared in the series like Anjanath and Odogaron. Additionally, the game should feature at least 164 quests at launch, with number 164 possibly being the final boss quest as it rewards the hunter with a massive amount of points.</p>
<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds open beta client also features new information on maps, which include 5 normal maps complete with NPCs and a special one, and weather states, which include sand storms, heavy rain, heatwaves, and blizzards. Interestingly enough, the open beta client also features data for breakable parts, which include antennae and trunks, suggesting that a Neopteron or Carapaceon monster could be in the game alongside an elephant-like monster like Gammoth.</p>
<p>As all of this information was discovered in the beta client, there's a good chance it is incomplete, and Monster Hunter Wilds will feature more monsters or other surprises when it launches in a few months. Still, it definitely looks like hunters will have plenty to do already at release.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th worldwide.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have finally revealed which patents Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are suing them about. It looks like they're focusing on the act of throwing capsular items to catch or release monsters, together with the usage of monsters as mounts.</p>
<p>If you've somehow yet to encounter Palworld, it's a bestselling <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game that takes hefty - some would say, scandalous - inspiration from Pokémon, with players poaching Pokésque critters using magic spheres, and deploying them as soldiers and minions.</p> <!--more-->
<p>When Palworld hit Steam in January, there was an outcry from some Pokémon players that it had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">broken Pokémon's copyright</a>. After an ominous interlude, Nintendo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-the-palworld-developers-for-infringement-of-patent-rights">announced legal proceedings against Pocketpair in September</a>, declaring that the corporation would "continue to take necessary actions against any infringement of its intellectual property rights including the Nintendo brand itself, to protect the intellectual properties it has worked hard to establish over the years."</p>
<p>Rather than going after Palworld's monster designs, which definitely look a hell of a lot like certain Pokémon, Nintendo claim Pocketpair have broken their patents on specific game mechanics. They didn't specify which patents at the time, but Pocketpair have now listed three in a <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">post</a> published today. They also report that Nintendo and the Pokémon Company are seeking an injunction against Palworld, together with late payment damages for the use of their patents.</p><p>The formatting of Pocketpair's post makes the exact amount sought in damages unclear - it could be that Nintendo and the Pokémon Company want five million yen each, or that they want five million yen in total. For clarity, the Pokémon Company isn't a Nintendo subsidiary but the result of a joint investment by the companies holding the copyright and trademark on Pokémon - Game Freak, Creatures and Nintendo.</p>
<p>"The Plaintiffs claim that "Palworld," released by us on January 19, 2024, infringes upon the following three patents held by the Plaintiffs, and are seeking an injunction against the game and compensation for a portion of the damages incurred between the date of registration of the patents and the date of filing of this lawsuit," reads the post.</p>
<p>The patents in question were all applied for and registered this year, after the early access launch of Palworld. They are: Patent No. 7545191, applied for on 30th July and registered on 27th August; Patent No. 7493117, applied for on 26th February and registered on 22nd May, and Patent No. 7528390, applied for on 5th March and registered on 26th July.</p>
<p>I've looked the patent numbers up on the <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/">Japan Platform for Patent Information</a>, aka J-PlatPat, which has Japanese-to-English machine translation. Here are their machine-translated overviews. There's a lot more detail on each patent page, of course, including diagrams, but it should give you a rough indication.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7545191/15/en">Patent No. 7545191</a><br>
"Determining, in a first mode, an aiming direction in a virtual space based on a second operation input, and causing, in a second mode, a player character to shoot, in the aiming direction, an item that affects a field character placed on a field in the virtual space based on a third operation input Based on the second operation input, the aiming direction is determined, and based on the third operation input, the player character is caused to shoot the battle character in the aiming direction."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7493117/15/en">Patent No. 7493117</a><br> 
"A sighting direction within a virtual space is determined based on second operation input in a first mode, a player character is allowed to release an item affecting a field character disposed on a field within a virtual space toward the sighting direction on the basis of third operation input, a sighting direction is determined based on second operation input in a second mode, and the play character is allowed to release a fighting character who fights toward the sighting direction on the basis of the third operation input."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-7528390/15/en">Patent No. 7528390</a><br>
"In one example of a game program, a riding object for ground or an aerial riding object is selected by a selection operation, and a player character is made to ride on the selected riding object. In the case that the player character riding on the aerial riding object moves toward the ground, a change is automatically made to a state in which the player character rides on the riding object for ground so that the player character can move on the ground."</p></blockquote>
<p>Pocketpair aren't backing down. "We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings," they write in the new post. They also aren't responding to individual media inquiries, for the moment - we'll all hear more via their website.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Warzone is set to get a huge overhaul with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a>, as the battle royale takes on Omnimovement, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99</a>, and a fresh set of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns</a>.</p>



<p>If you’re wondering when the Warzone x <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> Season 1 update is arriving, here are all the details you need.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date">Warzone Black Ops 6 Season 1 release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-new-area-99-map-arrives">New Area 99 map arrives</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-omnimovement-amp-guns-in-warzone">Black Ops 6 Omnimovement &amp; guns in Warzone</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-warzone-ranked-play-arrives-in-season">Warzone Ranked Play arrives in-season</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-looting-changes">Looting changes</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-black-ops-6-progression-carries-over-to-warzone">Black Ops 6 progression carries over to Warzone</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-warzone-black-ops-6-season-1-release-date">Warzone Black Ops 6 Season 1 release date</h2>



<p>Warzone’s first season under Black Ops 6 will begin on <strong>November 14 at around 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Prestige" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">downloadable update</a> brings a plethora of new content to the battle royale as well as Black Ops 6. Warzone Season 1 will include some huge gameplay, UI, and weapon changes too, as the devs aim to bring the battle royale more in line with BO6.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that it will also bring the brand-new Black Ops 6 Season 1 Battle Pass, which is filled with new weapons, Operators, and other rewards.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-area-99-map-arrives">New Area 99 map arrives</h2>



<p>A <strong>brand-new Resurgence map called Area 99</strong> arrives in Warzone Season 1. Set in the same classified facility as the multiplayer maps <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nuketown-manniquin-easter-egg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown</a> and Warhead, Area 99 is an ode to the iconic map that first arrived in the original Black Ops.</p>



<p>As well as Area 99, both Urzikstan and Rebirth Island will be returning. That said, it will be a slightly older version of Urzikstan, the version without Superstore.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-omnimovement-amp-guns-in-warzone">Black Ops 6 Omnimovement &amp; guns in Warzone</h2>



<p>Both <strong>Omnimovement and Black Ops 6’s arsenal of weapons</strong> will be brought to Warzone in Season 1. This means players will experience the all-new movement system that allows you to sprint, slide, and dive in every direction, as well as a new set of weapons.</p>



<p>The guns, Perks, and Equipment from Black Ops 6 will be implemented into the battle royale too. This brings the grand total of weaponry in Warzone to 177. This includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-weapons-black-ops-6-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">7 new weapons arriving in Black Ops 6 Season 1</a>, such as the Krig C and Saug.</p>



<p>Most of the weapons from previous titles will be unusable since Black Ops 6 weapons will be so dominant, so it’s not like players will be using guns from MW2 or MW3.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-ranked-play-arrives-in-season">Warzone Ranked Play arrives in-season</h2>



<p>The devs also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ranked-play-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play</a> for Warzone will be <strong>arriving in-season</strong>, which likely means the mid-season update.</p>



<p>It will likely follow a similar format to what has previously been seen in the battle royale and Call of Duty Multiplayer, where players climb Skill Divisions and earn Rank Points by performing well.</p>



<h2 id="h-looting-changes">Looting changes</h2>



<p>Warzone is getting some huge looting changes with the Black Ops 6 integration, as <strong>Backpacks are being removed and the inventory is reverting back to a more classic system</strong>, where there are set slots for your Equipment.</p>



<p><strong>Satchels are also returning</strong>, there will be an Armor Satchel that increases the amount of Armor Plates you can carry, and a Munitions Satchel, which allows you to carry more ammo.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-progression-carries-over-to-warzone">Black Ops 6 progression carries over to Warzone</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastery Camos system</a> will also make their way into Warzone. Battle royale players will have their <strong>rank reset to their Black Ops 6 level </strong>and will be able to unlock a <strong>new set of Mastery Camos through Warzone</strong>.</p>



<p>Playing and earning XP in Warzone will contribute to your overall level and Prestige progression, allowing you to continue <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-prestige-rewards-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unlocking rewards</a> just like in Multiplayer and Zombies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-19-million-players-since-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hideo Kojima announced that Death Stranding has had 19 million players worldwide, even before the game’s Xbox port was announced.</p>



<p>The news came from Hideo Kojima’s X account (formerly Twitter), where Kojima said that November 8th marks the fifth anniversary of Death Stranding’s release. During the thank you video, Kojima revealed that the game had sold 19 million units to date.</p>



<p>“We have expanded to various platforms, and currently, the number of porters has reached over 19 million worldwide, for which I am very grateful,” <a href="https://x.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1854779891046400213">Kojima said</a>.</p>



<p>Kojima’s announcement follows a surprise <span>shadow drop yester</span>day, in which the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-xbox-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding Director’s Cut was announced for Xbox</a> and released at a 50% discount. Death Stranding on the Xbox will be published by 505 Games.</p>



<p>Kojima Productions also announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company now wholly owns the Death Stranding IP</a>, implying that Death Stranding 2 will also be coming to the Xbox platform in the future. Death Stranding 2 is scheduled to release in 2025 on the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>That’s not all for the Death Stranding IP, either. Earlier this year, Kojima announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding has several adaptions in production</a>. </p>



<p>During&nbsp;<a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-hollywood-wme-1236157008/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his interview</a>, Kojima spoke about what the team is building with the Death Stranding IP:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are several “Death Stranding” adaptation projects currently underway, but there is a different story I’ve written that’s intended for a movie. But I don’t have the time to direct it, so I won’t.</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>The companies "will continue to work together on the smooth transition of services and operations".</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Amplitude Studios has reestablished itself as an independent studio after management bought back the studio from Sega.</p>
<p>Sega says the sale follows a "period of close consultation" between Amplitude and Sega management and "concludes the structural reforms that have been taking place in Sega's European business". The publisher previously canned its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-has-cancelled-hyenas">plans to launch live-service shooter Hyenas</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/total-war-developer-creative-assembly-refocusing-on-strategy-games-after-hyenas-failure">job losses at UK studio Creative Assembly as a result</a>.</p>
<p>Sega acquired Amplitude in 2016. It has released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/endless-space-2">Endless Space 2</a>, Humankind, and Endless Dungeon over that time.</p>

<p>"Sega Europe has today announced the sale of Amplitude Studios following a management buyout from senior leaders and employees at the Parisian studio. The move will see Amplitude go back to its roots as an independent organisation and concludes the structural reforms that have been taking place in Sega's European business," Sega said in a statement to press.</p><p>"The decision to part ways follows a period of close consultation between Sega Europe and Amplitude. As an independent studio once more, Amplitude will focus on its in-development projects and growing its own franchises, while Sega will continue to advance its strong and diverse stable of Japanese and Western IP.</p>
<p>"While Amplitude is no longer a part of the Sega family of studios, the two entities will continue to work together on the smooth transition of services and operations, ensuring minimum disruption for Amplitude employees and continuity of service for players of Amplitude games," Sega concluded.</p>
<p>"Amplitude is backed by strong, meaningful franchises, and our team is committed to creating the best games possible," said Romain de Waubert de Genlis, studio director.</p>
<p>"This decision allows us to be more agile in our approach while continuing to shape the vision that we've had from the beginning, empowering us to push boundaries and be closer than ever to our community."</p>
<p>As for what's still in store for Sega?

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro brings considerable visual and performance improvements in several titles, including Resident Evil Village, Resident Evil 4 remake, Demon's Souls, and others.</p>
<p>In the tests conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel/videos">Brazil Pixel</a>, the latest two entries in the CAPCOM survival horror series powered by the RE Engine show considerable performance improvements. Resident Evil Village, for example, runs at locked 120 frames per second in HFR without ray tracing at 1080p resolution, which is quite impressive to see on a console in a relatively recent game. The Resident Evil 4 remake, on the other hand, doesn't reach the same locked 120 FPS frame rate but does run close to 100 FPS in Frame Rate Mode without ray tracing, which is still quite impressive.</p>

<p>In a Tekken 8 quick test, Brazil Pixel also showed how the raw power of the PlayStation 5 Pro can boost games that use dynamic resolution even without a dedicated patch. Unfortunately, not every game can take full advantage of the console's power, such as Rise of the Ronin, which still suffers from performance issues even on the new system.</p>

<p>Among the games that were updated to take advantage of the PlayStation 5 Pro's power and features is also the Demon's Souls remake by Bluepoint Games. The recently released PS5 Pro patch introduces material-displaced contact shadows for all dynamic lights and 4K, 60 FPS support via PSSR upscaling, which makes one of the best-looking PS5 games to date look even better. These improvements can be seen in action in the comparison video below, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that PlayStation has sold 65 Million Units of the PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>The news came via the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q2 earnings results</a>, which revealed&nbsp;that the company had sold 3.8 million units in its last quarter, bringing the total number of PlayStation 5s sold to 65.5 million. The company reported that the last quarter saw a 29% reduction in PlayStation 5 sales compared to the same quarter the previous year.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the PlayStation 5 total sales are just behind that of the PlayStation 4, which sold around 67.5 million units, a 2 million unit difference. Earlier this year, PlayStation announced that it expects a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-sales-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued decline in its PlayStation 5 sales</a> as the console enters its latter half in the market.</p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom, though (if you could argue that anyway), as the company saw its biggest amount of Monthly Active Users for Q2 in its history at 116 million. The company saw 107 million Monthly Active Users during the same period last year.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>During the same earnings call, Sony also announced that PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units in its first 2 months</a>.</p>

            <p>Sales of Sony's PS5 consoles have now passed 65m units.</p>
<p>Sony says the growth in its game and network services division can be attributed to rising sales of its third party games, DLC, and PlayStation Plus subscriptions.</p>

<p>Despite hardware sales falling, however - compared to the same quarter last year, console sales dropped from 8.2m to 6.2m - PlayStation is reporting better hardware profitability.</p>
<p>Software sales are up, too. 131.3m games shipped in the first half of the financial year, of which 11.3m were first-party games. 1.5m of those alone come from Astro Bot, which only debuted at the beginning of September. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> has sold 13m copies across both PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The report also attributed its earnings boost to "a new sports title" - thought to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> - and "an action RPG title from China", which is likely <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation Plus subscriptions, however, have stalled at 116m. Whilst that's up from 107m year-over-year, there has been no additional growth since last quarter.</p>
<p>"We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period, that combines single-player games, which are our strength and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP, with live service games that pursue upside, while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release," Sony said.</p>
<p>Don't forget, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro is out now,</a> and we recently learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-was-already-working-on-ps5-pro-before-playstation-5-launch">Sony was working on the PS5 Pro console before it released the base PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

            <p>In all honesty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toads-of-the-bayou">Toads Of The Bayou</a> could have been several notches less ribbet-ing than its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2190400/Toads_of_the_Bayou/">Steam demo</a> ended up being, because its stylised pixel fly-snatchers are just that good. There’s only one of the three characters available in the freebie (one of the others is a toad nun with a shotgun), but he’s got a little cutlass, a flintlock pistol, and a can-do attitude - at least when it comes to either stabbing or shooting things. The game itself is a little bit deckbuilder, a little bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into The Breach</a>: turn based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> with perfect information and various tricks you can pull to make enemies hit each other instead of the thing you’re trying to protect.

<p>Toads Of The Bayou loves shops, is the first thing I found out about it. There’s four different ones in your home base, where you’ll lead a rebellion against Haitian Vodou figure Baron Samedi. You’ll select missions from a map, gather resources, then spent them on either more combat cards, companions, or single use traps and various other bufo-buffs. You’ve also got your own inventory of consumable items, and your starting toad generates barricades by killing enemies, which you can plonk down on a map - helpful, since most maps have an objective to project.</p>
<p>If you fail an objective, you’ll get ‘curse cards’ put into your deck, which can then show up randomly and ruin your day. Allegedly anyway, I was simply too good to have this happen. Cards cost action points, and there’s a few neat twists even in the small slice I played. Your movement card, for example, is free to play, but loses one movement per card you’ve played before it. So you can attack before moving, but you’ll be less effective. Some cards push enemies into obstacles for extra damage, and some let you switch places with them, which you can use to your advantage since they’ll be locked into their attacks by then. </p><p>There’s also permadeath, but it’s the fun kind that gives you upgrades for the next run. It all seems a fair bit more thoughtful and expansive than what I’d originally suspected, which was rote turn-based combat coasting on the back of its very good toads. But it does not coast, and the toads are better for it. It’s also out this month if you like the demo - 19th November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a>, Nvidia’s PC-focused game streaming service, will begin calling time on its most muscular of power users. A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">post on the GFN subreddit</a> announced the introduction of a 100-hour monthly cap (or "allowance"), effective from January 1st 2025 for anyone who signs up after that date. Existing streamists, or anyone who signs up by the end of 2024, will get a year’s grace period before the limit kicks in from January 2026.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Nvidia claim the vital importance of this hitherto completely unnecessary limit involves "providing exceptional quality and speed — as well as shorter queue times", and that 100 hours per month will "comfortably" accommodate 94% of current users. Obviously, if you are part of that remaining 6%, your newfound constraints won’t be reflected in any kind of subscription price cut or discount. But hey, you can always pay Nvidia <em>more</em> cash to unlock extra time. $6 for 15 hours on the Ultimate tier, to be exact, or $3 for 15 hours on the Priority tier, which is being renamed Performance.</p>
<p>15 hours of any unused time will also carry over each month, though even with these small concessions, I’m not sure that they’ll be enough to convince both heavy users and potential new customers to get on board. Would you sign up for <em>any</em> subscription service knowing it’s going to become materially worse in a year’s time? And for what purpose? Nvidia cite the relatively small proportion of users who’d exceed a 100-hour limit as justification for imposing it, but by that same logic, it’s only a handful of people jostling for that extra bandwidth. Anecdotally, I sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">use GeForce Now for playing Steam Deck games</a> that the handheld itself can’t handle, and I’ve never had trouble with queue times or streaming quality. If these 6% are a drain on the system, they’re being awfully polite about it.</p>
<p>What’s also a shame is that this "allowance" is being foisted alongside a range of other changes that, largely, sound quite good. The Performance-née-Priority membership will start offering 2560x1440 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-ultrawide-gaming-monitors">ultrawide</a> resolution options, with ultrawide previously being exclusive to the Ultimate tier, and both types are gaining the ability to save custom graphics setting configurations across different streaming sessions. Alas, the march of service decay continues, with the only way to continue enjoying unlimited streaming time being a GeForce Now Founders subscription – and those haven’t been available for new signups since 2021.</p>
<p>In other news, Nvidia this week <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-surpasses-36-trillion-market-value-after-trump-win-2024-11-07/">surpassed a market value of $3.6 trillion</a>, a global first that cemented their position above Apple as the world’s most valuable company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has announced that the PlayStation-exclusive Astro Bot has sold 1.5 million units in its first two months.</p>



<p>The news came via the company’s <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q2_supplement.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q2 earnings results</a>, which revealed that Astro Bot sold 1.5 million units as of November 3, putting the number just shy of two months from its September 6, 2024 release date.</p>



<p>Astro Bot received universal acclaim on review aggregator Metacritic, with the game receiving a 94 out of 100 according to 138 reviews.  Users also felt the same way, giving the game a 9.3 out of 10. Its universal acclaim has put the game at the forefront of being a likely winner for this years Game of The Year at The Game Awards, which takes place in December 2024.</p>



<p>Whether 1.5 million units sold is where Team Asobi and PlayStation hoped the game would be, remains to be seen, as either has yet to comment.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, Team Asobi has continued to support the game post-launch, offering <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-getting-a-new-speedrun-level-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weekly speedrun levels and new bots to collect</a>. </p>



<p>Astro Bot released on September 6, 2024 exclusively on the PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Sony's president Hiroki Totoki has reflected on the brief release and failure of the company's live-service flop, Concord.</p>
<p>Concord was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-pvp-shooter-concord-is-firewalk-studios-first-game">debut game from FireWalk Studios</a>, which on its announcement promised  players a "unique universe of vibrant worlds, and its rich cast of colourful characters". However, despite high hopes from Sony, the game failed to take off, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">a lacklustre launch</a>, the sci-fi shooter was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PS5 and PC debut</a>.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A following Sony's latest financial report, management was asked more about Concord, and the company's live service push. Here, Totoki said events from recent months had been a learning experience.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Currently, we are still in the process of learning," Totoki said via an interpreter (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-president-reflects-on-why-concord-failed/">VGC</a>). "And basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it.</p>
<p>"So for us, for our reflection, we probably need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates. And then we need to bring them forward, and we should have done those gates much earlier than we did.</p>
<p>"Also, we have a siloed organisation, so going beyond the boundaries of those organisations in terms of development, and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother.</p>
<p>"And then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximise our performance in terms of title launches.</p>
<p>"That's all I have."</p>

<p>Elsewhere during the same call, senior vice president for finance and IR at Sony, Sadahiko Hayakawa, noted the company had released two live service games, each with very different levels of success</p>
<p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both," the executive said.</p>
<p>"We intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p>"We intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games - which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP - with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release."</p>
<p>On its release in February, Helldivers 2 soon became beloved by swathes of players wanting to do their bit for liberty by squashing Terminids and, on occasion, each other. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/">Steam</a>, it reached a peak player count of 458,709. In contrast, Concord's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/charts/">Steam</a> all-time peak sits at just 697.</p>
<p>Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">shut down Concord developer Firewalk Studios in October</a>, extinguishing hopes for any kind of revival.</p>
<p>In September, Totoki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-concord-flops-sony-exec-says-company-doesnt-have-enough-original-ip">Sony didn't have enough original franchises</a> which it has "fostered from the beginning".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>In a lot of ways, Project ARC feels like a throwback to the good old days of PS3 and Xbox 360 era gaming, where the fledgeling Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network stores and the boom in console multiplayer led to a lot of innovative riffs on familiar concepts. In this instance, Project ARC takes the tactical shooter that’s dominated by Counter Strike and Rainbow Six Siege, and pulls the camera out to give a top-down isometric view.</p>
<p>To be honest, if you’re a regular CS or R6 player, that’s pretty much all you need to know to pique your interest.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Gameplay Trailer | Project ARC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIeVl5-yEdg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In our hands on with a mixture of devs and press, we played five matches split across the two game modes that the game will launch with. There’s the standard Team Deathmatch, which really feels like the lucid dream of an XBLA online twin-stick tactical shooter, and then there’s the mode that they’re calling Demolition, but is labelled as ‘Standard’ in-game. It has the, well, standard standard tactical shooter set up of one attacking team trying to reach one of two defended positions and place a timed bomb (sorry, the Decrypter), with all players having a single life per round. Oh, and there’s the ability for defenders to fortify, while attackers can break through destructible walls and windows.</p>


<p>Playing from a birds eye view, there’s an immediacy to how the game plays. You move with WASD, look with the mouse, and have to aim before you can fire –&nbsp;there’s no spray and pray here, which I very quickly discovered. The other thing I very quickly learnt is that crouching is a big deal. It lets you hide behind the waist-height cover, and anyone that’s stood up will shoot right over your head by default, giving you a split second advantage until they press the button to aim down at you, or shift to crouching themselves.</p>
<p>But crouching isn’t necessarily going to win you every fight, because battlefield awareness is everything, and you can’t see what’s going on if you’ve got your face buried in a hedge. Vision is actually a shared resource here. All players having a clearly defined cone of vision to their front, and a smaller radius of awareness around them, casting light and shadow through windows, doors and around obstacles, dynamically revealing and obscuring the enemy. You get to see everything that your teammates see, though, which instantly gives you a lot more understanding of what’s going on around the map –&nbsp;though this is handily assisted with a quick ping function as well.</p>

<p>As is pretty much inevitable for new online games, there’s a roster of stylised characters for you to choose from, each with a particular set of main and side weapon, a gadget ability, and then an item that you can select, depending on whether you’re attacking or defending. They’re not the most tactical looking bunch –&nbsp;there’s a Yakuza-looking guy, a shirtless chap with tattoos, a lady with a gold halter top and shiny puffer jacket, and a guy in a big cowboy hat –&nbsp;but they do have some good and distinctive styles of play and their roles and teamwork can really shine in Demolition.</p>
<p>You can pick any character whether you’re attacking or defending, and also double up on characters as well, but some are naturally intended for one side over the other – why bring the sledgehammer guy when you’re defending, and not the trip mine guy? You don’t need to smash through the boarded up walls when defending, but will rather want to use the ability to strengthen certain panels, and then place cover or barbed wire to slow the attackers.</p>
<p>Attackers can come from pretty much any direction, with multiple spawns to choose from, and I quickly felt the value of trying to coordinate efforts, whether splitting up to come from two sides or bull-rushing with the full team of five from one attack angle. You can obviously play for the elimination win, but playing the objective can also force the issue, whether that’s timing out the round as a defender or forcing them to counter-attack once you’ve placed the Decrypter.</p>

<p>There’s a lot more nuances here that we didn’t really delve into with just an hour’s playtime, and PUG Studios note that each firearm has its own sway and recoil characteristics, while aiming can be targeted at much more than just the high-low of standing and crouched –&nbsp;it does pay to mouse over an enemy to get the range right, I did feel –&nbsp;and obviously we only had the most basic of strategies start to emerge within Demolition.</p>
<p>Most importantly, I had a good time playing. There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.</p>
<p>Project Arc is currently only announced for PC and set for early access in 2025.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, BioWare <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1845910/view/4453590197273100466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the first <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> patch after the game's launch on October 31. The patch, around 1GB in size, is largely focused on a variety of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where DLSS options could end up “grayed-out” on a 40-series Nvidia GPU.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where some customizations were not applied to the Inquisitor correctly</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Companion Skill Points to reset.</li>
<li>Adjusted Companion Approval notifications so they remain on-screen longer as scenes end.</li>
<li>Harding now has arrows in her quiver and is ready for battle.</li>
<li>Global banter should no longer start too early.</li>
<li>Harding and Taash banter no longer repeats indefinitely.</li>

<li>Updated a number of assets to improve visual performance over long distances.</li>
<li>Fixed several distance “pop-ins” on level art assets.</li>
<li>Added collision to several assets that were missing it.</li>
<li>Fixed a minor texture issue with codex art.</li>
<li>Added haptics to a number of interactions and events.</li>
<li>Fixed lip sync in some ambient scenes.</li>
<li>Adjusted audio balance on several Dragon Age: The Veilguard assets.</li>
<li>Changing equipment no longer disables helmet voice processing.</li>
<li>Fixed several objective markers that were spawning improperly.</li>
<li>Cleaned up certain interactions between Skills that caused them to not behave as described.</li>
<li>Apparitions generated by Iron Veil will now attack</li>
<li>Entropic Spheres now behave properly on vertical surfaces.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where Taunt would sometimes be cleared early, which caused enemies to ignore it.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare issue where Rogues would not hold their bow while aiming down sights.</li>
<li>Made the detailed-stats screen more readable.</li>
<li>Balance changes made to certain fights to match design intent.</li>
<li>Balance adjustments made to several player skills.</li>
<li>Fixed leashing exploits on major encounters.</li>
<li>The Rage Demon’s Ring of Fire should now be appropriately dodgeable in all situations.</li>
<li>Slowed down the speedy raven in Hossberg.</li>
<li>Adjusted creepy corpse movement while they moved on/off-camera.</li>
<li>The Dalish elf in the Unwanted Guests quest is now an actual elf.</li>
<li>Fixed a rare blocking issue in the Sea of Blood quest.</li>
<li>Halla should no longer float during the In Entropy’s Grasp quest.</li>
<li>Fixed a blocking issue in the Pinnacle of Its Kind quest.</li>
<li>Adjusted timing on epilogue text cards.</li>
<li>NPC necks no longer grow unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Corrected instances where Dragon Age: The Veilguard NPCs would not properly look at each other or at Rook.</li>
<li>Long hair should now properly mesh with certain armor.</li>
<li>Fixed several issues with makeup in character creation.</li>
<li>Venatori crystal VFX should now disappear properly.</li>
<li>Added scroll wheel support to the sell screen.</li>
<li>Opening the journal while on the map no longer causes it to continue scrolling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, BioWare also added a Mass Effect themed cosmetic armor to Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is entirely appropriate since the patch dropped on N7 Day. You'll find the armor in a new chest near the Caretaker's Workshop in the Lighthouse, on the condition that you have completed Harding's mission called The Singing Blade.&nbsp;That wasn't the only news Mass Effect fans got yesterday, by the way: there's a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series in development at Amazon Prime Video.</a></p>
<p>As for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the game peaked on Steam at 89.4K concurrent users last weekend. We'll see if it can top that this coming weekend.</p>

            <p>Could tower defence be the ultimate "it's Friday and I am here in body only" genre? I haven't really thought about it before, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rift-riff">Rift Riff</a>'s effusively laidback crowd control has me pondering those optimal moments in any tower defender when the incoming horde hits the flamer-MG triangle <em>just</em> right, and you can settle back comfortably into the role of clockwatcher.</p>
<p>Rift Riff encourages this behaviour by being nice to look at. Created by a trio of developers including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hidden-folks">Hidden Folks</a> designer Adriaan de Jongh, it's a world of spacey, sun-carved mountains, forests and monoliths. The towers resemble the sacred architecture of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monument-valley">Monument Valley</a>, and the colour scheme and general ambience remind me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cocoon">Cocoon</a>. There's a demo, if you fancy it.</p><!--more-->
<p>Rift Riff's singleplayer offerings are split between several dimensions. In each dimension, you build a home base and surround it with synergistic fortifications to stave off waves of marauding inkblot creatures, using their spilled "juice" to fund additional structures. It's an "open field" tower defender, with attackers emerging from portals around the map rather than following strict lanes (you're told how many are coming from each portal before rounds, but not what kind), and construction permitted only on certain sites.</p>
<p>In the demo, you get rapidfire turrets, tall sniper's eyries, AOE-lobbing cannons, and thumpers which slow attackers nearby. There are more towers and upgrades to unlock between dimensions, while roaming an Eschery hive of obsidian staircases.</p>
<p>The full game is out in 2025. If I had a request, it would be more playfulness with the fundamentals. Give us some of the old Hidden Folks whimsy - what John Walker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hidden-folks-review">called</a> "the feeling of a puzzle book that's magically come alive, a Where's Wally where you get to poke and prod the characters". Anyway, you can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2800900/Rift_Riff/">Rift Riff</a> on Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed details of Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit which alleges that the game infringes on multiple patents. 
</p>
<p>
The monster battling and catching game had frequently been compared with Pokémon since its launch for PC and Xbox Series X/S in January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company's lawsuit was filed</a> just weeks before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">Palworld's PlayStation 5 version launched at the end of September</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108">revealed</a> that the lawsuit relates to three patents filed between February and July this year - after Palworld's launch. However, they relate to a pre-existing "parent" patent filed by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company in December 2021, preceding Palworld's launch, meaning they could indeed still apply to Palworld now.
</p>

<p>
The developer also stated that Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are seeking "an injunction against Palworld", presumably to block its future sale within the Japanese jurisdiction of the patent lawsuit, as well as a fine of 10m yen (around £50k) split between the two firms, plus "late payment damages".
</p>
<p>
So, what are the patents Palworld is accused of infringing on?
</p>
<p>
As expected and sniffed out by fans and industry watchers previously, Nintendo's patents numbered 7545191, 7493117 and 7528390 lie at the heart of this legal action. These all cover gameplay mechanics such as the capture of digital creatures and the ability to ride on them. 
</p>
<p>
We previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">highlighted the first of these patents in particular as likely behind the Palworld lawsuit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
The patent in question describes how a character catches a Pokémon by aiming and throwing a capture item, like a Pokéball, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes "owned by the player".
</p>
<p>
In Palworld, players catch Pals by aiming and throwing a capture item, named a Pal Sphere, at a creature. Upon successful capture, the creature then becomes owned by the player.
</p>
<p>
Japanese patent attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara previously dubbed the document a "killer patent" that would be "easy to infringe". 
</p>
<p>
Writing today, Palworld said once again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">it would continue to fight the case</a>. "We will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings," it said.

            <p>Earlier this week, we learned of Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick's response to Borderlands' "disappointing" silver screen debut, and now, Lionsgate CEO has commented publicly, too, saying that "nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong".</p>
<p>Jon Felthemier blamed "reshoots and rising interest rates" for Borderlands' weak performance, but admitted that "the success of [Lionsgate's] financial models doesn’t take the place of also getting the creative right".</p>

<p>"On Borderlands, nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong: it sat on the shelf for too long during the pandemic, and reshoots and rising interest rates took it outside the safety zone of our usual strict financial models," the Lionsgate boss said during Thursday's earnings call.</p><p>"Coupled with softer-than-anticipated results for other releases in the quarter", Felthemier said there was "less margin for error than ever before", with "several of [its] other releases in the quarter, though cushioned by financial models that worked as intended, [also not] living up to either our standards or our projections".</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said in Take-Two's own earnings call earlier this week that though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">"disappointing", the movie hasn't hurt the Borderlands video game series</a>. In fact, it gave it a boost.</p>
<p>This year's Cate Blanchett-fronted film was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>.</p>
<p>The adaptation generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As part of its Q2 FY 2025 financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20241108_q2_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>, SEGA has announced the sale of Amplitude Studios, the Paris-based studio known as the developer of Endless Space, Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Endless Space 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/humankind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humankind</a>, and more recently, Endless Dungeon. SEGA explained this concludes its wave of restructuring the European business, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included</a> the sale of Relic Entertainment and substantial layoffs.</p>
<p><em>The Group recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately ¥5.9 billion ($38.7 million) in the second quarter for the fiscal year due to the sale of overseas development studio Amplitude Studios SAS through a management buyout.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] The above-mentioned sale of Amplitude Studios SAS has been implemented as part of structural reforms in Europe that the Group has been working on since September 2023. The Group deems that this marks the completion of the series of structural reforms and will work toward realizing a business structure that further focuses on the strengths going forward, thereby tackling achieve regrowth in the European business.</em></p>
<p>SEGA has also discussed the 're-growth of the European business' for its two remaining studios, Sports Interactive and Creative Assembly. The former delayed Football Manager 2025 from November to March to ensure the game's quality. They changed the development engine to Unity, renewed the user interface, enhanced the graphics, and also integrated female football and acquired the full license for the Premier League. For its part, Creative Assembly registered increased sales for Total War: Warhammer III (mainly thanks to the Throne and Decay DLC) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total War: Pharaoh</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has reported its Q2 2024 financial results today, revealing that its PS5 console has now reached 65.5 million units sold. Hardware sales were slightly down year-over-year: whereas 3.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles were sold this past quarter, Q2 2023 saw 4.9 million PS5s sold.</p>
<p>However, this was more than offset by the increased sales elsewhere in the PlayStation department. For example, game software for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles reached 77.7 million units sold this quarter, a 14.94% increase compared to Q2 2023's 67.6 million units. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/sony-s-music-lineup-and-image-sensors-deliver-profit-beat?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, this was largely because of the outstanding success of Game Science's action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, which is said to have sold around 20 million units (though that includes the PC version). Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a> also performed rather well, selling 1.5 million units as of November 3, which is around two months after its launch.&nbsp;Even network services were more profitable for Sony. The PlayStation Plus subscriber base remained at 116 million monthly active users (MAUs), just like in Q1 2024; it was at 107 million units in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>The highly positive Q2 2024 led Sony to revise its gaming forecast upward for the full fiscal year results. Sales have been upped by 4% compared to August's estimate, mainly due to increased sales from third-party games, while PlayStation's operating income has been revised upward by 11%, also thanks to an improvement in hardware profitability.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Sony's fiscal year ends on March 31. As such, it will certainly benefit from big releases like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Monster Hunter Wilds, both slated for February 2025. But it's the next fiscal year that could be massive for PS5 game and hardware sales, with heavyweights like Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Mafia: The Old Country, Ghost of Yōtei, and of course, Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>The latter, in particular, could help the console catch up to its predecessor (it's currently trailing behind since the PS4 had sold 67.7 million units at the same point in its lifecycle). The impact of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released PS5 Pro console</a> also has yet to be seen, with Sony hoping it will account for around 20% of the sales from now on, just like the PS4 Pro.</p>

It launched to critical acclaim, with IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot review</a> returning a 9/10. We said: “A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Astro Bot’s sales aren’t up there with some of Sony’s big hitters (Helldivers 2 remains the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with an incredible 12 million sold in 12 weeks), it compares favorably to other recently released family friendly platforms. In Europe, launch sales of Astro Bot were 34% higher than those of 2022’s Sonic Frontiers and 52% bigger than those of 2020’s Crash Bandicoot 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put Astro Bot’s sales success into more recent context, Sega’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-1-million-units-on-launch-day-sega-reveals">Sonic x Shadow Generations hit the one million sold mark on its launch day of October 25</a>, according to Sega. But that game launched across multiple platforms and generations, whereas Astro Bot is a PS5 exclusive. Astro Bot sales will surely continue to grow as we head into the crucial holiday shopping season and gamers look to buy a PS5 or the recently released PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All 173 PlayStation Characters in Astro Bot - Easter Eggs</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Asobi has continued to support the game since launch with a number of updates that have added speedrun challenge levels and new cameos to rescue. At launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot"><u>Astro Bot</u></a> featured 173 bot cameos from PlayStation games past and present (check out IGN’s feature, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs"><u>Astro Bot: Every PlayStation Character - Easter Eggs</u></a>, for more).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-says-we-really-respect-the-choice-of-each-publisher-amid-final-fantasy-cameo-absence">iconic Final Fantasy characters were conspicuous by their absence</a> — an omission fans were quick to pick up on in the context of Final Fantasy's long-standing association with PlayStation. That means no Cloud from Final Fantasy 7, or any other character from the famous role-playing franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

But, the son she left at home has.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/">Deadline</a>'s sources, Macaulay Culkin has joined the cast for season two of Fallout, in a recurring role. Further details on his part remain slim for now, however Culkin is said to be playing "a crazy genius-type character" when the show's second season rolls around.</p>
<p>As Deadline notes, Culkin has already worked with Amazon before, cameoing in its adult animated series The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy, alongside his brothers.</p>

<p>Culkin will be joining cast members Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins - who play wide-eyed vault dweller Lucy, squire of the Brotherhood of Steel Maximus, disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean and the gunslinging Ghoul, respectively - when the Amazon's Fallout series makes its return.</p><p>As for when that will be? According to Leslie Uggams, who starred as Vault 33 Overseer Betty Pearson in the first season of Fallout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">filming for season two will begin this month</a>.
