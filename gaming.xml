There's plenty of excitement going into the day, which also makes it one of the best times to check out the best deals on everything Pokémon. </p><p id="tldr-best-deals-today"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="TL;DR - Best Deals Today"><strong>TL;DR: The Best Pokémon Day Deals</strong></h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's restocks or price reductions on the latest and greatest Pokémon TCG releases, or some sizable discounts for almost every Pokémon game on Nintendo Switch - I've done the hard work for you, and found the best offerings available today. </p><p id="pokmon-tcg"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG">Pokémon TCG: Restocks and Best Prices</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quite surprisingly, there's actually a whole lot of great Pokémon TCG restocks and deals available right now online, with Amazon having some of the best around. The online retailer has gone through something of a massive restocking mission this week, and at just the right time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Day Finds at Amazon</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest highlights from Amazon's selection include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8xdJ?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ascended Heroes - Elite Trainer Box</a>, now available and in stock for trainers to freely buy. It's matching market price, at $119,99 as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QV5X2x?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Day 2026 Collection</a>, which, considering the ongoing 30th anniversary celebration, should absolutely be at the top of your buy list right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Besides those standouts, I also wanted to highlight the Prismatic Evolution themed <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1K3X?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Pokémon Day 2025 collection</a> that released last year. Listed for $40.64, Amazon has recently restocked the special edition set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It includes two Prismatic boosters, a special metallic Eevee coin, and a foil Eevee card that features a unique Pokémon Day 2025 logo. That's absolutely worth picking up alongside the new 2026 collection, if I say so myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to call out availability on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q451rd?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames - Three Pack Blister</a>, for $32, alongside the Mega Lucario ex Figure Collection, and several of the Scarlet &amp; Violet Unova series, like the Poster Box, Tins, and Illustration Collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Day Finds at TCGplayer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGplayer has also pulled out all the stops for Pokémon Day, and has several of the most popular Pokémon TCG sets in stock and at market price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of sealed sets, I want to highlight the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Perfect Order booster boxes</a>, which are currently available for <a href="https://zdcs.link/z642Ll?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$201.18 market price at TCGplayer</a>. That's a remarkably good price for the upcoming set releasing on March 27, and probably one of the best deals I've seen all year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring 36 booster packs, you're looking at about $5.50 per pack, which is as close to MSRP as I think we're ever going to get. Compare this to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjbY8?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames booster boxes</a>, which are currently going for $320 or more, this is a huge saving. I'd snap this up ASAP before prices spike again as we get closer to release day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My next best suggestion is to consider The Pokémon Center Exclusive Ascended Heroes ETB, which is currently available for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8lvM?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$246.84 market price at TCGplayer</a>. Considering this was selling for $400 just a few weeks back, I'd consider this one of the best deals available right now for the biggest Pokémon TCG fans out there.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nintendo Switch Games">Nintendo Switch Games on Sale Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon’s Woot store has been known to offer a bunch of deals in the past, but it might just have outdone itself this time around with its <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1K2w?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">brand new "Video Games For All!" sale</a> that includes a whole slew of Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch. Just use promo code LEVEL20 to access the new bargains.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest standout is on Legends Z-A, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrJXRm?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>which is down just $35.92 on Nintendo Switch</u></a>. IGN's Rebekah Valentine gave the game an 8 out of 10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><u>in her review last year</u></a>, saying “Pokémon Legends: Z-A finally feels like Game Freak hitting its stride in Pokémon’s 3D era, with a fun setting to explore, a well-written story, and a total battle system overhaul that works surprisingly well.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can upgrade to the Switch 2 version digitally as well for just $10 after making your purchase, making this a certified bargain. But, and this is a big but, these are certified Pokémon Day deals that <em>will </em>expire by the end of today (February 27, 11:59 PM CT, to be exact). So, act fast to avoid disapointment.</p><p id="funkos-toys-and-plushies"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funkos, Toys, and Plushies">Pokémon Funkos, Toys and Plushies</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I couldn't wrap things up without at least mentioning several amazing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-plushies">Pokémon plushies</a> that are on sale at Amazon right now.

<h2 id="h-the-clue">The Clue</h2>



<p>When you first enter the office, you will notice a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">notepad</strong> sitting on a table. This notepad holds the key to the puzzle, but the indentations from the previous writing are currently invisible, and you need a specific item to show the solution.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-pencil">Where to Find the Pencil</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Chairmans-Office-Pencil-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Without the pencil, you will never discover the puzzle box's combination</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reveal the code, you need to find a writing utensil. Proceed to the smaller <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">office in the back</strong> connected to the main room.</p>



<p>There is an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy</strong> lurkinghere. If you have enough ammo, defeat it to search in peace. If you are low on health or ammo, you can avoid the enemy, quickly grab the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pencil</strong> from the desk, and retreat back to the main room.</p>

<p>Once you have the Pencil in your inventory, return to the main office. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Use the Pencil</strong> with the blank notepad.

<h2 id="h-the-reward">The Reward</h2>



<p>Inside the box, you will find the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Moon Quartz</strong>. This is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">three critical items</strong> required to escape the Rhodes Hill Care Center.

While this choice is often down to <strong>personal preference</strong>, the distinct gameplay styles of Grace and Leon mean that <strong>one perspective usually outshines the other</strong>, depending on who you are controlling.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-best-camera-settings" data-level="2">Best Camera Settings</a></li><li><a href="#h-grace-why-first-person-works-best" data-level="2">Grace: Why First-Person Works Best</a></li><li><a href="#h-leon-why-third-person-works-best" data-level="2">Leon: Why Third-Person Works Best</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-best-camera-settings">Best Camera Settings</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Camera-Options-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You can change between first-person and third-person camera at any time</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you want the most polished experience, I recommend <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">First-Person for Grace</strong> to maximize the horror atmosphere and <strong>Third-Person for Leon</strong> to master the combat, which are the exact same recommendations the game provides at the very beginning. </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">You can change your camera options for each individual character from the Camera tab in the Options menu at any time during gameplay</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-grace-why-first-person-works-best">Grace: Why First-Person Works Best</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Grace-First-Person-Gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>First-person camera is the most immersive in Grace's segments</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For Grace’s segments, which lean heavily into atmosphere and exploration, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">first-person is the optimal way to experience the game</strong> for a few reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Grace's segments, the camera often shifts to first-person during cutscenes. If you are playing in third-person, these transitions can feel abrupt and immersion-breaking. Staying in first-person ensures a seamless flow between gameplay and certain story beats.</li>



<li>A minor but noteworthy difference occurs during frantic escape sequences: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace can trip in third-person, but not in first-person.</strong> While this doesn't happen constantly, avoiding a stumble during a chase can be the difference between life and death in certain situations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-leon-why-third-person-works-best">Leon: Why Third-Person Works Best</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Third-Person-Gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Third-person camera works best for Leon mostly due to combat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Leon’s segments in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em>, on the other hand, are built around intense combat against a high number of enemies, making <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">third-person the superior choice for his segments.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Leon often faces much larger groups of enemies than Grace. The wider field of view provided by the third-person camera is <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">essential for keeping track of multiple threats</strong>, preventing you from being surrounded, and allowing you to respond quickly with a shotgun blast or a well-timed parry.</li>



<li>While first-person can be beneficial for precision aiming, Leon can find specific <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gun parts</strong> that allow him to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">aim down sights</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">in first-person</strong> with weapons other than sniper rifles, even while the general camera remains in third-person. This gives you the accuracy of a shooter without sacrificing the spatial awareness needed to survive some of the sticky situations he finds himself in often during the game.</li>

			<p>Surviving the nightmare in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong></em> requires more than just solid shooting skills. Whether you are navigating claustrophobic halls as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace Ashcroft</strong> or engaging in intense combat sequences with Leon S. Kennedy, understanding some of the game's underlying systems is the difference between life and death, especially if this is your first entry in the series.</p>



<p>To help you understand and enjoy the game right from the get-go, we have put together the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">best tips for beginners</strong> based on a full playthrough of the game at the highest possible difficulty for a new game run: Standard (Classic).</p>

<h2 id="h-learn-when-and-how-to-fight">Learn When and How to Fight</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Stealth-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Stealth is often the way to go in Resident Evil Requiem</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although just one part of the experience, <strong>combat</strong> remains one of the core elements in Resident Evil Requiem. While <strong>Leon has much better tools for handling multiple enemies&nbsp;at once</strong>, <strong>Grace is not built for combat</strong>. She is a fragile investigator, and her resources and weapon selection are far more limited. As such, for her, the best strategy is to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fight enemies only when absolutely necessary</strong>.</p>



<p>When forced into an encounter, <strong>always aim for headshots or leg shots</strong> to stagger your enemy. Once dazed, move in for a <strong>melee attack</strong> to knock them down. This buys you precious time to either finish them off efficiently with easier headshots or, more importantly, escape the room entirely.</p>



<p>One very important element to consider for both Leon and Grace is <strong>stealth attacks</strong>, which grant you the chance of taking out an unsuspecting enemy. While Leon can do this repeatedly with his <strong>hatchet,</strong> Grace requires a <strong>Hemolytic Injector</strong>, which can be found by exploring locations or by crafting (<strong>1 Scrap + 60 Blood</strong>), so keep this in mind if you're running low on ammo, but have some of these Injectors on hand.</p>



<h2 id="h-master-the-map">Master the Map</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-East-Raccon-City-Map-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Using the map, you will never get truly lost, no matter where you are</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">level design</strong> in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> is <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">intricate</strong> as per the series' tradition, and it is easy to l<strong>ose your bearings</strong> in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center or the vaster Raccoon City. Thankfully, <strong>the map is your best friend.</strong></p>



<p>If you frequently feel lost, make sure to <strong>check your map frequently</strong>. <span>The game is generous with its&nbsp;<strong>map markers,</strong>&nbsp;and any locked door </span>you encounter, or item you leave behind, is automatically noted on your map. As such, if you ever find yourself lost,<strong>just open the map</strong> and look for rooms with a door outlined in red or any other icon: <strong>the solution is usually staring right at you.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-use-crafting-effectively">Use Crafting Effectively</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Crafting-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The crafting system has some nuances to understand to be used effectively</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>crafting system</strong> works differently for Leon and Grace. While the classic series' protagonist only needs to find <strong>items</strong> to craft additional ammo and healing items,  the FBI's inspector has to use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Infected</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Blood</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Scraps</strong> to craft items. </p>



<p>Already in the Rhodes Hill Care Center, Grace will find <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Blood Transfusion Bags</strong>, which allow her to recharge the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blood Collector</strong>. When using Blood Transfusion bags, make sure to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">wait until the entire amount can be used</strong>. If you use a bag when your injector is nearly full, <strong>any surplus blood is permanently discarded</strong>. In a game where every drop counts for crafting healing items, ammo, and injectors, wasting blood is a mistake you should not make.</p>



<h2 id="h-learn-advanced-reloading">Learn Advanced Reloading</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Advanced-Reloading-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Reload Canceling is a very useful technique that can make battles more manageable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most useful expert techniques in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> that is not properly explained until later in the game is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Reload Canceling</strong>. </p>



<p>If you find yourself in a bind and can't afford to wait for a long reload animation to finish, you can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cancel the operation at any time by pressing L2</strong>. This allows you to immediately transition to a shooting stance or reposition more easily if an enemy gets too close during a reload.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-adjust-aim-assist">Don’t Be Afraid to Adjust Aim Assist</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Aim-Assist-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Aim Assist can make the experience more enjoyable if you are not skilled at shooters</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> features intense action,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> it is not a high-speed shooter</strong>. The focus of the game is the survival horror experience and its haunting atmosphere. </p>



<p>If you are not a veteran of the genre and find combat too challenging for you, do not hesitate to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adjust the Aim Assist settings</strong> in the options menu. </p>



<ul>
<li>With <strong>Aim Snap</strong>, your character will immediately lock onto the nearest enemy. </li>



<li>With <strong>Aim Follow</strong>, your character will keep aiming at the enemy even when they are moving, making it easier to shoot them repeatedly without having to readjust your aim manually. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The effect in both settings can be tweaked with the Aim Assist slider, which ranges from 1 to 10.</strong></p>



<p>As there's <strong>no real penalty</strong> for using any of the settings above, you should use the tools provided to make the experience more manageable while you learn the enemy patterns if you're having trouble.</p>

<p>While the game introduces the mechanic early on, the tutorial doesn't tell you everything you need to know about it. Here is how to master the parry and save your skin in the most intense fights.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-basics-of-parrying">The Basics of Parrying</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Leon-Parry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The core of Leon’s combat mechanics in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> lies in his hatchet. By holding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">L2 / LB / L</strong>, you can enter a defensive stance to deflect incoming blows.</p>



<ul>
<li>Every time you parry an attack, your hatchet will lose sharpness. If it goes blunt, you lose your primary defensive tool until it's sharpened by holding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">L2 / LB / L</strong> and pressing <strong>Square / X / Y</strong>. Sharpening takes some time, so make sure to do so while standing away from enemies.</li>



<li>Keeping <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">L2</strong> held down is the safest way to avoid taking direct health damage, but it is not the optimal way to play as it drains a lot of durability without providing any other advantage other than negating damage.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-perfect-parry">The Perfect Parry</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Perfect-Parry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>To truly master Leon's combat, you should always aim for a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Perfect Parry</strong>. This is achieved by <strong>pressing L2 / LB / L at the exact moment the enemy attack connects.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Perfect Parry leaves an enemy staggered and wide open for a high-damage follow-up or a  finisher, if its health is low enough.</li>
</ul>



<p>While this is one of the <strong>best moves</strong> in Leon's kit, it is also the most <strong>risky</strong>. Don't attempt perfect parries against powerful enemies you have never fought before, especially in Standard (Classic) difficulty, as you risk receiving a lot of damage. Instead, <strong>take the time</strong> to learn enemy patterns so as to attempt perfect parries with the highest confidence</p>



<h2 id="h-which-attacks-can-you-parry">Which Attacks Can You Parry?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Which-Attacks-Can-Be-Parried-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The way the in-game tutorial frames the mechanic, you might think you can <strong>only parry enemies wielding weapons</strong> like debris, pipes or chainsaws. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">That is not the case</strong>!</p>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em>, you can parry <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">barehanded attacks</strong> just as effectively as weapon strikes, and even nullify ranged attacks like thrown debris. Like for perfect parries, learn the enemy attacks to master this defensive mechanics and destroy the undead hordes coming at Leon as he makes his way through the Rhodes Hill Care Center and Raccoon City. Do note that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some attacks cannot be parried</strong>, so learning the enemy attack patterns remains paramount for using Leon's parry effectively.</p>

			<p>Choosing the right difficulty in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> is an important first step that can change the enjoyment of your first playthrough quite a bit, as some of the changes between the different difficulty settings have a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">deep impact on the experience.</strong></p>



<p>Here is the breakdown of the <strong>best difficulty settings</strong> to choose for your first run.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-standard-classic" data-level="2">Standard (Classic)</a></li><li><a href="#h-standard-modern" data-level="2">Standard (Modern)</a></li><li><a href="#h-casual-mode" data-level="2">Casual Mode</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-standard-classic">Standard (Classic)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Standard-Classic-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>If you're as much a zombie slayer as Leon, Standard (Classic) is your choice</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For those who have been playing the series for a very long time, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Standard (Classic) is the way to go</strong>. This mode is designed for veterans who want to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem </em>at its best.</p>



<ul>
<li> Enemies are slightly stronger than in Standard (Modern), making every encounter feel more tense and dangerous.</li>



<li>Grace’s segments are more in line with classic entries in the series, requiring much tighter management of your limited supplies.</li>



<li>In this mode, Grace needs <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ink Ribbons to save at typewriters</strong>.</li>



<li>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are strictly limited, meaning death carries a considerable penalty.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-standard-modern">Standard (Modern)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Standard-Modern-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Standard (Modern) retains the series' intensity while providing a fai</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> amount of ease</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you are a complete newcomer to the franchise, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">I suggest trying out Standard (Modern) first</strong>. This mode provides a relatively smooth experience that doesn't completely gut the game's atmosphere.</p>



<ul>
<li>This mode lacks the Ink Ribbon requirement found in Classic, allowing for a smoother flow for those who don't want to manage save items.</li>



<li>High stakes are what the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em> series is all about, and while this difficulty mode is not as challenging as Standard (Classic), it does a good job keeping some of the high stakes of the experience intact. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode">Casual Mode</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Casual-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Casual Mode is your choice only if you want to blaze through the story</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The easiest difficulty, <strong>Casual Mode</strong>, should be played only by <strong>absolute newcomers or those who wish to blaze through the story.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Combat encounters in this mode are easy and generally lack the signature tension of the series.</li>



<li>Ultimately, playing in Casual Mode strips the game of its core elements, creating a dissonance between the story's tense narrative and a way too high ease of gameplay, which feels like a disservice to the game's design. However, if you start on Modern and find it too intense, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">you can switch to Casual at any time after starting the game</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, unlike the Chairman’s puzzle box, you cannot interact with this one straight away. You’ll need a specific item to bypass a physical lock first.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is out today on the Switch 2, and if you're planning on jumping in, there's a day one patch.</p>
<p>This information comes from Nintendo's official Japanese website. According to the notes, Version 1.1.0 contains "several fixes". It doesn't go into any specific details, but mentions how this should be applied before playing the game.</p>
<p>If this update isn't already preinstalled when you boot the game, you'll likely be prompted to download it.</p>

<p>The "core visual identity" has been preserved</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's a huge week for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> series with the arrival of the latest entry <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. For Switch 2 owners, this is one of the first <em>major</em> third-party releases to hit the platform alongside other versions, so how does it hold up? The talented team at Digital Foundry has now taken a look at the port for Nintendo's hybrid platform, and overall, Capcom has done a respectable job here, even if there are some shortcomings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Capcom has preserved the core visual identity of the game, delivered a pretty convincing mobile version and leveraged the hardware's not-so-secret weapon - DLSS - to make this conversion defy the console's necessarily limited specs. The missing piece is frame-rate discipline, something we'd hope to see Capcom look into with a future patch."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>As for the specifics, Switch 2's internal resolution has been "slashed" to 540p in docked but Nvidia's upscaler puts the image quality ahead of the Xbox Series S version. The user interface is also fixed at 1080p on Switch 2. As for handheld mode, the game renders at "just 360p" but DLSS once again saves the day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"On paper, a 540p image blown up to 1080p on a modern flat panel display doesn't sound great. However, DLSS (likely the full CNN-based variant, comparable to PC) looks surprisingly competitive...The handheld story is even more extreme, but somehow a 4x resolution upscale from 360p to 720p (likely with a basic upscale to the screen's 1080p) still manages to look fine."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the performance front, the Switch 2 runs at an unlocked frame rate across both modes and targets 60fps. It doesn't hit this target "a lot of the time" but mostly runs in the 40s and 50s docked, with the lowest dips reducing the game to 30fps. In handheld, you can expect the game to "knock off a few frames in comparable spots".</p>

<p>As part of the Switch 2 experience, there are some minor cutbacks from a visual standpoint, but they apparently don't impact the run of play. Geometry is pared back, there are lower-quality textures, and Capcom has taken a different approach to character hair on Switch 2. Variable performance could also "use some work".</p>
<p>On the plus side, the level loading times are "very quick", and reloading a save is also relatively fast. For a more comprehensive rundown, be sure to check out Digital Foundry's full review.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The trailer for <em>We Are So Cooked</em>, a nice, cozy co-op physics stealth game about trying to hide a dead body with your friends, dropped today <a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/2018088867174203808">after the game went viral for its premise</a> earlier this month.&nbsp; The trailer does a good job of highlighting the particular challenges of trying to stealthily remove a dead body from a busy hotel, from abundant security cameras to the body’s floppiness. The game, which comes from indie developers Dwarven Brothers, premiered its trailer on <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2027075581406220756">Geoff Keighley’s X account</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DVOtmTwDOF5/">The Game Awards Instagram</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We Are So Cooked.</p> <p>First trailer for new indie co-op physics stealth game. </p> <p>You’ve accidentally killed someone, and now you have to get rid of the evidence. <a href="https://t.co/G34FieuScm">pic.twitter.com/G34FieuScm</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2027075581406220756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Though the game is technically playable solo, individual players will face extra challenges. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4258290/We_Are_So_Cooked/"><em>We Are So Cooked</em>‘s Steam page</a>, “dragging the body alone is slow and leaves a bloody trail,” and “You can hold an item, OR you can drag the body. You can’t do both. You’ll have to scream at your friends to open doors for you.” Co-op play doesn’t guarantee an easier path to victory, though: you’ll have to dodge security guards, dogs, and other hotel guests while trying to navigate down stairs and around corners with an awkward, heavy dead body that seems determined to slip out of your hands. You’ll have to come up with a solid plan and work together carefully to avoid dropping the body—the description warns that “if you pull left and your friend pulls right, you’re going to drop him down the stairs.”</p>

 <p><em>We Are So Cooked</em>‘s lighthearted approach to manslaughter is a nice respite from co-op games with heavier themes, like Hazelight Studios’ fun-looking but actually harrowingly grim divorce game <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-the-best-co-op-game-of-the-year-is-comin-1847973764"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>. At least you and your fellow players are on the same page in this one. <em>We Are So Cooked&nbsp;</em>is set to release sometime in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[An Ode To Pokémon’s Ash Ketchum]]></title>

            <guid>1447915</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On September 8, Ash Ketchum’s final <em>Pokémon </em>episodes will premiere on Netflix. After 25 years and over 1,200 episodes, the anime has retired its long-time protagonist and is moving on to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-trailer-liko-roy-ash-pikachu-sprigatito-1850184012">new main characters Liko and Roy</a> as they embark on a journey throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> world. Depending on who you ask, this is either a bittersweet end of an era, or a necessity for the <em>Pokémon </em>TV show to move in new, exciting directions. But regardless of whether or not you think Ash and his quest to be a <em>Pokémon</em> Master should have been kicked to the curb years ago, a pillar of nearly every fan’s <em>Pokémon </em>journey is coming to an end.</p> <p><em>This story was originally published on September 5, 2023.</em></p> <p>For me, Ash was, and largely still is the quintessential anime protagonist from my childhood, beating out characters like Yugi from <em>Yu-Gi-Oh! </em>or Goku from <em>Dragon Ball </em>as the most formative character of my early years. His relationship with his partner Pikachu has embodied friendship and informed my internalized role-playing with my own Pokémon in every single game. But even so, my connection to <em>Pokémon </em>has changed over the years, and my viewership of the anime Ash starred waxed and waned.</p>

 <p>Even if I hadn’t watched the show in a bit, I, like many other fans, felt a great sense of pride for the kid from Pallet Town after he became a Pokémon world champion at the end of his final season. But that also probably meant his time was limited. Shortly after, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-and-pikachu-new-season-liko-roy-1849903499">confirmed it would be leaving him behind</a>. Even those of us who’ve fallen off the show often still view Ash as central to our own <em>Pokémon </em>journeys, and for a long time, it felt like he would be a fixture for every <em>Pokémon </em>fan, no matter when they started watching the anime.</p>  <h2><strong>For long-time fans, Ash’s departure is the end of an era</strong></h2> <p>“I felt unexpectedly emotional when I heard that Ash was finally being retired,” Keza MacDonald of <em>The Guardian</em> (previously of <em>Kotaku</em>) told me. “He seemed like one of those perennial characters, an ageless fixture. If my kids get into <em>Pokémon</em>—and I’ve shown them a few old episodes of the anime, we’ll see how it goes—they’ll be growing up with different aspirational trainers.”</p>

 <p>MacDonald echoed a sentiment I felt as a child. When I was growing up adults often talked down to us for loving <em>Pokémon.</em> What they didn’t realize was that it was a power fantasy for kids who felt trapped and beholden to their parents’ rules, and yearned to embark on their own journeys alongside their friends and determine who they wanted to be on their own terms.</p>

 <p>“There was an emotional core to <em>Pokémon</em> in the early days that’s still there,” she said. “To adults, it looked like this hyper-commercialized, manufactured phenomenon, designed to sell toys and lunchboxes, but to kids it meant something. Actually, <em>Pokémon</em> is a classic children’s story and Ash is a classic children’s character: the child out on their own, in a world where adults don’t get to call the shots, forming their own relationships and forging their own way.”</p> <div>  <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p>Even as Ash and Pikachu haven’t aged in their decades-long run, <em>Pokémon </em>fans have, and that means a lot of people grow out of the show at some point. As such, you can probably reasonably tell how old someone is by asking them what their favorite scenes from the series are. If you talk to a millennial, they’ll probably mention episodes like when Ash released his beloved Butterfree so it could stay with a pink-colored mate. That still sticks, because it was devastating for us as children. Hell, even going back and watching it as an adult, that shit hurts so good. Ash’s story revolves around perseverance, determination, and connection, but equally deals with letting go, facing loss, and picking each other off the ground.</p>

  <p>“I think the moment that sticks with me the most is at the end of the Indigo League arc, when he loses,” writer Sam Greszes told <em>Kotaku</em>. “I was a kid when I saw that, but I understood what kid shows looked like. And though <em>Pokémon</em> is by no means the first, only, or even best anime to do this, for me, watching that episode was my first experience watching a protagonist fail at his overarching goal. […] It felt nice. Made me think about what you achieve, learn, and discover along your way to a goal, and how making connections can help you through crushing failures.”</p> <p>Younger fans often see Ash as a cool adventurer who gets to go on all these incredible journeys around the <em>Pokémon </em>world, or you might view him as an overly optimistic kid with no real flaws, but for adult fans like streamer Josh Vasquez, his selfless optimism and heroics have taken on new, greater meaning. In the <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>season, there’s an episode called “Lumiose City Pursuit!” in which Ash and Pikachu are trying to subdue an enraged Garchomp, and in the struggle, the little yellow guy is knocked off the Lumiose Tower (think <em>Pokémon</em>’s equivalent of the Eiffel Tower in Paris), and Ash jumps from this height to save his friend.</p> <p>“[There was] no hesitation,” Vasquez said. “He is of course saved but when he jumped, he didn’t know he would be. He jumped to save his friend thinking he would likely die. Ash has done things like that before but I think at the time being a little older it really hit. I was living on my own and moved to a new state and was still getting used to being away from friends and family. So I think seeing that show of love and friendship really hit home for me in the moment.”</p>

 <p>This gradual, rediscovered appreciation for Ash is a trend among adult fans I’ve spoken with since The Pokémon Company announced the protagonist’s departure.</p>  <p><em>Pokémon </em>is a “kid’s first anime” that serves as a gateway into more complex stories within the medium, and that tends to result in a backlash toward Ash as a protagonist. He’s an easy character to sum up, best known for his enthusiasm and tenacity, so as we transition from an equally optimistic child into a jaded adult, Ash can feel like a boring, flat character. But part of growing up is learning that relentless positivity is often more bold or interesting than nihilism, so we may also experience a “softening” toward the character as we grow older.</p>

 <p>“In my later teens and college, I found the character trite, but as I’ve grown into adulthood, I’ve come to appreciate how pure the character is even more than ever, I think,” Greszes said. “There’s something to be said for someone who has one goal and wants to achieve it his way, through friendship and connection. It’s his one reason for being. One singular guiding star, one that never goes out. A purpose. We should all be so lucky.”</p> <h2><strong>Can Ash Ketchum stand tall alongside his anime protagonist contemporaries?</strong></h2> <p>But where does Ash stand in the grander pantheon of anime protagonists? When a character has been around for over 25 years and 1000-odd episodes there’s such a deep well of story to draw from and talk about, which is why anime fandom is an entire subcategory of the <em>Pokémon </em>community distinct from the video games, trading card game, or its <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-original-stitch-sitting-cuties-merch-center-1850507835">lifestyle-brand merchandise</a>. That gives creators like Tom Speelman and Tyler Gorman plenty of fodder for their long-running podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/gotta-recap-emall/id1476705429" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Gotta Recap ‘Em All</em></a>. After watching the early episodes and movies, Speelman disputes a lot of the criticisms that claim Ash is a less-than-compelling anime protagonist. On the contrary, he thinks Ash’s empathy and determination make him a great character, rather than just a symbol of <em>Pokémon</em>’s larger ideals of friendship and determination.</p> <p>“[He’s] far from the single-minded blank POV character many wrongly remember him as from hazy childhood memories,” Speelman told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Ash really is an amazing anime protagonist. Over and over again, even at the comparatively early stage our show is on, he sets himself apart from nearly every other Pokémon trainer by being empathetic, kind, and understanding toward people and Pokémon. […] Ash may be more devoted to battling than common sense, but it’s his compassion and determination that made him a hero to, well, generations of fans. Now that he’s ridden off into the sunset, it’s truly remarkable just how far he’s come.”</p>

 <p>Part of that dismissive attitude toward Ash as a protagonist can come from not watching the show for several years and misremembering the details. Sometimes when adults rewatch those episodes they find a deeper, more emotionally mature character than history gives credit for.</p> <p>“Watching the anime again and podcasting with my co-host Tom have given me a huge new respect for [Ash],” Gorman said. “Seeing him openly cry in moments of sadness and joy rather than trying to hide it has been one of my favorite details I’ve picked up on.”</p>  <p>Because Ash has been at the forefront of the franchise for as long as he has and has seen so many different sides of the <em>Pokémon </em>world, the character has moved through different stakes, drama, and even writing styles over the years. Those early seasons showed Ash as the determined, empathic, and brave hero he has always been, but amid a slightly edgier tone than more modern anime seasons have. There was a sass to the writing of Ash that lent earlier seasons a more all-ages humor that kept the anime fresh for even aging fans. Nowadays, Ash still has his feisty moments, but the cutting sarcasm and comedic timing have fallen off as the franchise has ironed out some of the hero’s characterization.</p> <p>A lot of those rougher edges have been more apparent in the <em>Pokémon </em>movies, which underwent a reboot of the continuity separate from the anime starting with 2017’s <em>Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You!</em> (the one in which Pikachu <a href="https://kotaku.com/perhaps-the-most-surprising-thing-about-the-new-pokemon-1796974292">speaks a whole-ass sentence to his trainer</a>). Broadly, even as the weekly anime has become more of a slice-of-life show, the films Ash has starred in have depicted some of his closer scrapes with death, which probably explains why they made the movies’ timeline diverge and gave Ash new friends to meet and battles to face. But even before this, Ash was shown to be a character malleable enough to go from low-stakes 23-minute episodes to 90-minute epics in which he and Pikachu fought gods. As a protagonist, one of his greatest traits is that he believably exists in so many sides of this expansive world, but does the criticism that he’s just not that deep linger? Perhaps.</p>

  <p>“Ash Ketchum, with all his personality and boneheadedness, is about as standard of a shonen protagonist as you can get,” Greszes said. “He’s fueled by friendship, competition, and one single solitary brain cell, on a quest to Become The Best, Like No One Ever Was. It’s Deku, it’s Soma, it’s Luffy, it’s Ichigo, it’s a standard framework that was pretty rigid even in 1996. The thing that makes Ash special is the meaning we all found in him between the lines.”</p> <p>To fans like podcaster Luke Herr, Ash and the <em>Pokémon </em>anime’s necessity to facilitate a larger franchise has kept him stagnant over the years, which some believe has become more apparent as the anime’s gone on.</p>

 <p>“I’d give him a trophy for having a long career but a lot of the run time was kind of cookie-cutter to keeping the IP going,” Herr told <em>Kotaku</em>. “[This] is admittedly a little unfair, since it is a show for kids, but he didn’t need to change or evolve, as much as even like Gon from <em>HunterXHunter</em>—who changes more and is around a similar age—or Gohan [from <em>Dragon Ball</em>]. Like he did a great job at his job, but it didn’t require that much.”</p> <p>Vasquez, meanwhile, argues Ash has earned a spot in the conversation of great anime protagonists, at least. As much as some would claim he is an airheaded professional athlete with a cute mascot character on his shoulder, his arc—going from a bullheaded kid aspiring to some vague idea of being a Pokémon Master to someone who realizes that the connections he’s made were the real goal—is well-realized.</p>

 <p>“I don’t think he’s associated as much with the likes of say Naruto or Goku, but I believe the mark of a great anime protagonist is earned strength,” he said. “Not just through dedication and training but also strength of relationships and emotional maturity. Even the theme song went from wanting to be ‘the very best like no one ever was’ to ‘I’ll go anywhere if I’m with you’ in the final season. It doesn’t have to be all about the win. Ash learns that gradually through his journey. That’s what makes him the best to me.”</p> <p>That is the realization Ash finds <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-pikachu-final-episode-synopsis-1850261580">in his final episode</a>. After being asked by his original rival Gary if his championship win against Leon has brought him closer to being a Pokémon Master, Ash determines that the title isn’t what made him a Pokémon Master. No amount of training, gym badges, or trophies makes you a Pokémon Master, it’s about being friends with every critter you meet. Whether that be a Pikachu you got from your hometown professor, or meeting actual <em>Pokémon </em>god Arceus and helping him out.</p> <h2><strong>As Ash rides into the sunset, </strong><em><strong>Pokémon </strong></em><strong>has a new path to follow</strong></h2> <p>The conflicting feelings on Ash’s departure speak to a general conflicting feeling around him within the community. For over 25 years, the <em>Pokémon </em>anime followed the same hero who had the same goals. Greszes makes the comparison to the Greek mythological figure Sisyphus, who is forced to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity. Ash has been trying to reach the goal of being a Pokémon Master for all this time, and the need to keep him aspiring to the same things kept him in a “loop of failure.” Allowing him to win a championship and do something else frees him from this never-ending quest, but also gives the show a new place to go by seeking out new stories like Liko and Roy’s.</p> <p>“Ash Ketchum literally spent decades getting that boulder up the hill,” Greszes said. “This was, ostensibly, a way to make the character more interesting and extend his arc, but was also a way to enable his growth, enable him to pursue other adventures and other goals in pursuit of a goal that stood tantalizingly out of reach. And recently, after decades of adventures alongside friends and rivals, he got that boulder up the hill. There’s nothing left to do now.”</p>

  <p>When I <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947">interviewed Sarah Natochenny</a>, the voice of Ash since 2006, shortly after it was announced Ash would be walking into the sunset, she talked about how her journey as an actor has had parallels with Ash’s journey to become a Pokémon Master. For fans, myself included, Ash symbolizes learning about who you are in a world that feels vast and unknowable at a young age, and that the journey to learn about this world is best taken together. I don’t know many people who watched Ash’s story unfold in its entirety, but every <em>Pokémon </em>fan I know has taken that spirit with them as they’ve embarked on their own journeys. It is sad that the series is losing that universal constant that transcends age and time, but in its place, perhaps the <em>Pokémon </em>anime will find new stories to tell. Hopefully what Ash represented will stay with the series, even as he and his Pikachu walk into the sunset on a journey we’ll no longer follow.</p> <p>“I really hope that emotional core of <em>Pokémon</em> that Ash represented endures: empathy, determination and bravery,” MacDonald said.</p>

<p>This year, Sony San Diego is heavily promoting the brand new Trade Hub, which they’re calling a one-stop shop for all the deals players will make as Franchise general managers. The logic across all trades has been updated. Players will have access to a more complex system that takes into account several factors, including season standings, market size, rivalries, and more.

              <p>Well, folks, it seems like billionaire nepo baby David Ellison is probably going to get his way after all. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-paramount-trump-bidding-war-2000651372">throwing a hissy fit</a> because Warner Bros. Discovery agreed to <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">sell its company to Netflix</a> instead of the Ellison-owned Paramount Skydance, Ellison launched a months-long campaign, including a hostile takeover bid that appealed directly to WBD shareholders, to get the company to reconsider.</p> <p>Netflix decided to put an end to Ellison’s aggressive posturing by allowing Paramount Skydance to submit a best and final offer for WBD earlier this month—and WBD’s board has now found that new offer to be a “company superior offer.” Netflix had four days to respond and raise their bid, but, in a surprise move just hours after Paramount’s superior offer news broke, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-declines-to-raise-offer-for-warner-bros-1236738005/">Netflix declined to raise its bid</a> and dropped out of the running. This has left the door wide open for a Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery merger.</p>

 <p>Paramount Skydance’s new offer of $31 per share for WBD’s entire portfolio, including its cable channels, puts the deal at roughly $111 billion. Netflix had offered $27 a share for only Warner Bros.’ film studio and HBO Max, a deal worth approximately $83 billion. In a press statement, Netflix co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said, “…this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.”</p> <p>The Netflix deal was also facing increased regulatory scrutiny from a group of <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-warner-bros-deal-bad-for-america-attorneys-general-1236735795/">Trump-aligned attorneys general</a>.&nbsp; A Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery merger will likely have an easier path to approval, thanks to the Ellison family’s close ties to the Trump administration. Ellison’s apparent willingness to cave to Trump’s outrageous demands, as demonstrated by a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">$16 million lawsuit settlement</a> Paramount paid out to Trump, is a deeply troubling sign about the integrity of the person who will soon own Batman, among many other culturally significant properties. Read Netflix’s full statement below.</p>

 <p><em>Netflix, Inc. today announced that it has declined to raise its offer for Warner Bros. Netflix had earlier received notice from Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) that its Board of Directors has determined Paramount Skydance’s (PSKY) latest proposal constitutes a “Superior Proposal” under the terms of WBD’s existing merger agreement with Netflix. Netflix issued the following statement in response from co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters:</em></p>

 <p><em>The transaction we negotiated would have created shareholder value with a clear path to regulatory approval. However, we’ve always been disciplined, and at the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match the Paramount Skydance bid.</em></p> <p><em>Warner Bros. is a world-class organization, and we want to thank David Zaslav, Gunnar Wiedenfels, Bruce Campbell, Brad Singer and the WBD Board for running a fair and rigorous process. We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.</em></p>

 <p><em>Netflix’s business is healthy, strong and growing organically, powered by our slate and best-in-class streaming service. This year, we’ll invest approximately $20 billion in quality films and series and will expand our entertaining offering. Consistent with our capital allocation policy, we’ll also resume our share repurchase program.</em></p> <p><em>We will continue to do what we’ve done for more than 20 years as a public company: delight our members, profitably grow our business, and drive long-term shareholder value.</em></p>
