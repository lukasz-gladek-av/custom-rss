            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playstack and developer LocalThunk have announced that&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, and there's more good news for fans of the poker roguelike as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1821184859974344853" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Playstack and LocalThunk say that&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hit 2 million sales. Given that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million">marked its million-sale milestone</a> back in March, another million certainly won't hurt for the two studios, although it's clear (albeit understandable) that sales have somewhat slowed down since&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s release.</p>
<p>As well as announcing the new sales milestone, LocalThunk and Playstack have also revealed that the first major&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>update is due to arrive next year, and it'll bring "new ideas and strategies to the game". It'll also be totally free "as a token of huge appreciation to the game’s brilliant and passionate community".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-sales-2-million-shop.jpg?itok=yMz2n5a5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-sales-2-million-shop.jpg?itok=otiRjYD- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>is getting a major free update next year.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not all, either. The two studios are also teasing more "surprises" for&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>in the coming weeks, so it sounds like it won't be long before we hear more about what's coming to the poker roguelike.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it's one of the biggest indie smash hits of the last few months. The game combines poker gameplay with roguelike mechanics, introducing the possibility to swap out cards for synergies and build bespoke decks to take on its many challenges.</p>
<p>The game features a campaign mode that offers eight different difficulty levels to suit players of all abilities, as well as challenge runs and different seeds to keep you on your toes. Together with the upcoming free update, it's not likely you'll run out of stuff to do in&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>anytime soon.</p>

<p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has proven a bona fide sensation; it took just a couple of weeks for the game to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million">cross the half a million mark</a> in sales, and it's arguably just grown in popularity and cultural cachet since then.</p>
<p>It's also one of two major recent hits for publisher Playstack. Earlier today, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-600k">announced</a> that sales of its survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>&nbsp;have crossed the 600,000 mark, so it looks like Playstack's star is in its ascendancy.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>. There's no word of a console version being on the horizon, but perhaps that's the news LocalThunk and Playstack are cooking up for later this summer. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Exactly one year (and four days) after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s version 1.0 release, developer Larian is celebrating the highly acclaimed RPG's first anniversary by releasing a whole bunch of revealing players stats. Which, among other things, confirm that 30 percent of the 30 percent of players who opted to sex Halsin sexed Halsin in bear form.
</p>
<p>
Larian's <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770">newly unveiled birthday stats</a> get pretty granular, and I'll be glossing over the spoiler-y ones here (as well as the ones that mean absolutely nothing to me because I'm still prancing round the crash site right at the start desperately wishing I had more time to play). Instead, let us discuss the more universal revelations, such as the news 75m companion kisses have been shared in Baldur's Gate 3 over the last year, with 27m of those landing on the lips of Shadowheart, while 15m were planted on Astarion's puckered mouth-hole. And right at the bottom of the smoochy charts? Poor old Minthara with just 169,937 kisses. Which, let's be honest, is probably still way above average for most people.
</p>
<p>
And while we're on the subject of romance, it should be noted that around 197K players opted to bang Halsin in his now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-the-baldurs-gate-3-bear-sex-scene-came-to-be-and-why-its-a-watershed-moment-in-game-history">legendary bear form</a> (out of the 658K players total that danced down O-street with the hunky Wood Elf Druid), while approximately 407K people were up for mind flayer tentacle sex when the opportunity arose. Absolutely no kink-shaming here.

In slightly less erotic matters, the Paladin has proven to be the most common class pick for Baldur's Gate 3 players, being almost twice as popular as last-place pick, the Cleric. As for the most popular race pick, that'll be elf, which has been chosen nearly five times as much as the halfling, down at the bottom. Elsewhere, Scratch the dog was petted over 120m times, officially making him the goodest boy, while 141,660 players attempted to pet His Majesty - and are now, presumably, scraping their faces off the floor. Curiously, exactly the same number of players managed to complete Baldur's Gate 3's hardcore Honour Mode, so read into that what you will.

For the more spoiler-y stats, you'll be wanting to head over to Larian's <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1821186927779004770">illuminating series of posts</a> on social media - but I think it'd be remiss of me not to at least leave you with the news that 1.9m players got themselves turned into cheese. A feta worse than death, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Larian does, of course, still have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-seventh-patch-amends-split-screen-adds-mod-support-wont-be-final-update">few things up its sleeve</a> before it's ready to wave goodbye to Baldur's Gate 3 for good, with incoming features including mod support (currently in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-7-closed-beta-delayed-due-to-dice-rolling-issue">closed beta</a>), crossplay, a photo mode, gameplay tweaks, and quality-of-life improvements.
</p>
<p>
As Larian boss Swen Vincke recently confirmed, a Baldur's Gate 4 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">briefly toyed with</a> before the studio opted to tackle something new instead. And while Larian is yet to formally reveal its next project, it <em>has</em> confirmed two games are currently in the works - both based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described by Vincke</a> as "our best work ever."

Not anymore. </p><p>An announcement over on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/change-to-item-exclusivity-in-future-fortnite-battle-passes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Fortnite</em> website</a></span> outlines changes moving forward that will bring some battle pass rewards to the Item Shop with at least an 18 month delay. Here’s how Epic describes the shift:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Items in future Fortnite Battle Passes might be offered for purchase in the Fortnite Shop <strong>after 18 or more months from the Battle Pass’ expiration</strong>. A Battle Pass item may include a different number of its alt Styles each time it comes to the Shop.</p><p>This change lets us continue investing in new and exciting Battle Pass rewards while enabling players down the road to also enjoy the content, including Outfits based on popular licensed characters.﻿</p></blockquote><p>The “might” there means that Epic isn’t guaranteeing that <em>every</em> item will eventually be resold, preserving the current incentive to unlock it from the battle pass. This change also only applies to rewards moving forward. So old skins from <em>John Wick</em>, <em>Spider-Man</em>, and more will remain locked for anyone who didn’t already earn them and doesn’t have a time machine. The total number of alt styles available on skins if and when they’re resold will also vary, except for Lego versions which will always be included by default. </p><p>This is essentially Epic giving players 18 month advance warning that anything they unlock in a battle pass moving forward might show up on an opponent who is just able to buy it from the store. That will no doubt ruffle some feathers who feel a sense of “you had to be there” is an important element of <em>Fortnite</em>’s social contract. Other players will probably wish this change was retroactive so they had a shot at buying past costumes they missed out on. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Spectre Divide was revealed in full mere days ago, with the community responding positively to this innovative and ambitious first-person shooter. It looks as though it’s poised to rival the likes of VALORANT, and it has been developed hand-in-hand with Michael ‘shroud’ Grzesiek, a former competitive gamer and one of the biggest streamers in the world.</p>



<p>Players eager to get their hands on the game won’t have to wait long – the closed beta will start on August 13 and run for a week until August 21.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-into-the-spectre-divide-closed-beta">How to Get Into The Spectre Divide Closed Beta</h2>



<p>Per Mountaintop’s instructions, there are two ways to get access to the Spectre Divide closed beta.</p>



<p>First, you can watch streams on Twitch and earn invitations via Drops. If you’d rather be a little more direct, you can request access to the closed beta through Steam. That’s as simple as navigating to the game’s page and clicking ‘Request Access’. If you’re successful, you’ll be granted a spot in the closed beta in no time at all.</p>



<p>Spectre Divide aims to be disruptive, and the team at Mountaintop has devised a unique ‘duality’ mechanic that’ll help the game to stand out from the competition. With this mechanic, players can assume control of two bodies in the same game, allowing them to be more strategic than ever before.</p>



<p>When it’s released in full, Spectre Divide will feature ranked play, weekly competitions, and hopefully, a solid esports ecosystem. If it’s managed properly, it could be a true rival to the likes of VALORANT and Counter-Strike 2.</p>

Motorcycles, APCs, tanks, and exosuits eventually made it to the original twin-stick shooter, and with the Patriot and Emancipator Exosuits already having made their way to the sequel, it wouldn’t be surprising if more mobility options follow.</p><p>The larger size of Helldivers 2 maps compared to Helldivers 1 lend themselves even more to ways to get around them expeditiously. From the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:MC-109_Hammer_Motorcycle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MC-109 Hammer Motorcycle</u></a> for the lone wolves, to the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:TD-110_Bastion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TD-110 Bastion</u></a> and <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:M5_APC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>M5 APC</u></a> with their heavy firepower, there are tons of exciting ways Arrowhead could retrofit these vehicles from Helldivers 1 to fit within the gameplay context of the sequel.</p><p>Not only would vehicles bring new ways for players to traverse maps more quickly, take down larger enemies more efficiently, and strategize in new and interesting ways, but the opportunity for hilarity cannot be understated. </p><p>Social media (or at least my social media) has been full of people recording ridiculous moments of friendly fire, Stratagems gone wrong, or watching as their fellow Helldivers jump off cliffs just to showcase the amazing ragdoll effects the game has. It’s that physics engine that would make for even more laugh-out-loud moments with the addition of vehicles, as you accidentally run your friends over, tumble away as you attempt to exit a moving vehicle, or watch, powerless, as your teammate drives headfirst into a Charger, launching you both into the air. They could even go a step further and introduce something like a rideable rocket that requires your sacrifice, but allows for a truly targeted strike. Who knows! The possibilities are endless.</p><h2>Different Stratagems</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/02/15/vlcsnap-2024-02-15-02h21m50s298-1707992541308.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But a rideable rocket would be less of a vehicle and more of a stratagem. Well, they’re all Stratagems, but you know what I mean. Stratagems for heavy weapons and tactical deployments are some of the game’s most interesting mechanics, and honestly the thing Arrowhead seems most keen to add more of over time. We’ve already gotten the two Exosuits, and the Airbust and Commando rocket launchers since launch. But there are still a bunch more from the first game and even some gameplay mechanics that have yet to be introduced in Helldivers 2.</p><p>For instance, the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:TOX-13_Avenger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TOX-13 Avenger</u></a> was a support weapon stratagem in Helldivers 1 that spat toxic sludge like a flamethrower, giving the Terminids a taste of their own medicine. There was also the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:M-25_Rumbler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>M-25 Rumbler</u></a> mortar, which would give players control over their mortar strikes, and more emplacement turrets like the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:AT-47_Anti-Tank_Emplacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AT-47 Anti-Tank Emplacement</u></a> and <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:A/RX-34_Railcannon_Turret" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>A/RX-34 Railcannon Turret</u></a>. There were drones that <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:AD-289_Angel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>healed teammates</u></a> and <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Humblebee_UAV_drone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>boosted UAV signals</u></a>, <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Distractor_Beacon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>distractor beacons</u></a>, and even <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Close_Air_Support" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an Eagle Airstrike variant</u></a> that uses air-to-air missiles. Honestly, every one of these feels interesting and worthwhile for certain situations that would apply to Helldivers 2, and I hope that each of them make their way to the game eventually. Especially that last one, so I finally have a better way to deal with Shriekers and Gunships.</p><h2>More Weapon Types</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2-escalation-of-freedom-1721742365253.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>While there are already a good, healthy number of weapons available to Helldivers in the second game, there are still a few from the first that could shake things up for the meta if implemented. For instance — HELLDIVERS 1 HAD A SWORD. It was called the <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:Saber" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Saber</u></a>, and it was everything you could ever dream of. Please give us a sword, Arrowhead. But beyond that, there was also a <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:FLAM-24_Pyro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>flamethrower pistol</u></a>, a <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:DBS-2_Double_Freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>double barrel, double trigger shotgun</u></a>, and even a <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Helldivers_1:LAS-12_Tanto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>laser-powered submachine gun</u></a>. But my favorite has to be the hilarious and useless M2016 'Constitution' that’s just a copy of the classic M1903 service rifle from WW1 with a bayonet for melee attacks. There are a ton of fun ideas for weapons and I think we’re starting to see them get weird with it since the recent introduction of <a href="https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/K-2_Throwing_Knife" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Throwing Knives</u></a>.</p><p>Another, smaller element that Helldivers 2 could improve upon with input from the first game is the idea of Loadouts. Having to manually equip everything from armor to guns to Stratagems and boosters for every mission is tedious, and a Loadout system would be huge. It’s a wonder why that wasn’t one of the features that made its way over immediately from the first game. Whatever the case, I hope they’re able to implement that one really soon.</p><h2>AND MORE ENEMIES</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/helldivers2escalationoffreedomtrailer-ign-blogroll1-1721744259706.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In terms of new enemies, that’s the one place where everyone is looking to the first game for answers. The Illuminate were the third faction of Helldivers 1, and were another robotic life form like the Automatons, but more sleek and sophisticated rather than Terminator-esque. They rode around in circular, floating vehicles and used energy- and electricity-based weaponry, as well as energy shields. They were difficult, and required players to change strategy (and Stratagems) in order to take them down. It’s this kind of diversity that will keep players coming back as new and intriguing things are introduced. The Illuminate, however, I could see being a further-off plan, one for an even larger expansion. Maybe a big “year two” type deal.</p><p>In the meantime, there are ways to breathe new life into the Terminids and Automatons. In the upcoming Escalation of Freedom expansion, both the Terminids and Automatons will see new members join their respective factions, with the Impaler Terminid making its return from Helldivers 1. From what we’ve seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8don2Z3pvAo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the trailer</u></a>, they’ve reworked the Impaler to better fit the context of a third person shooter, with tentacles that cut off escape routes and force you to stand your ground. So it’s already begun! More and more ideas from the first game get to make their way to the second. You love to see it.</p><p>Ultimately, there’s also a lot in terms of inspiration that Arrowhead could take from games that share more modern elements with Helldivers 2 now that it has changed its formula in a few important ways from the original. Having larger enemies with weak points, or multi-stage boss encounters that evolve as the fight goes on is something that both of these kinds of games do incredibly well. </p><p>Plus, Helldivers II has already shown some interest in this kind of design, with Chargers and their breakable armor, the Bile Spewers and their burstable backsides, among others. Doubling down on this design language would open up enemy encounters and encourage new, thoughtful strategies to emerge amongst players. It’s exciting to think about what Helldivers II could build on top of the already stellar foundation of their enemy design.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With Helldivers 1 and 2, Arrowhead has showcased its incredible talents and creativity as a developer, and there are so many elements from the first game they can reinterpret for its successor. Their track record for making the right decisions about pricing, microtransactions, server issues, and patches has been rock solid so far, on top of designing a truly engaging video game. With the success they’ve now seen, I hope they are able continue making thoughtful and creative decisions that build the game into something even more engaging. I can’t wait to see what they come up with. And if I missed anything, let us know what you would like to see Helldivers II add in the comments down below.</p><p>For everything else about Helldivers 2, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/helldivers-2">guide</a> for all the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/helldivers-2/Tips_and_Tricks_for_Getting_Started">best Tips and Tricks</a> to get started.</p><p><em>Tyler Robertson is a social media coordinator and producer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The First Berserker: Khazan's first gameplay footage is here, and it's looking quite promising. Boasting a cel-shaded anime artstyle and a frosty aesthetic, Khazan looks straight out of the pages of a combat-filled manga like Berserk. How fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest entry in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter series--which includes the online fighting game DNF Duel and the MMORPG Dungeon Fighter Online--The First Berserker: Khazan is a hack-and-slash action-RPG with similarities to the Souls series and classics like the original God of War games. The trailer shows a wounded Khazan being fully healed by a strange sword called the "Blade Phantom." After that, he explores a snowy mountainscape, using his axe and sword to deal with a number of enemies, finally ending with an impressive boss fight with a Yeti-like monster.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The First Berserker: Khazan | Official First 15 Minutes Of Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While it's not clear if Khazan is fully a "Soulslike," it exhibits a lot of elements that have become synonymous with the series, including maze-like environments, powerful falling attacks, charge attacks, a sprint option, and even a parry. The game's stylized visuals stand out the most in this trailer, as we haven't seen many notable action-RPGs in that style in recent years. The First Berserker: Khazan will come out sometime in 2025, and it will release for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

The update will “bring new ideas and strategies to the game” and will be released for all platforms (it’s available on Steam, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox), LocalThunk says.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">earlier this year</a>, and it’s since become a smash hit thanks to its compelling gameplay loop that will have you saying “just one more run” until it’s far past your bedtime. While the game involves poker hands, you don’t gamble chips or money — instead, the goal is to strategically build high-scoring hands through things like discarding cards, modifying your cards, and collecting powerful jokers that have various ways of influencing the game. (LocalThunk says he is so opposed to <em>Balatro</em> becoming a true gambling game that, in his will, he stipulated that the franchise could <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1820752209765961746">never be sold</a> to a gambling company or casino.)</p><p>The game has now sold 2 million units, LocalThunk says, and it regularly sits in the upper ranks <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed">of top-played games on Steam Deck</a>. I’ve played <em>Balatro</em> most on Switch, but I bought a second copy on Steam so that I could play on Steam Deck, too.</p><p>In addition to the upcoming major update, LocalThunk says there are “a few more announcements in the works that will be revealed over the next couple of months.” The game is also in development <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102437/balatro-iphone-android-mobile">for iPhone and Android</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>UK arts and entertainment union Equity have unveiled a raft of "best practice guidelines" for video game developers hiring voice actors, including some suggested minimum rates that are designed to address "systemic low pay" for performers. Other measures are designed to improve voice actor working conditions, and stop companies using their voices and likeness as fuel for generative AI tools without their consent. It's both a praiseworthy endeavour and an interesting breakdown of the voice-actor's trade.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The videogames industry is a dynamic place to work but unethical practices undermine the profession," Equity <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/sector-specific-advice/videogames">explain on their official site</a>. "Pay for UK performers has stagnated despite games being a multibillion-dollar industry with almost £200 million in tax breaks. Performers don't have the protections they need in the unregulated world of AI, the misuse of NDAs is common and health and safety is often lacking."</p>
<p>The best practice guidelines span fair pay, the need for voice actor consent when creating digital replicas or "training" AI software, provisions for safer workplaces (including guidance about intimacy coordinators and vocal chord stress), and stipulations about "clear, legal, enforceable, fair, proportionate and targeted" non-disclosure agreements.</p>
<p>As regards NDAs, Equity <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/casting-and-auditions/information-on-non-disclosure-agreements">argues</a> that: "At the moment, many of the NDA agreements we see reflect poorly upon the industry, often intimidating and isolating Performers from those that support them. Performers are forced to sign documents which they have no hope of understanding or amending.</p>
<p>"The result is that Performers often assume that they will be sued if they tell anyone anything about the production, even where they have been victims of or witnesses to a criminal offence," the page continues. "This is all the more shocking five years since the Harvey Weinstein scandal highlighted the appalling misuse of NDAs, shook the film industry, and ignited the #MeToo movement. By now, we would have expected Engagers to be following best practice and not repeat past mistakes."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.equity.org.uk/advice-and-support/sector-specific-advice/videogames/videogames-recommended-rate-card#voiceover-rates">suggested minimum rates</a>, meanwhile, offer some snippets of info about how specific types of voice-acting and motion capture are valued within video game projects. For example, they distinguish between voice lines that form part of the main plot and "atmospheric" or "world-building" voices - "no more than 300 scripted/recorded lines that do not further the story".</p>
<p>There are also "Walla voices", defined as "unscripted voices not assigned to a specific character, that do not further the story". Examples of walla voicework include crowd chatter and creature noises  - the term apparently dates back to the early days of radio broadcasting, when certain shows found that having groups repeat "walla walla" produced an effective impression of organic background hubbub. </p>
<p>I like hearing about production niceties such as these. Now that I've learned the term, I find myself surprisingly laden with memories of walla voicework. There's a backing track of anomalous battlefield mitherings you hear during loading breaks for Total War: Warhammer 3, for example. I had that stuck in my head for a while, albeit partly because my review PC at the time was a sclerotic antique, and it sometimes took five minutes to load a battle.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-introduces-minimum-rates-to-address-systemic-low-pay-for-video-game-performers">reminds us</a>, Equity's best practice guidelines come amid strike action from US actor's union SAG-AFTRA. In July, SAG-AFTRA spokespeople commented that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">"AI protections remain the sticking point" for the strike</a>, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">disagreements between the union and members about deals with individual companies who use the tech</a>. "Eighteen months of negotiations have shown us that our employers are not interested in fair, reasonable AI protections, but rather flagrant exploitation," Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee chair Sarah Elmaleh commented at the time.</p>
<p>"Atmospheric" and "walla" voice-acting, Equity observe in their new guidelines, are "one of the segments of our industry most threatened by AI", presumably because the uncanniness of AI-generated speech is harder to detect when it's buried in a crowd. While not participating in the SAG-AFTRA strike for legal reasons, Equity have plenty of advice and requests for developers who are thinking about making use of generative AI.</p><p>Amongst other things, they suggest that companies confirm in advance whether "the data recorded within the stipulated performance sessions will be used for the stated project only and not re-used in future titles" and that "a pre-purchase / integration fee should be paid when a developer, studio or publisher wishes to hold performance data in their 'library' for potential re-use on future projects".</p>
<p>If you found all this intriguing, I encourage you to read the full text over on Equity's site - this is just a scraping of its surfaces. You might also be intrigued by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judas-and-bioshock-dev-ken-levine-thinks-video-game-voice-acting-has-a-problem-with-turn-based-dialogue">Ken Levine's thoughts on "turn-based dialogue"</a>. If you'd like to read more about the broad implications of generative AI technology, Mike Cook <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">did a whole essay series on it earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Warner Bros Discovery appears to be trying to get out of the games business. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2ea08a79-b569-4349-8ee8-993ba5599179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> (subscription needed), Warner Bros. is looking at the possibility of selling off at least a part of its games division.</p>



<p>The report comes just two weeks after Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired MultiVersus developer Player First Games</a>.</p>



<p>The report claims that by selling off games would help the company avoid possible lawsuits from various debt investors. Nothing has been finalized, however.</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games currently owns major IPs like Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat. They are also the publisher being Suicide  Squad: Kill the Justice League, the live-service game that was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-reportedly-says-suicide-squad-fell-short-of-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">met with a poor response</a> from players and critics alike. It was also a game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that cost the company</a> $200 million in revenue.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Warner Bros. Games was a potential sale candidate. Back in 2020, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-expresses-interest-in-acquiring-warner-game-unit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Microsoft was interested in buying the division in order to get games like Mortal Kombat, Suicide Squad, and others under its umbrella.</p>



<p>It’s unclear, should a sale happen, if Microsoft would once again be interested due to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-new-round-of-layoffs/">the current situation of the</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-new-round-of-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-new-round-of-layoffs/">company</a> after its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>Warner Bros. Discovery has not responded to multiple requests for comment prior to publishing.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>arrives on Steam and Xbox on August 27th, and it's arriving alongside a major update for the game that will add a number of oft-requested features including crossplay, new gear, and a pause button for those playing in single-player.</p>
<p>Titled The Golden Update, the upcoming patch will&nbsp;be made available to all players when the Steam and Xbox releases hit, and it's even got a feature that was only available to beta branch players on the Epic Games Store previously.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-fight.jpg?itok=2JAm5cQz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-fight.jpg?itok=b9YO6Fuq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>is coming soon to Steam and Xbox Series X|S.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, Sandbox Mode, which allows you to explore a procedurally-generated Moria at your own leisure. The devs say each playthrough can "vary significantly in layout and difficulty". Free Range does warn that this mode is mainly intended for those who are already familiar with&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria</em>, though, because it offers minimal tutorializing.</p>
<p>Additionally, up to eight players can now enjoy&nbsp;<em>Return to Moria&nbsp;</em>together no matter which platform they're playing on, so if you're playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lord-of-rings-return-to-moria-release-date">on the Epic Games Store or the PS5</a>, you'll soon be able to play alongside your Steam and Xbox buddies.</p>
<p>You'll also find recipes for new armor and weapons, and although they're only discoverable in Sandbox Mode, you'll be able to bring them across to the Campaign if you want to.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the Golden Update, you can check out everything that's new <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/aug27-golden-update" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here via the official website</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-takes-you-on-a-tour-of-its-hyrule">Nintendo released a fresh trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, that's due out next month.
</p>
<p>
The game stars the titular princess in the leading role for the first time and includes a new Echo mechanic, where Zelda can essentially copy and paste elements from the world to explore and solve puzzles.
</p>
<p>
The new trailer focused on giving a tour of Hyrule, showing off its various regions, and the new power Bind that allows Zelda to attach herself to (and move with) objects and enemies. 
</p>
<p>
But there are some extra details in the trailer you may have missed. Check out the new trailer below first.

<h3>Horse riding</h3>
<p>
Ok, it's not exactly a missable detail that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Echoes of Wisdom</a> will include horse riding. But it is significant, in part because it's usually associated with the more expansive 3D Zelda games (though it was included in Four Swords Adventures). Zelda will be able to summon a horse once she (appropriately) learns the Echo for a carrot, but in the trailer we see both a brown and white horse suggesting there's no set Epona equivalent but multiple horses available. Horses can run and jump through the world, and she appears to arrive at what could be Lon Lon Ranch. The inclusion of horses, ultimately, hints towards the size of this world that seems larger than any other top-down Zelda before.</p>

</figure>
<h3>Region names</h3>
<p>
When Echoes of Wisdom was first revealed earlier this year, fans speculated the map appeared similar to that of A Link to the Past. Yet now we have confirmed region names, which are taken from more recent Zelda games. There's the Gerudo Desert for instance, which causes the princess to break out in a sweat, and its Gerudo tribe women look like chibi versions of their <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> counterparts. The Faron Wetlands (Twilight Princess, Breath of the Wild) is where we meet the Deku, while the game's mountainous region is called Eldin Volcano - this parallels Skyward Sword when usually Death Mountain is the iconic volcano. Lastly, the Zora reside in Jabul Waters, perhaps relating back to Ocarina of Time's giant fish Jabu Jabu.</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-0-36-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Adventuring is sweaty work | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Water regions</h3>
<p>
Speaking of water, we've seen already the game will include both sea and river Zora who appear to be feuding. Jabul Waters features pillars with the Water Medallion design from Ocarina of Time, while the River Zora village curiously includes musical instruments like a lute, maracas, and a horn. Could this hint at Majora's Mask's band The Indigo-Go's?</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-1-5-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Spot the instruments! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Links to Breath of the Wild</h3>
<p>
Echoes of Wisdom certainly appears to be marrying the adorable top-down visuals of the Link's Awakening remake with the creativity and experimental vibe of the more recent Zelda games. Bind, in particular, feels analogous to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>'s Ultrahand. More specifically, the UI and text font are the same and this new trailer provides a look at Zelda's Adventure Log. It's here players will prioritise quests, split between Side Quests and Main Quests. Interestingly, Zelda has multiple Main Quests available, suggesting a more open player-led structure more akin to the Switch Zelda games.</p>

<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/The-Legend-of-Zelda_-Echoes-of-Wisdom-%E2%80%93-Traversing-Hyrule-Trailer-%E2%80%93-Nintendo-Switch-2-5-screenshot.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>This feels very similar to Breath of the Wild | <span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>

<h3>Japanese artwork</h3>
<p>
Outside of the trailer, Nintendo has released official artwork for Echoes of Wisdom. However, the Japanese version (as on the game's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/bdgea/index.html">Japanese website</a>) is zoomed out slightly further and includes some extra details. The top left corner includes a small man on a paraglider - could he be a new postman perhaps? There's also a snake enemy in the bottom right, as well as what looks like a Wanted poster for Zelda. The previous trailer showed Zelda meeting new companion Tri in a jail cell before embarking on her adventure while cloaked, so it seems she could spend part of her adventure on the run.</p>
 <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The Japanese version of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom key art includes a seemingly important key character that Nintendo hasn't talked about yet. </p><p>If you look in the upper left hand corner, you'll see him paragliding! <a href="https://t.co/mi7UeroeS3">pic.twitter.com/mi7UeroeS3</a></p></div>— Stealth (@Stealth40k) <a href="https://twitter.com/Stealth40k/status/1820811363553264013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<h3>Other bits</h3>
<p>
A few other small details from the trailer include a tiny cat and parrot in a hat in Gerudo town; a Goron leader named Darston, following the usual naming convention of the series (Darunia and Daruk, for example); and a map screen divided into sections, though it's unclear if map pieces will be acquired or if it will simply be unveiled by exploring.</p>


<p>
The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is set for release on 26th September and is shaping up to be a particularly unique entry in the long-running Nintendo series.

<p>A new NFL video game is set to launch next month, and  no it’s not the long-awaited NFL 2K game. New Star Games has announced NFL Retro Bowl 25 is coming in September.</p>



<p>Exclusively launching for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/retro-bowl/id6446029554?ign-itscg=30200ADM&amp;ign-itsct=newstar_arcade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple Arcade</a> on September 5, NFL Retro Bowl 25 will feature all 32 NFL teams along with players from each team. That means players like Buffalo Bills star quarterback Josh Allen, three-time Super Bowl winner Patrick Mahomes, two-time MVP Lamar Jackson, and more will all be available in pixelated glory.</p>



<p>“The upcoming release of NFL Retro Bowl ’25 allows NFL fans to create their own dynasty by choosing their favorite official NFL teams and players to take all the way to the house as they manage their rosters and game strategies with a fun and simple roster management system,” the game’s description reads. </p>

<p>As far as other potential platforms, there was no mention of when, or if, NFL Retro Bowl 25 could be available elsewhere. The current version of Retro Bowl that features generic teams is available on iOS, Android, Web, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Former Ubisoft and Eidos-Montréal developer Stevan Anastasoff has announced Tales from the Mabinogion, a third-person narrative game based on ancient Welsh folklore that's written primarily in the Welsh language. The game puts you in charge of a wandering monarch, who is embarked on quest to save the realm from a horrible fog. Find a trailer below. Yes, there are English subtitles.

<p>"As a vengeful sorcerer unleashes a cursed fog upon the ancient Welsh Kingdom of Dyfed, a warrior-king finds himself entangled with beasts from the mythical Otherworld of Annwn," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3067260/Tales_from_the_Mabinogion/">explains the Steam page</a>. "To save his realm, he embarks on a quest to uncover the origins of the curse - and unlock the secrets necessary to thwart its devastating grip."</p>
<p>
Tales from the Mabinogion sees you following beast trails and wrangling with mystical animals in a landscape of faded organic pigments and thick brushstrokes inspired by Erin Hanson, Vincent Van Gogh, and Claude Monet (another parallel, if not an influence, is Aardman's World War fable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/11-11-memories-retold">11-11: Memories Retold</a>, whose art style is a commentary on the fallibility of memory). It's not clear whether any kind of fighting system is involved, but there's certainly confrontation and conflict. 
</p>
<p>
The Mabinogion of the title is a collection of ancient Welsh stories dating back to the 12th century. As you travel through the game, you'll tease out a few of these fragmentary fables. "Welsh is a beautiful, ancient, musical, magical language - the language that inspired Tolkien's Sildarin, the language of the Elves," Anastasoff comments in a release. "There is no more fitting way to tell a fantasy story!"
</p>
<p>
Anastasoff's collaborators include famed Warhammer scribe Gav Thorpe, author of The Lion. The game's Welsh script is the work of translator Rhys Iorwerth, and is narrated by Phil Rowe, whose other credits include Age Of Empires and Raid: Shadow Legends. Welsh folk musician Oliver Wilson-Dickson is doing the score.
</p>
<p>
The game launches on PC via Steam in 2025.

            <p>
Popular deck-building roguelike Balatro has now passed 2m sales and a major update is due next year.
</p>
<p>
The game was released across PC, Switch, PS5 and Xbox back in February and has proven particularly successful over the past six months.
</p>
<p>
Publisher Playstack and solo developer LocalThunk has a series of three announcements it's sharing across August and September, what it's calling a "Three-of-a-Kind of Surprises" campaign.
</p>

<p>
The first announcement is that a major gameplay update for Balatro will arrive in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Few details are currently available, though Playstack states the update will "bring new ideas and strategies to the game" when it's released across all platforms. It will also be completely free.
</p>
<p>
The remaining two announcements will be revealed at undisclosed times.

<p>
"I would never have thought that Balatro would be played by over two million people when I started working on it almost three years ago. I'm so grateful to all the players for giving it a chance and I'm excited to show everyone the next chapter for my game," said LocalThunk.
</p>
<p>
After its release, Balatro ran into controversy as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rogue-like-poker-hit-balatro-pulled-from-sale-in-some-countries-due-to-unexpected-ratings-change">poker theme meant it was pulled from sale</a> in some countries due to an unexpected ratings change.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/maybe-it-should-be-illegal-to-instantly-delete-a-website%E2%80%99s-archives.946896/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last week it was reported</a> that GameStop, a clown show of a company peddling meme stocks and cheap video game merchandise, had unceremoniously and without notice shut down Game Informer, a magazine and website that had been publishing in some form since <em>1991</em>.</p><p>The decision was a terrible one for many reasons. For readers and fans, it deprives them of one of the few traditional games publications remaining <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-layoffs-destructoid-pc-invasion-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the smoking ruins of this modern media apocalypse</a>. For staff it's a nightmare, with everybody facing a job market where video game journalism opportunities simply do not exist anymore.</p><p>There are also consequences for the wider internet. And for the history of video games, the history of video game criticism and media and, on a more personal note for the site and magazine's staff, the histories of everyone who ever worked for Game Informer or saw their work printed there. Because when GameStop pulled the plug last week, they didn't just end the publication of an extremely long-running magazine, they also killed its accompanying website (and, spitefully, even its Twitter account). It's just not there anymore. Not a single article from a website that had been around since <em>2003 </em>(or <em>1999 </em>if you're counting its pre-GameStop days) is now able to be viewed, as Game Informer's front page and navigation menu have been replaced with a single statement ominously called "The Final Level".</p><figure></figure><p>In the 21 years Game Informer's website was open--and this was a magazine that was once the centre of the video game media landscape thanks to its lavish reveal stories and covers--do you know how many other websites linked to its posts? How many Wikipedia pages, how many reports on the pages of peers and competitors, how many forums, emails, tweets and Facebook posts? It must be <em>countless</em>.</p><p>Game Informer's posts--and the links pointing to them--are the bedrock of our modern, online history. So much of the internet is built around clicking one thing to be taken to another, links piled atop decades of older links, that it's become part of our subconscious user experience, as second-nature to being online as putting one foot in front of the other is to walking down the street. But that clicking only works when there's something to click <em>to</em>.</p><p>In tearing down Game Informer's website, GameStop has torn the nervous system out of a huge part of gaming media's dying body. You now can't read any old Game Informer posts, and most of the old links pointing towards them work anymore. Where Game Informer once stood there's now nothing but a gaping black hole, with torn wires hanging around its edges. Were it not for the Internet Archive (and Wikipedia editors’ herculean efforts in substituting its links with archived substitutes) salvaging some old stories and links, it would be as though the site had never existed in the first place.</p><p>Of course, Game Informer is not the first publication to be treated like this, nor will it be the last. It's only been a few weeks since<a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/mtv-news-website-archives-pulled-offline-1236047163/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> MTV News suffered a similar fate</a>. And every time it happens, I ask myself the same question: <a href="https://slate.com/business/2024/02/messenger-gawker-vice-media-layoffs-sites-deleted-why.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how is this allowed</a>?</p><p>I know this might sound like the pissbaby whinings of one of the few people on the planet who would truly care about this--a video games journalist<a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> whose own archival contributions are hanging by a thread</a>--but I'm coming around to the idea that it, if you own or buy an online media company, it should be illegal to wipe the site and its archives as swiftly and heartlessly as this.</p><p>You can't (unless you try really hard) erase a newspaper or book. They exist in a physical space, and can be archived physically, just<a href="https://library.gamehistory.org/repositories/2/resources/42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as the Video Game History Foundation have done with Game Informer's own print edition</a>. But you can very easily kill a website. You just...take it down. Sure, as I've mentioned, the Internet Archive can pick up <em>some </em>of the slack, but as I've found trying to retrieve some of my own older works (Kotaku's pre-2008 archives are all but lost), its coverage can often be patchy at best, and is no substitution for a site's own complete archives.</p><p>If a shithead owner wants to close a site and lay everyone off, there's not much anyone can do about that, the gods will come for them or their descendants sooner or later. But to erase a site's archives is wrong. To block them without notice is actively spiteful. It belies a contempt for the product, that this thing you owned means so little to you that it can be erased from history at the click of a button.</p><figure><figcaption>Just in case you were wondering if there was any malice in this or not | Screenshot: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nintendeal.com/post/3kyyj3blpgr2y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendeal</a></figcaption></figure><p>But it <em>did </em>mean something, to a lot of people smarter and kinder than anyone who has ever made a decision this cruel. At the very least, the writers and editors who worked there deserved a chance to retrieve their contributions, to catalogue some part of careers that spanned years or even decades. And the rest of us are entitled to some semblance of a working internet.</p><p>I'm not saying archives need to be kept up indefinitely--<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though Lord knows that comes in handy sometimes</a>--as that would be unworkable, but maybe there should at least be regulations governing how quickly the curtain comes down on a commercial website, and with how much notice. How <em>much</em> time? At least enough for people to be able to retrieve their work, or in best-case scenarios, to find a new home for the archives that the current owners clearly value so little they were willing to throw it in the bin and turn the lights off.</p><p>I know this isn't a serious proposition. There's about as much chance of a government enacting a Digital Media Preservation Act as there is a commercial website's owners truly valuing the contributions of its embattled journalists. Whether it could actually happen or not isn't my point here though, my point is that murdering a website is such a shitty thing to do, yet is something that so many people seem totally fine doing, that it <em>should </em>be illegal because that would be the only way we're ever going to stop this from happening over and over and over again.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite a linear single-player campaign, the meat of the game seemed to be in the six-class multiplayer PVE mode which is full of unlocks and customizations. “<em>Space Marine 2</em> has a real shot at being the quintessential third-person action game set in the <em>40K</em> universe,” Hafer wrote. </p><p>If the PVE mode sounds similar to the loot-based horde mode game <em>Darktide</em>, well, that’s exactly the comparison <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-delivers-maximum-warhammer-to-glorious-effect&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-delivers-maximum-warhammer-to-glorious-effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em>’s Chris Tapsell drew</a></span>.  <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s take is less atmospheric but also more streamlined in its class-building and progression. Tapsell called it “schlockier” overall and better at embracing the “unthinking fanaticism” of the <em>Warhammer</em> fantasy. “This is a double-A game in triple-A clothing, in many senses, simple pleasures and just occasional jank, with a layer of grim, gothic fidelity over the top,” Tapsell wrote, describing the type of less ambitious, more focused shooter we don’t get as often these days. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/within-10-minutes-of-killing-tyranids-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-become-my-most-anticipated-shooter-of-2024/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/within-10-minutes-of-killing-tyranids-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-become-my-most-anticipated-shooter-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em>’s Andrew Brown</a></span> was even more enthusiastic, saying his time with the game turned it into his most anticipated of the year. “The way in which you move from shooting to melee and back is exceptionally fluid, and there were several fights where I felt like a force of nature, which is exactly what playing a Space Marine should feel like,” he wrote. “Even when I was up against Chaos Space Marines and hordes of demons, who crept into the preview level to fight Tyranids and Imperium alike, I was outnumbered but always felt like the strongest person on the battlefield.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/preview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PCGamesN</em>’s Ross McInally</a></span> was much more harsh on the main campaign, criticizing what he saw as by-the-book missions and boss battles that make you unlearn the lessons the game has taught you. Also glitches. The Operations mode was a different story, with the ability to paint each piece of armor giving <em>Space Marine 2</em> a bit of the sensibility of the miniatures tabletop game that inspired it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-brutal-gratifying-gameplay-is-doing-warhammer-40000-right/1100-6525419/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-brutal-gratifying-gameplay-is-doing-warhammer-40000-right/1100-6525419/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em>’s Dave Jewitt</a></span> was also bullish on game’s virtues as a <em>Warhammer </em>adaptation. </p><p>“Overall, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is shaping up to be a more than worthy successor to the 2011 fan favorite,” he wrote. “Everything that made the original <em>Space Marine</em> great is still there but as a much more considered and evolved version of itself, all of which comes together to make <em>Space Marine 2 </em>feel like both a familiar old friend and an exciting new experience.” That’s all fans of the original need to hear. </p><p><em>Space Marine 2</em> was originally supposed to ship last year, before being delayed to 2024. It’s now set to come out on September 9. There were supposed to be free betas for fans to test out the game for themselves ahead of release, but developer Saber Interactive canned them in order to focus on having “the best launch” possible. Some features and hidden reveals were already spoiled for fans when an old build of the game leaked earlier this summer. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-leak-warhammer-40k-focus-saber-1851594237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-leak-warhammer-40k-focus-saber-1851594237">Saber warned players to stay away</a></span>, hoping their first experience of the game would be the finished product rather than in-progress work. So far it sounds like it will be worth the wait. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
