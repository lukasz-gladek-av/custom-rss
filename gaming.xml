			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost feature isn't delivering the 45% improvements promised before launch likely due to memory bandwidth constraints.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> commented on the system's features delivering, so far, only a 30%, 35% improvement in titles that did not receive a PS5 Pro Enhanced patch. While it is still not clear if Game Boost, which is essentially a compatibility mode, offers all the features and all the performance of the system, which seems unlikely, considering the Xbox Series X, powered by AMD hardware like Sony's consoles, offers the full GPU power when running Xbox One X using a similar compatibility mode, there's a very good chance that memory bandwidth constraints are limiting the improvements. This is similar to what happened on the PlayStation 4 Pro, as the 45% GPU upgrade over the base model was accompanied by only a 28% improvement in memory bandwidth, although the unbalance was way worse in the previous generation refresh system, which couldn't target 4K resolution in games even if the system had the shading power for it.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost feature being limited by memory bandwidth hypothesis is somewhat backed up by how AMD handles its GPU, as the increase in CU is parallel to an increase in memory bandwidth and memory controller improvement that allows larger cache GPUs to better handle high resolutions such as 4K. As such, there may be situations in the future where the PS5 Pro will be able to handle 1080p at 120 FPS with ease but struggle more at higher resolutions, as the higher the resolution, the more memory bandwidth is needed.</p>

<p>Despite unpatched games not seeing the improvements that some were expecting, the PlayStation 5 Pro seems to be delivering in PS5 Pro patched games, as in cases like<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/"> God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, the visual and performance improvements are substantial.

<p>Next month, The Game Awards celebrates its tenth anniversary as the leading award show in the gaming space. It’s the premier presentation for gamers worldwide, with awards being dished out, new games being teased, and updates being revealed. This year’s event, which will take place on December 12, is set to be a monumental showcase.</p>



<p>In the run-up to the event, The Game Awards has posted an email revealing to fans that it’s trying to secure registration with the US Patent &amp; Trademark Office, legitimising the brand. It has called on those same fans to bolster the application and help secure the trademark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-distinctive-association">Distinctive Association</h2>



<p>In an email circulated amongst fans, The Game Awards’ team explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are just 1 month away from The Game Awards and our 10th anniversary. </p>



<p>As a fan who joined us for one of our Zoom sessions during the pandemic, we are reaching out with a quick request. </p>



<p>We are currently in the midst of registering “The Game Awards” as a mark with the US Patent &amp; Trademark office. We are looking for letters of support to establish that consumers (that’s you!) distinctively associate the term “The Game Awards” with our annual awards show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The email then requested any ‘personal reflections’ that fans might have, all of which will be added to the application when it’s submitted in the coming weeks. If successful, the patent will recognise The Game Awards with a trademark, representing the legitimacy of the event and the high standard to which it’s now held by gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Upon opening the link in the email, users are presented with a pre-written letter regarding them as a ‘video game enthusiast and an avid viewer of The Game Awards’. By signing the letter, you confirm to the best of your ability that The Game Awards is a ‘well-known trademark’ associated with the showcase hosted by Geoff Keighley – and Ola Balola LLC.</p>



<p>What do you think? Do you associate the term ‘The Game Awards’ with <strong>nothing but </strong>the annual showcase hosted by Geoff?</p>

                <p>It's not a big surprise, but a lot of children want video games for the holidays. The Entertainment Software Association, which represents the US video game industry's interests in Washington D.C., has <a href="https://www.theesa.com/video-games-top-kids-wish-lists-this-holiday-season/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released the results of a study</a> that says kids aged 10-17 overwhelmingly want video games for Christmas and the holiday season in general.</p><p>A survey found that 76% of kids plan to ask their parents or caregiver for video games, outpacing money (67%), clothes (66%), and general tech items like phones and smartwatches (62%).</p><p>Both girls (67%) and boys (87%) said they planned to ask for video games this holiday season.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hundreds-of-zenimax-workers-strike-over-microsoft-outsourcing-remote-work-policies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Hundreds of staff at Bethesda parent company ZeniMax will go on strike today in protest at parent company Microsoft outsourcing work without bargaining with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) union. 
</p>
<p>
The one-day walkout by staff who work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Doom will be held today, Wednesday 13th November, from 10am to 6pm local time at four ZeniMax Studios offices in Maryland and Texas. 
</p>
<p>
Staff say they are concerned over the "unilateral decision" to outsource quality assurance (QA) work to external teams at a time of uncertainty and layoffs. In short, the worry is ZeniMax will undercut its own union staff by shifting the work elsewhere. 
</p>
<p>ZeniMax workers say they have also been prompted to walk out over continued concerns over remote work policies - the same issue which sparked a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">protest by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 developers at Activision's QA studio in Minnesota</a> at the end of last month.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted ZeniMax and Microsoft for comment.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recognises-300-person-zenimax-testers-union">Microsoft recognised the ZeniMax Studios union back in January 2023</a>, when 300 video game testers who worked on ZeniMax and Bethesda titles grouped together under the CWA. 
</p>
<p>
The union was the first Microsoft recognised and the largest video game union in the US. At the time, Microsoft was still battling to buy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, and was keen to voluntarily recognise worker unions to mitigate concerns over its growing portfolio's impact on workers.
</p><p>
"The Xbox business has never been more healthy," Microsoft's gaming boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-no-red-lines-over-any-xbox-game-coming-to-nintendo-or-playstation">Phil Spencer said in a Bloomberg interview published just earlier today</a>, when asked what the future had in store following a year filled with Microsoft layoffs. "The business is performing right now, and I think that means a more healthy future for hardware and the games we build."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZeniMax Workers United, a gaming union consisting of quality assurance workers from across the studios of Bethesda's parent company, is going on strike today over what it alleges to be excessive outsourcing of QA on parent company Microsoft's part.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the union wants Microsoft to "meet [it] at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing", <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714480413003983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demanding</a> "job security and improved working conditions".</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inverse report</a>, QA test lead Rhyanna Eichner says ZeniMax Workers United members are "all really looking forward to coming together and spending time together", and that "this is what needs to be done to move on".</p>

She says Microsoft has "continually given us their first proposal again and again", and that it's obvious to her the union's "different mobilization tactics have not worked".</p>

<p>Senior QA tester Juniper Dowell adds that many employees would be forced to consider alternative employment if they were required to be at the office five days a week because they were hired under remote working conditions.</p>

<p>Dowell says that while striking "isn't fun or ideal", there's a "satisfaction in having a concrete physical action" to help the union and its members "fight for better work conditions". She's hoping that Microsoft and ZeniMax will "stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=mv-ewWrh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=OoFPjxfo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United wants to negotiate for better remote working policies and less QA outsourcing.</figcaption></figure><p>ZeniMax's union isn't the only one to go on strike in recent months. Last week, employees at French studio Don't Nod <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">went on strike</a> following the announcement that almost 70 jobs at their studio could be at risk, with remote working policies also on the list of issues employees raised.</p>

<p>Gaming giant Ubisoft also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">faced a strike in October</a>, again in part over remote working policies, as well as what the employees involved perceived to be inadequate salaries.</p>

<p>ZeniMax Workers United's strike will last a single day, running between 10am and 6pm local time. We'll have to wait and see whether Microsoft and ZeniMax pay enough attention for negotiations to truly begin.</p>

It seems it’s more that the company is worried they’ll play with it the wrong way. “By the time you notice, it’s already covered in drool...”</p><p>I have three cats, and I can’t say this has ever proved an issue. My ten-year-old is far more likely to cover the screen in that inexplicable sticky residue all children exude, even more so than Archie, the giant, lumbering ginger. Although, in fairness, I don’t own a slavering St. Bernard or Mastiff, leaving those ghastly tendrils of slobber everywhere they go. I wouldn’t want one of those playing <em>Zelda</em> on my device.</p><p>The tweet continues, “Pet saliva and urine can cause the device to malfunction due to water exposure. If you have pets, be careful about where you place your Switch.”</p><p>“Pets” seems to be doing rather a lot of work, trying to cover up for the real culprits here: <em>dogs</em>. Just name them, Nintendo. Stop trying to be all woke and refusing to profile. We’ve also got a pet corn snake, and I’m not in the least concerned about Cornflake running my Switch under the faucet.</p><p>However, according to the image accompanying the warning, it looks like Nintendo might be more concerned about rabid foxes than anything else.</p><p>Look, it’s good advice. You <em>should</em> stop your pets from peeing on your electronic devices. You also shouldn’t put them through the washing machine, run them over with your car, or drop them into a volcano.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">While all eyes are on Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom has unveiled a brand-new game for mobile devices (App Store and Google Play) in the franchise called Monster Hunter Outlanders. The company is teaming up with TiMi Studio Group, known for its work on Call of Duty Mobile and Pokemon Unite.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Outlanders is being described as an open-world survival game, offering solo play as well as co-op for up to four people. The announcement trailer--seen below--interestingly enough doesn't showcase any combat for the title, instead focusing on mobility. The video sees a player paragliding across the map, swimming, sliding, utilizing a grappling gun, climbing a cliff, and even being shot out of a cannon-like device.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A core aspect of the Monster Hunter franchise is taking on giant creatures and then craving them up for parts to build new armor as well as weapons. Monster Hunter Outlanders will feature "the traditional hunting experience," per a press release, though this aspect isn't really shown in the debut trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">“Monster Hunter Outlanders not only offers players an authentic hunting experience, but it does it in a massive open world featuring the community and social systems players are looking for today," said TiMi producer Dong Haung in the press release.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is coming soon to mobile devices, though no specific launch date is listed. In the meantime, there will be several playtests for Monster Hunter Outlanders.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry for the series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-launching-in-february/1100-6526679/" data-ref-id="1100-6526679">Monster Hunter Wilds, which will launch February 28, 2025</a>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <p>Following the passing of Sylens' original actor Lance Reddick last year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has recast the role.</p>
<p>In the latest Horizon outing, the character is voiced by Tim Russ, Eurogamer can confirm.</p>
<p>Russ has been in the industry for many years, and is known for his roles in the likes of Star Trek: Voyager where he portrayed Vulcan Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, and as doorman Frank in Samantha Who?</p>

<p>Sylens features in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which Lego Horizon Adventures is based on, and its sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Series developer Guerrilla is yet to comment on who will replace Reddick, who portrayed Sylens in both mainline games and their respective DLC, longer term.</p>
<p>Reddick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actor-lance-reddick-star-of-destiny-and-the-wire-has-died">passed away in March last year</a>, aged 60. Following his passing, players discovered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lance-reddick-memorial-added-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dlc">memorial situated on an island visited in Horizon Forbidden West's DLC Burning Shores</a>, which served as an homage to the late actor.</p>
<p>"In honour of Lance Reddick, we created a memorial to commemorate the profound impact he had on us all," Guerrilla wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lance, for everything you brought to the role of Sylens: your gravitas, energy, wisdom and more. An incomparable talent and friend. We miss you terribly."</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Amazon’s Prime video service have released a new trailer for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/secret-level/"> Secret Level.</a> The fifteen episode series features fourteen dedicated to a specific game, and one for “various PlayStation Studios games” which we know will feature Kratos from God of War as he was seen briefly in the first trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Secret Level - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvY9Uq7I30Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room: Concord is still listed, although not shown in the trailer. Well, I don’t <em>think</em> it’s shown in the trailer, given that barely anyone played the game before it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">deleted from history</a> it’s rather hard to judge.</p>
<p>The cast list has also been revealed and there are some big names; Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator Franchise), Kevin Hart (Jumanji), Keanu Reeves (John Wick), Temuera Morrison (The Book of Boba Fett, Chief of War), Ariana Greenblatt (Barbie), Heaven Hart, Emily Swallow (The Mandalorian), Gabriel Luna (The Last of Us, Terminator: Dark Fate), Ricky Whittle (American Gods, Land of Bad), Patrick Schwarzenegger (The White Lotus), Merle Dandridge (The Last of Us), Claudia Doumit (The Boys), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lost, The Union), Clive Standen (Vikings, The Morning Show), Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina), and Michael Beach (The Perfect Couple, Tulsa King).</p>
<p>The games covered include: Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, , Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer 40,000. The first set of episodes will drop on December 10th with additional episodic drops until December 1th, so I would guess that means two episodes a day.</p>

<p>“Secret Level weaves a tapestry of iconic games across multiple mediums, to tell a series of unique and captivating stories,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “Created and led by Tim Miller, Blur Studio, and Supervising Director Dave Wilson, each episode will take our global Prime Video customers on a brand new journey with breath-taking animation and imaginative storytelling.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last year, I visited Japan for a few weeks, soaking in the culture, the nature and way too many plates of curry. Giant billboards advertised the latest niche gacha game, and multi-floor department stores dedicated huge displays to current and upcoming game releases unlike anything I’d ever see back in America’s dried out and dour shopping culture. The single most mind-blowing display of gaming reverence and promotion, though, was when I walked into a Lawson convenience store in Osaka that had been converted from front-to-back with a Dragon Quest theme. The signage outside was made of slime smiles, when you walked into the store you’d hear the crunchy NES sound-effect of an opened door from the original game play, and half the store was dedicated to selling merch related to the franchise. Dragon Quest has had a lasting impact not just on gaming, but on Japanese culture as a whole. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, above all else, is a reminder and a celebration of that.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRx4TbtpcRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For people outside of Japan, it can be hard to notice that influence, and a lot of that is simply due to the Dragon Quest series not being nearly as impactful or consistent overseas. Mainline entries like Dragon Quest IX on the Nintendo DS or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-review/">Dragon Quest XI</a> have certainly made an impact on gamers worldwide, but for Dragon Quest III and what is essentially this franchise’s equivalent of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII</a>, there hasn’t been a widely accessible or brushed up release until now with this remake.</p>


<p>Of course, with HD-2D in the title, it’s clear that this isn’t a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Remake</a> or Rebirth moment for Dragon Quest. The bones of this game are the same as they were in 1988 – you’re a young adventurer boy or girl, tasked with forming a party of companions and setting off into the world to vanquish the demon Baramos and save the world. It’s without a doubt a clichéd story that’s been adapted and twisted and parodied for decades, but what’s important here is that Dragon Quest III is ostensibly the game that invented that kind of story in the first place.</p>


<p>As a remake, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake isn’t doing a whole lot to reinvent that story, flesh it out or turn it into some kind of meta-commentary. There are some additional Episodic story scenes you can access throughout your journey, but they serve to flesh out some of the already existing characters and story threads – like getting a deeper look into the adventures of your famous father Ortega. As a protagonist, you’re a blank-slate, and the same goes for your customisable companions.</p>
<p>Each character class has a unique set of sprites and can be customized with their own names, hair colour, and personality-types, but with no spoken dialogue from your comrades, that final element only affects their stat-growth on paper. Still, that didn’t stop me from telling a story in my mind where my scatterbrain cleric Kikuri kept wasting her MP and missing attacks because she was nursing a perpetual hangover/drunken stupor like her Bocchi The Rock anime namesake.</p>

<p>A new gameplay feature that helps amplify that sense of self-driven storytelling is the ability to Recall conversations. Anytime someone says something you’d like to keep in mind for later, instead of having to jot down a note in your notebook you can just press the start button to save that entire conversation in-game for later access. In a game like Elden Ring, the natural experience of remembering characters wants and objectives can be hard to keep track of the deeper you get into the game. A quality-of-life feature like Recall makes that process a bit easier without hampering the self-guided nature of the journey at all.</p>
<p>Lots of other quality-of-life features have made their way into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, like the introduction of multiple difficulty options that can be swapped at any time. This isn’t a particularly difficult RPG by traditional standards, but certain tricky bosses or lengthy dungeon back-tracks definitely had me relying on a temporary drop in difficulty to get through them a bit more swiftly.</p>
<p>There’s also a brand new vocation called Monster Wrangler for your companions – it starts out as a pretty standard brawler type with good physical attributes, but eventually turns into a bit of a Blue Mage style character. By capturing and recruiting monsters, you can learn skills from them for the Monster Wrangler. On top of the really fun skill variety, having the added layer of monster-capturing on top of every enemy encounter made battles a lot more enticing and exciting. Your recruited monsters also feed into the newly expanded Monster Arena side-mode, a huge upgrade from the monster-battle gambling of the original game. It feels like a huge love letter to Dragon Quest Joker, the iconic Pokemon-inspired spinoff series, to have these Monster Wrangler and Monster Arena elements worked into the game – and it’s impressive how seamlessly they fit into your grand adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest change and upgrade in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, without a doubt, is the shift in visuals to an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> inspired blend of 3D environments, realistic lighting, and traditional pixel-art sprites. It’s done incredibly well, and the mix of old-school elements like the sprite art and chunky sound effects combined with the flashy new visual touches creates such a fun contrast. Particle effects have been given a wild modern upgrade too, leading to incredibly satisfying moments in battle where your spells and abilities summon huge gusts of wind and searing fireballs.</p>
<p>My only issue with the HD-2D treatment is that, in a lot of locations and times of day, the bloom lighting can be a bit too distracting – I nearly had to wear sunglasses from how bright the sun was reflecting off my parties sprites.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.</p>

			<p>Fallout TV series creator Jonathan Nolan and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer appeared earlier this week at the Paley International Council Summit during a panel titled Source Code: How Hollywood and Videogames Are Leveling Up Together.</p>
<p>At some point during the conversation (transcribed by Inverse), Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-season-2-jonathan-nolan-interview-phil-spencer-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the outstandingly successful Fallout TV show might have actually benefited from not having another game launch in the same franchise at a similar time. The executive pointed out that the strategy is much more in-depth and long-term than merely using the adaptation to incentivize fans to buy a new game.</p>
<p><em>We didn't have a new game lined up for the launch. I actually think that gave us some creative liberty that we wouldn't have had if we tried to coordinate the production of two very different creative processes to land at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>The play is much more long term than trying to drive some gift buying.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, the days of tie-ins, when games were often rushed out of the door simply to be released alongside big-budget movies, are behind us. This has led not only to greater creative freedom but also to much better overall quality, as the creative process cannot be rushed. Plus, Fallout games did <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> a massive boost in sales anyway when the TV show dropped on Amazon Prime Video, even if they weren't newly released.</p>
<p>During the panel, Jonathan Nolan briefly discussed the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a>, saying it will rely even more on flashbacks than season one.</p>
<p><em>For the most part, in games, it’s a little harder grammatically to flashback, right? Some games can do it very well. There are a couple of memorable flashbacks in Call of Duty and other franchises. But for the most part, you kind of lock the user into that first-person point of view across both space and time. In a show, you can flashback and you can explore that world beforehand. It’s one of the things I love the most about season one and we will be doing more of that in season two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV season 2 will start filming soon in California.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced the GOG Preservation Program, an initiative that aims to keep certain games playable forever no matter whether their developers are still supporting them or not.</p>

<p>Over on the official Preservation Program <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the company warns that "time is erasing the games that shaped you", but that "we can fight back" through the program, which "ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems".</p>

<p>According to GOG, games that belong to the initiative will be DRM-free and eligible for "dedicated tech support", so even if something does go wrong, you'll be able to get help to fix it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=8mrmRJ9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=jt7K9zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GOG Preservation Program currently covers 100 games, and more are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1856698605563793789" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), GOG says that the initiative features "updated, improved, or quality-tested builds", and that if you see the Preservation Program stamp on a game's GOG page, that means you'll be able to enjoy it on your PC "hassle-free".</p>

<p>Games currently included in the program include the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-classic-gog-re-release" rel="nofollow">original three&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games</a>, the original&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Hellfire&nbsp;</em>expansion, and&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic 3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and more.</p>

<p>GOG cites the Video Game History Foundation as saying that "87% of games created before 2010 are inaccessible today", a sobering statistic that demonstrates just how necessary an initiative like this really is.</p>




<p>You'll also find an FAQ on the Preservation Program's website that provides more information about the initiative. It includes info like what to do when a stamped game doesn't work, as well as whether classic GOG games are necessarily worse than those included in the Program (the answer being no, of course).</p>

<p>GOG says it wants "hundreds of games" to come with the GOG Preservation Program stamp by the end of 2025, so you can expect lots more games to be added to this initiative as time goes on. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Instead, the company opted to work directly with smart TV manufacturers to integrate that functionality. The company’s much hyped Xbox mobile gaming store is also still MIA. Still, it sounds like Spencer thinks the overall market is trending away from walled gardens, whether on Xbox, iPhone, or beyond.</p><p> “I think the ball is moving in the right direction,” Spencer said. “I think this idea of open platforms, where users have more choice, creators have more choice, you see the momentum, right?” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Union employees at Bethesda have gone on strike across multiple locations in the United States.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, “hundreds” of employees have walked off the job in both Maryland and Texas. It’s claimed that the strike is due to the company not addressing remote work concerns as well as the recent outsourcing of quality assurance. The latter being something the union never agreed to.</p>



<p>The report claims that the union is “looking to limit the percentage of quality assurance testers the company outsources in comparison to the number of full-time workers present in its bargaining unit”.</p>



<p>The union, which is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest video games union</a> in the United States, is also looking for a more flexible remote work policy after employees are being denied remote work requests.</p>



<p>“They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it’s become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked,” Bethesda Quality Assurance Test Lead Rhyanna Eichner told Inverse regarding the company’s negotiations with the union.</p>

<p>“Striking isn’t fun or ideal, but there’s a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions,” Senior Quality Assurance Tester Juniper Dowell told the outlet. “Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-no-longer-supports-windows-7-or-8/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve has released an update for Steam that officially ends support for Windows 7 and 8 operating systems. </p>



<p>The update, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on November 5</a> that includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-game-recording-feature-is-now-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability to record games</a> within Steam, forces those who wish to continue to use Steam to either upgrade to Windows 10 or 11. Or, if you don’t want Windows at all, you can move to MacOS or Linux.</p>







<p>“This version of the Steam client will no longer run on Windows 7 or Windows 8,” the update reads. “Users on these OS versions will not automatically update to this new version of the Steam Client.”</p>



<p>In it’s FAQ page on the support ending, Valve says moving on from the old operating systems has to do with the security of its users.</p>



<p>“This change is required as core features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows,” Valve said. “In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”</p>



<p>They continued: “Computers running these operating systems, when connected to the internet, are susceptible to new malware and other exploits which will not be patched. That malware can cause your PC, Steam and games to perform poorly or crash. That malware can also be used to steal the credentials for your Steam account or other services.”</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that Steam will also no longer work on MacOS 10.13 or 10.14.</p>



<p>Are you one of the holdouts still using Windows 7 or 8? Will this finally get you to upgrade? Let us know down below.</p>

With the release of Lego Horizon Adventures this week, it has been confirmed--in that spin-off game at least--that Sylens does appear and is voiced by Star Trek Voyager actor Tim Russ.</p><p>A deuteragonist in the games, Sylens is similar to Horizon's hero Aloy in several ways, as he also explores the secret history of the world following a cataclysmic event that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Russ is no stranger to the Horizon series, as he'd previously played the character Jetakka in Horizon Forbidden West. In Lego Horizon Adventures, he appears as "DJ Sylens" (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-recasts-late-lance-reddick-with-star-trek-actor-tim-russ" data-target="true"
