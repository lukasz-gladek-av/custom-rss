            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/battlefield-labs-is-a-community-playtest-collab-for-the-next-battlefield/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has announced Battlefield Labs, a community collaboration project aiming to get direct feedback and shape the development of the next Battlefield by a group of studios that includes Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios – now under the collective name of Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p>The announcement video also gave us a very brief first look at the next Battlefield game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Battlefield Labs testing will go live in the coming weeks and sign ups are now live at<a href="http://battlefield.com/labs"> battlefield.com/labs</a>. Initial tests will be invite only and use players and servers in Europe and North America, before expanding in future waves. Taking part does require signing an NDA, so no public chit-chat will be happening until EA is good and ready to talk about the game some more.</p>
<p>DICE will remain primarily responsible for the game engine and the multiplayer side of the game, while the focus for Criterion has been on the single player – returning for this game after skipping Battlefield 2042. They’re being supported by Motive with multiplayer maps and single player content, while Ripple Effect is working on “an experience that is really going to open Battlefield to a whole group of new players”, but Senior Producer Ryan McArthur.</p>

<p>It’s curious to see how this group has been brought together, as while the Battlefield Studios brand is new, the collaboration between these studios is familiar – all uniting on a single game project is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/03/ea-announced-plans-for-connected-battlefield-universe-in-franchise-leadership-shakeup/">a far cry from the Battlefield universe that was envisioned back in 2021</a>. Criterion has often been brought in to assist, working on vehicular content for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/13/star-wars-battlefront-ii-review/">Star Wars Battlefront II</a>, the Firestorm battle royale mode for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/11/13/battlefield-v-review/">Battlefield V</a>, and was dragged away from Need for Speed to help with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/15/battlefield-2042-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-ps4-pc/">Battlefield 2042</a>. Motive’s closest ties to the franchise has been with creating the single player for Battlefront II – it’s a little unexpected to see them seemingly take a supporting role to Criterion on this.</p>
<p>Lastly there’s Ripple Effect, formerly known as DICE LA, and a part of the Battlefield 2042 development group creating Battlefield Portal, which transported classic Battlefield games, maps and modes into the new engine. A really fascinating side to the game that was one of the highlights from its launch. It’s not clear what they’re working on for the next Battlefield, but expect some kind of adjacent genre, if they’re looking to attract a new audience.</p>

		
		

<p>The video caps off with a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG. Is it possible that we’ll get the full building destruction back from Bad Company 2?</p>

The sequel expands on the first game with a bigger, more detailed world that includes new gameplay systems and a lengthier script. Does all of this extra stuff coalesce into something compelling and meaningful?</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>VGC</em>’s Jordan Middler</a></span>, the larger mix still feels cohesive and intentional in a way the first game’s did not. “This is Warhorse Studios’ <em>Witcher 3</em> moment,” he writes in his five-star review. “<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>is an extremely confident, accomplished, dirty, hilarious, and massively enjoyable RPG. The game tries a lot of things and executes on almost all of them very well, and its commitment to being ruthless must be applauded.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em>’s Katharine Castle</a></span> was similarly impressed but less in love with the finished product. “There’s a lot to admire here, sure, but you have to do so on its own terms,” she writes in her three-out-of-five star review. “It is a hard and maddening slog at times, but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn’t an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry’s betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won’t be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon.”</p><p>Early reviews make <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> sound like its side quests and the way they’re woven together across its big world are a highlight, while combat remains a bit underwhelming, and text-heavy menus make navigating and learning about some of the systems a chore. The lock-picking mini-game is apparently terrible, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/app/1771300/discussions/0/591760496744510997/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1771300/discussions/0/591760496744510997/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as is saving the game</a></span>, and the beginning  seems hellbent on making players struggle to overcome even the simplest challenges.

And it has excellent melee combat, which The Elder Scrolls never came close to even at its peak. Sometimes it’s not sure if it wants to be a cinematic tale about a specific guy going on a specific adventure or a truly dynamic open-world sandbox packed with interesting and varied side quests, and that can lead to a few immersion-shattering conflicts. But most of the time, leaning into one doesn’t get in the way of the other, and you’re free to go on any of its many optional adventures along the way to a thought-provoking and rousing finale for the main plot. I was delighted to get lost in its world, and it will be a long time before I forget its exceptional story. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h16172"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> While Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 still stumbles in some aspects of its portrayal of 15th-century Bohemia, the shadow that lingered over the first game has mostly dissipated. This is a massively improved sequel in every other area, with better combat, quest design, and none of the technical issues that plagued the original. Not everyone will vibe with its slow-paced and oftentimes tedious approach, but those willing to meet it on its own terms will find a compelling open-world RPG that relishes in player agency and the consequences of your actions.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h16173"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While a few failures trigger a “game over”, many produce scenarios as winding and gratifying as any victory, and in any case, living life in Henry’s shoes has taught me to take the rain with the shine. In particular, I never wanted to simply overpower people the way blockbuster games teach you to, and Deliverance 2 met me halfway, initially, by having characters dunk on me when I tried to act the tough guy, or applaud me for being a good sport when I got my arse kicked. But after a series of mandatory plot skirmishes, my Henry has become a proficient and well-appointed combatant, because that is what KCD2 fundamentally requires him to be. It’s as though the game had assumed the role of that servant girl from my intro: it won’t let me get on with my day unless I consent to my own greatness.﻿<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h16174"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-pc/#:~:text=From%20its%20memorable%20cast%20of,that%20you%20shouldn't%20miss.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-pc/#:~:text=From%20its%20memorable%20cast%20of,that%20you%20shouldn't%20miss." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Trends</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The branching dialogue options and reputation system make for some engrossing moments. At certain points, I’m given the option to respond using the key tenets of Persuasion, Coercion, Domination, and others. This isn’t just determined by a rudimentary point value system from leveling up skills and perks. Rather, it relies on several factors, such as my standing within a community and even the dirt or blood on my clothing. After all, you probably won’t convince merchants that you’re a member of the nobility if you look like a vagabond, just as how you might not be able to intimidate the guards if you look like a total pushover. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h16175"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is, in almost every way, the RPG that so many fans have been asking for. With Baldur’s Gate 3 taking the world by storm, amidst so many other RPGs that widely missed the mark, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 presents a colossal, in-depth, beautiful, masterfully designed game right at the start of 2025. The performances are excellent, it’s a major technical step up, and evolves the game beyond its foundation into something that embraces modern audiences without losing its identity. The original game turned away many due to its slow-paced, tedious aspects and technical shortcomings, and while the sequel exceeds on a technical level by far, the biggest shame will be if people still give it a miss because of the almost simulator-like mechanics.﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h16176"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>WindowsCentral</em></a></span><br></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Given that I was a big fan of the original title, I went into Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 expecting to greatly enjoy the follow-up, too. Even so, I was thoroughly surprised by how <em>perfect </em>of a sequel it is, with Warhorse building on everything fans loved about KCD while simultaneously fixing its major story, combat, and performance issues. Between the immersive reactivity of its huge open world, countless varied quests to fill up your journal with, its engaging well-balanced combat, a gripping story, and immaculate presentation, it’s got everything a Kingdom Come fan could want and more. </p></blockquote><h2 id="h16177"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Looking for a sweeping fantasy romp? You won’t find one. Like its predecessor, this is a game whose story springs inevitably from the politics of its time and place: the Kingdom of Bohemia in 1403. Want to mow down your foes by the dozen? Good luck. Combat is a strange dance of positioning both your hands and feet relative to those of your enemies, and charging into the fray even in the late game is liable to get you cut apart. Want to equip a hauberk without first equipping a padded gambeson beneath it? What are you—some kind of moron?﻿</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has delivered the first official look at the new Battlefield game as part of an announcement around player testing and its development set-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The brief glimpse at pre-alpha Battlefield gameplay comes as part of a video revealing what EA calls Battlefield Labs and an accompanying call to arms for playtesters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, EA revealed Battlefield Studios, the umbrella branding for the four studios it has working on the new Battlefield. These are the series’ main Stockholm, Sweden-based developer, DICE, Dead Space remake and Star Wars: Squadrons developer Motive, U.S. studio Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA), and UK studio Criterion, whose work on Need For Speed has now come to an end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE in Sweden is building the multiplayer for the new Battlefield. Motive is working on single-player missions and multiplayer maps. Ripple Effect is working on bringing in new players to the Battlefield franchise. And Criterion is working on the single-player campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As already announced, the new Battlefield sees the return of a traditional single-player linear campaign after 2021’s Battlefield 2042 went multiplayer only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA said its collective Battlefield Studios teams are now entering a “critical” phase of the development cycle, and want player feedback on what to prioritize, improve, and refine before release. To that end, Battlefield Labs will see EA test almost everything but not everything players see will be complete. Participants will have to agree to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) before getting in.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/03/bf-labs-concept-art-1738588148146.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield Labs is designed to bring in playtesters for the new Battlefield. Concept art credit: Electronic Arts.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at,” EA said. “We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is an unprecedented moment for Battlefield. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And yes, we will be testing Conquest and Breakthrough, the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience, but BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve Battlefield pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial invites will be limited to a few thousand participants with servers located in Europe and North America. Over time EA will invite tens of thousands more with support for further territories. It’s worth remembering that while EA is devoting four entire studios to Battlefield, last year it shut down Ridgeline Games, a Seattle-based developer that was working on a new supposedly standalone single-player Battlefield game with more of a story focus, and laid off all its staff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, EA revealed fresh details on its untitled Battlefield game alongside its first concept art. IGN also confirmed that Battlefield will return to a modern setting after stints in World War I, World War II, and the near future. The concept art suggested ship-to-ship and helicopter combat will be part of the new game, and that it will feature natural disasters like wildfires.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Vince Zampella, Head of Respawn &amp; Group GM for EA Studios Organization, referenced Battlefield 3 and 4 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella">an interview with IGN</a>. "I mean, if you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there. But I think for me, it's that peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday… although I would say 1942 also."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The return to the modern setting represents a course correction for the series after Battlefield 2042, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/once-thought-dead-battlefield-2042-sees-huge-surge-of-players-during-free-weekend"><u>eventually found its footing</u></a> but was otherwise <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-open-beta-specialists-feedback-ea"><u>widely panned for features like Specialists</u></a> — characters that made it seem as if Battlefield was trying to be a hero shooter. Its ambitious 128-player maps also proved unpopular with fans who preferred a more focused experience. Battlefield 2042 eventually went back to supporting 64 players per map, and the next Battlefield plans to stick to that approach. Specialists are also out this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pressure on the next Battlefield is on after 2042’s missteps. EA CEO Andrew Wilson has called it one of the "most ambitious projects in [EA's] history," and based on the sheer number of studios involved, it’s a significant investment. The Battlefield Studios tagline is, “We’re all in on Battlefield.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yeah, it's definitely betting bigger on Battlefield,” Zampella told IGN in the interview from 2024. “It's going in and expanding what Battlefield is. We have to have the core. The core Battlefield players know what they want. They've been with us forever, they've been amazing supporters. We need to earn their trust back and get them back on our side. And then it's expanding out and getting more players into the universe and seeing what we can do, so when you want a different experience, you don't have to leave Battlefield. You can experience more things within the Battlefield universe. So we're expanding the offerings that we're giving."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has yet to announce a release date, launch platforms, or a final title for the new Battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review.1098969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some days I’ve moped about how I'll never get back the feeling I had the first time I played Skyrim. And then Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrived on a mighty steed to sweep me off my feet at full gallop. Armed with excellent, skill-focused melee combat and a rousing, action-packed medieval saga fit for a Hollywood blockbuster, it's one part sequel and one part coronation, bringing a lot of the original's ideas to fruition in the same way <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review">The Witcher 3</a> did for CD Projekt Red or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/17/greedfall-review">Greedfall</a> did for Spiders. No game of this scope and scale is without some technical scuff, of course, and its competing design goals are occasionally at war with themselves just as much as our hero Henry is internally. But even still, its majesty is hard to deny.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tragic tale picks up almost immediately where Kingdom Come: Deliverance left off back in 2018, though I don't necessarily think you need to have played the first one to get up to speed thanks to the main plot being relatively easy to follow and most of the callbacks being well explained as they happen. Henry, a blacksmith's son turned unlikely warrior, is thrown into the middle of dynastic politicking and bloodshed played out by a diverse and complex cast, including your boisterous failson of a liege lord and some truly memorable entrances from real historical figures I don't want to spoil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The star that shines brightest across this expanse of countryside, though, is the city of Kuttenberg. I can't speak about this place in any terms less flattering than to say it might be one of the wonders of the modern RPG world. I don't think I've ever walked the streets of a virtual medieval city that feels this huge, detailed, and most importantly, alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layout is based largely on the actual town that still stands today, with parts of it following the modern street grid almost exactly. It's a wonderful place to simply wander around and discover all kinds of urban adventures – from resolving a dispute between two rival sword schools to hunting down a grisly serial killer. Yes, some of the NPCs obviously share the same voice actor and others share the same face – even important side characters, which can be particularly jarring. But it’s hard to get too hung up on that in a place like this. When I first arrived here I was already more than 40 hours into my 120-hour journey, and I spent multiple in-game days gleefully shopping for the sickest duds and best armor I could afford. And that's what arriving in a huge regional capital should make me want to do!</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are around 100 quests, and practically every one was memorable.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The quest variety is what impressed me most of all, and that extends beyond just Kuttenburg. Very rarely are you simply sent to kill some bandits or carry a package to the next town – at least without some kind of interesting twist, moment of emotional turmoil, or decision built in. There are around 100 quests in total and, having done nearly all of them, practically every single one was memorable enough that it would stand out as a highlight in a lesser RPG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Admittedly, some were slightly better in concept than execution. There was one I stumbled onto completely by accident that took me deep underground and turned my sword-swinging adventure into a horror movie, but ended up being far too short for the dread to really set in. All the same, I never felt like doing side quests ever became a chore, because I knew each one would be its own little complete episode of The Adventures of Henry, stuffed with quality writing and unique objectives. It's a testament to how consistently strong they were that 120 hours did not feel way too long to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way are expansive, breathtakingly beautiful landscapes spread over two open-world maps, both of which are chock full of meticulously researched details of late medieval Bohemian life. There isn't a ton of variety in terms of geography – it's all wooded hills and meadows, for the most part. But that’s what the region looks like in real life. It's big enough to get lost in, and the contrast between villages and open wilderness varies things up nicely enough. I did find it odd that you can't go into most of the churches, though, since those would be near the top of my list if I were planning a tourist trip through 1400s Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the side quests are like episodes of a TV show, the main quest is a big-screen war movie that pulls out all the stops in its ambition, dialogue, and emotional range. Parts of it made me cheer. Parts of it actually brought me to tears. And Henry's ultimate nemesis got under my skin in a way video game bad guys rarely do, making me rethink everything I’d done up to that point in what might be one of the most memorable final encounters I've ever played through. It's mature without being edgy, it drips with historical authenticity, and it has interesting questions to ask you about what it means to be a hero or a villain.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main quest is like a big-screen war movie that pulls out all the stops.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's somewhat unfortunate, then, that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is both a mostly linear medieval action-drama and an open-world sandbox, and those two concepts don't always play well together. I'm going to skirt around spoilers the best I can, but I need to give a specific example of the worst experience I had. I need to tell you about the Hungarian Camp.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one of the late-game areas, there is a military camp set up by King Sigismund, the evil conquering bastard you've been opposing since the first hour of the first game. I, of course, tried to assault it by myself the second I got there, and was immediately put down like a dog. Fair enough. But for the next 40 hours of adventuring, I was plotting my revenge. A fire was lit in me – motivation to become as much of a badass as possible. I studied with all of the best blademasters. I learned the way of the bow. I saved up for the best armor. I forged, by hand, the very best sword in Bohemia. Next time I showed up at that camp, things were going to be different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, near the end, I went back to the Hungarian Camp Rambo-style and I killed everyone there. Okay, not the cook or the tailor. And not Musa – Musa's cool. But probably somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 40 armed men. This was an empowering and gleeful rush, with difficult combat that tested all of my skills like never before. A real highlight of the entire journey. And these are enemy soldiers, let me remind you! I don't feel like this was an unpredictable or degenerate thing to do.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a downer when, shortly after, I was asked to infiltrate this same camp as a spy, and Henry didn't even so much as mention that he had completely desolated the place and had a bounty on his head so large that the authorities would skip fines and prison and straight-up execute you if you're caught. This is a required story quest with no alternate path, so the ridiculous, frustrating solution was to sneak up on the unkillable quest NPCs several times to talk to them and start the next cutscene before that same NPC spotted me and went running to call the guards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also ruined my near-perfect reputation because I guess killing <em>invading enemy soldiers</em> was a crime the peasants Sigismund is actively oppressing couldn't forgive, and everyone in every town ended up hating me. But this was a major outlier in what was otherwise a hugely engrossing, marathon-length playthrough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other than that one total debacle though, I truly adored almost every minute I spent with Henry and company. The tactical, skill-based sword combat is a sharp refinement of the already great system from the first game, though I felt like at higher levels, the balance of pure stats to player skill skewed too much in favor of the former. You could probably reach the credits without actually getting particularly good at the swordplay, which was certainly not the case in the first one. But it is cleaner, more varied, and smoother to play. Archery, in particular, has improved a lot.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Open World RPGs</h3><p>The best open world RPGs to play in 2025</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a blacksmithing minigame now, which I found a little bit clunky and unsatisfying, but it's still great to be able to use a sword I made myself in combat. And alchemy has been made way more intuitive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also really like the new perk system, where every level up feels like it gives you multiple choices between meaningful bonuses. In the first one, a lot of perks honestly felt more like side-grades than upgrades. There was a perk that made it so sleeping outside was more restful, but sleeping in a bed, less so. The sequel’s version only has the upside, and not the drawback, which is important if I'm going to spend my hard-earned skill points on something rather than picking it as a character background at the beginning. And while there wasn't a single quest as interesting or different as the monk arc from the original, getting to level up my scholarship and unlock new quest resolutions by destroying my enemies with facts and logic was also great.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Did I mention that it runs really well on my 4070 Ti, even at 4K and very high settings? I still can't even run the first Kingdom Come: Deliverance at max settings on this same machine, and that game is seven years old at this point. So the optimization work that was done here deserves a shout. There are also plenty of bugs, but most of them are of the silly sort you screenshot to show your friends that you'd expect in an RPG with this much ambition. Only rarely did something actually disrupt my gameplay.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With tariffs by the US set to take effect on Tuesday, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expressed concern about how they may affect the video game industry. In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/esa-statement-on-proposed-tariffs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement on its website</a>, the ESA warned that import taxes on gaming devices would "negatively impact hundreds of millions of Americans."</p><p>The ESA, the trade association representing most of the major publishers in gaming, said that tariffs would "harm the [game] industry’s significant contributions to the US economy." The ESA ended the statement by saying it was looking forward to "working with the [Trump] Administration and Congress to find ways to sustain the economic growth" supported by the game industry. According to the ESA, total video game sales in the US <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-consumer-spending-on-video-games-totaled-58-7-billion-in-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached $58.7 billion in 2024</a>.</p><p>The US government is set to enact import taxes on Canada and China at 12 AM ET on February 4. Canada faces a 25% tariff on products imported to the US, while China, where technology products, including video game consoles, are manufactured, is looking at a 10% tariff. The Trump administration initially targeted Mexico, a hotspot for video game disc production, with a 25% import tax, but Trump agreed on Tuesday to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-sheinbaum-trudeau-017efa8c3343b8d2a9444f7e65356ae9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">halt planned tariffs on Mexico</a> for a month. All three countries have announced their own countermeasures, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-retaliation-trudeau-sheinbaum-70e067b092a3af72c2eb7ca37d532c91" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">retaliatory tariffs against the US</a>.</p><p>Trump also expressed intentions to enact tariffs on computer chips, a plan he still appeared keen on pursuing even after <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/despite-meeting-with-nvidia-ceo-trump-sticks-with-plan-to-tariff-foreign" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meeting with Nvidia CEO</a> Jensen Huang on Friday.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
If you could barely contain yourself when Minecraft added a bunch of new pig variants last month, you might want to hold onto something solid: Mojang is back with a brand-new content update for public testing, and this time we're talking <em>cows</em>.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Minecraft's <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/more-minecraft-game-drop-features">latest Java snapshot</a> includes a grand total of two cow variants. You've got your fur-covered cold cows who'll wander around those snow-covered biomes, as well as your warm cows who like to do their grazing in sandy biomes.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of which, Mojang has also introduced new ambient sounds for desert biomes, which include whispering sand, chirping crickets, rustling twigs, and howling winds. Additionally, players can place a dead bush on two outdoor sand blocks, or cluster sand and terracotta blocks together to bring some of that desert ambience back to their own bases.

<p>
Elsewhere, there's a lot going on in the world of bushes. Java snapshot players can also get acquainted with the new firefly bush, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like - conjuring a dainty swirl of dancing lights around its branches at nighttime. It's found in swamps and other bodies of water, with players able to retrieve the firefly bush and grow it using bone meal back at base if they want to enjoy it closer to home. Additionally, the firefly bush can be placed under a block to give the block above a sparkly effect.
</p><p>
Still in the realm of shrubbery, Minecraft's final addition is the evocatively named "bush" - a new bush found in forests, birch forests, plains, windswept hills, and other green biomes. This can also be grown in bone meal if you need all the bushes, all the time.
</p>

<p>
All the above - as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-adds-new-pig-variants-ambient-falling-leaves-wildflowers-and-more-for-testing">new pig variants, ambient falling leaves, and wildflowers</a> added for testing in January - are available right now as part of Minecraft: Java Edition's latest snapshot, and can be accessed by enabling snapshots in the launcher's "Installations" tab. Mojang notes the new features are coming to Bedrock beta and preview "soon" - and everything currently in testing will get a full release at some point later this year.
</p>
<p>
Mojang hasn't yet said <em>when</em> Minecraft's first full content drop of 2025 is due, but it did previously confirm it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">changing the way it releases new content</a>. Gone is Minecraft's traditional mega-sized summer update, replaced by multiple smaller drops throughout the year.

            <p>Watch out for that falling breezeblock! It's about to-- ah, too late, you've been donked. A clip of loud wreckage, gunfire, and bazooka'd buildings has fallen dustily into our lap via a promotional video for Battlefield 6 (or whatever the developers plan to call the next of these large-scale first-person shooters). Mostly, it's a lot of producers talking a big game about "levelling up" the "core experience", which seems to remain blasting a building you don't like with a rocket-propelled grenade. We can tell from the final 10 seconds of the video, which show some of the game's actual running and/or gunning.</p>

<p>Yup, sure looks like a Battlefield game. A rocket is fired into a building, lots of dust and rubble falls down around soldiers, a big tank parks itself helpfully in the middle of the road. </p>
<p>The producers chat from a hypescript for most of the rest of the video and hail from four different studios, all working on the game in some way or another: Dice, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect. We already knew most of what the video covers, including that the shooter will have a single player campaign, and that it'll take place in a modern or near-future setting. </p><p>The only new thing is mention of a program called "Battlefield Labs" in which members of the public can sign up for the chance to playtest the game. It seems like a fancy way of saying "sign an NDA and we'll give you a test build". EA (among other companies) commonly source playtesters from the public like this. Think of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-heelflips-into-my-calendar-with-an-early-access-release-some-time-in-2025">open and ongoing testing</a> done for another EA studio, Full Circle, who like to watch people play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> and presumably take notes when players fall and hurt their little bum-bums. </p>
<p>As for the four-studio unity on display, it is hard to take this display of corporate unity at face value. Criterion's role on the game means that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-have-delayed-need-for-speed-so-criterion-can-support-battlefield-6">plan to work on the next Need For Speed game is postponed</a>. And Electronic Arts did have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">a fifth crowd involved on the campaign</a> at one point - Ridgeline Games, a studio set up by Halo series veteran Marcus Lehto. But EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shuttered that studio last year</a>. So, uh, no mention of them in this promo piece. Awkward.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Pump the brakes on expectations for a new Need for Speed anytime soon. That's because Criterion, the developer behind the racing series, is all in on supporting the next Battlefield experience currently. But EA is promising that Need for Speed will return eventually.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a> spoke with Battlefield boss Vince Zampella about Criterion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">which now sits under the Battlefield Studios banner</a>. Of course, that sort of change--with Criterion supporting the single-player experience for the next Battlefield--brings up questions about whether the developer might only be focused on the shooter series going forward.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"The Need for Speed team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield," said Zampella. "As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for Unbound. With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways."</p><p dir="ltr">In September 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfs-burnout-studio-will-work-on-next-battlefield-game-and-also-more-nfs/1100-6517857/" data-ref-id="1100-6517857">EA announced that Criterion was contributing to the next Battlefield game</a>, though it added work would continue with the Need for Speed series. Criterion previously partnered on Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042. Meanwhile, earlier in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-need-for-speed-developers-form-new-studio-called-fuse-games/1100-6512400/" data-ref-id="1100-6512400">former Criterion developers formed Fuse Games</a> after the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/need-for-speed-unbound-review-comic-book-racing/1900-6418010/" data-ref-id="1900-6418010">Need for Speed Unbound</a>, the last entry in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Criterion became the de facto studio for the racing series with Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit in 2010, followed up by Need for Speed: Most Wanted in 2012. Previously, the developer was best known for creating and overseeing the Burnout franchise. Then, Ghost Games took charge of the franchise, starting with 2013's Need for Speed Rivals and ending with 2019's Need for Speed Heat. EA revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-development-is-moving-back-to-crite/1100-6473648/" data-ref-id="1100-6473648">Criterion was coming back to Need for Speed in 2020</a>, ultimately releasing 2022's Need for Speed Unbound.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>NetEase has cracked the live-service element with Marvel Rivals. We’re already looking ahead to Season 2 as everything the developer puts out is a win, so let’s see the early details to see what the developer is cooking up for the second season.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 2 is unlikely to be as big and as impactful as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-eternal-night-falls-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a>. The first season was the proper debut, we were still in the early days, and player counts usually tend to fall off as time goes on—no matter how good the game. Still, NetEase has Hulk-smashed it, and January 2025 saw its peak <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">player count smash the 650,000</a> mark.</p>



<p>That being said, we need to look ahead to the future. The developer needs to keep its foot on the pedal and prioritize retention.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-expected-release-period">Marvel Rivals Season 2 Expected Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The saga continues. Credit to NetEase</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>NetEase hasn’t outlined an exact start date, but game director Guangyun Chen’s comments suggest Season 2 could start on April 4.</strong></p>



<p>Guangyun Chen said in an interview with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/14/marvel-rivals-interview-make-a-hit-live-service-game-22352641/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metro</a> that Season One is a “<strong>three-month-long journey</strong>.” Season 1 launched on Friday, January 10, so if we fast-forward three months (12 weeks), we land on <strong>Friday, April 4</strong>.</p>



<p>There are several factors to consider here though. Firstly, three months can mean January to April, so it’s not necessarily 12 weeks. It could be 13 or 14, so it’s logical conjecture for now. Furthermore, it’s quite common for projected dates to change by a week or two due to delays or rethinks.</p>



<p>I’ve seen countless live-service games delay seasons down the years, and Marvel Rivals is liable to suffer the same fate. Fingers crossed it doesn’t, but we will update you on the latest changes and developments.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-2-new-hero-leaks-amp-early-details">Marvel Rivals Season 2 New Hero Leaks &amp; Early Details</h2>



<p><strong>A ton of different leaks suggest Marvel Rivals Season 2 is getting two new heroes from a large selection of potential characters including various X-Men heroes and more.</strong></p>



<p>We know Marvel Rivals is guaranteed to get at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-heroes-every-3-months/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new heroes every three months</a>. Many names have been outed with leakers such as <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@X0X_LEAK</a> posting <a href="https://x.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1872451730652422378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">messages on X</a> concerning heroes in the game’s files.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-x-men-characters-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men characters have leaked</a>—thanks to datamining—and suggestions are that more high-profile names such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-leak-claims-deadpool-and-more-are-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadpool</a> are Marvel Rivals-bound. On the other hand, more reports have come out saying NetEase is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hiding fake heroes in game files to catch leakers</a>.”</p>



<p>It’s hard to say for sure if NetEase is doing this, but if they are, it’s an interesting move. For now, here’s every leaked name, and we’ll see if any of them appear in Marvel Rivals Season Two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Angela</li>



<li>Beast</li>



<li>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</li>



<li>Colossus</li>



<li>Deadpool</li>



<li>Emma Frost</li>



<li>Gambit</li>



<li>Hit-Monkey</li>



<li>Jia Jing</li>



<li>Jubilee</li>



<li>Locus</li>



<li>Modok</li>



<li>Nightcrawler</li>



<li>Paste Pot Pete</li>



<li>Phoenix/Jean Grey&nbsp;</li>



<li>Professor X</li>



<li>Rogue</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-2">What To Expect From Marvel Rivals Season 2</h2>



<p>We’re still weeks away from a Marvel Rivals Season 2 content roadmap or NetEase announcements, but it’s safe to assume we’ll get typical live-service content additions: <strong>New maps, heroes, game modes, and Events</strong>.</p>



<p>This is the kind of information we get more of—including leaks—closer to the time. But, it’s fun to speculate, and it’s easy to make educated guesses based on previous content and seasons.</p>



<p>New heroes are assured, as we covered above, but don’t expect the volume of characters we got in Season 1 as this is considered a one-off. New maps are about the most locked-in type of content for any new hero shooter season too.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-spring-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1’s Spring Festival and Clash of Dancing Lions</a> is an example of the type of events and content Rivals is adding in the future. With Seasons lasting three months, another event or two for Season 2 is a given. We’ll be filling in the blanks as we go on all of this and see if we can borrow Doctor Strange’s powers to see into the future.</p>



<hr>



<p>Details for Marvel Rivals Season 2 are vague right, granted. But it won’t always be the case, and we’ll update you as developments happen. But what do you want to see from the new season? What’s NetEase not getting right in the F2P shooter?</p>

<p>The Need for Speed franchise isn’t dead, it’s just dormant for a while. </p>



<p>EA has confirmed that  it has plans for Criterion Software—developers of 2022’s Need for Speed Unbound and other past racing titles—to return to the franchise in the future. For now, however, the sole focus at Criterion is the next Battlefield game as part of EA’s “Battlefield Studios” team.</p>







<p>“The Need for Speed&nbsp;team at Criterion are joining their colleagues working on Battlefield,” EA’s Vince Zampella&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-will-return-ea-pledges-but-team-all-in-on-battlefield-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told Eurogamer</a>. “As a company, it was important to us to take the last year to listen to our Need for Speed community and use their feedback to create content for Unbound.</p>



<p>“With an increased understanding of what our players want in a Need for Speed experience, we plan to bring the franchise back in new and interesting ways.”</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Confirms Battlefield Labs Community Testing Platform</a></h6>



<p>Based on the statement, it seems clear that there is no new Need for Speed in development in any way at the studio. That means, if and when it returns, fans are looking at years down the line for its release.</p>



<p>When do you think Criterion will return to developing Need For Speed? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-caster-rages-at-liquid-players-inexcusable-misplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A color caster for Counter-Strike 2 found himself screaming at a pro player’s mistake, and had to walk away from the desk to cool off. The play and the caster’s reaction occurred at IEM Katowice, one of the biggest tournaments in the yearly CS2 circuit.</p>



<p>What ended up being a terrible series for the player was highlighted by this one unimaginably poor play.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-you-doing">‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING?’</h2>



<p>During a match between Team Liquid and The MongolZ, a poor decision from Liquid player Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak drew the ire of former player and long-time CS2 caster Chad “SPUNJ” Burchill. While defending the B site of Mirage in the pistol round, ultimate waited too long to pull the trigger, allowing a teammate of his to die before he himself got taken out. Both SPUNJ and his casting partner Alex “Machine” Richardson were quite frustrated, but SPUNJ let the full anger out.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250203_AcceptableTriangularAirGuitarThisIsSparta-j-dfX8zpT8v4JKDA_source.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>What ultimate was trying to do was to stay hidden until multiple enemies passed him, so that he could take them all down in quick succession. However, he waited too long to act, and the first player he let by ended up killing his teammate. By the time ultimate lined up the second enemy, the first one noticed him and quickly dispatched him.</p>



<p>Ultimate’s performance in the map prior was clearly a factor in SPUNJ’s outburst, as the Polish player had a <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/matches/mapstatsid/191534/the-mongolz-vs-liquid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0.5 K/D</a> in the first map of the series. Following the mishap, SPUNJ remarked that the play was “inexcusable,” especially considering that Liquid had a man advantage. The CS2 caster chose to walk away from the desk and out of the casting room for the second round. Both SPUNJ and Machine got back on track by the end of the third round though.</p>



<p>To make matters worse for ultimate, Liquid lost despite winning map one, and he ended with one of his worst stat lines ever. On a positive note, ultimate played better the next day versus MOUZ, and Liquid is still alive in Katowice.</p>



<p>Was ultimate’s play warrant that big of a reaction from the caster? Let us know what you think down below or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released for PC via Steam and Epic at the end of last week, but just a few days and 5000+ user reviews later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2s-pc-port-is-already-getting-slammed-by-steam-users">it settled on a "mixed" rating on Steam</a> with players reporting bugs, stabilisation issues, and crashes.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-labs-could-let-you-shape-the-next-battlefield-game-through-testing.1098822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and its "collective Battlefield Studios teams" have announced Battlefield Labs, a testing initiative that will allow certain&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>players to test out the new game and provide their feedback during development.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/news/this-is-battlefield-labs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>website, EA describes Battlefield Labs as its "most ambitious community development collaboration ever". The initiative will give players the chance to provide their feedback in order to "validate the future of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>".</p>

<p>So, what exactly will Battlefield Labs entail? Essentially, if you're approved for the program, you'll be testing various elements of the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, like core combat, environment destruction, and "balance and feedback" for features like weapons, gadgets, and vehicles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-labs-announced-bf2042.jpg?itok=Gw27uiy4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-labs-announced-bf2042.jpg?itok=rV4k72SI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battlefield Labs seems like an attempt to avoid another disastrous launch like that of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>EA also says that Battlefield Labs will include tests for the Conquest and Breakthrough gameplay modes, which it describes as "the heart and soul of our all-out warfare experience", as well as "pillars" of the franchise like its class system, which was controversially replaced with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/battlefield-2042-specialist-system-gamble" rel="nofollow">the Specialist system</a> in&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for a chance to join the Battlefield Labs program <a href="https://electronicarts.queue-it.net/?c=electronicarts&amp;e=generalsite&amp;cid=en-US" rel="nofollow">right here</a>, but at time of writing, there are tens of thousands of users in the queue, so be prepared to wait a while before you get your opportunity.</p>

<p>Initially, only "a few thousand participants" will be invited to join Battlefield Labs in Europe and North America, but over time, "tens of thousands more" across "further territories" will get to try the game out.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that this doesn't constitute a full announcement of the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game, although you can see a few seconds of gameplay in the video EA released as part of the Battlefield Labs announcement. You can check that out here.</p>




<p>It's likely that Battlefield Labs is part of EA's attempt to avoid repeating the disastrous launch of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-bugs-other-issues-plague-launch" rel="nofollow">plagued with bugs and other problems</a> at launch, as well as missing features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-scoreboard-update-coming-in-february" rel="nofollow">scoreboards</a>.</p>

<p>The problems at launch were so bad that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/60000-battlefield-2042-players-want-their-money-back" rel="nofollow">a petition</a> to allow players to claim an unequivocal refund for the game reached <a href="https://www.change.org/p/sony-allow-refund-for-battlefield-2042-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost 234,000 signatures</a>, which is probably why EA wants to make sure the next game is ready for player scrutiny before it's released.</p>

<p>The seventh season of&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 2042</em>, which took place last year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-2042-seasons-ending" rel="nofollow">served as the game's last</a>, and production on the next game ramped up around the same time. Four studios - Motive, DICE, Criterion, and Ripple Effect - are currently working on the game.</p>

<p>We don't know what the next <i>Battlefield&nbsp;</i>will be called yet, nor do we know when it'll release, but we do, at least, know it'll have been made with the participation of the community. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, Alice B (RPS in peace) was frustrated that the villagers in Early Access medieval townbuilder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/foundation">Foundation</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-furious-idiot-villagers-will-not-eat-their-bread-and-now-theyre-starving">would not eat their bread</a> and were furiously starving. Then it turned out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-i-was-the-one-starving-my-foundation-villagers-all-along-my-bad">Alice was the one starving them</a>. Hoho! Pure japes.
</p>
<p>Five years later, Foundation has just hit 1.0.

<p>The 1.0 update sounds substantial, from the number of new, improved and revamped features <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/690830/view/507318638682833727">in this Steam news post</a>. It includes a coat of arms editor, new types of residential housing, a less restrictive progression system, and my favourite, "new and improved walls". This is referring to the kind of walls that wrap around and fortify your village, but I like to imagine they mean just all the walls.
</p>
<p>I really don't want to undersell the size of the update. One of the other subheadings is "a completely revamped art direction." No minor final tweaks are these.
</p>
<p>As a consequence of the scale of these changes, some Early Access saves will no longer be compatible with the 1.0 release. If that means you, you can still access older version of the game within Steam by heading to the game properties, hitting up the beta tab, and selecting 'early_access_1_9' in the dropdown. Mods will also need updating, and as such are not currently available immediately after the 1.0 launch.
</p><p>Apparently the developers plan to continue to support the game with new quality-of-life updates, modding features and tools and more, as well as DLC in due course. Whether any of this will allow Alice B to live down her bread shame, I do not know.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
