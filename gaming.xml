                <p>While Sony and Nintendo have expanded their lead over Xbox, a dark horse console had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kinects-revenge-nex-playground-outsells-xbox-hardware-in-the-us/1100-6537053/" data-ref-id="1100-6537053">a very strong showing</a> in third place in November. The Nex Playground has emerged as a breakout hit, and CEO David Lee believes that one of the reasons why its been so successful is because the console has solved the Wii "problem."</p><p>Nearly two decades ago, the Wii powered Nintendo's post-GameCube comeback with its motion controls and unique games. Lee argues that the scope of Wii's success made it difficult to sustain in the long term. Instead of trying to sell games like Wii, Nex Playground is offering its titles as part of a subscription service.</p><p>"One of the most important things we should do is learn from history and try not to commit the same limitations, and that's why we have a subscription model," Lee told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-want-a-nex-playground-in-every" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "Nintendo expanded the audience with Wii. When you expand the audience, and they want different things, and they only buy Wii Fit, Wii Sports and not many others … that's a bit of a problem."</p><p>Lee was very complementary toward Nintendo in his follow-up remarks, but he added that the Wii's model of selling only a few games to certain members of its install base was "not sustainable."</p><p>"It's very important that we set ourselves up to serve our customer continuously with new innovations," added Lee. "That is how the whole system can sustain. But it started with Wii. We are standing on a giant’s shoulder."</p><p>Nex Playground reportedly accounted for 14% of all console sales on Black Friday, finishing ahead of the Xbox family of systems.</p>

A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a> reported that the platform is rampant with predators.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are an Avatar, floating in the void. By your power alone you can mold the earth beneath you, from scorching deserts to shifting seas. But there is another Avatar, a foe contesting the realm. Will you have the magic, wits, and minions to survive? That’s the question posed to you when you shuffle up your decks and play <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></a>, a Trading Card Game created by Erik's Curiosa.</p><p><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is a collectible TCG created in 2024 by Erik’s Curiosa, which aims to capture the old-school feel of classic trading card games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28960c39-7173-4bd8-bcaf-074e72deed91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Magic: The Gathering</a>.</p><p>From incredible, oil-painted artwork (of which all the artists retain the rights to their work!), to a “Kitchen Table TCG” design philosophy, the game aims to capture what it felt like to first crack packs of early-days TCG’s and jump into a strange and enchanting world.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-beginning-board-state.jpeg?itok=Ou5OURx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-beginning-board-state.jpeg?itok=O45IfbRQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>The rules are designed to be simple, but there’s plenty of tactical strategy involved to encourage players to experiment with deck-building and different approaches to battle.</p><h2>How Do You Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>To play the game, each player will need an Avatar of their choosing, a deck of 30 Atlas Cards, and a deck of 50 Spellbook cards, as well as a play mat or gaming surface divided into a 4x5 grid.</p><p>There are four different elements (you guessed it: earth, wind, air, and fire) which each give different flavor to cards, and require different types of Site cards played on the field to power up.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-4.jpg?itok=5NIkZgzv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">

  </picture><p>You’ll use your Avatar to play these Site cards onto the battlefield, cast spells, attack enemy Site cards with minions, and attempt to bring your opponent’s health down to 0 - which triggers a tense end-game as you move your forces in for the kill.</p><p>Wait… did I just say move?</p><h2>How Does It Feel To Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>One of the most exciting aspects of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is the way you battle on the board. You’ll actually move your minions and Avatar around the playing field (once you’ve placed cards down that serve as realms across the vast void), attacking, defending, and trying to close the gap on your opponent. This adds a thrilling mix of troop movement into your usual TCG game.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-board-closeup.jpeg?itok=a2uLWKI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1440" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-board-closeup.jpeg?itok=lx1gy53R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="900">
                  

  </picture><p>In a way, it almost feels like you’re playing a smaller, approachable version of a tabletop war-game in the middle of your classic TCG. This reliance on physical placement of cards on the board adds a truly unique feel to the game - with some Spells shooting out in a straight line. There are also ways to destroy your opponent's Site cards, or in other ways hinder your enemy's movement.</p><p>Attacking feels familiar to games like <em>Magic</em>, where your Minions deal damage equal to their strength to your opponent's Minions - but there's a unique mechanic here, too, where nearby allied Minions can swoop in to help defend. It all leads to much more movement around the board than you'd expect at first glance (most Minions and Avatars can only move one space per activation). It all feels familiar <em>and</em> refreshingly new at the same time. Just like the artwork on the cards.</p><h2>The Art of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As you've likely noticed from the imagery so far in this review, the artwork on display for <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is unique, iconic, and captures a feeling I miss from modern TCG games: that hand-made feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not saying games like <em>Magic</em> and <em>Pokemon</em> can't have gorgeous card art - they more often than not <em>do</em> - but overall there's a slickness to the images that leaves them feeling less personal.</p><picture>

This creates a very authentic and varied feel within the art, evoking the golden age of fantasy."</p><p>That's my favorite part of the Sorcery artwork, every card looks different. <em>That</em> feels like old-school TCG games to me, where there's no unified set of design imperatives all the artists have to adhere to. It feels free, wild, and evokes the varied magic being flung around the void in <em>Sorcery</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Learning The Game</h2><p>The game's core rules and concepts are very easy to pick up on <em>if</em> you're a veteran of trading card games already. You'll understand core mechanics like needing resources to play cards, tapping things to attack/gain effects, etc. If you're brand new to trading card games, you will need to do a bit of catch up - as <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> takes the foundations built over the last 30 years of gaming and adds on it with "troop movement" (for lack of a better term).</p><p>My <em>only</em> complaint with the game is also something I love about it - go figure! That's this "kitchen table" approach to gaming, meaning there are some elements that flavorful, but not clearly defined (especially in the starter set's quickstart rulebook). And while that leads to a little extra flipping back and forth through the core rules, I'd imagine it also opens the game up to more creative ideation in the future.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Where To Start With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As I just mentioned above, <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> currently has three sets out: the core set, Arthurian Legends, and the <em>just</em> released set: Gothic. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I highly recommend picking up one of their two Starter Sets - The Four Elements Starter Set comes from the core set, and features four mini-decks each attuned to one of the four elements.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a great way to get a taste of the game. The new The Prophets of Doom Starter Set was just released with the release of Gothic, and features four decks attuned to angels, demons, and other gleefully grim cards from the new set.</p><h2><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm - </em>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I've wanted to try <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> for a while now based just on hearing rumbling about it in the TCG community, and I'm so glad I did! <em>Sorcery</em> is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, completely blowing away my expectations. The artwork on display is unlike anything else in the TCG world today, and the gameplay feels fluid, satisfying, and tactical.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a fan of classic fantasy artwork and you're looking for a new game to try as your other faves get filled with outside IP's, chase ultra-shiny mega rares, and more bloat -- you should absolutely give <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> a spin! You won't be disappointed.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>On Friday, retro and arcade game publisher ININ Games surprisingly announced it’s been able to “recalculate production” on offering a physical version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>for the Switch 2 because “Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2.” Physical games on the Switch 2 have been something of a contentious topic; full physical games are reportedly expensive for developers, while game-key cards don’t actually have the game on the cart.</p><p>But later in the day, ININ removed that line from its post and published <a href="https://x.com/ININ_Games/status/2002062795857174721">a significant correction</a>: “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo.” However, it will still be able to offer the physical Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em>, though by tacking on €10 to the retail price.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Solid information about why more developers don’t offer games fully on-cartridge is hard to find, though it may come down to cost. In May, a Brazilian Nintendo journalist <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1921315639563608384?s=19">reported that</a>, based on leaks from Arc System Works, Nintendo only offered two types of physical games for developers: a 64GB cartridge and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/643635/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-explained">game-key card</a>. The YouTube channel Physical Paradise has <a href="https://youtu.be/x1wCUjEwklg?si=PhTU7qqhdB_t7nFT&amp;t=274">also reported that</a> the cost of a physical cartridge is “about” $16, “which is quite expensive.”</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad, replying to ININ Games’ initial announcement about the new cartridge sizes, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/2002066817704194487">said on X that</a> “cost was always the primary factor between key cards vs full cart releases.”</p><div><div><p id="do-you-know-the-actual-cost-of-switch-2-cartridges"><h2>Do you know the actual cost of Switch 2 cartridges?</h2></p></div><p>If you do, please email me at jay.peters@theverge.com or message me on Signal @jaypeters.11.</p></div><p>It’s unclear exactly how much more affordable additional cartridge capacity sizes could be or why the company might offer them to developers now. New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen tells me it could be because of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">rising cost of memory</a>; his two cents is that this “is in anticipation of memory going up in cost soon, allowing Nintendo to charge a more reasonable price especially for third-party games.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/848462/nintendo-switch-2-smaller-cartridges-inin-games]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A change-up has happened at Archetype Entertainment. The lead of the studio, James Ohlen, will be stepping down from the company, shifting his role within the parent company, Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/james-ohlen-shifts-from-archetype-entertainment-head-to-creative-consultant-for-tabletop-rpgs-at-wizards.716766/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, James Ohlen has chosen to leave his position as the lead of Archetype Entertainment. This is a new internal games studio established by tabletop giant Wizards of the Coast to develop AAA videogames based on original IPs.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This is important since the studio's first project, <em>Exodus</em>, has been long in development. After its 2023 announcement, a lot of pre-rendered trailers, a dedicated episode in the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, and an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coasts-exodus-ttrpg-is-out-putting-sci-fi-twist-on-dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">TTRPG tie-in</a>, the sci-fi title had a gameplay trailer at this year's The Game Awards. The game appears to be a narrative-focused third-person action title. It also dropped a release date of early 2027.</p><p>Ohlen's official reasons for his departure from Archetype Entertainment were that he felt that his work on <em>Exodus</em> was complete and that the final bits of development were in good hands. Given the nature of videogame development cycles, this tracks. It means the game is essentially content complete; all that is left is QA, playtesting, and improving technical performance.</p><p>But Ohlen is not completely departing from Wizards of the Coast as a company. Ohlen will remain as a creative consultant for the tabletop publisher, shifting his focus to TTRPGs. This is a familiar field for Ohlen since he launched Arcanum Worlds, a TTRPG studio dedicated to publishing third-party material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><p>Better still, Arcanum Worlds' output has a consistent record of quality. Their world includes DMs Guild supplements like <em>Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy</em> and <em>Heroes of Baldur's Gate,</em> as well as the comprehensive book on the Nine Hells, <em>Chains of Asmodeus</em>. The studio has also created original fantasy settings built on D&amp;D's system, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragon-age-writer-reveals-raiders-of-serpent-sea" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Raiders of the Serpent Sea</em></a> and <em>Odyssey of the Dragonlords</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

I don’t play </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, so I didn’t think much of it when my coworkers were chatting about how tough today’s word was. That is, until I looked outside of the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Slack and to the rest of the internet, where I saw that </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> players were absolutely crashing out about today’s word.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The word for today is “myrrh,” which, for those who don’t know about the cool shit Jesus was given when he died, is a “fragrant gum resin obtained from various Arabian and African trees and used in perfumery, medicines, and incense.” For a lot of players, the go-to </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> strategy is to start by guessing vowels as a basis and then filling in consonants based on where the vowels fall. As you can see, myrrh has no vowels, so players were already at a disadvantage. Many tried and failed to figure out the word, and it just about ruined their day.</span></p>

What I wasn’t expecting was some of the other responses I came across that we elected not to share here. I know edgy humor and wild comparisons are common in most gaming spheres, but I did not expect some of the vile shit I saw </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>players calling the game’s developers. So if you’re down to see some truly off-the-wall, excessive reactions to a simple word game, you can search for that yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>At any rate, maybe they’ll bring “myrrh” back to </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><span>Jimmy Fallon’s game show</span></a><span> version comes along, and we’ll see someone crash out on live television.</span></p>

But they’ve remained <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-switch-2s-gameless-game-key-cards-are-going-to-be-very-common/">popular with publishers</a> that want to save production costs on a boxed Switch 2 game release, since Game Key Cards don’t include any of the expensive flash memory found on a standard Switch 2 cartridge.</p>
<p>Now, though, at least one publisher has publicly suggested that Nintendo is offering cheaper Switch 2 cartridge options with smaller storage capacities, lowering production costs in a way that could make full cartridge releases more viable for many games on the console.</p>
<p><a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully">Earlier this week</a>, <em>R-Type Dimensions III </em>publisher Inin Games explained to customers that it couldn’t switch from Game Key Cards to a “full physical cartridge” for the retail version of the Switch 2 game without “significantly rais[ing] manufacturing costs.” Those additional costs would “force us to increase the retail price by at least €15 [about $20],” Inin Games wrote at the time.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/doesitplay.org/post/3mae3kmiy5y2b">an update posted to social media earlier today</a>, though, the publisher said that “there is no better timing: two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge [storage capacity] sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>
<p>As such, Inin said it has decided to replace the Game Key Cards that were going to be in the game’s retail box with full physical cartridges. That change will result in the game’s asking price going up by €10 (about $13) “due to still higher production costs,” Inin explained. Still, that’s still less than the “at least €15” Inin was speculatively quoting for the same change just days ago. And Inin said early pre-order customers for <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> won’t have to pay the increased price, essentially getting the full cartridge at no additional cost.</p>

You can unlock Pauline's Diva Dress a lot earlier in your adventure with the Amiibo. The Diva Dress doubles the likelihood of enemies dropping music discs. To unlock the Diva Dress, you need to talk to the NPC shaped like the Amiibo in the Resort Layer. The NPC will ask you to show them the Amiibo to claim your reward. Without the Amiibo, this particular outfit is locked behind post-game challenges.</p><p>Scanning the Bananza Amiibo also spawns gold KONG letters that can be smashed to refill Bananergy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Never before have we seen so much goodwill so quickly squandered: This week, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://aftermath.site/larian-ceo-ai-art-baldurs-gate-3-divinity/"><u>repeatedly dug his heels in on the issue of AI</u></a> following a poorly received interview during which he talked about how his studio – fresh off the success of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, a meticulously crafted feat of human ingenuity – employs it. He went so far as to suggest that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” which is almost certainly untrue. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we discuss the myriad reasons someone working in games might not want to object to their boss’ ill-advised edict these days.</p><p>This time around, we convene for our final show of 2025, a notably horrible year for the world but <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/"><u>a pretty solid one for Aftermath</u></a>. We begin by talking about a controversy that was unexpected, to say the least: Larian openly embracing AI. Vincke has spent the past several days both digging his heels in and doing damage control, but the furor continues. Will the studio change its ways? Or will those of us opposed to AI have a difficult decision to make when Larian’s next and apparently biggest game, <em>Divinity</em>, comes out in… probably still a lot of years?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we hand out our first ever Stuff Of The Year awards to the games, trends, events, people, cats, nontroversies, and everything else that defined our 2025. Finally, we come up with a rock-solid concept for Aftermath Muppets.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can force a still-human Luke to exasperatedly put up with our Muppet antics all day.</p>

<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This is part of the larger story of video game industry precarity. If you are not OK with how your studio is implementing AI, you’re probably not gonna make a fuss about it, because you could lose your job. Right now, everyone in the games industry is jobless, so that’s your one lifeline, and if you lose it, you might be cooked. Especially Larian being a studio where a lot of people had to move for those jobs, you are just not going to risk it.&nbsp;</p><p>So [Vincke] is like “Yeah, everyone’s fine with it,” I don’t think they actually are. You’re a boss speaking for everyone at your company, and your company employs hundreds of people. Like, come on.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> And a lot of people had to go through, like, 20 job interviews. Don’t forget. A lot of people had to go through a really bad hiring process.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, writers especially. For people who watch or listen to the show but aren’t on Bluesky, a lot of writers this week talked about how it’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brunodias.bsky.social/post/3ma4qheh7gk22?ref=aftermath.site"><u>an open secret in the games industry</u></a> that the job application process for Larian in particular is just a fucking nightmare. You’ve gotta do tons and tons of interviews. It takes months. You’ve gotta do a writing test that includes playable elements.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It’s uncompensated.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yep, it’s uncompensated. And then they might not get back to you for a really long time, only to let you know that they’re going with somebody else. It’s this thing that every writer in the industry will tell you about. It seems entirely miserable.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, so you have all of this precarity and a boss speaking for the company, as well as all these employees who I’m sure would want to say something if they felt safe doing so. [It’s notable, also, that former employees have come forward on social media to say they did, in fact, have a problem with AI.] And then all of that ties back into the AI conversation: People are worried about losing their already less-than-secure jobs to AI, specifically. You have this example of how precarious things are and how that’s already muzzling them, and it’s just a fucked-up stew with every conceivable ingredient of the ills of the games industry right now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> At what is ostensibly the good company. That’s what makes it hurt most: They’re the good guys, technically.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Or they were.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Where have all the cowboys gone, man?</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/larian-ceo-ai-art-baldurs-gate-3-divinity/"><div><p>I Don’t Think Larian’s CEO Understands How Art Is Made</p><p>‘I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it’ [Citation needed]</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/take-time-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>1388722</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's a conundrum: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">Cooperative board games</a> have wide appeal, but they tend to have a singular problem. Because everyone around the table wants to win, rather than genuine cooperation, there’s a tendency for groups to accept plans suggested by the most experienced or able player. Of the various ways to prevent this, the most successful has been to give players hidden information they’re not allowed to communicate.</p><div catalogid="ca7f5cd0-93c8-4c39-8f04-3dc1337b1477" id="233757"><div id="233757" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Take Time Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme example is 2018 game <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Me7G?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Mind</a> where players aren’t allowed to talk at all, and simply have to rely on their innate sense of timing to lay cards in the correct numeric order. Take Time belongs in this group, but it’s trying to use a set of novel, simple mechanics to chart a worthwhile course between no communication at all, and heavyweight cooperative planning.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What’s in the Box</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within, which you can sense by its weight. First up there’s a player deck of numeric cards, 24 in all, embossed in gold and set against fetching, complimentary shades of white and dark blue. Beneath there are a set of 12 envelopes, also embossed in gold and set with luminous art pieces depicting colorful, stylized scenes from nature. It’s a salutary lesson in how simple yet highly effective graphic design and artwork can elevate everyday game components into something glorious and eye-catching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the envelopes contain four clock discs, each with six points. While these are thinner cardboard and lack the gold that elevates the cards and envelopes, they’re still delightful things, carrying more of that rich, stylish nature art in slightly more muted colors. You’ll be playing cards at each of the points, and as soon as they’re on the table, the whole thing springs to life visually. The final component is a set of punch tokens which contain a clock hand and several cogs. They’re chunky and a little drab compared to everything else in the box, but that’s fine: they take a back seat during most of the play time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The core game rules are very simple. Each player gets a hand of number cards which come in two colors that run from 1 to 12. In the center of the table is a clock face with six segments. One of these will be the starting segment and your goal, as a group, is to play cards so that the total in each segment runs from lowest in the starting segment and ascends to the highest in the final segment. The catch? Most of your cards must be played face down, and you’re not allowed to talk about your plays while making them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, you start to make logical deductions about what people are likely to have played. It’s up to the players – without discussion – to decide who’s going first so, intuitively, someone with a low card will likely play into the starting space and the group will understand that is probably a one, or a two. If the next player plays into the next space, it’s a good bet they’ve played a two (ties count as being part of the ascending order) or a three. Cards played straight into the final space are probably high, and so on. On this basis you can begin to figure your way around the puzzle, although deciding where to play your limited number of face-up cards is still an interesting choice. If no one reaches to open the play, for example, then it’s likely nobody has a low card so starting with a face-up mid-range option might be wise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each pack contains four clock faces and, from the very first challenge, there are additional requirements to frustrate you. That first face, for instance, requires the first segment to have a single white-color card in it, and the last segment can contain no more than three cards. So you can’t just dump high-values into that final space mindlessly and call it a day, as once you hit the three-card limit there’s a good chance the penultimate space might end up containing a higher total.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Take Time’s tiny box belies a wealth of goodness within.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the difficulty begins to scale, you’ll start making use of the game’s most ingenious aspect. Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to plan and strategize before anyone has looked at the cards they’ve been dealt. Initially this looks of limited value: how can you plan when you don’t know what values anyone has at their disposal? But there are still things you can do. The card colors are public knowledge, for example, as it’s reflected on the card backs, so in that first clock you can quickly see how many white cards have been dealt and whether you’re likely to have a low-value card to play into its first segment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. The rules are purposefully vague about what you can discuss in this phase, only explicitly disallowing “codes or signals” during card play. This leaves cunning players with a wealth of ways to approach the game and increase the group’s chances. No spoilers, but once you understand the game flow you can be surprisingly creative in terms of forming a plan, and when imaginative proposals pay off on a difficult clock it is incredibly satisfying. But remember that you have to adhere to the dictum that you must not communicate in any way, even with devised codes, during the card-play phase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played a limited-communication cooperative game before, such as <a href="https://zdcs.link/akwNpg?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hanabi</a>, or Take Time’s spiritual predecessor The Mind, you’ll know this rule is hard to enforce. Sometimes a player forgets, and blurts something out by accident, or the preceding player will instinctively react to a play with a wince or a knowing smile, all of which gives out useful information. Some players find this vagueness troublesome: if that’s you, be aware that Take Time has nothing to ameliorate this issue. If not, it can actually be quite fun to watch how different groups interpret and enforce “no communication.” It’s a cooperative game, so it doesn’t really matter so long as you’re on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, the game has no final fail state. If you mess up on a clock face, you get to have an additional face-up play for each failure to a maximum of three, and then you keep going until you either succeed or give up. In the latter case, you place the clock into the delightfully named Sleeve of Regrets and move on. To win overall you must go back and ensure you pass all 40 tests although once you’ve at least attempted them, you can open a final sleeve for additional replayability. But how you actually approach this is up to you: Take Time is more interested in being surprising and fun than it is in whether a group wins or loses. It’s clearly supposed to be a cozy, cooperative time to be enjoyed together.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Although you can’t communicate while you’re playing cards, you’re allowed to strategize before anyone has looked at their cards.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From the initial clock face, you may be wondering how any of the subsequent puzzles get hard enough to make you want to skip them. Each new face introduces new rules and wrinkles, but these never become overwhelming. After the first three faces, for instance, you’re not allowed to have any segment total higher than 24. Later, some segments disallow certain cards, while others force you to draw new cards, and an increasing proportion will have one or more placement rules. The design has a fantastic knack of pulling the rug out from strategies you’ve become used to. If your new clock disallows laying your lowest cards on the first segment, and your highest on the last, working out how to get them in ascending order suddenly becomes a whole lot more challenging.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazingly, the lack of an absolute loss condition does little to undermine the excitement and thrill of play. Even with good communication and a full three bonus cards, there’s easily enough uncertainty about what’s around the clock to require thoughtful consideration before late cards, and ramp up the tension ahead of the final reveal. A group win is always gratifying, and it doesn’t take many losses before any given face begins to assume a daunting prospect, propelling you toward discussing new approaches, and offering ever-sweeter satisfaction when you finally take the win.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7O0p?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QVEn83?object_uuid=ce8ef5d3-040f-48d6-837c-38476b2b3ee4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 19, 2025 7:24 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Some gamers view games almost entirely through the lenses of strategy or narrative, and Take Time offers neither of these pleasures. It is, however, brilliantly successful at suckering in pretty much everyone else, including reluctant players and family groups. Its simple rules and non-threatening structure appeal to all ages, and the way it remains packed with excitement and creative potential without complexity or even the threat of losing is almost magical. Don’t expect this to burn your brain, or even create particularly memorable play moments, but being able to spend such pleasant time with friends, family, or relative strangers is a memorable reward all in itself.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/take-time-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>But Riot says it’s considering rolling the BIOS requirement out to all players in <em>Valorant</em>‘s highest competitive ranking tiers (Ascendant, Immortal, and Radiant), where there’s more to be gained from working around the anti-cheat software. And Riot anti-cheat analyst Mohamed Al-Sharifi says the same restrictions <a href="https://x.com/ItsGamerDoc/status/2001831378401530297">could be turned on</a> for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, though they aren’t currently. If users are blocked from playing by Vanguard, they’ll need to download and install the latest BIOS update for their motherboard before they’ll be allowed to launch the game.</p>

<p>The vulnerability is known to affect four of the largest PC motherboard makers: ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, and MSI. All four have released updates for at least some of their newer motherboards, while other boards have updates coming later. According to <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/382314">the vulnerability note</a>, it’s unclear whether systems from OEMs like Dell, Lenovo, Acer, or HP are affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asrock.com/support/Security.asp?iD=1">ASRock’s security bulletin</a> about the issue says it affects Intel boards based on the 500-, 600-, 700-, and 800-series chipsets; <a href="https://csr.msi.com/global/product-security-advisories">MSI</a> only lists the 600- and 700-series chipsets. <a href="https://www.asus.com/security-advisory/">Asus</a> is also missing the 800-series, but says the vulnerability affects boards based on even older 400-series Intel chipsets; <a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/Support/Security/2338">Gigabyte</a>, meanwhile, covers 600-through-800-series Intel chipsets, but is also the only vendor to mention patches for AMD’s 600- and 800-series chipsets (any motherboard with an AM5 socket, in short).</p>
<p>Collectively, all of these chipsets cover Intel’s 10th-generation Core processors and newer, and AMD Ryzen 7000 series and newer.</p>
<p>What’s unclear is whether the boards and chipsets that go unmentioned by each vendor aren’t getting a patch because they don’t <em>need</em> a patch, if they will be patched but they just aren’t being mentioned, or if they aren’t getting a patch at all. The bulletins at least suggest that 400- and 500-series Intel chipsets and 600- and 800-series AMD chipsets <em>could</em> be affected, but not all vendors have promised patches for them.</p>

                <p>A sizeable portion of Nintendo Switch 2 players have been very vocal about their opposition to Game-Key Cards that allow players to digitally download a game rather than including it on a cartridge. But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo.</p><p>Inin Games shared the news that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-ditches-game-key-cards-for-a-physical-release-but-itll-cost-more/1100-6537110/" data-ref-id="1100-6537110">upcoming US and European run</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/r-type-dimensions-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-706122">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">production prices</a> as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well.</p><p>Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. </p><p>Nintendo hasn't issued any statement about this yet, <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/2001264866632372548" rel="nofollow ">but the rumors suggest that smaller cartridges</a> are being offered in 16GB and 32GB sizes, both of which are cheaper than the standard 64GB cartridge. Publishers who wanted to sell Switch 2 games on physical cartridges were previously stuck paying for and using Nintendo's 64GB cartridge. The publishers who released larger games were also forced to use Game-Key Cards because their titles couldn't fit on a single cartridge. There's currently no indication that Nintendo is planning any cartridges bigger than 64GB to accommodate those larger games. If those were available, they might mitigate the need for Game-Key Cards.</p><p>The one bit of bad news from R-Type Dimensions III is that the game will be a little more expensive now that Inin Games is going for the physical cartridge. Regardless, Inin pledged to honor the original price for anyone who preordered the game before the change was made.</p><p>"We'd like to sincerely thank the community for the passionate discussion, the feedback, and the patience over the past days," reads <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement by Inin Games</a>. "Your enthusiasm for physical games and for R-Type in particular made this solution possible, and we're very happy to be able to deliver a true cartridge release."</p><p>Last month, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> will be the first game published by Nintendo itself that will only be given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-first-nintendo-published-title-to-get-game-key-card/1100-6536144/" data-ref-id="1100-6536144">a physical release as a Key Card</a>.</p>

              <p>In a promising reversal for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-pokopia-game-key-card-2000642940">game key card haters</a> everywhere,<em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em> publisher Inin Games has announced it will be able to support a physical release on Switch 2 that contains the entire game on the cartridge. How was it able to manage this feat? It said this was all thanks to Nintendo introducing additional SD card sizes for Switch 2, before later revoking all such claims.</p> <p>“We’re happy to share a positive update regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>R-Type Dimensions 3</em>,” the company <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii">announced on Friday</a>. “There is no better timing: Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that in a way that wasn’t possible before.”</p>

 <p>As a result, it said it would move forward with offering a physical version of the game on Switch 2 that wasn’t a game key card. The only difference is that the physical version will cost $10 more than the digital version to account for the production costs. This is good news, and essentially what every diehard fan and enthusiast collector has been begging Nintendo and its Switch 2 development partners to do from the start.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ININ Games retracts their statement about the new smaller Switch 2 carts. </p> <p>"There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities. Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information… <a href="https://t.co/V9yeCHynVR">pic.twitter.com/V9yeCHynVR</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2002067728631533570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But apparently Inin Games wasn’t supposed to reveal that this was all due to new cartridge sizes from Nintendo. The company deleted its original statement and followed up with a bizarre new one. “There has been no official announcement or confirmation from Nintendo concerning cartridge storage capacities,” the company corrected itself.</p>

 <p>It continued, “Any references to specific storage sizes should not be interpreted as official information from Nintendo. At this time, we can only confirm that our upcoming release <em>R-Type Dimensions III</em> will be on a physical cartridge. No further technical details regarding cartridge specifications have been officially confirmed.” Mmhmm. Sure.</p>

 <p>The good news is that it sounds like other publishers may be able to take advantage of this new development moving forward, though some may still opt to do game key cards for performance reasons (running a game off an installation vs. a cartridge can improve loading times) or because of the cost savings. Up until now, the only Switch 2 cartridges available to developers were 64GB ones.</p>

 <p>Games that were too big, like<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, had to go the game key card route as a result. But it also meant that most small games found paying for the unneeded extra space prohibitively expensive. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> and a ton of other games were only released on Switch 2 as game key cards as a result. Hopefully, Square Enix and others follow the example now set by <em> R-Type Dimensions 3</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Indie Game Awards 2025—How I Voted]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on Thursday, December 18, and saw 21 awards handed out to deserving games, developers, and people. </p>



<p>This year, I was lucky enough to be selected <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as one of the judges</a> and had the opportunity to vote on 12 awards. Those included the likes of Music, Gameplay, Narrative, Game of the Year, and more. </p>







<p>While the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awards were given out</a> already, I thought it would be good to show the Insider Gaming audience how I voted this year. To be completely honest, it was a lot tougher than I expected.</p>



<p>Doing a ranked choice vote led to plenty of second guessing and dozens of pages of notes in my black and white marble notebook. There was even a time where I had my votes all ready to submit, only to start over by reviewing my notes again. Eventually, decisions were made and the ballots were sent in. </p>



<p>Not all of my selections won, but I was happy with how I voted and congratulate all of the winners. There really were so many incredible games this year that you could make a strong case for every game that was nominated, and even others that weren’t. But, without any more delay, here’s how I voted for The Indie Game Awards 2025.</p>

                <p>It's lonely out in space, especially if you're a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> player waiting for any word about the next major update coming to the game. Bethesda's space-based game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/" data-ref-id="1100-6534318">receive an additional story DLC</a>, it's just a matter of when. Now, a new report suggests that the delay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> played a role in Bethesda's decision to push back its next Starfield chapter.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Bethesda "felt more comfortable" about pushing Starfield's second DLC to the first half of 2026 because Microsoft already had a "busy holiday period" for 2025 without it. More intriguingly, the same report indicates that Bethesda has already been showing off the new update and DLC behind closed doors to a select group of players.</p><p>One of the rumored changes is a revamp of the game's space flight systems that will actually make travel feel like a journey instead of a series of loading screens. Other aspects of space travel and exploration are also said to be improved in the new update, and the Creation Engine will reportedly include "large technical improvements ... that will also carry forward to future games."</p><p>However, a separate report about the Starfield showcase from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/temper-expectations-bethesda-reportedly-prepping-starfield-improvements-though-suggestion-is-this-isnt-a-cyberpunk-20-scale-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> seemingly walks back the scope of some of those changes and adds that fans shouldn't expect a "Cyberpunk 2.0-scale update." Until the embargo from the event is lifted, further details probably won't be available.</p><p>Former Bethesda developer Bruce Nesmith recently stated that he felt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-designer-says-game-fell-short-of-fallout-and-elder-scrolls-calls-space-inherently-boring/1100-6535617/" data-ref-id="1100-6535617">Starfield fell short of Fallout and Elder Scrolls</a>, despite liking the game himself. There are rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-wont-be-announced-until-2026-report/1100-6535565/" data-ref-id="1100-6535565">Starfield will come to PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-leaker-claims/1100-6534121/" data-ref-id="1100-6534121">Nintendo Switch 2 in the future</a>, but Bethesda has yet to confirm the game for either of those systems.</p>
