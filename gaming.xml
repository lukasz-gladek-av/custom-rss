			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roaring-kitty-is-apparently-back-to-his-gamestop-pumping-ways/">GameStop</a> has sold its Canadian branch, GameStop Canada, to French-Canadian entrepreneur and McFarlane Toys co-owner Stephan Tetrault, who has also confirmed that the retailer will re-launch as Electronics Boutique Canada Inc., or EB Games Canada.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of GameStop, Ryan Cohen, <a href="https://x.com/ryancohen/status/1891884823465103698">announced back in February</a> that he was looking to sell the Canadian division of the company, telling interested parties to email GameStop's mergers and acquisitions division, saying "<em>High taxes, Liberalism, Socialism, Progressivism, Wokeness and DEI included at no additional cost if you buy today!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stephan-tetrault-acquires-gamestop-canada-302446106.html">press release</a> regarding the acquisition, Tetrault says, "<em>This isn't just a business decision - it's about bringing something back that Canadians truly loved. We're going to build something special here, with community, nostalgia, and innovation at its heart</em>."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a report from <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/gamestop-selling-canadian-assets-ceo-wokeness-dei-1.7462542">The Canadian Press</a> put the number of Canadian GameStop stores at 203, though that was before GameStop <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/03/26/gamestop-close-significant-number-locations-report/">confirmed it would be shutting down</a> more of its locations worldwide, Canada included. The press release for today's acquisition puts the current number at "<em>over 185</em>" locations.</p>
<p>"<em>We want EB Games Canada to be more than a store,</em>" adds GameStop Canada president Jim Tyo. "<em>We want it to be the hub for gaming and fandom culture across Canada. This is about passion, and that's what's going to drive every decision we make</em>."</p>
<p>The transition from GameStop Canada to EB Games Canada will begin across the country in the coming months, including new store signage, a new website, and new branding across all social platforms. Canadians will surely have whiplash over the change since many remember that it wasn't too long ago that <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8066111/gamestop-eb-games-canada-rebrand/">GameStop sunsetted&nbsp;the EB Games branding in Canada</a>, with every EB Games becoming a GameStop.</p>
<p>Gamers have been lamenting the poor practices that GameStop perpetuates and how the stores have begun to sell more toys and Pop Funkos than games. It'll be interesting to see how Tetrault tries to turn things around, and if he can bring more gamers back to the retail store after many have turned their backs on buying from GameStop for years.</p>

It looks like Christopher McQuarrie, who directed <em>Rogue Nation</em> and <em>Fallout</em> as well, had entire portions of the sub’s interior recreated for the scenes. Hopefully, in addition to whatever new ways Cruise finds to make his insurance agents squirm, the sequence doesn’t lean on post-production special effects to make an impact. </p><p>This isn’t <em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s first major water stunt. <em>Rogue Nation</em> saw Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold his breath for 6 minutes</a></span> in a scene where his character, Ethan Hunt, had to unlock a hatch while swirling around a giant server-cooling tank. And that scene only came about after Cruise filmed <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, for which McQuarrie helped write the script, which ends with his character diving underwater beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris to kill a giant alien.</p><p><em>The Final Reckoning </em>hits theaters in just a few weeks on May 23, and brings with it a lot of questions beyond whether Cruise and the franchise still have new tricks up their sleeves. For one, there’s the question of how the movie will make good on the many callbacks to earlier entries in the franchise teased in the trailers, and what it will tell us about how Hunt came to join the IMF in the first place, a plot thread hinted at in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>. The biggest question of all, though, is whether this will be Cruise’s last<em> Mission: Impossible</em> movie. Given his obsession with movies, Hollywood, and his own legacy at the box office, I somehow doubt it. At least as long as<em> Final Reckoning </em>does better than its predecessor. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, weird stuff. The game got a sequel in 1994, which (spoilers) ended with Ecco getting access to a time machine and leaving for some unknown point in history. While the games were odd, they had a lot of fans and now the creator behind them, Ed Annunziata, has shared that remasters of those games are on the way, along with a new sequel. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a May 5 interview with Xbox</a></span>, Annunziata talked about his inspiration for creating Ecco and then gave a small tease for the future of the franchise, telling fans to “stay tuned” and further explaining: “Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original <em>Ecco the Dolphin </em>and <em>Tides of Time</em> games.

You might be expecting a teaser or perhaps a bit more info about these upcoming remasters and the next game in the <em>Ecco</em> series. Well,  there’s nothing like that on the site. Instead, if you head over there you’ll be greeted by a countdown clock that won’t hit 0 for another 8,528 hours or about 355 days, also known as basically a full year. </p><p>I’ve seen video game marketing countdown clocks before, but usually they’re for a week or two at the most. More often it’s just for a few days. The idea of doing a one-year countdown clock for remasters of <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> is wild. I mean, I guess it worked because you’re reading a blog about the countdown clock and the remasters right now. But I’m not sure this fanbase has the energy to be excited for a year. Anyway, hopefully I’ll be back in 350 days or so to share  a cool trailer for <em>Ecco The Dolphin Remastered</em>. See you then! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ecco-the-dolphin-and-ecco-the-tides-of-time-remasters-and-a-new-third-ecco-game-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ecco the Dolphin creator Ed Annunziata announced in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/">Xbox Wire</a> that remasters of Ecco the Dolphin and Ecco: The Tides of Time are on their way. Once those are complete, Annunziata and the rest of the original development team will work on a brand-new third Ecco game for modern players.</p>
<p>The full Xbox Wire post focused more on celebrating Asian and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and games made by Asian and Pacific Islander creators, with a short but impactful spotlight at the end where Annunziata answered a few questions.</p>
<p>When asked about what the future holds for Ecco, Annunziata did not mince words, saying, "<em>Me and the entire original team are going to Remaster the original Ecco the Dolphin and Tides of Time games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Annunziata ended off by telling players to keep their eyes on <a href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/">eccothedolphin.com</a>, which takes you to a landing page with a countdown that will end on&nbsp;<strong>April 25, 2026, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT.&nbsp;</strong>Annunziata did not elaborate further as to whether that will be when the remasters release, or if it'll just be when we get our first look at Ecco's upcoming return.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652">Gematsu</a> spotted trademark filings from SEGA for "<em>Ecco</em>" and "<em>Ecco the Dolphin,</em>" which we now know were due to the series being brought back to life, and not just your bog-standard filing to keep the trademark.</p>
<p>Ecco the Dolphin has <a href="https://wccftech.com/ecco-metroid-orphan-of-the-machine-xbox-series-x-fall2020/">inspired</a> a number of games since its original release in 1992, with its focus on ocean conservation and marine life, and its meticulous and difficult brand of 2D side-scrolling. It'll be interesting to see how Annunziata and the team approach a remaster, if it'll be something akin to what Virtuos did for<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/"> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, with a big graphical overhaul while keeping the underlying game the same, or if it'll be more like a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-thing-remastered-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-from-nightdive/">Nightdive Studios</a> remaster, that keeps the original look and feel of the game intact, while adding a few quality-of-life improvements so it runs as smooth as possible on modern hardware.</p>
<p>If it's the former of the two, then that will also likely inform what Annunziata means when he talks about making a third game with "<em>contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.</em>"</p>

Bungie’s extraction shooter didn’t really win me over, but each time I booted it up I was greeted by a PlayStation Studios logo, as the former <em>Halo </em>maker is now owned by PlayStation. This was odd to see on my Xbox, but it didn’t stand out too much. But <em>Gears of War </em>on PlayStation is so bizarre. It’s one of Xbox’s big three:<em> Forza, Halo, Gears</em>. Now only one of them remains truly Xbox only. </p><p><em>Gears </em>on PS5 is the kind of weird idea that, a decade ago or more, you’d hear someone suggest and you’d laugh at. Like some random, clueless analyst pondering when Mario will arrive on Xbox. Never gonna happen dude, don’t you know anything? I remember being a younger lad and being one of the few people at my middle school to own an Xbox. They all had PlayStation 3s. They all were jealous of <em>Gears of War</em>. Some of them would tell me that <em>Gears </em>was coming to PS3 one day. And <em>Halo</em>. I’d shake my head. I knew better. I read all the gaming magazines of the day. I scrolled through gaming forums and consumed <em>GameSpot </em>articles. They were wrong. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357"><em>Gears of War</em> would <em><strong>never </strong></em>be on a PlayStation console</a></span>. Well, turns out they were right, they were just about 18 years ahead of the schedule.</p><p> So while I understand the business reasons for <em>Gears </em>coming to PlayStation and I’ve seen plenty of other Xbox-published games arrive on non-Xbox consoles, it’s all still very weird for me to watch. I’ll probably have to sit down when I see the news of <em>Halo </em>on PS5. At least more people will now have access to more games. That’s cool, even if younger me would never have believed any of this was possible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At least, they’re hoping so.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shimmer is Ellie’s horse in <em>The Last of Us</em>, both in the show and in <em>Part II </em>of the game. The trusty steed helps get our heroine from the small town of Jackson to the warzone of Seattle. However, in one of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s most shocking moments, while on horseback the player is forced to accidentally trigger an explosive barricade set up by the W.L.F. A member of the militia is kind enough to put her out of her misery after the blast, but then captures Ellie for questioning. It’s a brutal scene, and it’s even worse when you don’t know it’s coming.</p><p>As such, people watching the <em>Last of Us </em>show after playing the game have been bracing themselves for this week’s episode, as this would have been the one in which Shimmer kicked the bucket in a more faithful retelling.

Homegirl is living her best life free of worry. So is Shimmer safe from the horrors of Ellie’s revenge tour? A lot can happen in the three episodes left of the season, but fans are crossing all their fingers and toes.</p><p>It’s probably not gonna undo the collective trauma of watching Pedro Pascal get murdered via golf club, but hey, we take the wins where we can get them. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the dead of night, the company updated the store's top games chart, and now displays games ranked by "highest sales for the past few days" and not "most downloads for the past two weeks." It wasn't until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/3X6nDoGNfPc?si=xUNgqoJokQsQI9uq">YouTuber GVG</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> happened to spot the change that anyone took notice, and developers who've spent years building audiences on the eShop scrambled to understand how it would impact their game. Storefront visibility is a key driver of financial success in the digital age, and the quirks of every different platform from Steam, to PlayStation, to the Nintendo eShop all have developers trying different sales strategies at different times.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 only a month away, it's notable that Nintendo would shake up how it displays games to players. Developers are counting on the new console to not only </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2s-dlss-support-to-be-a-big-part-of-future-nintendo-games">deliver better performance</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but to also serve as a gateway for players to jump from first-party to third-party titles.

Nintendo needs to balance its promise that most Nintendo Switch games will be compatible with the Switch 2 while avoiding overpromoting what may be perceived as "low quality" games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/nintendo-switch-2-shows-nintendo-s-strategy-for-a-social-future" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo Switch 2 shows Nintendo's strategy for an online social future</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Changing the eShop ranking criteria from sales volumes to revenue will stop much of this content from surfacing on Switch 2, where Nintendo has already set in place measures—including the platform-wide "Switch 2 Edition" program—to favor positioning of higher-value Switch 2-branded content," he said. "The knock-on impact is going to be [fewer] opportunities for developers of lower-priced software to reach players."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He pointed to "breakout" Switch games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Exit 8</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suika Games</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Thief Simulator</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as games that may not rank as high under this new system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GameDiscoverCo founder (and former Game Developer publisher) Simon Carless offered a similar outlook, saying the change will stop a lot of the eShop "slop" that's released on sale at 90 percent off from dominating the charts. He called this "good," but added "it'll also be trickier for cheaper games to get high up the charts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers and publishers behind cheaper games </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>might</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> stand a chance of ranking high if they can still move high volumes of units, but as No More Robots publisher Mike Rose told Game Developer, that may favor companies with the ability to do "huge short-term marketing blasts, the size we can't compete with."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/-redesigned-from-the-ground-up-the-nintendo-switch-2-will-launch-on-june-5" target="_self" data-discover="true">'Redesigned from the ground up:' The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5 for $449</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's decent reason for small developers to worry, but with other discoverability options on the way, Rose said he's waiting to pass judgment.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-online-sandbox-mmo-to-launch-on-june-20-in-early-access-will-be-open-source/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, San Francisco based independent developer Clockwork Labs announced that their sandbox MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/bitcraft-is-a-community-sandbox-mmorpg-with-a-fully-editable-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcraft Online</a> will launch on June 20 in early access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3454650/BitCraft_Online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a>. Moreover, the game's code will be open source, allowing any user to contribute.</p>
<p>Tyler Cloutier, co-founder of Clockwork Labs, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>The ethos behind BitCraft Online has always been about one core principle: collaboration. This is a massive in-game ecosystem, where we encourage players to work together to build towns, cities, or even empires. So to truly empower our community, it was important to ensure that the game would be open-source, allowing players to express themselves in their own unique way. We want to give our community not only the toolset to play within our world, but to participate in building it. Open-sourcing is more than just a technical decision—it's a philosophical one.</em></p>
<p>The game is set in a single procedural world, meaning that all players will play together, unlike in most MMORPGs. They'll join others to form communities, build cities and structures, and discover beautiful biomes.</p>
<p>The world terrain can be modified, too, allowing players to carve mountains and build their own legacy with a tangible impact on the land. As in any good sandbox game, Bitcraft Online promises multiple valid playstyles, from crafter and trader to explorer and monster hunter, or any such combination. Surviving and gathering resources are the keys to success. The economy is entirely player-driven, so the best merchants will thrive.</p>

The real surprise is definitely<a href="https://zdcs.link/av4eXq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> the Jar Jar Binks figure</a>. Love him or hate him, there's no denying that this Jar Jar looks like he walked right off the screen. He's even got seamless arm joints and two swappable face sculpts for recreating all those wacky poses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot Toys is also filling a glaring hole in the Sequel Trilogy lineup by finally releasing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXO73?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Poe Dameron figure</a>. Fittingly, Poe is wearing his Resistance X-Wing jumpsuit. We're also getting another of the fan-favorite Republic Commandos in the form of Clone Commando Boss, and the company's new Star Wars Rebels-inspired line of animated figures is getting <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw2Xq?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Darth Vader</a> to accompany the previously announced Stormtrooper figures.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hasbro's Star Wars Toys</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Day 2025 Figures - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro revealed a number of new figures in both the 6-inch Black Series line and 3 3/4-inch Vintage Collection line. Hasbro continues to capitalize on the 20th anniversary of Revenge of the Sith by releasing new Black Series figures in packaging based on the classic RotS toy line. Next up are Aayla Secura and a Magnaguard droid. Black Series collectors can also augment their Imperial trooper collections with a Rogue One-themed 2-pack that includes both a Shoretrooper and a Death Trooper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Vintage Collection front, Hasbro has a couple very interesting multi-pack releases in the works. The "Stormtroopers of the Empire 3-Pack" features a Snowtrooper, Scouttrooper and a Sandtrooper. The "Cantina Adventure 4-Pack" includes four aliens from the iconic Mos Eisley sequence, including Hammerhead, Walrus Man, Greedo, and Snaggletooth. It should go great with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hasbro-reveals-massive-mos-eisley-cantina-playset-for-hardcore-collectors">Hasbro's crowdfunded Mos Eisley Cantina playset</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Star Wars prop collectors will be happy to know that a new ForceFX Elite lightsaber based on the weapon used by Rebels' star Ezra Bridger is in the works. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sideshow's Star Wars Figures and Posters</h2><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Sideshow Collectibles' Star Wars Day 2025 Reveals - Image Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be outdone,. Sideshow Collectibles had a wide lineup of figures, statues, and art prints to reveal. Undoubtedly the showpiece of their Star Wars Day lineup is <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gbMOG?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the Luke Skywalker: Red Five, Standing By Premium Format Figure</a>. This massive 1:4 scale, mixed media statue features Luke decked out in his X-Wing jumpsuit and climbing up the ladder to his trusty ship. What really makes this piece special (and especially expensive) is that Sideshow went to the trouble of actually sculpting a portion of the X-Wing so that it hangs in mid-air.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sideshow is also continuing to release 1:6 scale figures alongside distributing Hot Toys' releases. Sideshow is focusing on its "Scum and Villainy" line, which highlights the many aliens and creatures that don't necessarily receive attention from Hot Toys. The second wave of Scum and Villainy figures is focused on characters from Jabba's Palace in Return of the Jedi, like Bib Fortuna, Klaatu, and Vizam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Sideshow showed off the latest 1:10 statue from Iron Studios, which happens to be <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK2Rg?object_uuid=5658684f-9ed8-4831-83e3-6910b3e3e309&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a shrunken-down version of their 1:4 scale Darth Vader statue</a>.

		<p>Gears of War: Reloaded has been announced by The Coalition, which has confirmed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war">Gears of War</a> franchises is taking its first foray into being a multiplatform series. The game will be available from August 26th for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox Cloud Gaming, and PS5, making it the first time Gears of War has been made available on a PlayStation console.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War Ultimate Edition - Opening Cinematic" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qODC-rxITUc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by The Coalition in partnership with Sumo Interactive and Disbelief, Gears of War: Reloaded is a complete remaster of the original game, with this version supporting 4K resolution, 120 FPS support, and it will have cross-play across all platforms through the game’s two-player co-op campaign and 8-player versus multiplayer. Interestingly, no Microsoft will be required for cross-play, though signing in will enable cross-progressions for Campaign and multiplayer.</p>
<p>The full list of upgrades is as follows;</p>
<ul>
<li>4K resolution</li>
<li>60 FPS in Campaign</li>
<li>120 FPS in Multiplayer</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range (HDR)</li>
<li>Dolby Vision &amp; 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos</li>
<li>7.1.4 3D Spatial Audio</li>
<li>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</li>
<li>4K assets and remastered textures</li>
<li>Enhanced post-processing visual effects</li>
<li>Improved shadows and reflections</li>
<li>Super resolution with improved anti-aliasing</li>
<li>Zero loading screens during Campaign</li>
</ul>
<p>While the game coming to PS5 is obviously the biggest shocker, this is still great news for Xbox and PC fans in general. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition launched early in the Xbox One era, and was never updated to support the Xbox One X, so the game has been trapped at 1080p where Gears 4 and later had better compatibility through to Xbox Series X – through backward compatibility it did get 60fps, though. On PC Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, the game has some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp1Rcvi01zo">major performance issues (per Digital Foundry)</a>, reportedly introduced through Windows 10 a few years ago. With this remaster, this brings the original game back into focus once more.</p>
<p>When Gears of War: Reloaded launches, all the DLC that has been available as part of the package including the bonus campaign the multiplayer maps, characters, and cosmetics. Those of you who bought <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition">Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</a> before today, 5th May, will get a free upgrade for Gears of War: Reloaded. Otherwise it will cost $39.99, though the game will be available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only Gears of War game in the works, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-revealed-prequel-to-the-original-series/">Gears of War: E-Day</a> in development as a prequel to this original game with previous series collaborators <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">People Can Fly co-developing</a>. The one thing that we can seemingly put to one side, though, is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/gears-of-war-collection-multiplayer/">the rumours of a Gears of War Collection remaster</a>, which was also rumoured for an August release.</p>

I flew directly from a week in Disneyland with my family, giving hugs and saying goodbye as they soaked in a final few hours at the pool, while I headed towards Boston. That trip took on this outsized importance because it felt like the culmination of something my wife and I had been building to the entire time we'd been together—a picture perfect trip with the family we'd wanted for the entire time we'd been together. And then I left them! I put my sunglasses on in the cab, while trying to hide my tears from the taxi driver. This year, thankfully, is full of less drama. I'm mostly upset that I cannot bring my PlayStation 5 with to play a few hours of <em>Clair Obscur</em> on the road.</p><p>-pk, who will be testing his PlayStation Portal playing remotely</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><a href="https://remapradio.com/podcasts/episodes/remap-interview-davey-wreden-the-stanley-parable/"><em>Remap Interview (feat: Davey Wreden)</em></a> – This one is a delight!!!

But if it’s bad now, just wait until May 30 when Destined Rivals is officially released.</p><p>Journey Together should have been the very exciting return of Trainer Pokémon to the card game but instead proved rather flat, failing to significantly shake up the format. But it seems this was just a tentative toe poked into the waters, because this month we’re getting Destined Rivals, which not only enormously elaborates on the range of Trainer Pokémon, but also reintroduces Team Rocket to the TCG for the first time in 25 years. And yes, that means there’s a Giovanni’s Mewtwo, and yes, it’s already at a colossal price in Japan.</p><p>The full official English-language line-up has yet to be revealed, but The Pokémon Company has shown a fair few, a bunch more have appeared in Spanish, and there are many more we know are coming from the Japanese set. So based on all of this, we’ve put together the most anticipated cards that’ll be included in Destined Rivals (not to be confused with the <em>Black &amp; White: Rival Destinies</em> anime).</p><p>It’s going to be tough to find them on sale, but it’s worth knowing that pre-release events take place  on May 17—definitely check to see if your local specialist store has tickets. Scalpers can’t abuse this, because to get your packs you need to open and play with them!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Supporter card Ariana is hardly groundbreaking (it allows you to draw cards until you have five in your hand, or eight if all your benched Pokémon are Team Rocket Pokémon), the art here really is. The Japanese version of the set contains three of these Team Rocket Supporter full-art cards, along with Giovanni and Ethan, and all three look highly collectible, but this Ariana is the sort of profile work you almost never see in the TCG.</p><p>It’s selling for about $35 in Japan, but I suspect the U.S. version will fetch much higher prices.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Kotaku</em>’s own Ethan has a high showing in this set, starting off with these two versions of the Ho-Oh ex. Both are absolutely stunning cards in dramatically different ways, and my guess is that the version on the right may fetch around $150 when it launches. There will also be a gold version of this card, and I’ll be curious to see if it generates interest.</p><p>It’s also a hell of a card, given you can use it to load up all your Ethan Pokémon with energy each turn, and  when in the Active Spot it’ll deal out a massive 160 damage, while healing <em>every single one</em> of your Pokémon in play by 50. I think there are going to be a lot of Ethan-based decks coming soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stick Typhlosion in that deck too, and you can deliver two very powerful attacks. Once it’s evolved, it’ll do 40 damage for just one energy, but then add on another 60 damage for every Ethan’s Adventure card in your discard pile.</p><p>But clearly I’m including this one for the <em>spectacular</em> artwork. What an absolute beauty. In Japan, the big money cards are mostly Team Rocket, but I think this looks good enough that it’ll fetch a hefty resell value on its own merits.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan, of course from Gen 2's <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>, has a fair few cards in the set, including starter Cyndaquil, Magcargo, and the mighty Pichu. All three are celebrated in this outlandishly lovely card, Ethan’s Adventure.</p><p>The card itself helps you fetch Ethan’s Pokémon from your deck, of course going into your discard pile at the same time in order to power up Typhlosion.</p><p>But, also, look how flipping cute this is!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Cough. Yes, obviously this card’s going to do well. Everyone loves Misty, some rather too much, and here she is in her swimming cozzie. It does help that it’s also a completely lovely piece of art, with Psyduck looking so cute.</p><p>The Japanese version, from Heat Wave Arena, seems to sell for around $26, which is incredibly low. I imagine it’ll be double that in English by this time next month.</p><p>Its ability allows you to discard the bottom card of your deck, and then when done, discard any cards attached to the Psyduck and put the card back on the top of your own deck. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Team Rocket and Crobat are old friends, so this is no surprise. But wowsers, what a card. It looks stunning. </p><p>It helps that when you first evolve to it, you can put 20 damage on your opponent’s Stage 2 cards. Then, when you use it to do that 120 attack, you have the option to return it to your hand. Oh, and the 310 HP is ludicrous.</p><p>This is the third-highest-selling card from Japan’s The Glory of Team Rocket set, currently selling for around $120.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look at Giovanni! He’s so cute! That’s definitely not right. I love it.</p><p>Meowth is, of course, a Team Rocket fixture, and it’s great to see him hanging out with the boss rather than Jessie or James.</p><p>Here, Meowth is his usual mischievous self, the first “attack” letting you pick a card at random from your opponent’s hand, look at it, and then have it shuffled back into their deck.</p><p>The second is a triple-coin toss, with 20 damage per heads flipped.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Moltres is always an incredibly popular card (although it seems to only ever hit the ridiculous money when it also features Zapdos and Articuno, which this does not). Add that to a Team Rocket special, then combine with this astonishing piece of art, and you have a total banger.</p><p>The Japanese version is already fetching $190 for U.S. buyers, so expect this card to go stellar. I wouldn’t be surprised to see $250, unless it ends up being used as a promo. </p><p>That 110 attack also reduces damage from the next incoming attack by 50, but that’s as nothing compared to its four-energy move. Here, if you have a Team Rocket Energy card attached to it, you discard that energy, causing your opponent’s active Pokémon to be instantly discarded too! It’s a one-hit kill, and you can keep the card in play!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is the top-selling card in Japan’s Heat Wave Arena, and currently sells in the U.S. for over $230. That seems likely to spike an awful lot higher come June, and given the mediocrity of it as an ex card in play, we can likely put this down to the rarity and the spectacular artwork.</p><p>A 100 damage attack for one energy is amazing, and 260 for two energy is bonkers (even if you do have to discard it all), but given this is a Stage 2 evolution, it’s not going to be super-easy to get into play.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is the big one. It’s Giovanni, it’s Mewtwo, it’s sending everyone crazy. Prices are still climbing for the Japanese version out of The Glory of Team Rocket, at the time of writing sitting at $435.</p><p>Personally, I’m not a fan  of the art here. Neither the style nor the composition. But then, hey, when I pull it I won’t mind parting with it for the big cash! It’s hard to say how big Destined Rivals is going to be, but if it’s as daft as I’m suspecting, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this hitting $600.</p><p>It’s a tricky card to play, however, with a sort of reverse-ability. An inability, if you will. You need at least three other Team Rocket Pokémon in play to even be able to use its attacks, which means it’s only going to work in decks built around the troublesome gang, and then you’ll depend on the draw.</p><p>However, in return you get a heck of an attack for a Basic card. Mewtwo delivers 160 damage as a base, but that can go up to a whopping 280 if you also discard two energy cards from your benched Pokémon.</p><hr><p>There are a whole bunch of other spectacular pieces of art in our combination of the two Japanese sets (plus some other leftovers), and we’ll properly get into celebrating them once the set’s released and we’ve got all the cards in English.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Earlier this year, we took a look at how and why <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">Anthropic's Claude large language model was struggling to beat <em>Pokémon Red</em></a> (a game, let's remember, designed for young children). But while Claude 3.7 is <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/claudeplayspokemon">still struggling to make consistent progress at the game</a> weeks later, a similar <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">Twitch-streamed effort using Google's Gemini 2.5 model</a> managed to finally complete <em>Pokémon Blue</em> this weekend across over 106,000 in-game actions, earning accolades from followers, <a href="https://x.com/sundarpichai/status/1918455766542930004?t=8NLgn42y3kAqUbZVhg4zLw&amp;s=19">including Google CEO Sundar Pichai</a>.</p>
<p>Before you start using this achievement as a way to compare the relative performance of these two AI models—or even the advancement of LLM capabilities over time—there are some important caveats to keep in mind. As it happens, Gemini needed some fairly significant outside help on its path to eventual Pokémon victory.</p>
<h2>Strap in to the agent harness</h2>
<p>Gemini Plays Pokémon developer JoelZ (who's unaffiliated with Google) will be the first to tell you that Pokémon is ill-suited as a reliable benchmark for LLM models. As he <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gemini_plays_pokemon">writes on the project's Twitch FAQ</a>, "please don't consider this a benchmark for how well an LLM can play Pokémon. You can't really make direct comparisons—Gemini and Claude have different tools and receive different information. ... Claude's framework has many shortcomings so I wanted to see how far Gemini could get if it were given the right tools."</p>
<p>The difference between those "framework" tools in the Claude and Gemini gameplay experiments could go a long way in explaining the relative performance of the two Pokémon-playing models here. As LessWrong's Julian Bradshaw lays out <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7mqp8uRnnPdbBzJZE/is-gemini-now-better-than-claude-at-pokemon">in an excellent overview</a>, Gemini actually gets a bit more information about the game through its custom "agent harness." This harness is the scaffolding that provides an LLM with information about the state of the game (both specific and general), helps the model summarize and "remember" previous game actions in its context window, and offers basic tools for moving around and interacting with the game.</p>

<p>Since these gameplay harnesses were developed independently, they give slightly different levels of support to the different Pokémon-playing models. While both models use a generated overlay to help make sense of the game's tile-based map screens, for instance, Gemini's harness goes further by adding important information about which tiles are "passable" or "navigable."</p>
<p>That extra information could be crucial to helping Gemini overcome some key navigation challenges that Claude struggles with. "It’s pretty easy for me to understand that [an in-game] building is a building and that I can’t walk through a building, and that's [something] that's pretty challenging for Claude to understand," Claude Plays Pokémon creator David Hershey <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/why-anthropics-claude-still-hasnt-beaten-pokemon/">told Ars in March</a>. "It's funny because it's just kind of smart in different ways, you know?"</p>
<p>Gemini also gets help with navigation through a "textual representation" of a minimap, which the harness generates as Gemini explores the game. That kind of direct knowledge of the wider map context outside the current screen can be extremely helpful as Gemini tries to find its way around the Pokémon world. But in his FAQ, JoelZ says he doesn't consider this additional information to be "cheating" because "humans naturally build mental maps while playing games, something current LLMs can't do independently yet. The minimap feature compensates for that limitation."</p>
<p>The base Gemini model playing the game also occasionally needs some external help from secondary Gemini "agents" tailored for specific tasks. One of these agents reasons through a breadth-first-search algorithm to figure out paths through complex mazes. Another is dedicated to generating potential solutions for <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-version/Victory_Road">the Boulder Puzzle on Victory Road</a>.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>While Gemini is using its own model and reasoning process for these tasks, it's telling that JoelZ had to specifically graft these specialized agents onto the base model to help it get through some of the game's toughest challenges. As JoelZ writes, "My interventions improve Gemini’s overall decision-making and reasoning abilities."</p>
<h2>What are we testing here?</h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong, massaging an LLM into a form that can beat a Pokémon game is definitely an achievement. However, the level of "intervention" needed to help Gemini with those things that "LLMs can't do independently yet" is crucial to keep in mind as we evaluate that success.</p>

<p>We already know that <a href="https://drubinstein.github.io/pokerl/">specially designed reinforcement learning tools can beat Pokémon quite efficiently</a> (and that even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/21yjqh/rng_plays_pokemon_beat_crystal_after_969_hours/">a random number generator can beat the game quite inefficiently</a>). The particular resonance of an "LLM plays Pokémon" test is in seeing if a generalized language model can reason out its own solution to a complicated game on its own. The more hand-holding we give the model—through external information, tools, or "harnesses"—the less useful the game is as that kind of test.</p>
<p>Anthropic <a href="https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/1894419011569344978">said in February</a> that Claude Plays Pokémon showed "glimmers of AI systems that tackle challenges with increasing competence, not just through training but with generalized reasoning." But as Bradshaw writes on LessWrong, "without a refined agent harness, [all models] have a hard time simply making it through the very first screen of the game, Red's bedroom!" Bradshaw's <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8aPyKyRrMAQatFSnG">subsequent gameplay tests</a> with harness-free LLMs further highlight how these models frequently wander aimlessly, backtrack pointlessly, or even hallucinate&nbsp;impossible game situations.</p>
<p>In other words, we're still a long way from the kind of envisioned future where an Artificial General Intelligence can figure out a way to beat Pokémon just because you asked it to.</p>

This thin, telescoping rod a few feet long was a staple of game shows from the 70s. They haven’t made that microphone, or really any like it, for decades, but they should, not just because the parts are cheap, but for an entirely different reason: TikTok.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game - Gene's Microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3D2onJTja_c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Holding a tiny lav microphone with your hand became kinda a meme a while back among annoying TikTok interviewers. Though this feels like it’s designed in a lab to aggravate anybody with a film production background, I also see the point: lavalier mics–the tiny, wireless mics frequently pinned to the lapel of a shirt–got tremendously cheap in the last few years. What used to be a substantial investment (I have some Sennheiser eW100s gathering dust in a closet) has now gotten silly cheap with companies like Røde, DJI, and Hollyland all offering solid quality wireless options for online content creators. What’s more, the spectacle of using one incorrectly became a purposefully irritating meme unto itself. It also serves a practical purpose: it’s slightly less alarming or formal to a stranger on the street than a stick mic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Match Game: The Day Gene's Mic Grew" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BkrlEIaQrkw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This was also the appeal of the Long Ass 70s mic. Bob Barker is the name most people associate with it, but Gene Rayburn from <em>Match Game</em> used one. As far as I can tell it is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lukpac/28666027418/in/album-72157694426924062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Sony ECM-51</a>, an electret condenser mic set to the end of a telescoping pole. My understanding from a bunch of forum posts is that the capsule is based on the <a href="https://tapeop.com/reviews/gear/43/ecm-50-mic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-50</a> lav mic, a lineage that continues today with the <a href="https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/lavalier-and-headset-microphones/ecm-55b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony ECM-55B</a>, which is still in production although Sony has long since exited the Long Ass 70s Mic game. If they don’t decide to jump on it, someone else should.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bob Barker Has a Minor Mic Malfunction Before a Game of TEMPTATION - The Price is Right 1982" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7wLgiNFaprM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Due to the ECM-51’s legacy and novelty as being <em>the</em> game show mic, a properly functioning unit goes for <a href="https://reverb.com/item/4073559-vintage-sony-ecm-51-bob-barker-telescoping-condenser-microphone-works-great-screen-battery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of money</a>. Sony and a handful of other companies also made similar but less noticeable mics, and other gooseneck style mics exist. But designing a replica using off the shelf lavaliers and parts should not be impossible. If smartly done, you could even potentially update it for wireless functionality.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Opening the package for my Sony ECM-51 microphone" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0IsGcAtqkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here is my most Millennial-coded plea: the long ass game show mic deserves a second chance. It has a form factor that’s iconic and visually striking. It’s weird, it’s sleek, and it’s vaguely disarming in a memey way. It serves a distinct purpose that content creators have accidentally discovered via reverse engineering. I need someone to bring back the long ass 70s mic, because if they don’t, I’ll be forced to make one from scratch myself.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/soccer-mommy-stardew-valley"><h3>Soccer Mommy’s Guide To Stardew Valley, The Coziest Video Game Ever</h3></a><p>The open-hearted indie rocker plays the farming game for the romance</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
