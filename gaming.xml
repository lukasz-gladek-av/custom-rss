            <link>https://kotaku.com/razer-kishi-ultra-gaming-controller-is-almost-50-off-mobile-gaming-can-feel-way-better-for-much-less-2000661027</link>
            <guid>1410649</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Little cousins love to ask the question, “What games you got on your phone?” Not too long ago, the answer to that question would be a humble response. <em>Flappybird</em>, some <em>Tetris</em> ripoff, maybe <em>Words With Friends</em>. Or even that one app that makes it look like you’re drinking a beer, though that technically isn’t even a game.</p>
<p>But now? The answer to that same question in 2026? EVERYTHING. The App Store is full of real games now. <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and<em> Roblox</em>—of course—all can be downloaded and played right from your phone. And with cloud gaming available with services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PS Remote Play, that list of games you can play grows exponentially. Though, many of these games are far better when experienced with a controller than with a touchscreen. So come bring your phone’s interface up onto the level of the games it can now play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Razer Kishi ultra gaming controller is exactly what your need, bringing you the ergonomics of an actual gamepad for when your gaming on your phone. Right now, Amazon happens to have the controller add-on for a massive discount. Normally set at $150, the price has been cut to nearly half. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/">A limited time Amazon deal has the controller discounted by a staggering 47%, meaning you end up only having to pay $80 to completely elevate your mobile gaming.</a></p>

<h2>Pro Grade Console Controls on Mobile</h2>
<p>All you do is just slot your phone or tablet in between the two sides of the controller and presto. You have yourself a gaming handheld, evoking the design of the Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The controller connects to your mobile device over USB-C. So if you’re still holding onto that old iPhone 15 or even earlier model, you best upgrade before purchasing this because it is not compatible with the discontinued Lightning port. Android users need not worry. And since it’s plug in, no need to worry about any latency.</p>



<p>The construction of the Razer Kishi is solid. The controller is equipped with a Mecha-tactile eight-way d-pad and action buttons, Hall Effect triggers, programmable buttons, and ultra durable TPSiV analog sticks. It even supports haptic vibrations.</p>
<p>The controller isn’t limited to mobile gaming. You can even plug it in over USB-C to a PC to use it like any other PC gaming controller. It’s a little funky looking without a phone or tablet stuck in the middle, and you might prefer a different controller for PC gaming. However, if you’re traveling and trying to pack light, you can use just the one controller for both mobile gaming and gaming on your laptop which is pretty rad.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Forza Horizon 6 is racing onto the scene this year, but following the release of its predecessor on PlayStation 5, questions regarding platforms are already starting to appear.</p>



<p>If you’re a PlayStation 5 gamer and you’re looking for details on whether Forza Horizon 6 will be available on PS5, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Forza Horizon 6 will be playable on PlayStation 5, Playground Games have confirmed, though it won’t be launched immediately on the console.</strong></p>



<p>After the success of releasing Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, the decision to release the sequel on the PlayStation platform has been confirmed in advance of launch, and the wait will be shorter than the many years it took for Forza Horizon 5 to make the move onto the platform.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will, however, initially launch exclusively on Microsoft platforms on Xbox Series X|S and PC, before making a move to PlayStation at a later date.</p>



<p>Just like its predecessor, this will include all content and crossplay, allowing players across all platforms to play together when exploring, racing, or causing chaos.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">When Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p><strong>No precise launch window has been announced for Forza Horizon 6 on PlayStation 5, with confirmation stating only that the arrival will be “post-launch”.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forza Horizon 6 reveal</a>, it was stated that, due to “the excitement for this franchise on other platforms,” Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are “working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch.”</p>



<p>While the history of Forza Horizon doesn’t provide too much of an insight, given Xbox’s approach to cross-platform launches is relatively new, other titles may provide a hint of how long PlayStation gamers will have to wait.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released in December 2024 on Xbox Series X|S and PC, with a PlayStation 5 version launching four months later in April 2025. Using that timeframe, expect there to be at least a few months before a PS5 launch of Forza Horizon 6.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6 is one of the biggest games releasing from Microsoft-owned developers this year, and the series will be heading to a new location.</p>



<p>After an extended stint in Mexico with the last edition of the game, Insider Gaming has all the details on where Forza Horizon 6 will take place.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-will-forza-horizon-6-take-place">Where Will Forza Horizon 6 Take Place?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new setting. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will bring the franchise to Japan, a setting that has been heavily requested by players since the first game in the series.</strong></p>



<p>The setting of Forza Horizon 6 was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Playground Games</a> at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2025, where it was stated that players “will get to discover a scenic and breathtaking Japan,” while the reveal trailer showed several locations, including Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and roads lined with cherry blossom trees.</p>



<p>In the reveal FAQ, PlayGround Games added that “Japan has been one of the most iconic and requested locations by the community,” and that bringing the Horizon Festival to the region “has been one of our largest ambitions yet.” </p>



<p>Advancements in technology and design will provide players with a world that they “hope you will fall in love with,” and they can’t wait for players to “discover the beautiful landscapes and rich heritage of Japan” when Forza Horizon 6 releases.</p>



<p>Japan follows on from Colorado, France, Italy, Australia, the UK, and Mexico as the locations in the Forza Horizon series.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-of-japan-will-forza-horizon-6-feature">How Much of Japan Will Forza Horizon 6 Feature?</h2>



<p><strong>The full map size for Forza Horizon 6 in Japan has not been showcased, though it has been announced the setting will be a “region” of Japan, and not a single city or location.</strong></p>



<p>Forza Horizon games usually take an area of a location and reduce its size to be smaller, allowing for a variety of biomes to be featured, which results in the likes of Forza Horizon 5 having barren desert landscapes and lush jungles. On top of this, the seasonal changes significantly tweak the look of the environment.</p>



<p>Tokyo is sure to feature, along with Mt. Fuji, and more details of the map, and how the size compares to previous games in the franchise, will be revealed closer to launch.</p>

<p>A new concept leak offers players a glimpse of the Fable reboot’s locations, items, story elements, and more ahead of its official reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Playground Games had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> the release of the Fable reboot to 2026 last year to give the title more time. We were finally going to receive an extended look at the title at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> this week. However, a leak has now revealed some major details ahead of the event. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-leak-suggests-return-to-bloodstone-a-fable-2-location">Fable Leak Suggests Return to Bloodstone, a Fable 2 Location</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1ST</a> reveals concept art for the Fable reboot, shared in an artist’s portfolio who previously contributed to the game. One of the most important finds in these images is the return of Bloodstone, a port town from Fable 2, known for housing criminals. The castle’s entry was situated between a range of mountains, which is how you might access Bloodstone in the Fable reboot. </p>



<p>Different areas surrounding this location were highlighted, including the Market District, Pub Island, and Arena. Some routes lead to characters like Artisan and Jacobs. The location features signs indicating it operates as a functioning town, such as one showing a man selling his fresh catch of fish and another reading “The Phoenix Feather.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fable concept art leak revealed another location: a swamp village named Hamlet in the files. Two versions of this location were showcased in the artwork; one depicting its original appearance and the other illustrating the effects of a flood on the village, which could serve as a story element.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are images of the main character travelling through sewers and facing off against a werewolf. The werewolf’s den is filled with hanging corpses along with skulls and bones spread across the area. Lastly, there’s also an image of different versions of chests that players can acquire in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Readers should note that there is no information regarding when this concept art was created, so details may change by the time the final version of the game is released. We might receive confirmation about some of these details during the Xbox Developer Direct next week.</p>







<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alleged-screenshot-reveals-forza-horizon-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged screenshot</a> has revealed the release date for Forza Horizon 6.

            <p>A bunch of alleged concept art for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a> reboot has reportedly been unearthed via a developer's portfolio, ahead of the RPG's appearance at this week's Xbox showcase. As of writing, there's no indication as to what stage of developement the apparent game art could be from. However, if it's genuine, it does seem to point towards a location from Fable 2 making a return in the reboot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The alleged art's been shared by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1ST</a>, who claim to have pulled it from the portfolio of an unnamed developer who worked on the game at some juncture between right now and the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Taking a look through the gallery of 29 images, a few of which aren't in colour, a good number appear to reference or depict Bloodstone. Fable 2 frolickers will remember a coastal town of that name being a pirate haven you visit on your quest to recruit Reaver, a tophatted rogue whose help you need to do big spoilery things. Well, if one of these images appearing to show the layout of its market district is to be believed, Bloodstone may now be home to a "pub island".</p>
<p>One of the images which appears to show Fable's protagonist looking out over a rocky vista also includes a sign with Bloodstone's name scrawled on it. Though, said sign appears to indicate you can get to Bloodstone both by heading in a certain direction or its complete opposite direction, which has raised my eyebrow slightly. Beyond these, MP1ST claim some of the images show a swampy village filenames suggest to be called The Hamlet, with multiple interprations of its nature-encusted homesteads appearing to show them before and after being abandoned.</p><p>There's also a sequence of sewer exploration, some more of the sort of whimsical fantasy architecture you might expect from Fable, and no less than two shots prominently featuring sheep. All in all, I'd say none of it looks hugely out of line with the pre-alpha gameplay Playground showed off when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">announced the game's delay to 2026</a> last year - not that this counts for anything in terms of proving the art's real.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is wait for that Developer Direct Fable's set to rock up at on Thursday, January 22nd. There, Xbox have promised, will be Fable things you don't have to gulp down with a tablespoon of salt. Well, unless you really can't stand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw">Richard Ayoade</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valentine’s Day is less than a month away, and it’s the perfect excuse to tell your partner how much they mean to you. A thoughtful gift can, of course, sweeten that expression, and if you’re after something beyond flowers or chocolates – something that lets you both spend quality time together – the LEGO Art Love collectible building set deserves your attention.</p>
<p>You can create your own small version of Robert Indiana’s famous LOVE sculpture with this one, that too without paying the full price right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">It’s currently available at Amazon for just $64, down from $80, after the retailer slashed the price by 20%.</a> But as you’d expect, the offer is selling out fast. Hurry to pick one up, before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fun Weekend Activity</h2>
<p>This set comes with 791 pieces in total, and is based on the famous real-life sculpture with a similar design and colors (red, blue, and green). Less than 800 pieces means it won’t really be one of those massive building projects that take weeks to complete. It can be a fun weekend activity with your loved one, where you guys bond over the experience. You can take turns following the steps, or each focus on one letter, as the set comes with two building instructions. Prepare some hot chocolate, pull out a list of thoughtful questions, and get started with the thing. Before you know it, you won’t even realize how long it’s been since you last picked up your phone.</p>



<p>You can even gift it to a friend to appreciate their presence in your life, or a parent who enjoys creative activities. Once built, the model measures over 10 inches (25 cm) high, 10 inches (25 cm) wide, and 2.5 inches (6 cm) deep. It can be a great display piece anywhere you like; place it on a shelf in the living room, the dining area, or even your office to add some personality to it. The model is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. The included instruction books take you through each step of the process one-by-one. The booklets are quite easy to follow, but you can also download the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. The app offers zoom and rotate features that make it easy to view each block from every side.</p>
<p>The LEGO Art range features more such brick-built artworks that let you create iconic pieces and pop-culture figures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">We’re spotting quite a few sets at a discounted rate, which makes now a great time to grab the ones you’ve been eyeing for a long time.</a> As for the current discount, we’re expecting it to wrap soon. It’s best to act quickly to score the drop.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's announcement that long-running MMO The Elder Scrolls Online would be moving away from traditional major expansions to focus on smaller seasonal updates, developer ZeniMax Online has insisted the big shake-up is in no way related to last year's sweeping layoffs at parent company Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">heavily impacted</a> the studio.
</p>
<p>
Last July, in a year that saw Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella boast "record performance" and a revenue increase to $281.7bn, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">announced mass layoffs</a> affecting over 9000 employees across the company, marking its third round of significant job cuts since 2023. The move - which impacted numerous Xbox studios including Rare, Turn 10, The Initiative, and Raven Software - was accompanied by multiple project cancellations.
</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>
ZeniMax Online Studios' in-development sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird was one of the games impacted, and its cancellation coincided with nearly 200 job cuts at the studio. But following last week's announcement that <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69137">The Elder Scrolls Online would be shifting to smaller seasonal releases</a>, executive producer Susan Kath has insisted the two events are unrelated.
</p>
<p>
"Seasons is not in any way a response to [the layoffs]," Kath <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">recently told RockPaperShotgun</a>. "We kicked off the Season work at least 12 to 14 months ago. We started making the changes in the team to move in this direction, knowing that this was our intent."
</p><p>
Kath describes 2025 as a "hard year for the studio", but acknowledges Blackbird's cancellation could be seen as a positive for ESO. "Ultimately, we had a lot of people doing double duty on those projects, splitting their time between projects," she continued. "[They] are now devoted 100 percent to Elder Scrolls Online. So, in fact, in some capacities, we actually increased the number of folks available as we came out of that because they weren't managing two products anymore. They were only devoted to one title."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax first publicly discussed the idea of smaller updates for The Elder Scrolls Online shortly after the layoffs. In September, studio game director Rich Lambert <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> the MMO was in "a bit of a transition year", and that the team was now looking to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker". The aim, he said, was to launch these smaller updates roughly every six to nine months, compared to the 12-15 month release schedule for traditional expansions. And last week, ZeniMax formalised its plans, announcing a move to smaller, quarterly - and free - seasons, starting 2nd April, which will also see many earlier paid expansions rolled into the base game. This change coincides with the introduction of a seasonal (but not time-limited) battle pass, featuring a free tier and two paid extensions.

<p>
In a press briefing attended by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">RPS</a> ahead of the announcement, Elder Scrolls Online game director Nick Giaomini insisted the shift would give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."
</p><p>
"To say that [the layoffs] didn't impact us wouldn't be right," Giacomini added. "We're putting on a strong face. We're human. It absolutely impacted us. But, you know, the team rallied. We're excited about the future. We're excited that we're making all these big changes."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon</a> is celebrating its 30th anniversary on 27th February, and we're collectively dying to see what might be revealed about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">long-rumoured next mainline game</a> and other projects. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> aims to shake things up with a new take on town life sims in early March. In its beginnings, however, the series took a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>This is what The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said during a brief appearance at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> through a special video (hat tip to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/pokemons-game-boy-development-process-took-a-great-deal-of-trial-and-error">Nintendo Life</a>). The franchise as a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">received the Andrew Yoon Legend Award</a>, which celebrates a "sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p>
<p>Ishihara took this opportunity to reflect on the series' humble origins. The games were made with "limited resources" back then, and he underlined Red and Green took "a great deal of trial and error" to get right and to the finish line. He even revealed the entire process ended up lasting six years, which is shocking to learn about when you consider dev cycles back in the day were substantially shorter than nowadays. What now feels normal rarely happened back then.</p>
<p>We know it all paid off in the end, and much like us, Ishihara believes it was all about having a strong base-level idea the team was confident about: "Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle." These elements were designed with nostalgic themes and warm feelings in mind, as it was all tied to "fundamental experiences" many players had as children who connected with nature.</p><p>That said, he was "uncertain at first" about its appeal outside Japan as many formative childhood experiences aren't shared. Needless to say, there was nothing to be scared of. After that initial hit, Pokémon's core themes of friendship and our (often very complicated) relationship with the world shaped the franchise's identity.</p>
<p>No comments on the next main game from Ishihara beyond continuing to use those tenets as a "major driving force," but that could change soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/</link>
            <guid>1410607</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Much has been said about the incredible level of quality that <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> put into <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a budget of <strong>less than $10 million</strong></a> and a core team of <strong>around thirty employees</strong>. </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/witchfires-creative-director-on-the-benefits-of-small-teams-and-the-mystery-of-how-clair-obscur-turned-out-so-brilliantly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, another veteran developer has expressed his absolute disbelief at what the Montpellier-based studio was able to pull off with this game. He's <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>, the founder and CEO of independent Polish developer <strong>The Astronauts</strong>, known for <strong>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</strong> and the upcoming roguelite first-person shooter <strong>Witchfire</strong> (on which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed him in September 2023</a>), due to be released out of early access at some point this year.</p>



<p>Chmielarz, who previously worked on games like <strong>Painkiller</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: Judgment</strong>, and <strong>Bulletstorm</strong> while at <strong>People Can Fly</strong> (which he originally founded in 2002), has always been outspoken. Just last month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his viewpoint on why PC gamers prefer <strong>Steam</strong> over the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong></a>.</p>



<p>In the new interview, he calls Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 '<strong>the biggest mystery in gaming right now</strong>':</p>



<p><em>Last week, I learned that the guys behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hired a lot of newbies, people who didn't make a game before. And now my world view is ruined, and I don't know what to do. Here we have a game that looks AAA to me, it's just phenomenal in every aspect. There's a deep story, deep method of work, good gameplay, great visuals and sound. It's a very coherent product. And then you hear that the core team was 30 people, half of which were first timers. And I'm like, "I don't know what to believe anymore."</em></p>



<p><em>The head of the studio had a two-hour conference in France where they were discussing the process of making this game. I haven't watched this yet, but I downloaded it, and I have transcribed the audio and translated it to English. And this video is waiting for me, because I need to know the secret, because it's absolutely crazy.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, we didn't make Witchfire with 26 people, because we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing – when you roll the credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, it's 10 or 15 minutes long. But still, that doesn't change the fact that the core team responsible for the vast majority of the game and the ideas and execution is around 30 people, half of whom are new. So it's the biggest mystery in gaming right now.</em></p>



<p>That said, he does point out a couple of things with the eye of a designer. For one thing, <strong>the game's enemies lack faces by design</strong>, which is one way to cut down on animation work. Furthermore, the high-quality scenes are more like theatrical plays in that <strong>the characters never interact with the environment</strong>, which, in his experience, is one of the most challenging aspects when making cutscenes.</p>



<p>Quite obviously, there are other such 'tricks' that Sandfall has employed, but the final outcome cannot be argued with. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an astounding amount of prizes during the award season</a>, including a few days ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-goty-2026-new-york-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>New York Game Awards</strong></a>, and there's likely more awards to come.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders has some surprisingly deep lore behind the raid-and-repeat nature of the extraction shooter, and it all revolves around the ARC. These advanced robots have overtaken the Earth’s surface, but it all started with the First Wave. </p>



<p>That was all long ago in the history of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but the remains are still seen scattered across the various in-game maps. As is the nature of the game, these First Wave Husks can be looted for ARC materials, but knowing where to look is key.</p>







<p>Follow along with this guide to learn what to look for when searching for First Wave Husks, as well as the best places you can find them in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-removes-out-of-map-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-first-wave-husks-in-arc-raiders">What Are First Wave Husks In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First Wave Husks are the older remains of ARC, as opposed to the freshly destroyed parts of ARC killed by raiders. </strong></p>



<p>Visually speaking, they stand out due to their more rusted and decrepit appearance. They’re often found half-buried in the ground, indicating that they’ve been there a long time. </p>



<p>There are three types of First Wave Husks you can find in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-copy-tarkov-flea-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. These are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Wasp Husks</li>



<li>Rocketeer Husks</li>



<li>Baron Husks</li>
</ul>



<p>The first two should seem familiar, since they’re both ARC you’ll commonly fight during a raid. The Baron Husks are a bit different, though. These large, spindly Husks have yet to be seen in fighting form, but you’ll find a good few of them on various maps. </p>



<p>Each of these First Wave Husks can be breached to find some ARC materials inside. That’s easy enough for the Wasp and Rocketeer Husks, but to breach a Baron, you’ll need to climb to the top of its head and breach. Once that’s done, flames will emit, so make sure you jump off and wait for the fire to subside before claiming your loot. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-places-to-find-first-wave-husks-in-arc-raiders">Best Places To Find First Wave Husks In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s an easy place to get to. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First Wave Husks can be found on four of the five maps in ARC Raiders, with Stella Montis being the only exception. </strong></p>



<p>These <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-teases-multiple-maps-coming-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> include: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dam Battlegrounds</li>



<li>The Blue Gate</li>



<li>Spaceport</li>



<li>Buried City</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, there’s a chance they can spawn littered across all of these maps, but there are a few more concentrated spots if you’re looking to find a solid batch at once. Generally speaking, though, you will want to search areas where it’s clear a battle has happened before. These wind up being ARC graveyards, of sorts, and contain a variety of First Wave Husks to search. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for some guaranteed locations, here are a few POIs to check out in ARC Raiders:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">POI Name</th><th data-align="center">Map Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Old Battleground</td><td data-align="center">Dam Battlegrounds</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Water Tower</td><td data-align="center">Spaceport</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Maintenance</td><td data-align="center">Spaceport</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Barren Clearing</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Adorned Wreckage</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Broken Earth/Ridgeline</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Additionally, two map modifiers can help increase the spawn rates of First Wave Husks. These are <strong>Husk Graveyard</strong> and <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong>. Husk Graveyard is an event across all four maps, and it vastly increases the spawn rates of Husks, but it doesn’t offer the x2 points modifier for Trials since it’s only a minor map condition. </p>



<p>Electromagnetic Storm, on the other hand, does offer the x2 points modifier, whilst also increasing the spawn rates of Husks. However, it’s not available on Buried City, so keep an eye out for it on the other three maps. </p>

		<p>A new update for Battlefield 6 will go live today, it is a “smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6”. The patch changes melee attacks, ladders, and jet fighter combat amongst other things.</p>
<p>Here are the full patch notes:</p>


<h2 id="major-updates">Major Updates for 1.1.3.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.</li>
<li>Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.</li>
<li>Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="changelog">CHANGELOG</h2>
<h3 id="vehicles">VEHICLES:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.</li>
<li>Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weapons">WEAPONS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.</li>
<li>Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.</li>
<li>Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.</li>
<li>Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.</li>
<li>Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.</li>
<li>Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.</li>
<li>Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks. Sprint is now only interrupted until the attack reaches its target, rather than for the full duration of the animation.</li>
<li>In the Firing Range, target dummies can now take damage while in the process of getting back up.</li>
<li>Shooting with a suppressor now emits a small muzzle flash when viewed from close range only.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gadgets">GADGETS:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the GDPIS was not destroyed when targeted by the XFGM-6D Recon Drone, Defibrillators, or the Repair Tool.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Sniper Decoy did not properly hide scope glints from nearby snipers.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Assault Ladder</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where ladders positioned above the player could not be entered.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where soldiers could be launched unexpectedly when attempting to enter a ladder.</li>
<li>Improved the soldier animations while climbing ladders.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ui-hud">UI &amp; HUD:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a new option allowing players to customize the reticle colour inside weapon and gadget scopes.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where home screen focus navigation could become locked to the bulletin.</li>
<li>Fixed cases where weapon menus displayed incorrect Reload Time stats for LMGs.</li>
<li>Soldier lightning improvements to the front-end</li>
<li>Improved front-end lighting to enhance the visual quality of soldier characters.</li>
<li>The Reticle Colour option now correctly updates reticle colours for Thermal Scopes and other supported gadgets.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vfx-video">VFX &amp; Video:</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="map-modes">MAP &amp; MODES:</h3>

<p><em>Battle Royale</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the armor bar could disappear intermittently.</li>

<p>Coming to Switch consoles this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios' sublime debut, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a>, brought some top-notch puzzle/platforming action to Switch back in April 2024. Indeed, we went so far as to give this beautiful-looking cinematic adventure a rather splendid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">8/10 back at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Now, its Swedish dev, alongside publisher Thunderful Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/atari-to-acquire-steamworld-dev-thunderful">now majority owned by Atari</a>), has dropped a full 10 minutes of unedited gameplay footage from the game's soon-to-be-released sequel, the cunningly titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</a>. Oh yes.</p>
<p>You can check out the video above, and we've got to say, rather unsurprisingly, it's looking like something we'll want to be playing as soon as it drops, on both Switch consoles, <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>. Keeping its predecessor's stylish sci-fi tone, the trailer shows off a game that will surely look fantastic in handheld mode on either Switch.</p>

<p>The original Planet of Lana made amazingly good use of its sci-fi setting and its gorgeous art-stylings to hammer home an emotional, absorbing and otherworldly tale, which also has its fair share of very good puzzles and platforming to keep you busy.</p>
<p>You know the score if you've played cinematic games of this ilk before, your <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ico">Icos</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Insides</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/another_world">Another Worlds</a>. Lots of running in fabulously animated fashion, basically, whilst avoiding death and making peace with the fact you have little in the way of defence. Relaxing!</p>

<p>ARC Raiders update 1.12.0 removes the out-of-map exploit from Stella Montis, along with duplication and other issues. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the out-of-bounds map glitch in Stella Montis was getting out of hand. So much so that last week, we learned that a trio of players was using this glitch to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceiling-glitch-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact revenge</a> on another trio that was using the same glitch. It seems that Embark Studios has had enough of it now and has finally patched the exploit. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-patch-1-12-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Patch 1.12.0?</h2>



<p>It seems that the ARC Raiders patch released today, update 1.12.0, is focused on removing the exploits players have been using to gain an unfair advantage in the game. First and foremost, the duplication glitch has been fixed, stopping players from duplicating items and ammo. </p>



<p>Next, players were previously taking damage through the map’s geometry, but this issue has now been resolved. Lastly, the ARC Raiders bug that hindered players has been fixed, along with several out-of-bounds map exploits on Stella Montis. This should hopefully put an end to players taking advantage of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-patch-notes-for-arc-raiders-update-1-12-0">All Patch Notes for ARC Raiders Update 1.12.0</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an item duplication exploit.</li>



<li>Fixed an ammo duplication exploit.</li>



<li>Fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry.</li>



<li>Fixed various out-of-bounds map locations on Stella Montis.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Another one bites the dust.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has confirmed it issued a DMCA strike on a paid Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod, after its creator refused to make it free for everyone upon the studio’s request.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The R.E.A.L. VR mod for Cyberpunk 2077 was created by Luke Ross, who, according to a 2022 report by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a>, makes $20,000 a month modding PC games to run in VR headsets. His mods are locked behind a Patreon, which sparked CD Projekt’s concern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/jan_rosner/status/2013219892405604457" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Jan Rosner, VP, Business Development at CD Projekt Red, said the company issued the DMCA strike because Cyberpunk VR was a paid mod, which violates its fan content guidelines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never allow monetization of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place,” Rosner said. “We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are big fans of mods to our games — some of the work out there has been nothing short of amazing, including Luke’s mod for Cyberpunk 2077. We’d be happy to see it return as a free release. However, making a profit from our IP, in any form, always requires permission from CD Projekt Red.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross <a href="https://x.com/LukeRoss_00/status/2013321528679473503" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded to Rosner’s tweet</a> to take issue with his work being characterized as fan content. Rather, Ross insisted, it is independent software and thus does not infringe on CD Projekt’s IP rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm sorry but I don't believe you are within your rights in demanding that my software needs to be free,” Ross said. “It is not ‘derivative work’ or ‘fan content’: it supports a large number of games which were built upon different engines, and it contains absolutely zero code or assets from your IP. Saying that it infringes your IP rights is equivalent to maintaining for example that RivaTuner violates game publishers' copyrights because it intercepts the images the game is drawing on screen and it processes them in order to overlay its statistics.”</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games" data-cy="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3><h3>Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross <a href="https://x.com/LukeRoss_00/status/2013321765141799015" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to say</a> he wants to find a “win-win solution,” and suggested CD Projekt make his Cyberpunk VR mod official, “or at least sanctioned by your company.” He added: “I think the current state of affairs is not the best way to resolve this misunderstanding.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, Ross has left his Cyberpunk VR mod behind (in a post on Patreon, Ross said, “So long, and thanks for all the fish,”), and he has pulled support for the game. Ross’ tweet here has sparked a debate about the legal implications of his mod, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a point he expanded on in a post on Patreon</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As usual they stretch the concept of ‘derivative work’ until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property,” he said. “And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy, and they cannot just be grateful about the extra copies of the title they sold because of that — without ever having to pour money into producing an official conversion (no, they're not planning to release their own VR port, in case you were wondering).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The bottom line is all that matters, and gamers be damned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Am I a little bitter about all of this? Yeah, you bet I am. Especially in the same week when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-shuts-3-vr-studios-and-lays-off-hundreds-of-devs-as-it-pivots-from-virtual-reality-and-the-metaverse-to-ai">Meta pulls the plug on three major VR studios</a>. Especially after four years during which I (together with other modders) spent so much time keeping our mods alive in spite of CDPR's constant breaking updates. Especially when they never even knew or cared during all this time that the VR conversion was there, and are only knee-jerk reacting now because somebody reported to them that it existed and it was not free.”</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not the first time Ross has been hit by a DMCA strike. In July 2022, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-5-red-dead-redemption-2-vr-mod-takedown-notice">Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two issued a DMCA notice against Ross for his GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 VR mods</a>, among others. He made a similar argument against the decision back then, insisting "none of my modifications are built using software belonging to Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc, and the modifications are not intended to replace their games, nor are they a means of exploiting Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc's proprietary IP or assets."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk is just one of a number of games for which Ross has released VR mods, and he sounds undeterred by CD Projekt’s action here. Ross already has VR mods for the likes of Sony’s Days Gone, FromSoftware’s Elden Ring, and Ubisoft’s Far Cry 5 games. Now he’s turning his attention to Larian’s Baldur’s Gate 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>One of the original Tomb Raider creators has shared some details on a previous request from a Japanese publisher, which asked the team to give Lara Croft an anime-style redesign to make her more widely appealing.</p>
<p>According to Paul Douglas - who in his own words "co-created Tomb Raider half a lifetime ago" - publisher Victor Interactive wanted the team to change up Lara's in-game look to "appeal more to a Japanese audience".</p>

<p>The Tomb Raider creator said this redesign request included ideas for Lara to have "huge eyes/head etc". Douglas added the publisher went so far as to send over a fax with some design suggestions late in Tomb Raider's development. However, fellow Tomb Raider developer Toby Gard "didn't really want to alter Lara", Douglas said on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cnhyv.bsky.social/post/3mcq3dxcwv22o">Bluesky account</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/CoreDesign_com">@CoreDesign_com</a>).</p>
<p>In order to keep both parties happy, a compromise was reached. This saw Tomb Raider's manual and guide feature more "manga-style" characters, though Douglas is "not sure who did that render or illustrations".</p>
<p><a href="https://xcancel.com/cnhyv/status/1362414841424728073">Back in 2021</a>, Douglas shared some images of these characters, with a few extra background notes. At this time, the Tomb Raider co-creator said he believed Victor "just assumed altering all the models would only take a few days of work".  However, this was "early days of 3D... 🙄", so would of course take considerable time.</p>
<p>"It started out as a request to change all the in-game and cutscene models.Then just in-game. Then just Lara. Then just Lara's head…"</p>

<p>The original Tomb Raider is currently getting a from the ground up remake, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">known as Legacy of Atlantis</a>. This will be released later this year, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and Steam.</p>
<p>Along with the remake, Crystal Dynamics is also working on the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> entry with Amazon. It's known as Catalyst, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">takes Lara to Northern India</a>. Earlier this week, Eva La Dare - known to many as Sheva Alomar in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-5">Resident Evil 5</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-5-and-street-fighter-actor-confirms-tomb-raider-catalyst-role">announced she was part of Tomb Raider: Catalyst's cast</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A top-to-bottom Atari-themed hotel is increasingly close to becoming a reality. A location has been found - in the centre of Phoenix, Arizona - and the company responsible, Intersection Development, says construction will begin late 2026 with a prospective opening date of late 2028.</p>
<p>The architectural company designing the building, Räkkhaus, revealed updated designs and features for the hotel. Renders show a large but not enormous building bearing the Atari logo and decked out with bright lighting everywhere. To me it looks like an arcade version of an Ibis.</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>But to borrow from the press release's much more poetic language: the Atari Hotel uses the "visual language" of Tron and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blade-runner">Blade Runner</a> to create a "glowing monolith of light and motion" (I bet the neighbours are pleased). The "fractured" design on the outside of the building is supposed to evoke pixel grids, and the streaks of light on the inside are supposed to remind us of arcade circuitry.</p><p>A defining feature will apparently be an LED-lit "breezeway" (pictured top) - a passage wrapped in programmable LEDs - which can be programmed to suit whatever event or season makes sense at the time. Räkkhaus reckons it'll feel like a portal from the outside world into the hotel.</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

<figure>
 


</figure>

</figure>
<p>The 90,000 sqft building will also feature a 20,000 sqft concert center, an esports venue, several restaurants, retail spaces and an "oversized pool designed for high-energy parties and gatherings". There will be 72 rooms in the building - a nod to Atari being founded in 1972 - as well as 19 suites and a "Baller Suite" penthouse with a private pool, spa and sun deck.</p><p>Räkkhaus creative director Zac Cohen called it: "A tower defined by motion, responsive surfaces, and a frame that glows with its own internal logic. This is placemaking at a new scale, a building that will be truly unique in the world."</p>
<figure>
 


</figure>
<p>However, there's still a slight question over the Atari Hotel securing the rest of the funding it needs in order to be built. Because although $14m has been raised in investment to get things going, the total budget is estimated at $124m, according to the <a href="https://www.atarihotels.com/">Atari Hotels website</a>.</p>
<p>Intersection hopes to make the money by asking the public to invest. For a minimum investment of $500, you can own a piece of the project - the land, the building and the Atari Hotel name, apparently - as well as receive various owner perks.</p><p>"You're helping turn an iconic gaming legacy into a real destination and you'll share in the success of the project along the way. Think of it as owning a piece of the experience, not just the idea," says the Atari Hotel website FAQ.</p>

<p>It's not clear what will happen if the money is not raised by the public, though, and whether the Atari Hotel will be constructed anyway.</p>
<p><a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Atari Hotels were first announced six years ago in 2020</a>, as part of a masterplan to build a chain of them around the US. The first were earmarked for Las Vegas, Nevada, and Phoenix, Arizona, but the Vegas plans have been dropped along the way. <a href="https://lasvegassun.com/news/2026/jan/16/atari-hotel-project-in-las-vegas-quietly-powers-do/">The Las Vegas Sun reported</a> that the company explored deals in the city but none came to fruition.</p>
<p>Originally an architectural company called Gensler was attached to the Atari Hotel project and shared concept images that were much grander, featuring taller buildings with far more elaborate structures and designs. These new designs are more mundane, but perhaps more realistic as a result. Phoenix also makes sense as a starting place with both Räkkhaus and Intersection having offices in the city.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> providing VR support for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is no more, after CD Projekt issued a takedown notice they claim hinged on them not being happy that the mod's creator had stuck it behind a paywall. In response, modder Luke Ross has accused the company of being all about making money.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Many of you have noticed that two of my recent posts disappeared about a week ago. I apologize that I could not comment personally about the fact, because there was an ongoing legal exchange," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771">Patreon post</a> over the weekend. "Now that the dust has settled, I'm even more sorry to announce that we are leaving behind an adventure that so many of you deeply loved and enjoyed. CD PROJEKT S.A. decided that they would follow in Take-Two Interactive Software's steps and issued a DMCA notice against me for the removal of the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod."</p>
<p>This Cyberpunk VR mod is actually just one limb of Ross' creation, which is dubbed R.E.A.L. VR and essentially serves as a framework offering various VR support forks for a bunch of different games. In order to grab Cyberpunk VR, folks have had to take out a paid subscription to Ross' Patreon (the modder does also list some works for free on <a href="https://github.com/LukeRoss00?tab=repositories">Github</a>). That, according to a post from CD Projekt business development vice president Jan Rosner, was the crux of this takedown strike.</p>
<p>"We have indeed issued a DMCA strike, as it was available as a paid mod (only accessible to Patreon subscribers)," Rosner wrote. "This directly violates our Fan Content Guidelines: we never allow monetisation of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place. We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it."</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’d like to briefly address the discussion around the “Cyberpunk VR” mod created by Luke Ross. We have indeed issued a DMCA strike, as it was available as a paid mod (only accessible to Patreon subscribers).

</span>
</p></div>
<p>That, it would seem, isn't a road Ross is prepared to go down. "As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualizing 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," the modder wrote. "And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy, and they cannot just be grateful about the extra copies of the title they sold because of that - without ever having to pour money into producing an official conversion (no, they're not planning to release their own VR port, in case you were wondering)."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Luke Ross, a pseudonym according to a 2022 report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">The Verge</a> which claimed the modder was making £20,000 per month from their VR modding efforts, has had a publisher issue them with a strike. As you might have gathered from their earlier mention of Take-Two, R.E.A.L. VR's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, and Mafia trilogy support had a copyright-focused takedown filed against them <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>As for next steps, Ross used the end of that post to announce that they'd be putting out a VR mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> ahead of schedule, "without going through the ordinary testing cycle". On one hand, I understand at least some of the modder's ire at being asked via lawyers to change up how they make their living, but on the other, if the option to go free but with optional donations for Cyberpunk is there, that seems a decent compromise for CD Projekt to have offered.</p>

                <p>In the lead up to its release on March 5, Bungie has revealed the full voice cast for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>--and it is stacked. Featuring fan-favorites from recent hits like Baldur's Gate 3 and Clair Obscur, TV sci-fi stars, and other notable gaming voices, Bungie is clearly going all-in on Marathon's voice acting.</p><p>In a blog post, Bungie revealed the 33 names that make up the English voice cast for Marathon, many of them instantly recognisable for fans of games and sci-fi. The list includes the voices of some of our favorite Baldur's Gate 3 companions including Jennifer English (Shadowheart), Neil Newbon (Astarion), Samantha Béart (Karlach), and Tracy Wiles (Jaheira). Also from the realm of RPGs are Ben Starr and Rich Keeble, who lent their voices to Verso and Monoco respectively in Clair Obscur.</p><p>Sci-fi fans might recognise Nika Futterman, who voiced Asajj Ventress in the Clone Wars animated series, as well as Elias Toufexis, the voice of Adam Jensen in the Deus Ex series, who later broke into TV sci-fi with roles in The Expanse and Star Trek: Discovery. Some other notable names include Roger Clark who plays Arthur Morgan in Red Dead 2, Morla Gorrondona who plays Eris Morn in Destiny 2, and Erin Yvette, who has appeared in Dispatch, The Wolf Among Us, Hades 2, and more.</p><p>Check out the full voice cast below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Krizia Bajos</li><li dir="ltr">Samantha Béart</li><li dir="ltr">Beau Bridgland</li><li dir="ltr">Ry Chase</li><li dir="ltr">Roger Clark</li><li dir="ltr">Darin De Paul</li><li dir="ltr">Jennifer English</li><li dir="ltr">Dave Fennoy</li><li dir="ltr">Nika Futterman</li><li dir="ltr">Morla Gorrondona</li><li dir="ltr">Reina Guthrie</li><li dir="ltr">Donnla Hughes</li><li dir="ltr">Keston John</li><li dir="ltr">Sohm Kapila</li><li dir="ltr">Rich Keeble</li><li dir="ltr">Elliot Knight</li><li dir="ltr">Erica Lindbeck</li><li dir="ltr">Piotr Michael</li><li dir="ltr">Brent Mukai</li><li dir="ltr">Neil Newbon</li><li dir="ltr">Ariana Nicole George</li><li dir="ltr">Emily O'Brien</li><li dir="ltr">Lee Shorten</li><li dir="ltr">Jason Spisak</li><li dir="ltr">Ben Starr</li><li dir="ltr">JB Tadena</li><li dir="ltr">Fred Tatasciore</li><li dir="ltr">Craig Lee Thomas</li><li dir="ltr">Elias Toufexis</li><li dir="ltr">Oliver Vaquer</li><li dir="ltr">Scott Whyte</li><li dir="ltr">Tracy Wiles</li><li dir="ltr">Erin Yvette</li></ul><p>It's unusual for a game to reveal its full cast ahead of release, though the move makes sense with all the popular voice actors Bungie has on board. Marathon's latest trailer introduces one of many characters players will meet in the world of Tau Ceti--Gantry, the MIDA faction agent. Marathon will have six factions for players to interact with, each with their own network of characters to interact with and mysteries to untangle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbNhSVj6WZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UbNhSVj6WZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marathon is set to release into direct competition with popular extraction shooter Arc Raiders, and its impressive voice cast might just be an important point of distinction for Bungie's entry into the genre. While Arc Raiders has been well received overall, one unpopular element amongst some fans and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">critics</a> is the game's use of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">AI-generated voice over</a>.</p><p>Marathon is set to release on March 5 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-launches-on-march-5-will-cost-40/1100-6537486/" data-ref-id="1100-6537486">priced at $40</a>--the same price point as Arc Raiders. Preorders for Marathon are available now.</p>

                <p>Bungie announced this week that its new extraction shooter Marathon will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-launches-on-march-5-will-cost-40/1100-6537486/" data-ref-id="1100-6537486">release on March 5</a>, and also revealed some other important pre-release information--including a set of updated system requirements.</p><p>While Bungie released PC specs for Marathon ahead of the game's first closed alpha last year, it only gave the minimum system requirements.

With reasonable minimum specs, even those with older or less powerful PCs should be able to manage the game on lower settings, too. The specs currently don't say how much system storage will be required to install Marathon, another detail which will likely come closer to release.</p><p>Marathon's development so far hasn't been smooth sailing--originally planned to release on September 23, 2025, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">launch was delayed</a> due to poor player feedback from the alpha playtest. Marathon was also embroiled in a scandal around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">stolen art</a>, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/" data-ref-id="1100-6536649">later resolved</a>, and recently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-has-lost-its-art-director-just-months-before-release/1100-6537099/" data-ref-id="1100-6537099">game's art director left</a> just months before launch. The game will also launch into direct competition with extraction shooter Arc Raiders, which has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">hugely popular</a> since it launched last October.</p><p>As one of the projects in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/" data-ref-id="2900-6143">Sony's questionably ambitious push into live service</a>, Marathon has drawn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">comparisons to Concord</a>, the live-service title that notoriously shut down <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/concord-is-shutting-down-after-two-weeks-but-is-that-unprecedented/2900-5747/" data-ref-id="2900-5747">within two weeks of launch</a>.

            <guid>1410535</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As is customary for any game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirms a release date and opens up pre-orders</a>, <strong>Bungie</strong> revealed the official <strong>Marathon</strong> PC system requirements by updating the store page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on <strong>Steam</strong></a>.</p>



<p>The good news is that any PC released in the past six to nine years should be able to run the game. The minimum graphics card requirement is either <strong>NVIDIA's GeForce GTX 1050 Ti</strong> (released in <strong>October 2016</strong>) or <strong>AMD's Radeon RX 5500 XT</strong> (launched in <strong>December 2019</strong>). Intel's option, the <strong>ARC A580</strong>, is much more recent, having been released in <strong>October 2023</strong>, but that's only because Intel entered the GPU market much later.</p>



<p>Overall, it is quite obvious that Bungie aims for Marathon to be playable on a vast number of computers, making the extraction shooter accessible to as many users as possible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Marathon</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>8 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4 GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8 GB, with ReBAR on)</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2060 (6 GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8 GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16 GB, with ReBAR on)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>DirectX</strong></td><td>Version 12</td><td>Version 12</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Then again, this was always their philosophy, even with 2017's <strong>Destiny 2</strong>. For comparison, we've also included the PC system requirements of Bungie's previous game release. Marathon runs on an evolved version of the proprietary Destiny 2 '<strong>Tiger</strong>' engine, after all.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Destiny 2</strong> <strong>Specifications</strong></th><th><strong>MINIMUM</strong></th><th><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td><td>Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Processor</strong></td><td>Intel Core i3 3250 3.5 GHz or Intel Pentium G4560 3.5 GHz / AMD FX-4350 4.2 GHz</td><td>Intel Core i5 2400 3.4 GHz or i5 7400 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen R5 1600X 3.6 GHz</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>6 GB RAM</td><td>8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Graphics</strong></td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB or GTX 1050 2GB / AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB</td><td>NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB or GTX 1060 6GB / AMD R9 390 8GB Memory 8 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Network</strong></td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td><td>Broadband Internet connection</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>105 GB available space</td><td>105 GB available space</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Anyway, the most interesting aspect of the Marathon PC system requirements is that they really open the door to a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> port. On paper, Nintendo's hybrid console should definitely have enough power to run the game, especially since it supports NVIDIA DLSS, whereas the GTX 1050 Ti does not. </p>



<p>Bungie Game Director <strong>Joe Ziegler</strong> did comment on this very topic <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/39409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Japanese website Famitsu</a>. This was shortly after the reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 in April 2025. Ziegler replied:</p>



<p><em>At the moment, we don't have any plans to add any other compatible hardware, but we will consider doing so in the future.</em></p>

            <p>Historical real-time tactics game Strategos is out in early access today, boasting over 120 factions and 250 units based on “the major and minor powers of the ancient Mediterranean”, according to developers Strategos Games. If you are a brazen tomfool, you might summarise it as Total War without the sprawling campaign map element. If you are an <em>excessively</em> brazen tomfool – brazen to the point that a formation of Greek Hoplites would use you as cover while manouvering around some pesky Achaemenid Persian archers – you might also say that “Strategos” sounds like a spiky brand of cereal, rich in essential iron and horse sweat.</p>
<p>We neither of us are tomfools, however. We know better than to write such nonsense out loud. I’ve still yet to play Strategos, but I’ve been reading more about its “command and control” simulation, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/real-time-tactics-game-strategos-aims-to-outflank-total-war-with-over-120-factions-at-launch">covering the news that MicroProse would publish the game</a>, and it does sound like a worthwhile complication of the process of clattering phalanxes together like frying pans.</p><!--more-->

<p>In brief, there’s a gap between giving an order and receiving or executing that order. Orders are issued by generals, rather than arriving magically in every unit’s brain whenever you left-click. To receive an order directly, units need to be within earshot of a general (some generals are louder, making them better commanders). If the general is too far away, they’ll need to send one of a finite number of couriers. Couriers can be intercepted and killed. Do you see? I have played wargames that make communication a feature in this way, but not recently.</p><p>Even if an order is successfully delivered, units may act independently, based on what’s going on nearby. They may choose their own targets. They can be goaded by enemies. Having one of your generals ride up to offer morale support and instructions is one way of countering this, along with keeping units in reserve to plug the line.</p>
<p>Units may also take unprompted tactical breathers after a certain amount of time spearing each other’s bellies, rather than grinding away till they rout, as in Twar. As the developers explained to <a href="https://strategyandwargaming.com/2025/03/27/is-this-the-new-total-war-strategos-exclusive-interview/">Strategy And Wargaming</a> last March, “[o]ngoing combats can also periodically shift into a mutual ‘passive’ mode where the two sides, although still locked into melee, fall back for a rest during which combats are not resolved and they can rally (and they may hurl some missiles at each other if available), which is part of the ‘Pulse Model’ of ancient warfare that inspired much of Strategos.”</p>
<p>I consider all this very juicy, and I’m sad we don’t have some review impressions to share with you. That said, the game has only just launched into early access, so there’s time yet to flank the bastards and treat them to a vigorous Wot-I-Thinking. The plan is for it to launch into 1.0 in early 2027 or so. The current build includes five historical campaigns, nine reenactment battles, and one map-based campaign, and the devs aim to “add additional scenarios and units (including chariots), along with a more refined map-based campaign”.

            <p>With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-the-switch-2-getting-more-expensive-soon-nintendo-says-theres-no-immediate-impact-but-will-keep-an-eye-on-volatile-memory-market">menace of price hikes</a> looming over every piece of gaming hardware and early 2026 reports that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Nintendo Switch 2 was below Switch 1's sales curve over its first December period</a> in the US and Europe, many have started to wonder if we were looking at a strong start with bad legs for the newest hybrid console. But, in Japan at least, that doesn't seem to be the case.</p>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japans-console-game-market-grew-by-138-8-in-2025-driven-by-the-nintendo-switch-2/">Automaton West</a> (from original reports by Kadokawa Game Linkage and Famitsu), we have learned Japan's console game market saw a big boost year-on-year in 2025, with a 138.8 percent growth across the board. It reached 418.13 billion yen, which amounts to around $2.64 billion. These figures are based on physical software and hardware sales as reported through the end of 2025, so they include the bulk of the Christmas shopping we typically see every December.</p>
<p>Mind you, we haven't seen the more specific data for the Christmas period, but overall, Japan's console game market is looking remarkably strong, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pierre485.bsky.social/post/3mbwj5lp24s2o">outpacing Switch 1's first year</a> (and every other console's, it seems) in Nintendo's home turf. Things look even better when we take into account that digital sales, DLC, and in-game purchases are not accounted for in the aforementioned reports.</p>
<p>Moreover, the original Switch continued to perform well given its age and the presence of Nintendo's second hybrid console, with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-japan-dominance-continues-as-switch-2-fuels-40-market-growth-in-2025/">1.52 million units reportedly sold in 2025</a>, putting it above PS5's sales in Japan last year. It must be noted <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466770/2025-japan-sales-comparison-charts-through-december-switch-2-vs-ps5-vs-xbox-series-vs-switch/">other charts aren't as optimistic</a>, but the information shared shows the Japanese market favours Nintendo's hardware.</p>
<p>When it comes to best-selling physical games in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (2.668 million units) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> (2.534 million units) conquered the top spots with the Switch 1 &amp; 2 releases combined.</p>
<p>Looking at what early 2026 has in store for us and the strong focus on iconic JRPG series like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-demo-now-available-on-switch-2-and-xbox-series-xs-so-you-can-check-out-performance-on-nintendos-console">Final Fantasy</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-are-developing-this-to-be-the-masterpiece-version-dragon-quest-7s-producer-on-taking-a-scalpel-to-the-structure-of-a-classic">Dragon Quest</a> making the jump to Switch 2 before first-party heavy hitters start to arrive, we're not expecting a slowdown of that market's growth.</p>

            <p>Marathon has swiftly climbed Steam's Top Sellers list following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">reveal of its 5th March release date</a>.</p>
<p>Bungie's extraction shooter, which has up until now lived in the realm of closed betas and behind-closed-doors tests, was made available for pre-order overnight. In those midnight hours many wallets were opened by keen members of the public, landing on the number seven spot.</p>
<p>It lies currently behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, at third. There's also EA Sports FC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Those three currently ranking well due to substantial discounts on the PC marketplace. Marathon is currently retailing for £34.99 / $39.99.</p>

<p>It's a great first showing for the extraction shooter, which has until now had to power through a turbulent development process at Bungie. Only last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">its art lead left the company</a>, and prior to that the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-still-lives-as-bungie-announces-new-closed-technical-test-ahead-of-public-update">underwent drastic design changes</a> to the game following a mixed reception to initial public betas.</p><p>It follows on the heels of Arc Raiders, another extraction shooter which took the world by storm last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">growing in popularity through the winter holidays</a>. Whether that game has set the stage for wider extraction shooter popularity, allowing Marathon to launch to a comparable level of success, will be made clear as early as March.</p>

<p>As detailed in the (very brief) patch notes, the app is now live in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Today! - Version 2.3.0 Update</strong></p>
<p>Now available in Argentina, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you've yet to experience the delights of the Nintendo Today! app, it's essentially Nintendo's primary way of communicating key announcements and updates since its launch in 2025. You'll often find that new trailers or even Nintendo Direct announcements will be made on the app before they go live on social media or YouTube.</p>
<p>One such announcement was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, the single-player spin-off title for the <strong>Splatoon</strong> series on Switch 2. A debut trailer was released on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/splatoon-raiders-a-new-splatoon-spin-off-is-confirmed-for-switch-2">10th June 2025</a>, but we've yet to hear anything more about this mysterious title. Here's hoping Nintendo will host a fresh Direct soon and reveal its secrets.</p>

            <p>A mod for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> which enabled the game to be playable in VR has been removed following a legal takedown notice by CD Projekt.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, prolific VR modder Luke Ross said the Cyberpunk 2077 and Witcher 3 studio had issued a DMCA notice against him, requesting the removal of his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod.</p>

<p>However, it wasn't actually the mod itself that the team took issue with. Rather, CD Projekt requested the removal after Ross put his mod behind a Patreon paywall, effectively selling its content. This is at odds with the Cyberpunk 2077 studio's official 'Fan Guidelines' document, which states any content created with its games can not be used for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>"We're happy for you to accept reasonable donations in connection with your fan content, but you're not allowed to make people pay for it or have it behind any sort of paywall (e.g. don't make content only available to paid subscribers)," <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/fan-content">this document reads</a>.</p><p>Despite this, Ross has admitted he feels "bitter" about being forced to remove his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod. "In the end it amounted to the same iron-clad corpo logic: every little action that a company takes is in the name of money, but everything that modders do must be absolutely for free," Ross wrote in a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771">very to the point Patreon post</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/luke-ross-cyberpunk-pc-vr-mod-dmca-takedown/">roadtovr</a>).</p>
<p>"As usual they stretch the concept of 'derivative work' until it's paper-thin, as though a system that allows visualising 40+ games in fully immersive 3D VR was somehow built making use of their intellectual property," Ross continued.</p>
<p>"And as usual they give absolutely zero f***s about how playing their game in VR made people happy." According to <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/2013313704004120925?s=20">@SynthPotato</a>, Ross generates $20k monthly from paid mods.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, our Ian took Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 mod out for a spin. You can check out his adventures in the video below. </p>

<p>Despite the legal issues between Ross and CD Projekt, he is not giving up his VR modding endeavours. In his same post, he announced the release of a new VR mode for Larian's acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in CDPR-related news, earlier this month Cyberpunk 2 creative director Igor Sarzynski revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-dont-we-see-male-v-in-post-launch-cyberpunk-2077-marketing-the-cyberpunk-2-creative-director-has-a-very-simple-explanation">why male V disappeared from the game's marketing after Cyberpunk 2077 launched its 2.0 update</a>.</p>
