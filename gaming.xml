In a new <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Nacon announced that it will now delay the Terminator: Survivors launch until 2025, previously expected to release in October 2024.



Nacon broadly cited the need for “some additional time” in order to realize its vision for the game. The studio also wants to “deliver the game that fits your expectations.”



Nacon did not break down the exact cause for delay, nor offer a more concrete release window.



However, the devs say they are impressed by fan enthusiasm, and thanked the community for their understanding and support. Although fans are dismayed by Terminator: Survivors’ delay, they did support the decision to await a smooth launch.

&nbsp;



Nacon first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-open-world-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed Terminator: Survivors</a> in February 2024, during the Nacon Connect showcase. A couple of months later, Nacon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-offline-story-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed more details</a> about the game during a Q&amp;A session.



Terminator: Survivors is an open-world survival game and first-person shooter, built in Unreal Engine 5. It will support co-op, as well as offline single-player gameplay.



According to the official <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, players will “meet iconic characters of the franchise as well as original ones.” It will also feature “an unexplored storyline” about Judgment Day.



Terminator: Survivors previously planned to launch on PC on October 24, 2024, with console versions releasing later on. Most recently, Nacon shared a development video late last June, explaining the game’s inspiration from James Cameron’s original two films.

I don’t consider myself an achievement hunter. I see the appeal, and I’m excited to watch one of those videos on YouTube of someone achieving one of the rarest trophies in a game, but I don’t want to put in the work myself. I’m happy just playing the game. That said, if you fall into the former camp, here’s a look at all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong!

<figure><figcaption>Image via Game Science</figcaption></figure><p>


Seriously, I’m right there with you. I want to get my hands on Black Myth: Wukong! But if you’re looking to track down and unlock all achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, you must wait until August 20 to play the game.



Black Myth: Wukong launches simultaneously on PC and PlayStation 5, but sadly, there’s still no word about the Xbox Series X|S release date. It’s coming; the studio just doesn’t know when.



</p><hr><p>



To help you unlock achievements, it’s nice knowing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-open-world-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game is mostly linear</a> so that you won’t have to run far and wide. What do you think? Would Black Myth: Wukong be better as an open-world game or a linear one?

We said ‘Let’s use what they’ve done and build on top of it,’ rather than going our own way.”<br></p><p>The Ubisoft producer added that all of the teams working on various <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games are “part of the brand” and it’s important that all the studios are talking to each other to avoid “redoing work.” </p><p>“Making games is difficult, it takes a lot of time and passion, and you want to avoid doing the same things but differently,” said Onnée. </p><p>“You want to build on top of work and improve on it. We have a lot of discussions with other teams to make sure if we’re doing similar things, we can collaborate and so if they want to do something afterward, we can take that into account.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-escape-from-tarkov-wipe-event-is-nothing-new.951360/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-wipe-event-nothing-new/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The first Escape from Tarkov wipe event has kicked off and is in full force worldwide. It’s nothing new, though – it’s something we’ve seen before, and it’s expected that it’ll be joined by other, typical pre-wipe events in due course. The event started after Battlestate Games had posted an image on socials showcasing in-game characters hefting around bags of concrete, and that was enough to give the game away.</p>
<p>For this first event, players will be able to level up their Hideout for nothing more than bottles of Pevko beer. Also, skill levels are climbing at an accelerated rate, which means that players will be able to hit max levels in a fraction of the time as wipe draws ever closer.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wipe Soon?</h2>
<p>The next Tarkov wipe is on the horizon, and it has been a long time coming. This is officially the longest gap we’ve ever had between wipes at more than 225 days, and players are tired, to say the least. It has been a rocky few months for the Escape from Tarkov universe. First, there was the drama surrounding the release of Tarkov Arena, and then the reveal of The Unheard Edition threw the entire ecosystem into disarray. From the problems with incessant cheating to rampant instability, it has been a hard time to call yourslef a Tarkov fan of late.</p>
<p>But all that’s going to be pushed aside now that the first pre-wipe event has kicked off. It means that players are potentially days away from the all-important wipe that resets everyone’s account and brings hundreds of thousands of players back into the game. Plenty of changes and additions will be coming with the 0.15 patch that’ll come in alongside the wipe, too.</p>
<p>For now, players can take part in this basic event.</p>
<p>https://x.com/tarkov/status/1822928618072236049</p>
<p>To level up your Hideout as quickly as possible, you’ll need to collect Pevko beers. Fortunately, any enemy designated as a ‘Boss’ is now guaranteed to drop them, so you can farm them quite easily. Also, as you adventure across Norvinsk slaying these tougher-than-normal characters, you’ll find that your skill levels are climbing at an eye-watering pace, turning you into a super soldier in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>As stressed, it’s the first pre-wipe event in Tarkov – we can expect much more to come in the next few days.</p>

In fact, Rob and I were so distraught over the endless sports being over that we decided to record a podcast waxing nostalgic over and event that literally concluded over the weekend. Alas. We do plan to watch the paralympicsthis month, so if you have recommendations on athletes to keep track of, events that are particularly interesting, let us know! (P.S. We are aware we've been pretty sports-centric recently.)</p><p>-pk, who cannot f'ing wait for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> later this week</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>Rob and I have been watching <em>a lot</em> of Olympics the past two weeks, and supercharged by the way the men's and women's basketball teams finished, we decided to double dip on Sports!. (Yes, we talk a little Caleb Williams, too, but we are <em>really really really really</em> trying to play it cool.)</li><li><strong>TUESDAY: </strong>We'll record an episode of HOA early with Janet, talking about Janet's office-to-studio transition, and how it's got someone like me considering a similar pivot this year. You'll hear that episode next week, but during the day, <em>Remap</em>'s football geniuses will join forces to check out the new Madden, in which us playing it <em>really really really</em> cool about Caleb Williams will suddenly be thrust into the spotlight, as we try to win with the Bears.) I think we're also going to spin the wheel to determine the next My Turn episode. If Sports! editing gets gone early, Cado will release it on Tuesday, otherwise...</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY:</strong> ...Sports! will be released today. We're ditching the days between release. In the past, we dropped Sports! episodes on the main feed a few days later, timed to the Sunday NFL schedule, but it feels weird. The bonus you get for being a paid sub, like Remap Radio, is the podcast without ads. Cado and Rob will also take to the streams to continue motorsport managing.</li><li><strong>THURSDAY: </strong>There will, hopefully, be a letter series that drop sometime this week, but as of this writing, I have not responded to Rob's prompt quite yet. Stay tuned, though. In the meantime, we'll be recording a new Remap Radio.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY:</strong> Remap Radio goes live, amidst my push to finish <em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>. We're at the endgame now, which opens the door to me finally playing <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>in the coming weeks. (I will also be preserving the play-for-30-minutes format for another game in the near future. Taking requests!)</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-team-releases-35-minute-%E2%80%98deep-dive%E2%80%99-trailer.951330/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-deep-dive-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>GSC Game World has just given fans worldwide the best look at Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong>. In an extended 35-minute walkthrough, the team guides players through various elements of this post-apocalyptic FPS title, which has been developing for over a decade. Outside of the recent leaks that showcased several minutes of rough gameplay, this is the longest and strongest look we’ve had at Stalker 2 since it was announced more than ten years ago.</p>
<p>Recently, the team at GSC Game World revealed yet another delay for the highly anticipated open-world game. In an announcement that went hand-in-hand with a tongue-in-cheek trailer poking fun at all the postponements, it was revealed that the launch of Stalker 2 will be pushed back two months to November 20, 2024.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Everything You’d Want to Know</h2>
<p>Stalker 2 has been coming for a long time, but there’s still a little longer to wait. If it runs well on launch, it’ll be a very well-received game, as some trends have surfaced this year, such as the rampant popularity of the Fallout television series, that have left gamers worldwide <strong>hungry&nbsp;</strong>for a solid post-apocalyptic adventure. Given that it has been several years since the last major Stalker release, it’ll also be a boon for fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>Several key details have been revealed in the massive gameplay walkthrough published today by GSC Game World:</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl - Developer Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jRLJ3lV-_V8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Firstly, it’s stressed just how wide, open, and diverse ‘The Zone’ will be in Heart of Chornobyl. It’s a staggering world that features&nbsp;<strong>twenty regions</strong>, each of which offers unique elements that encourage open exploration. With that being said, the team has constructed the game from the ground up to give a sense of loneliness and apprehension as the player explores, fully unaware of what might be lingering around the corner.</p>
<p>Despite Stalker 2 being a solid competitor to games like Fallout, there’s no ‘traditional’ levelling system in the game, which restricts the more RPG-focused elements some players might have been hoping for. It’s still Stalker at heart, though – and that means that you’ll still have those survival elements and some resource management to handle.</p>
<p>For instance, you need to manage your inventory to ensure you’re not carrying too much weight. Instead of a typical levelling system, Stalker 2 will unfold like Metro Exodus, with the player needing to explore and dig in all the game’s nooks and crannies to unlock attachments, weapons, equipment, and upgrades.</p>
<p>With a dynamic faction system, a whole host of nasties to battle, a massive open-world map, and countless opportunities to take on side quests and other assorted missions, Stalker 2 looks like the kind of game that you’ll pour&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>upon&nbsp;<strong>hours&nbsp;</strong>into.</p>

                <p>Nacon's upcoming Terminator game, Terminator: Survivors, will potentially bring the future war to life in a way that gamers have never seen before. But Judgment Day is going to have to wait. Nacon has announced that the game has been pushed back from its PC release date on October 24. Instead, both the PC and console versions of Terminator: Survivors will now be released in 2025.</p><p>Marco Ponte, Nacom's CEO and creative director, released a statement online that explains why the studio felt it needed more time to work on the game.</p><p>"This deferral of the game's release was a tough decision to make, however we believe that this additional time will enable us to ensure that our vision of the post-apocalyptic world of Terminator meets the expected level of quality," said Ponte. "On behalf of the Nacon Studio Milan team, I would like to thank all the players and fans of the franchise for their enthusiastic reception of Terminator: Survivors. We are extremely proud to have this opportunity to work on such an iconic franchise as Terminator, and are eager to reveal more of it to you. Thank you all for support… We’ll be back."</p><p>While the Terminator continuity has been mangled by the last two movies in the franchise, Terminator: Survivors is taking its cues from the first two films. The title is an open-world game set four years after Judgment Day, as humanity is still scrambling after Skynet's attempt to wipe them out. Gamers can play solo or join other players in co-op as they look for resources to build a base and mount an offensive against the machines.</p><p>Naturally, Skynet won't be taking that lying down, and numerous Terminators from the films will be featured in the game.</p>

            <p>
Terminator: Survivors, the open-world Terminator game from Rims Racing developer Nacon Studio Milan, has been delayed, with publisher Nacon having opted to move its previously announced Steam early access launch from this October until sometime in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Terminator: Survivors was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terminator-resistance-developer-making-new-robocop-game">teased</a> back in 2022, but it wasn't until this February that Nacon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nacons-open-world-terminator-survivors-heading-to-steam-early-access-in-october">gave it a name</a> and shared first details. It sees players, cast as the titular survivors of humanity's near-extinction on Judgment Day, attempting to "reestablish some semblance of society in a world that seems hell-bent on eliminating... the last vestiges of mankind."
</p>
<p>

More specifically, players - either working solo or co-operatively with up to three friends - must roam Terminator: Survivors' hazardous post-apocalyptic open-world in search of materials, resources, information, and other survivors as they set about establishing a base of operations - all while fending off Skynet's machines and rival factions hunting for the same resources.

<p>
Terminator: Survivors was originally due to launch into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2617340/Terminator_Survivors/">Steam early access</a> on 24th October, but Nacon has now <a href="https://x.com/SurviveTheT800/status/1823011706836029701">announced a delay</a> on social media. "To realise our vision, and to make sure to deliver the game that fits your expectations," the company wrote, "we need some additional time. Thus we will be pushing the launch to 2025."
</p>
<p>
"We know that this will be a disappointment to many," it continued, "but we want to do right by this universe, its fans, and our community. In the long term we believe this is the right call. We are grateful for your understanding."
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, Terminator: Survivors' Steam early access launch will be followed by a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release "at a later date".

<p>Players will be free to roam the large and realistic open world of the real Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, transformed by the fictional Chernobylite material. They will get to create and develop their own hero, with attributes and skills affecting combat effectiveness and the conversation style.</p>
<p>The developers claim the sequel will feature an advanced melee combat system, in addition to a diverse arsenal of firearms. Stealth or calling on others for help are other options available. Each of the main character's buddies is a potential teacher, ready to share their knowledge and skills. Assemble your team and discover the unique strengths and abilities they bring to the table.</p>
<p>Planewalking allows you to change the build and equipment on the fly. Moreover, players are free to develop more than one character skill set. Base expansion is also important, with players able to craft valuable items and upgrade their weapons every day. Assigning tasks to NPCs ensures they will take care of your equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>Throughout Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, players will fight for influence and negotiate with the game's factions. The Exclusion Zone is a battlefield that changes daily and reacts to your actions.&nbsp; Perhaps the biggest addition is online co-op. Dedicated missions are reportedly embedded in the single player campaign, allowing players to interact with each other in various ways.</p>
<p>We'll keep a close eye on the development of this promising sequel. Stay tuned for more information as the release draws near.</p>
