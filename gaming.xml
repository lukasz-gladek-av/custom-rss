			<p>EA is going to be acquired by an investor consortium for $55 billion, as it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-reportedly-closing-in-on-deal-to-go-private-massive-50-billion-buyout/">widely rumored last week.</a></p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">press release shared today</a>, the publisher of successful titles like the Battlefield series, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october-10-pre-orders-open-two-open-beta-weekends/">highly anticipated sixth entry is launching next month on PC and consoles</a>, confirmed it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an investor consortium comprised of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners in an all-cash transaction of $55 billion. Going into further details, the agreement's terms indicate the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the company.</p>



<p>The press release continues that the acquisition agreement was given the go-ahead by the EA's Board of Directors after the opportunity was carefully evaluated. According to Luis A. Ubiñas, the Lead Independent Director of the board, it was concluded that the opportunity delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders.</p>



<p>Although EA has entered into the acquisition agreement, the transaction is expected to close in Q1 FY27, and will be subject to closing conditions, including approval of regulatory bodies and EA stockholders. After the transaction is closed, EA's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p>



<p>Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of EA, commented on the news, saying:<em> "Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work. Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</em></p>

            <p>Remember when you were young, and had your first crush? All of a sudden your hormones are going nuts, and here's this person you can't think about without your face contorting into a goofy smile, or talk about without bashfully giggling. Well, it seems that's how part-time Gearbox exec and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hey-randy-im-not-sure-if-saying-that-a-real-fan-will-figure-out-how-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-is-a-good-look">full-time social media poster</a> Randall Steward Pitchford II feels about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s freshly revealed first DLC Vault Hunter.</p>
<p>It's understandable to be fair. Which of us hasn't found ourselves gazing longingly at a former casino robot dressed like a goth version of John Wayne, before volunteering to help animate its card-throwing? Sometimes, C4SH rules not just everything around you, but your very heart.</p>

<p>C4SH is the name of this cowbot, whom you'll be able to play as if you splash out for him when he arrives alongside the game's first story DLC early next year. The Vault Hunter's "a drifter who chases the probability-breaking highs of cursed eldritch artifacts, with his bio continuing that the first story DLC, Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, "is full of cosmic horrors that harbor uncanny curios, some of which can surely bend the odds in C4SH's favour."</p><p>As you might have guessed, C4SH is aimed at folks who like playing in a way that comes with high risk for potentially high reward, with the buckarndroid's skills being deliberately unpredictable. That's all cool, but the more important thing emphasised in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/nfyubGFy_AE">C4SH's reveal at the Tokyo Game Show</a> is this: Randy Pitchford fucking LOVES him.</p>
<p>"C4SH is important to me because I think he and I have a lot in common," the exec said during this on-stage reveal, having previously descibed the cowboy robot as "very dear to me, very personal to me." What's engendered these strong feelings in such a famously chill and dispassionate fellow? Well, Pitchford has both won and lost while doing some real life gambling, the CEO said, and he's also a professional magician. "I’ve mastered sleight of hand with playing cards, and we used my demonstration to help animate the character in the game," said the smitten Gearbox skipper.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll have more to share in the coming months about C4SH and Story Pack 1, but for now, check out what's up next in our post-launch roadmap, including our first Seasonal Mini-Event, Bounty Pack, and Invincible Boss. <a href="https://t.co/FUYq5qduqO">pic.twitter.com/FUYq5qduqO</a></p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1972142127967850710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>So, if you've ever wondered what it's like to basically be Randy Pitchford - or at least a cyborg Clint Eastwood that he sees a lot of himself in - now's your chance to find out. I assume there's a posting interface built into the HUD when you load in as C4SH. Either that, or you'll have to run two monitors for the authentic experience of arguing with tweeters about the capabilities of their game-playing boxes as you play Borderlands. Remember: when it feels like you should probably stop posting, do not stop posting.</p>
<p>As they've revealed C4SH, Gearbox have also put out a DLC roadmap for Borderlands 4. Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, the first story pack C4SH arrives as part of early next year, also includes extra main and side missions in a new zone of Kairos and new gear. Hopefully the majority of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4s-latest-update-aims-to-deliver-more-performance-fixes-ends-up-causing-more-stuttering-for-some">performance issues</a> which've plagued the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> since release will be sorted by then, so you can enjoy C4SH rather than crash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The version 2.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Memories of Dreams Bygone,” will launch on October 15, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [207 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-997143"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this latest update, players will team up with Spook Shack and set foot in the newly unlocked Timesworn Hills, where ghost stories echo through abandoned ruins in the Hollow. Lucia, Yidhari, and Komano Manato join the battlefield as new Agents, accompanied by fresh gameplay, new outfits for Vivian and Manato, and engaging events.</p><p>The newly revealed Timesworn Hills region, known for its abundant Lumite ore deposits, conceals abandoned research facilities and testing ground ruins where chilling legends thrive. Tales of miners who vanished within the Miasma, the tolling of a phantom bell, creatures that gaze into people’s hearts, and hypnotists capable of ensnaring victims in endless dreams haunt the land. This new adventure begins with the case of missing miners and Porcelumex employees, drawing Proxies into the Hollow to uncover unsettling truths.</p><p>The new members from Spook Shack bring not only fascination with haunted tales but also formidable strength to the battlefield. Lucia, an S-Rank Ether Support Agent and devoted Ethereal fan, wields dreamlike powers to recreate Ethereals in combat. By accumulating Dream Points, she can enter a Dream state and unleash Ether Veil: Wellspring, boosting all allies’ max HP while enhancing team damage through increased Sheer Force and triggering Aftershocks. Yidhari, an S-Rank Ice Rupture Agent, embodies both risk and resilience. She gains Sheer Force based on her max HP, and her ice attacks always inflict Sheer DMG, piercing through enemy defenses. Her damage increases as her HP percentage drops, rewarding a delicate balance of HP loss and recovery. Meanwhile, Komano Manato, now joining the battlefield as an A-Rank Fire Rupture Agent, unleashes Sheer DMG with strikes that scale from his max HP. In addition, S-level agents Vivian (Ether – Anomaly) and Ju Fufu (Fire – Stun) will return in this version’s banners.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_997145"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> continuously gears up to deliver eventful content and optimized combat experiences. In Version 2.3, Soldier 0 – Anby will be enhanced through refined combat mechanics and boosted performance to unleash her latent combat potential. New gameplay “Threshold <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">Simulation</a>” offers both tactical and combat challenges as Proxies deploy multiple squads to withstand interconnected battle scenarios. The event “When Dreams Remain Unfinished” introduces turn-based combat, where players command various categories of monsters with unique traits and tactical positioning. Completing the event also grants Agent <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>to as a free reward. Additionally, the beloved “SNAP! Shining Strike” photography event returns with an upgrade, offering more freedom with camera controls, diverse filters and frames, allowing players to capture stunning scenes.</p><p>As New Eridu’s story continues to unfold, <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> offers a heartfelt glimpse of what lies ahead. Future agents — including Banyue, Dialyn, Zhao, and Ye Shunguang — are set to join the Proxies’ journey in the near future. As a token of gratitude for embarking on the adventures still to come, Proxies can claim an extra 600 Polychromes in addition to the regular rewards of 10 Encrypted Master Tapes and 10 Boopons during Version 2.3.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,018 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,420 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.3 special program below.

            <p>EA has officially been acquired by a group of investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund in a private transaction worth $55bn.</p>
<p>EA chairman and CEO Andrew Wilson will continue to lead the company - known for its sports games, BioWare's RPGs, The Sims, and forthcoming shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> - with the transaction expected to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/investors-including-saudi-s-pif-are-reportedly-in-advanced-talks-for-a-50bn-leveraged-buyout-of-ea">News of the acquisition came over the weekend</a>, before an official announcement today. The investor group comprises the PIF, as well as investment firms Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p>
<p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world's most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," said Wilson.</p><p>"Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energised than ever about the future we are building."</p>
<p>"Electronic Arts is an extraordinary company with a world-class management team and a bold vision for the future. I've admired their ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, and as someone who grew up playing their games - and now enjoys them with his kids - I couldn't be more excited about what's ahead," said Jared Kushner, CEO of Affinity Partners. Kushner is US President Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>
<p>PIF <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-increases-stake-in-ea-by-55">increased its stake in EA in 2023</a>; now its 9.9 percent stake will roll over. The organisation also holds stakes in a number of gaming companies including Nintendo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, Embracer, Capcom, and more.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is another, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-to-get-surprise-free-story-dlc-later-this-year">Assassin's Creed Mirage set to receive a surprise free DLC</a> set in 9th century AlUla, an ancient Arabian city.

<p>The PIF was designed to diversify Saudi Arabia's revenue via investment in foreign companies.

<p>After so many years of performance issues on the original Switch, I haven’t quite gotten used to the fact that most games on Switch 2 hit a stable 60fps and that modern third-party blockbusters run on it well. As such, I raised a sceptical eyebrow when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/resident-evil-requiem-has-been-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2">announced for Nintendo’s second handheld hybrid</a> during the last Nintendo Direct. From what we’ve seen of it up until that point, the ninth mainline Resident Evil is a graphical stunner and not something I would expect or even want to play on a less powerful console.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for Capcom to convince me otherwise. Both on the chaotic showfloor of the Tokyo Game Show and tucked away in a conference room, a confident Capcom had Requiem running in handheld mode on the Switch 2. Still sceptical, I sat down for a 30-minute run-through of the same demo you might’ve seen PS5 footage of from Gamescom 2025 and came away impressed with what Capcom has managed to do.</p>
<p>As this was an impromptu hands-on, I only had a small stand for my iPhone 16 available. As you can tell in the footage, the screen was pushed slightly far from me and angled back to avoid the fluorescent lights in the conference room.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7400cb56870cd"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Switch 2 Gameplay" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7400cb56870cd/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-gameplay.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The demo begins with new protagonist Grace Ashcroft suspended upside down on a gurney in a rundown hotel. Freeing herself, she then must find a way to escape. Problem is, the gate to the ward she’s in requires a second fuse to open. The fuse, of course, is in a locked room she needs to find a key for, and even then, the fuse itself requires a tool to break from its locked encasement. Oh, and there’s a massive, gnarly monster that resembles an old woman chasing her through the poorly lit corridors.</p>
<p>As you can tell, this demo leans heavily into the classic survival horror side of the franchise. Grace can’t suplex the monster grandma like Leon Kennedy might have, but she did survive a couple of swipes from her massive claws. As a fan of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard-gold-edition">Resident Evil 7</a>, I felt right at home as the monster stalked me through holes in the ceiling and leapt out of doorways to ambush me as I solved the puzzle required to escape.</p>
<p>Even on the small handheld screen, my heart was pumping as Grace pushed a noisy cart across a room in order to climb up it and reach a screwdriver. It was at this moment, with the quality headphones Capcom provided, that I thought how amazing an experience it would be to play Requiem late at night while cosy in bed instead of at my desk or on the sofa—though I do have two caveats when playing this way.</p>

<p>In handheld mode, I found my brief time testing the over-the-shoulder third-person mode a bit disorienting; the first-person perspective felt much more natural on the smaller screen because I could make out items I could pick up on shelves and other details much more easily.</p>
<p>That said, if the third-person perspective feels better for more action-heavy sections that fans have speculated about since the game’s announcement, the option to switch between the two while also switching between handheld and docked mode might give the Switch 2 version an edge over other consoles and PC. I could see myself taking down bosses on my monitor with a grenade launcher and switching to the handheld mode as I solve puzzles while avoiding unkillable monsters.</p>
<p>However, I can’t comment on how much visual fidelity is lost between the Switch 2 and beefier hardware, as there wasn’t another version to directly compare it with. When looking at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8gK0YdUpY&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendolife.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=Mjg2NjY">Switch 2’s reveal trailer</a> side-by-side with the <a href="https://youtu.be/POz1-EmLsTY?si=89ijO9dsImK-zCgA">original announcement trailer</a>, hair and textures in general clearly lose quite a lot of fidelity. To me, however, the game looked amazing on the smaller screen at (presumably) 1080p. While I didn’t have enough time to squint at how many pixels Grace’s hair had as she ran for her life, the differences in the trailers didn’t seem so drastic.</p>
<figure data-uuid="dd9d88b685b34"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem Switch 2 Gameplay" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dd9d88b685b34/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-gameplay.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Which brings me to my second caveat: the relative dimness of the Switch 2’s screen in a well-lit room seemed insufficient for such a dark, atmospheric game. This obviously isn’t Capcom’s fault, but compared to something more colourful like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, which I personally have found no problem with in bright rooms, I worry that you’ll pretty much only be able to see Requiem clearly while hiding beneath your covers after midnight.</p>
<p>You can see this in my footage; at first, the fluorescent lights of the room obscured the bottom half of the screen. Once I angled those out of the way, I was pretty much looking at a mirror image of myself while I stumbled my way through the dark corridors.</p>
<p>Regardless, my experience with RE Requiem has broken me of that Nintendo stigma that third-party blockbusters can’t run on their hardware. I did not notice any dropped frames and — at least in handheld mode — the visual downgrade on the Switch 2 doesn’t seem that drastic.</p>
<p>As a result, I’m seriously considering picking up Requiem on Switch 2 over other versions, as avoiding the grandma monster seems a little bit more spooky and immersive when everyone else is asleep and tucked into bed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-announces-unprecedented-55-billion-sale-to-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner%E2%80%99s-private-equity-group-and-others.1311352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another one of the biggest game publishers in the world is being sold. On Monday, Electronic Arts announced a <span id="_ctrl0_ctl46_spanNewsDetailsTitle">$55 billion deal to take the publisher behind massive franchises like <em>Madden</em>, <em>The Sims</em>, and<em> Apex Legends</em> private, selling to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, Silver Lake, and President Donald Trump nephew Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>The all-cash deal values the company at a 25 percent premium over its mid-august stock price and is set to be finalized by mid-2026 pending shareholder and regulatory approvals. Current CEO Andrew Wilson will remain the head of the publisher which will stay headquartered in California. The sale builds on Saudi Arabia’s existing 10 percent ownership of the company which was built up in recent years amid investments across the larger gaming industry. Those included the $4.9 billion purchase of <em>Monopoly Go!</em> mobile game maker Scopely in 2023 and the gobbling up of <em>Pokémon Go</em> and Niantic’s other gaming businesses earlier this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-scopely-niantic-saudi-arabia-monster-hunter-1851769360">for $3.5 billion</a>. The current $55 billion buyout of EA is not just the government-backed Public Investment Fund’s largest gaming acquisition to date, it’s also the largest sale ever to take an existing public company private.</p> <p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” Wilson said in a press release. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p>

 <p>Founded back in 1982, EA’s gaming empire is vast with studios across the globe and franchises ranging from blockbusters like <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>EA Sports FC</em> (formally known as <em>FIFA</em>) to <em>Mass Effect</em> maker BioWare and smaller label signings&nbsp;this year’s critically-acclaimed GOTY-contender <em>Split Fiction</em>. It’s not yet clear how the deal will effect the size and scope of the roughly 15,000 person publisher.</p>

 <p>Saudi Arabia’s funding partners include the private equity firms Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, the latter of which was founded by Kushner after Trump left office in 2021. Roughly half of its reported funding, approximately $2 billion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">is also from Saudi Arabia</a>. “Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future,” he said in a statement. “​I’ve admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids–I couldn’t be ​more ​excited about ​what’s ​ahead.”</p>

 <p>The deal arrives amid fresh criticism of people selling out to the Saudi Royal family despite its record of human rights abuses. Organizations backed by PIF held the Esports World Cup in Riyadh this summer and hosted talks with high-profile industry figures like Hideo Kojima and Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, whose company is currently producing an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> DLC set in Saudi Arabia. Outside the world of gaming, famous comedians like Bill Burr and Dave Chappelle were recently criticized for attending the Riyadh Comedy Festival.</p> <p>“From the folks that brought you 9/11,” quipped <em>WTF</em> podcast host Marc Maron <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO9RDQ0ks4P/?hl=en">last week</a>. “Two weeks of laughter in the desert, don’t miss it! The same guy that’s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f***ing suitcase. But don’t let that stop the yucks, it’s gonna be a good time!”</p> <p>The full press release is below:</p> <blockquote><p>Under the terms of the agreement, the Consortium will acquire 100% of EA, with PIF rolling over its existing 9.9% stake in the Company. EA stockholders will receive $210 per share in cash. The per share purchase price represents a 25% premium to EA’s unaffected share price of $168.32 at market close on September 25, 2025, the last fully unaffected trading day, and a premium to EA’s unaffected all-time high of $179.01 at market close on August 14, 2025.</p> <p>PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners bring deep sector experience, committed capital, and global portfolios with networks across gaming, entertainment, and sports that offer unique possibilities for EA to blend physical and digital experiences, enhance fan engagement, and create new growth opportunities. The transaction represents the largest all-cash sponsor take-private investment in history, with the Consortium partnering closely with EA to enable the Company to move faster and unlock new opportunities on a global stage.</p> <p>“Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work,” said Andrew Wilson, Chairman &amp; CEO of Electronic Arts. “Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building.”</p> <p>“PIF is uniquely positioned in the global gaming and esports sectors, building and supporting ecosystems that connect fans, developers, and IP creators,” said Turqi Alnowaiser, Deputy Governor and Head of International Investments at PIF. “PIF has demonstrated a strong commitment to these sectors, and this partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale.”</p> <p>“This investment embodies Silver Lake’s mission to partner with exceptional management teams at the highest quality companies. EA is a special company: a global leader in interactive entertainment, anchored by its premier sports franchise, with accelerating revenue growth and strong and scaling free cash flow. We are honored to invest and partner with Andrew – an extraordinary CEO who has doubled revenue, nearly tripled EBITDA, and driven a fivefold increase in market cap during his tenure,” said Egon Durban, Co-CEO and Managing Partner of Silver Lake. “The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations.”</p> <p>“Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future. ​I’ve admired their ​ability to create iconic, lasting experiences, ​and ​as ​someone ​who ​grew up playing their ​games ​- and now enjoys them with his ​kids – I couldn’t be ​more ​excited about ​what’s ​ahead,” said Jared Kushner, Chief Executive Officer of Affinity Partners.</p> <p>“The Board carefully evaluated this opportunity and concluded it delivers compelling value for stockholders and is in the best interests of all stakeholders,” said Luis A. Ubiñas, Lead Independent Director of EA’s Board of Directors. “We are pleased that this transaction delivers immediate and certain cash value to our stockholders while strengthening EA’s ability to continue building the communities and experiences that define the future of entertainment.”</p> <p><b>Transaction Details</b></p> <p>The transaction was approved by EA’s Board of Directors, is expected to close in Q1 FY27 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals and approval by EA stockholders. Following the close of the transaction, EA’s common stock will no longer be listed on any public market.</p> <p>The transaction will be funded by a combination of cash from each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners as well as roll-over of PIF’s existing stake in EA, constituting an equity investment of approximately $36 billion, and $20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close. Each of PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners plan to fund the equity component of the financing entirely from capital under their respective control.</p> <p>Upon completion of the transaction, EA will remain headquartered in Redwood City, California and continue to be led by Andrew Wilson as CEO.</p></blockquote>

They are made."</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly a year after its debut in Poland, Andrzej Sapkowski's latest Witcher novel, Crossroads of Ravens, finally arrives in English this week. Amazon is currently selling it for <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjAwy?object_uuid=9c107776-76db-4695-84a2-6e134a786c12&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$24.50 in the US</a> (18% off the $30 MSRP) and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOg4B7?object_uuid=9c107776-76db-4695-84a2-6e134a786c12&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">£19.99 in the UK</a> (20% off the £20 RRP).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossroads of Ravens is a new standalone prequel novel in The Witcher saga.

Sapkowski frames this as the story of “how legends are made, and what they cost.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It makes sense for this new tale to look back rather than push forward. Geralt’s arc already reaches a definitive conclusion in the main saga, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/15-the-witcher-anniversary-cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt games</a> have effectively carried the timeline on in their own way, set just a few years after the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">books</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, while Sapkowski’s novels remain the bedrock of the series, The Witcher has long since grown into something much bigger.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War 4</a> got a new gameplay trailer over the weekend, and while excitement continues generally for the upcoming real-time strategy game, the video has sparked a number of complaints from some within the Warhammer 40,000 community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the voice acting, which some are saying sounds flat. The complaints here stem from comparisons to Relic’s much-loved Dawn of War, which came out in 2004. Based on the new video, the chatter from the Space Marines especially doesn’t have enough oomph, and lacks the metallic ‘vox’ texture the Space Marines usually have when speaking through their helmets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My best guess here is that the developers at King Art Games needed the Space Marines to sound sufficiently different to the Adeptus Mechanics, one of Dawn of War 4’s brand new factions. The Ad Mech are the fanatical worshippers of the Machine God of Mars, tech priests who have discarded their humanity in favor of cybernetics. Their voices have that metallic vox-ness to them by default, which may have forced King Art’s hand when it came to the Space Marines' audio. After all, on chaotic battlefield, the player needs to know which faction is saying what.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Here’s your official look into the next evolution of the iconic real-time strategy franchise with Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV!</p><p>First revealed during PC Gaming Show: Tokyo Direct, this new trailer has been captured entirely from in-engine gameplay.<a href="https://t.co/Tdy6sZQTof" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Tdy6sZQTof</a> <a href="https://t.co/SJGiQWy6g3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/SJGiQWy6g3</a></p></div>— Dawn of War IV (@PlayDoW4) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayDoW4/status/1972347455808393305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 28, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Voices for Space Marines aren't good, compared to DOW1 or DOW2,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngpg480/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said the wonderfully named redditor KillerKanka</a>. “You know it's missing that ZEAL, the mechanical filter, the ‘COME. SHOW ME WHAT PASSES FOR FURY AMONG YOUR MISBEGOTTEN KIND’ or ‘SPESS MEHRINESS ATTAAAAACK’ or ‘STRIKE FROM THE SKIES, BROTHERS.’ It's much easier to correct, tho, but still.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Looks promising, but please fix the Space Marine voice acting,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dawnofwar/comments/1nst8b0/comment/ngrk15a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ImSorryOkGeez</a>. “That dude does not sound like he is ready to burn heretics, kill mutants, or purge the unclean.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the Orks in Dawn of War 4, the voice work we hear in the video is nowhere near as over-the-top cockney as Warhammer 40,000 Orks traditionally sound, and indeed how they sound in Dawn of War 1. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s a growing row about the inclusion of Primaris Marines, which, well, if you’re not in the weeds on Warhammer 40,000, this one may prove to be a head-scratcher.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstborn” Space Marines, as they’re known, were essentially replaced within the setting by Primaris Marines. They’re bigger, tougher, stronger, and faster than the OGs, but some within the fandom absolutely hate them for their softer redesign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot to unpack here, but essentially this debate about the Primaris Marines boils down to a feeling that Games Workshop has “toned down” the Space Marines over the years so that they look a little less like the religious fanatics the lore suggests they are, and more like the poster boys Warhammer 40,000 needs to attract new fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War, which came out over 20 years ago now, leaned into the Warhammer 40,000 of that time, and so its Blood Ravens (the Space Marines chapter at the heart of the Dawn of War games) delivered on that fanaticism. Dawn of War was based on Warhammer 40,000 4th Edition (we’re now on the 10th), and so the Astra Militarum were called the Imperial Guard, the Aeldari were called the Eldar, and the Necrons didn’t speak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4, due out 2026, was always going to have a different feel in keeping with the Warhammer 40,000 of today, the grimdark far future we see in Amazon animations, in video games like the record-breaking Space Marine 2, and perhaps (hopefully!) in Henry Cavill’s Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe. Dawn of War 4 was always going to feature Primaris Marines, which have been the default Space Marines for almost a decade now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not surprised by complaints around the voice work, which probably could do with a shot in the arm, or the complaints about the Primaris Marines (this is an ongoing complaint about all things Space Marines). The Warhammer 40,000 fandom, perhaps more than any other, is big on tradition. But I am surprised to see complaints about the game’s visuals, which I think look pretty detailed. King Art has spoken about going hard on sync kills, which Dawn of War 1 was famous for, and we see those in action here. Some are saying Dawn of War 4 looks too colorful, but to me it looks fine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are more extreme reactions online, some of which compare Dawn of War 4 to the critical and commercial flop that was Dawn of War 3. It’s impossible to make such a comparison based on what we’ve seen of Dawn of War 4 so far, and King Art has made it clear from the start that it’s using Dawn of War 1 as its reference point for the game with base building and big armies the focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, with each new video, Warhammer 40,000 fans will continue to have their say on Dawn of War 4, right up until launch and beyond. Heresy is at the heart of the Imperium, and so perhaps King Art knew full well it was going to have to deal with a healthy dose itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-nearing-50-billion-deal-with-saudi-arabia-and-other-investors-to-go-private-report/1100-6535057/" data-ref-id="1100-6535057">rumors</a> were true: Electronic Arts has announced that it's sold itself in a $55 billion deal. EA sold itself to an "investor consortium" made up of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake.</p><p>EA said the all-cash deal "positions EA to accelerate innovation and growth to build the future of entertainment." EA CEO Andrew Wilson is still on board as CEO.</p><p>The investor consortium will take over 100% of EA. The PIF already had a 9.9% stake in EA prior to this deal.</p><p>It's a good day for EA stockholders, too, as they are getting $210 per share in cash as part of the deal--that's a significant premium over what the stock was trading for last week.</p><p>"Our creative and passionate teams at EA have delivered extraordinary experiences for hundreds of millions of fans, built some of the world’s most iconic IP, and created significant value for our business. This moment is a powerful recognition of their remarkable work," Wilson said. "Looking ahead, we will continue to push the boundaries of entertainment, sports, and technology, unlocking new opportunities. Together with our partners, we will create transformative experiences to inspire generations to come. I am more energized than ever about the future we are building."</p><p>PIF's Turqi Alnowaiser said, "This partnership will help further drive EA’s long-term growth, while fueling innovation within the industry on a global scale."</p><p>Affinity's Egon Durban shared an enthusiastic quote, too. He said, "The future for EA is bright, we are going to invest heavily to grow the business, and we are excited to support Andrew and the EA team as the company accelerates innovation, expands its reach worldwide, and continues to deliver incredible experiences to players and fans across generations."</p><p>As for Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law said, "Electronic Arts ​is ​an ​extraordinary ​company with a ​world-class ​management ​team and a bold vision ​for ​the ​future."</p><p>The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wide range of human rights violations</a>. The PIF, through its Savvy Games Group, has invested in or acquired numerous gaming companies over the years. Before EA, Savvy bought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Pokemon Go developer Niantic's gaming division for $3.5 billion</a>.

The biggest gaming buyout ever was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">Microsoft's $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</a></p>

            <p>May Horace save and protect you, my fellow Metamedia Sorcerers, for I come with bad tidings. We are entering a news-lull. While there are some curious, possibly even attention-worthy PC games out this week, none of them are Big. None of them have that triple, quadruple or possibly even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-boss-calls-gta-6-an-aaaaa-game-in-latest-attack-on-human-dignity">quintuple-A bullshit frosting</a> the Maw so delights to batten upon. Last week gave us Tokyo Game Show, a time of relative bounty, but this week, there is a dearth of obvious headline material, and the Creature is already showing signs of discontent.</p>
<p>Its guts stiffen and strain like paralysed icebreakers. Its eyes widen in every mirror. How could it get worse? Oh hell's teeth, I've run out of coffee. We're doomed! Rohan has deserted us! Theoden has betrayed me! Abandon your posts! Flee, flee for your lives!
</p><!--more-->
<p>I don't have a Gandalf to stride in here, whack me with a staff and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=267nNfzyL5E">rally the troops</a>. James would have played the part, I'm sure, but he's not in today. Perhaps he's out buying coffee. Please let that be the case. Also, please let somebody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">buy EA or equivalent</a> so that we have a chunky morsel to appease the beast, before it ruptures the continuum and turns Mars into Belgium again. Casting my gaze wildly at the events calendar, I see only the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/events?year=2025">GamesIndustry.biz HR Summit 2025</a> on 2nd October. I can't feed HR people to the Maw! After all, they're vitally needed for approving my holidays. Please, let somebody post a link to something straightforwardly huge in the comments. While you scrape around for ideas, here's the latest new game round-up.
</p>
<h2>Monday 29th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3862550/Bonapartes_Bluff/">Boneparte's Bluff</a> is a free and simple-looking abstract strategy game in which the pieces lie to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tuesday 30th September</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</a> is a revamp of the venerable PS1 strategy RPG. Dom over at Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review">says it's pretty good</a>.</li>
<li>It seems likely you're in the mood for xenomorphs, after Alien: Earth, so maybe cock a squint at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>'s Evolved Edition (pictured), the new headset-free version of a VR horror game that is apparently a bit mid.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1969370/LEGO_Party/">LEGO Party!</a> is a four-player minigame bonanza with an unnecessary and frankly condescending exclamation mark. People should know well enough to supply their own dang exclamation marks when they play "party" games.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Wednesday 1st October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690460/FLICK_SOLITAIRE/">Flick Solitaire</a> is a solo card game with a lot of decks from different artists. It's free-to-play and launching in early access. There are in-app purchases and season passes, but "all core gameplay, collecting decks, and completing them can be experienced for free". A suspicious CTRL+F of the Steam page reveals no mention of NFTs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thursday 2nd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">Éalú</a> is an atmospheric puzzler with hand-made, stop-motion animations. It's about a wooden mouse trying to escape a maze.</li>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/">Digimon Story Time Stranger</a> is a monster-taming RPG about those collectible creatures who aren't Pokemon and also aren't currently being sued for trying to be Pokemon.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Friday 3rd October</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3386900/Castle_of_Heart_Retold/">Castle Of Heart: Retold</a> is a prettied-up version of a lush Slavic side-scroller in which a knight must continuously murder vodniks to stop his body turning to stone.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's your cue. Fill me in on any important breaking news, or major games releases not mentioned here. Please, I beg of you. I'm literally writing this from inside the Mawmouth, peering out at you through a forest of quantum strings as thick as baleen. It smells awful in here. I'm sitting on a rancid chunk of Borderlands DLC, attempting to wipe the kaiju dribble off my laptop screen. Time to test out this Boneparte Bluff game, I guess, while Mark embarks on an emergency expedition to locate any massive standalone mods we've forgotten about.</p>

Now, EA and Battlefield Studios appear to be poking fun at Call of Duty with a live-action Battlefield 6 trailer that introduces some celebrities soldiers before ruthlessly dispatching them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EunkRPRzECg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EunkRPRzECg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett play themselves as the warriors who prove to be expendable in more ways than one. This video appears to be a callback to Call of Duty's "There's A Soldier In All Of Us" series of trailers that featured all manner of celebrities, including Sam Worthington, Jonah Hill, and Dwight Howard. The celebrities operators had a much easier time in that video than they did with Battlefield 6's urban chaos and destructible locations.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has already had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-new-campaign-trailer-featuring-tons-of-explosions-during-state-of-play/1100-6534997/" data-ref-id="1100-6534997">a launch trailer for its campaign</a>, which highlighted the extent that bringing down buildings can reshape the game. Another trailer put the spotlight on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-what-battlefield-6s-portal-mode-can-let-you-create-in-wild-new-trailer/1100-6535026/" data-ref-id="1100-6535026">Battlefield 6's Portal mode</a>. That's the part of the game that puts tools in the hands of players and lets them create customized maps that inject more chaos into the battles.</p><p>DICE boss Rebecka Coutaz recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-felt-an-obligation-to-make-a-better-game-after-2042-stumbled/1100-6534972/" data-ref-id="1100-6534972">she felt an obligation</a> to deliver a greatly improved incarnation of Battlefield following the disappointing response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>. GameSpot has shared its<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-story-campaign-lets-you-have-fun-with-destruction-when-it-wants-to/1100-6534987/" data-ref-id="1100-6534987"> first impressions of the game</a>, following a hands-on preview.

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>-inspired retro RPG Threads of Time has received a new gameplay trailer, showing off more of its time-travelling narrative.</p>
<p>From Canadian developer Riyo Games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-revealed-rpg-threads-of-time-will-compete-with-sea-of-stars-as-chrono-trigger-spiritual-successor">Threads of Time was first revealed at last year's Tokyo Game Show</a>. Now, a year later, this new trailer was shown at the PC Gaming Show Tokyo Direct and it looks to be progressing nicely.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic classic, Threads of Time will take place across a number of time periods, from prehistory to a cyberpunk future, and is presented similarly to the Octopath Traveller HD-2D aesthetic.</p>

<p>One minute the adventurers are strolling through a bustling medieval town and battling the sort of fluffy or botanical creatures you'd typically expect in an RPG; the next they're exploring sci-fi facilities and a rain-soaked futuristic metropolis with flying cars overhead.</p>
<p>There are some beautiful animated scenes chopped in too, though I hope the character designs don't lean too heavily on Chrono Trigger nostalgia - I'm looking at you, robot.</p>
<p>What's really struck me, though, is the look of the battles. These are turn-based, but have a strong sense of depth with a perspective sitting between Octopath and Dragon Quest as characters fight across the foreground and background with some evocative environments.</p>

<p>There's no release date yet, though presumably it's set for release on PC.</p>
<p>It's also well-timed, following the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> from fellow Canadian studio Sabotage as another Chrono Trigger-inspired retro RPG. That game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-stars-clockwork-dlc-will-release-later-this-month">DLC Throes of the Watchmaker was recently released</a>, if you need an excuse to return.</p>
<p>What's more, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">Square Enix is this year celebrating the 30th anniversary of Chrono Trigger</a> and promised various projects would be released, sparking hope for some form of remake or remaster.</p>
<p>It's still unclear what's happening there, even as fans cry out for a re-release on current hardware. Until then, Threads of Time could well fill the gap.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s been many times where I’ve uttered the words “this is the weirdest game I’ve ever seen.” It happened when I first played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-review/">Shadow of the Colossus</a> as I rode a horse across empty plains, unbothered by enemies as I approached a giant, moving, climbing puzzle. It happened when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/10/superliminal-review-ps4-xbox-switch/">Superliminal</a> twisted my mind into confusing shapes as I tried to understand its perspective-based puzzles. It even happened when I saw a trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/17/genital-jousting-is-a-wonderfully-silly-looking-game-and-a-bit-nsfw/">Genital Jousting</a>. Now it’s happened for possible the final time. Why? Because Blippo+ is the weirdest game I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="Blippo+ | Switch and Steam Release Date Trailer | Coming Sept 23rd" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f69DgOfBCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technically speaking, Blippo+ isn’t even a traditional game. It’s more of a 90s television simulator… now in colour! There’s no on-demand streaming here, it’s a programme guide complete with multiple TV channels to switch between. After the original “1-bit” release in black and white on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playdate/">Playdate</a>, this PC and Switch version now brings more of an analogue TV aesthetic, right down to the artifacting and fuzzy video quality. And I do mean video quality, as it’s live action video of actual actors doing actual acting, but it’s all unerringly presented in the style of television from three decades ago. It’s actually incredibly impressive how perfectly they’ve nailed this aesthetic – using Blippo+ is basically indistinguishable from actual television back then, right down to scanning for channels.</p>


<p>Well, almost. You won’t find reruns of Friends, Fresh Prince or Star Trek Voyager here, because this is television from another planet, called Planet Blip. This is explained through the TV shows themselves, with one news segment explaining that a planet somewhere off in space seems to have activated devices called PeeDees that can receive the television signal from Planet Blip due to a fold in space. A PeeDee is apparently a smartphone-type device that is ubiquitous on Blip. It took a moment for me to realise that the planet they were referring to was Earth, and that my/our playing of this game is a part of its story. I am not sure if I mentioned this yet, but Blippo+ is weird.</p>


<p>Planet Blip seems to be caught in some kind of sci-fi 90s fashion vortex, with everyone having era appropriate clothing, makeup, and hairstyles… if they were appearing in Doctor Who. The TV shows are, if anything, weirder than you’re expecting. One show is a cooking show that shows you how to prepare alien fruit, complete with a cooking show voiceover explaining what to do and some good alien fruit props. Another is a scientist who can revive people from their DNA and is using it to conduct interviews that are a bit insulting, but very unsympathetic to the horrors of suddenly being revived long after your own death. Bushwalker is a first person view of walking through the great outdoors, with two hands holding a knife and a wooden axe moving at the sides of the screen. Then there’s Tantric Computing, which is on the “porn” channel which is all scrambled, but images keep making it through of a keyboard being softly stroked, a cable being inserted, or a (computer) mouse being handled whilst soft moans play in the background.</p>
<p>It’s just about the most surreal thing I’ve ever experienced. Hundreds of people worked on this – writers, actors, graphic designers, musicians, editors – and it’s a stunningly odd achievement. I do believe they’ve nailed what they wanted to do, from the aesthetic, to the vaguely self aware nature of the performances, the creativity on show, it all seems pretty much perfect for the niche I have to assume this is aimed at: drama kids, weirdos like me that watch too much Dropout TV, and fans of shows with rich veins of overly meta humour.</p>

<p>The problem is, I imagine for a general audience it all kind of blends together after a while. It’s pretty hit and miss at the best of times, but the constant stream of irreverent weirdness means it lacks the variety to keep me actually engaged. If some channels did things that took themselves seriously, others did comedy stuff, other did chat shows, there would be stuff to switch between. Back when linear TV was still the norm in my life, I wouldn’t channel surf to find things of the exact same tone as what I was already watching, I’d be looking for something different. That’s the whole point of changing the channel. Here you just hop from weird to weird, so the novelty of that runs out far too quickly. If some of the programming took itself more seriously, at least in the way that something like Tommy Wiseau’s The Room does, then the variety would go a long way.</p>
<p>For understandable reasons, the programmes themselves are all very short as well, perhaps up to a minute long. This makes sense, but it also limits their depth and impact – they’re over so quickly that they become transient, there’s no ads or pauses between them to leave a moment to sit with the end of a show and react to it. Of course, the constant barrage of advertisements are a scourge on humanity, but at least in the olden days when the younger generations still watched live TV they did provide a pause to reflect on what you’ve just seen, react to it, discuss it, or at least go to make a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Kickstarter goal smashed</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Accessory maker Retro Fighters has smashed its newest <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/brawler64-pro-series-n64-wireless-controller">Kickstarter campaign</a> for the <strong>Brawler64 Pro Series Edition</strong>. A mouthful, to be sure, but the pad itself actually looks pretty neat.</p>
<p>With compatibility confirmed for the Switch and Switch 2 alongside the original N64, the new Brawler64 Pro (we'll just leave it at that going forward) features Hall Effect joysticks, a tactile d-pad with Kailh switches, back buttons (which you can lock if you wish), adjustable vibration, and magnetic customisable faceplates (which, we should note, is currently locked behind the $50K stretch goal).</p>
<p>The pads themselves will come in six colours, including Classic Gray, Watermelon, Extreme Green, Turquoise, Atomic Purple, and Smoke Black. With the added faceplates, however, you'll be able to mix and match your favourite colour combinations whenever you wish.</p>
<p>It's a nice little upgrade to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2019/06/hardware_review_retro_fighters_brawler64_controller_-_a_crowdfunded_upgrade_to_your_battered_original">original Brawler64</a> and should prove to be a competent competitor against <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/64-controller/">8BitDo's Analogue 64 controller</a>.</p>
<p>There are still about two weeks to go until the Kickstarter ends for the Brawler64 Pro, so if you're keen on grabbing one of these, you can grab one for <strong>£47 / $63</strong>. Additional pledge tiers are also available if you're looking to purchase multiple controllers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-combat-evolved-remake-is-rumored-to-use-ue5-and-blam-engine-add-gameplay-tweaks.1311280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-2026-release-campaign-only/">supposedly launching next year</a> is reportedly going to use a hybrid engine setup with Unreal Engine 5 and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine, as well as modern gameplay features and tweaked level design.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RebsGaming"> Rebs Gaming</a>, who proved their reliability in the past by reporting correct information before official announcements, such as the launch date for Halo Infinite multiplayer component, reported some new details on the rumored remake, relied by an unnamed source who received it from a developer who works for a co-development studio which has previously worked with 343 Industries on the Halo: The Master Chief Collection and is now handling a lot of the remake's core development.</p>



<p>According to the new information, the current Halo Combat Evolved remake build features sprinting, which is not available in the original. Although the introduction of a modern FPS gameplay mechanic can be divisive, its inclusion would be hardly surprising, considering series co-creator Marcus Lehto talked about more contemporary core mechanics that improve gameplay among features of a potential remake that would enhance the original experience. Regarding gameplay, the remake is said to feature tweaked level design for maps like The Library.</p>



<p>The rumored Halo Combat Evolved remake will also reportedly be powered by two engines like this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, using Unreal Engine 5 for rendering, and a modified version of Halo Reach's Blam engine for gameplay logic and world systems. This setup would ensure modern visuals and faithful gameplay, although using UE5 for graphics could lead to performance issues, as we have seen time and time again in way too many games released in the past few months, especially if <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-performance-issues-caused-development-process/">optimization work is not done properly, as suggested by Epic CEO last month</a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Rebs Gaming has proved to be reliable in the past, we have to take the new information, and even the development of a Halo Combat Evolved remake, with a grain of salt. Thankfully, it shouldn't take much longer to learn if the game is really in development, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">Halo Studios will reveal the future of the series at HaloWC 2025 next month.</a></p>

            <p>It's been over half a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-next-patch-come-with-first-bits-dlc-team-folon-celebrates-becoming-registered-business">announced that it'd be getting three bits of DLC</a> adding new quests to post-apocalyptic Blighty. The folks behind the massive mod have been relatively quiet in that time, but they've now confirmed that the first of these DLCs, Rabbit and Pork, will require you to start a fresh save game.</p>
<p>Also, one reason it hasn't arrived already is that the team have been working to ensure other quest add-ons won't force you to go back to square one, whenever they drop.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This DLC is a DLC in name only really, it adds in a lot of fixes and some cut/new content," Fallout: London project lead Dean ‘Prilladog’ Carter wrote on Team FOLON's<a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1233281020376252417/1421047996292005960">Discord server</a> over the weekend, in response to a user asking if they'd have to start over again when the DLC arrives. "So, it'll require a new save. One of the reasons it's also [taken] so long was ensuring any future groundwork for other quests in other DLCs won't require the new game save."</p>
<p>A fresh save being mandatory for at least the first of the three Fallout: London DLCs isn't a huge surprise. Since the mod first started getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">updates and patches to fix bugs</a> last year, Team FOLON's advice for the best experience has been to start a new game each time a new version arrives, with carrying on from an established one being doable, but potentially leading you to run into "compatibility issues".</p><p>The possibility of messing with saves was what led the modders to roll Fallout: London's bug-fixing version 1.03 patch, originally teased late last year, into this upcoming first DLC. Given that, it's really encouraging to hear the modders have been working on ways to minimise the impact future updates'll have in this regard, since starting over in such a huge game every time it gets updated is far from ideal.</p>
<p>As for what you can expect from this first DLC, Rabbit and Pork, Team FOLON's 2D art lead Emily ‘Saffron-rice’ Kemp wrote in a Discord exchange with another fan immediately following Carter's that DLC number one will include "various new side quests of different sizes, but no main quest content".</p>
<p>We do know that extra main questing will be coming in Fallout: London's third DLC, Wildcard, which looks to be the final one the modders have planned at the moment. As Carter <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">revealed in an interview with me for my old home</a> last year, that DLC'll add in a whole New Vegas-style wild card arc for the game's main quest, which'll let you decide the fate of London without having to side with the three established main quest factions: Angel, Camelot, and the Fifth Column. This questline was originally intended to be in the base game, but had to be cut after the modder taking the lead on it was, in Carter's words, "basically forcibly conscripted" into the conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>That leaves the second DLC, Last Orders, which very much looks pub-themed based on its name and the accompanying art. I'll be keen to give each of them a go, and all the better if I can get away without starting fresh three or four times in the process.</p>

<p>That's according to a handful of fans who were lucky enough to attend <a href="https://zurichpopcon.ch/en">Zurich Pop Con</a> over the weekend, where Nintendo of Europe held a pretty sizeable booth. The NoE Switch 2 area was home to all of the banners we're used to seeing at these kinds of events (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, you get the picture), but it also housed a display featuring <em>five</em> different LEGO games, all under the S2 logo.</p>
<p>As showcased on <a href="https://x.com/LEGOGameMuseum/status/1971875743866277955">Twitter</a> by <a href="https://x.com/LEGOGameMuseum" tabindex="-1">@LEGOGameMuseum</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_city_undercover">LEGO City: Undercover</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_star_wars_the_skywalker_saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_harry_potter_collection">LEGO Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_dc_super-villains">LEGO DC Super-Villains</a> all featured on the Switch 2 banner. Importantly, none of these have been officially given Switch 2 Edition releases... <em>yet</em>.</p>

<p>A blurred banner photo is far from a hard fact, but <a href="https://x.com/LegoGamesNews" tabindex="-1">@LegoGamesNews</a> has been sharing <a href="https://x.com/LegoGamesNews/status/1971997217948160071">other images</a> of the marketing from different angles, and it sure seems to be the real deal.</p>
<p>Of course, we'll still be treating everything with a pinch of salt until LEGO and TT Games make it official. This wouldn't be the first piece of Switch 2 marketing with incorrect info on it — we're looking at you, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Prime 4</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-ad-claims-metroid-prime-4-is-out-now">'Out Now' poster</a> — but it's an exciting concept all the same. Heck, any excuse to replay The Skywalker Saga is a welcome one, if you ask us.</p>
<p>Until we hear any official word on this, the Switch 2's first franchise LEGO game is set to launch next year when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> swoops our way at some point in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game developers have often criticized the Xbox Series S for its lower specifications, which made ports troublesome, but there have also been a few voices claiming the contrary. Recently, Ripple Effect <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Battlefield 6 was better optimized due to the development team's work to optimize the game for Microsoft's less expensive Xbox console.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with Windows Central</a>, Square Enix's programmer and director Naoki Hamaguchi has now said that the Xbox Series S has solid specs and his team did not encounter many issues with the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade port, except for the memory (the Series S has only 10GB of RAM).</p>



<p><em>In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec. We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related. Optimization is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gained Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this month, Square Enix <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade port is coming to Xbox Series S and X as well as Nintendo Switch 2 on January 22, 2026. They also added that the whole trilogy will eventually be available on all main platforms (including PlayStation 5 and PC, of course). We don't know yet when Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will launch on Xbox and Nintendo Switch 2. We also do not know whether the third chapter in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy will launch simultaneously for all these consoles or still as a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive, as was the case with the first two installments.</p>

IGN has contacted Epic Games for comment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In general, fan response to the emote being pulled has been mixed, with some acknowledging the potential for the "Nazi emote," as it's been dubbed, to subsequently be misused by players to grief others. Others, however, have questioned why Epic Games has acted here but not in other similar situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, Fortnite recently raised eyebrows by adding the Tylil Dance, an emote collaboration with rapper Kai Cenat which features music by Kanye West. West, who now refers to himself as Ye, previously made numerous comments deemed to be anti-semitic and in 2022 said he identified as "a Nazi." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In another example, Fortnite has notably shied away from reselling an in-game skin, Rue, whose costume players widely likened to the design of a Nazi uniform.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new PlayStation 5 CFI-2100 model <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-revision-amazon/">released in Europe this month</a> may have a smaller SSD, but it introduces some welcome improvements, including one for a well-known <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">critical liquid metal cooling issue that has damaged plenty of systems already.</a></p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@austinevans">Austin Evans</a> takes a good look at the new hardware revision of Sony's current generation console, highlighting some changes over the previous models besides the inclusion of an 825 GB SSD over the 1 TB SSD of previous version of the system, which is a considerable downgrade for the Digital Edition of the system considering how much storage space games require nowadays.</p>



<p>The first notable change is purely aesthetic. The design of the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision remains identical to the current Slim design, but without the glossy finish. Although minimal, some may prefer this look, which is more in line with the launch models regarding the faceplates.</p>



<p>Every other change over the previous model is internal. Among the most notable changes are the inclusion of more NAND modules, three over the two of the earlier models, and ridges for the liquid metal cooling solution like those seen in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">PlayStation 5 Pro. </a></p>



<p>This addition is extremely welcome, as without those ridges, liquid metal can drip down if the console is placed vertically, causing dry spots on the APU, which can heavily compromise its functionality. Despite having had my launch model vertically since day one, I never had any of these issues as others did, so not every older model is affected by this problem. Still, these ridges are welcome additions that should ensure these systems stay functional longer.</p>



<p>The above changes are only some the new PlayStation 5 hardware revision offers. You can learn more about the reduced weight of the system and its better efficiency in the full teardown below.</p>

<p>The new base PlayStation 5 hardware revision, whose release in the United States is still uncertain, is reportedly being followed by a PlayStation 5 Pro revision. Little is known about this new model, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">changes are expected to be minimal.</a></p>

            <p><strong>Update</strong>: Well, that escalated quickly. Following rumours over the weekend, EA have confirmed that an investor consortium consisting of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners have acquired the Battlefield 6 publisher in an all-cash transaction that values EA at around $55 billion. The consortium will buy 100% of EA and take it private, with the PIF rolling in their existing 9.9% stake in the publisher.
</p>
<p>EA have put out <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/EA-Announces-Agreement-to-be-Acquired-by-PIF-Silver-Lake-and-Affinity-Partners-for-55-Billion/default.aspx">a press release</a> featuring various hyperbolic remarks from the likes of EA CEO Andrew Wilson, who will stay on in his position. EA will also continue to be based in Redwood City, California. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2027 - in other words, at some point between January and March, once it has been granted the usual regulatory approvals and voted through by EA's shareholders. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>According to the press release, the transaction constitutes "an equity investment of approximately $36 billion" from PIF, Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, plus "$20 billion of debt financing fully and solely committed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., $18 billion of which is expected to be funded at close". 
</p>
<p>So there you have it: one of the oldest North American videogame household names still kicking, now privately owned after three decades on the market. The press release doesn't, as you're probably expecting, discuss how this might affect ordinary EA employees and subsidiary developers, or address any concerns they might have about their workplace being co-owned by Saudi Arabia's investment wing. For more on that, read this morning's initial reporting on rumours of the acquisition, below.
</p>
<p><em>Original story from 29th September follows:</em></p>
<p>Battlefield, EA Sports FC and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> publishers Electronic Arts are holding "advanced talks" to go private with a valuation of $50 billion after 35 years as a public company, according to reports this weekend.
</p>
<p>If rumour breathe true, the buyers are a group of investors that include private equity firm Silver Lake, Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, and Affinity Partners, the Saudi-backed investment firm founded by Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
</p>
<p>The report comes via the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">Wall Street Journal</a> (paywall) and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/electronic-arts-nears-roughly-50-billion-deal-go-private-wsj-reports-2025-09-26/">Reuters</a>, the latter of whom cite "sources familiar with the matter". They claim that if the deal goes through, it could happen this week.
</p>
<p><em>If</em> the deal does happen, it will mean that BioWare, Criterion Games, DICE, Motive Studio, and Respawn Entertainment are now partly overseen by the investment arm of a state that oppresses women and queer people, executes journalists and imprisons political dissenters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> developers may find the prospect especially unwelcome, given the focus their games place on diverse casts.
</p>

</figure>
<p>Reuters frame the investments as part of Saudi Arabia's "Vision 2030" strategy to diversify the Kingdom's heavily oil-reliant economy. The PIF were rumoured to be discussing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracers-collapsed-2bn-deal-reportedly-with-saudi-arabia-funded-savvy-games">a $2 billion investment deal</a> via their subsidiary Savvy Games with the infamously acquisition-happy Embracer Group some years ago. These talks reportedly fell through in May 2023, triggering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">a brutal period of mass layoffs and cancellations</a>. 
</p>
<p>More recently, the PIF acquired Scopely, US publishers of licensed games like Marvel Strike Force and the current developers of Pokemon Go. They have also funded the creation of a new Assassin's Creed: Mirage DLC pack set in the historic city of AlUla, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisofts-deal-with-saudi-arabia-over-free-assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-has-reportedly-seen-staff-pushback">prompting internal criticism from Ubisoft developers</a>.
</p><p>In addition to investing in games publishers, the PIF have poured a lot of money into esports, acquiring companies and hosting tournaments in what has been widely styled a case of 'sportswashing' <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">the Kingdom's abysmal human rights record</a>. Earlier this month, the Public Investment Fund-backed company Qiddiya <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saudi-government-backed-firm-and-giga-project-now-co-owns-fighting-game-tournament-evo">became co-owner of fighting game tournament Evo</a>. Savvy Games already own ESL FACEIT Group, a merger of two esports organisers, who are organising next year's much-trumpeted Esports World Cup in Riyadh.
</p>
<p>As for the other two investment groups who are allegedly party to the EA deal, Silver Lake are a 1999-founded firm who once owned Skype, and who have also sunk a few doubloons into game engine company Unity and PC manufacturer Dell. Affinity Partners were founded by Kushner in 2021, and have received billions from the PIF, with Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman personally intervening to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/10/us/jared-kushner-saudi-investment-fund.html">push the investment through</a>. Kushner is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/kushner-has-discussed-us-saudi-diplomacy-with-saudi-crown-prince-2024-10-04/">the subject of scrutiny</a> as to whether his Saudi partnerships have influenced his work in the US government.</p>
<p>The rumoured EA buyout would continue the past decade's consolidation of game developers and publishers in the hands of a select few megacorporations. Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">completed their acquisition of Activision-Blizzard last year</a>, adding Call of Duty, Diablo and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/candy-crush-saga">Candy Crush Saga</a> to the Xbox haggis. The world's largest videogame publisher, Tencent, have scooped up big outfits like Riot Games, Sumo Group and Funcom, while acquiring majority stakes or sizeable minority shares in the likes of Epic, Krafton and Paradox Interactive. Tencent recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">funnelled a huge reservoir of money into Ubisoft</a> as part of the latter's wider corporate restructuring to focus on Assassin's Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six.
</p>
<p>EA have <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ea-sports-apex-legends-sales-electronic-arts-earnings-1236473474/">seen "better-than-expected" revenue growth</a> lately, but they've had some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">significant disappointments</a> in the past year or two, and are currently betting rather a lot on Battlefield 6, with executives allegedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late">hell-bent on attracting 100 million players</a>. Whatever their current fortunes, it seems plausible that layoffs will follow any buyout, as the new overlords seek to 'optimise' their investment.
</p>
<p>I'll wire EA a request for comment.</p>
