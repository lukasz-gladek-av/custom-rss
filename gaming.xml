            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Millions of digital horses were clad in armour on April 3, 2006. The survivors of this phenomenon called this downloadable content purchase a “microtransaction.” They lived only to face new nightmares: season passes, live service models, always-online single-player, loot boxes, pay-to-win, ship-now-fix-later patches, and more. Make no mistake, the team at Terminator 2D: No Fate developer Bitmap Bureau has seen this future, and they clearly don’t like it. As such, Terminator 2D is an unapologetically nostalgic sidescroller, specifically designed to send players directly back to the 16-bit era of the ’90s to experience the greatest T2 game we never played. Exceedingly short by modern standards but brimming with love for James Cameron’s indisputable sci-fi classic, Terminator 2D is part time machine, part uncommonly terrific movie tie-in. In an insane world, it’s the sanest choice.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Terminator 2D’s main story mode – which follows the events of T2, with a few expanded diversions – takes roughly an hour to complete successfully. However, it took me a few runs to actually achieve this. Admittedly, this is incredibly short by contemporary standards – but it’s nonetheless authentic to an era where a game’s perceived girth was significantly inflated by the amount of times you’d need to play through nearly the entire thing in order to reach the end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even though I no longer have the time, the patience, or the sugar-enhanced reflexes of a 12-year-old with no job, I do respect the format.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This philosophy feels pretty heavily baked into Terminator 2D and, even though I no longer have the time, the patience, or the sugar-enhanced reflexes of a 12-year-old with no job, I do respect the format. Sure, burning through my continues on an encounter I didn’t quite understand immediately was frustrating, and needing to start all over again is never fun. However, pushing past punishing sections that gave me grief on previous playthroughs is undeniably rewarding. I only wish you weren’t limited to accumulating a maximum of just nine continues. Whenever you have nine in the bank, any further ones you collect are converted to bonus points instead. Failing on the last level does sting a little harder knowing I could’ve easily had a few more cracks at it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Are We Learning Yet?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On account of Terminator 2D’s modest length, I’m hesitant to drill down too specifically on how and when it shifts up its various mechanics, because encountering and learning this stuff for yourself is really all part of the process. What I will say, however, is that Terminator 2D doesn’t stagnate as a one-speed sidescroller, and there are tweaks throughout that typically require a slight adjustment to your approach. That is, one moment you might be cutting a plasma-fueled path through a Skynet-ravaged future in an overtly Contra-inspired run-and-gun action section, and the next you’re sneaking through the Pescadero State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, engaging in mild stealth and hiding from the T-1000. This level loses its suspense on subsequent visits thanks to its scripted nature, but the tension the first time around was palpable thanks to the excellent use of T2’s original music and the predilection of the deadly T-1000 to pop up out of nowhere.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Terminator 2D: No Fate Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">T2’s music is actually used to incredible effect all throughout. It essentially does all the heavy lifting in terms of atmosphere in the absence of voice acting, with the dialogue relayed through on-screen text. The power metal version of T2’s main theme is a major highlight, and there’s a fabulously engineered bit of licensed music available in the biker bar that had me grinning like a cybernetic organism in a well-stocked weapons bunker – just be sure to punch that jukebox. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Terminator 2D is as fabulous to look at as it is to listen to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Happily, Terminator 2D is as fabulous to look at as it is to listen to. Its pixel art isn’t just brilliantly handsome, either; it’s also silkily animated. It oozes character at every opportunity, from the way the T-800 disdainfully tosses that unlucky biker onto a burning grill, to the desperate backpedalling of Sarah in the shadow of her worst nightmare, to the final flailings of the T-1000 as it cycles through its most recent shapeshifts in the pool of molten metal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>I Know Now Why You Cry</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">My biggest disappointment overall is the surprising lack of T-800 sequences, resulting in a Terminator game where you unfortunately spend limited time as the Terminator itself. When playing the core story thread – that is, the one that runs faithfully to the film – you’ll only play as the T-800 during the biker bar beatdown and the canal chase. It’s true that, in the spirit of the film, Bitmap Bureau can’t simply turn the T-800 into a mass-murdering WMD. After all, as we all know, it’s under strict instructions from John not to kill anyone. As regularly as ’90s movie tie-ins coloured outside the lines – present company included – it would’ve been quite discordant to have the Terminator arbitrarily massacre his way through a few levels.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nonetheless, it does feel like there are some missed opportunities here. For instance, the biker bar beat ’em up gameplay could’ve made a very logical reappearance in, say, a mall level where the T-800 was forced to slap down some security on his way to rendezvous with John for the first time. This could’ve crescendoed with the T-800 blasting at the T-1000 with his shotgun. As it stands, this iconic encounter occurs in a brief still screen before the motorcycle chase, with no associated gameplay. It feels brushed over considering just how mega that moment is in the context of the movie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s odd, too, that the T-800 blasting the cop cars assembled outside Cyberdyne Systems is only a playable portion in runs destined for one of Terminator 2D’s alternate endings. We actually don’t<em> </em>get it in a regular canon run. It’s stranger still that the T-800 is a passenger for the entire final showdown at the steel foundry with the T-1000. You get a glimpse of the fight between the two as you hustle through the area as Sarah – and the part of the slugfest you can<em> </em>watch does<em> </em>contain some terrific fan service – but I feel like it would’ve been nice to be able to participate<em> </em>in that. I’m not sure whether or not the slight sidelining of the T-800 is related to the fact Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness is not actually featured in Terminator 2D, while Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, Edward Furlong, and Michael Edwards are. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m not sure whether or not the slight sidelining of the T-800 is related to the fact Arnold Schwarzenegger's likeness is not actually featured.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-800 does get some minigun action if you dabble with the decision options that become unlocked after completing the main story for the first time. These decisions send the story on a split path towards new endings that are bespoke to Terminator 2D. They’re an interesting novelty, and these paths result in some different riffs on previously completed levels, but I wouldn’t say they’re a massive boost to proceedings. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing these other paths is the key to unlocking several bonus modes, like a Boss Rush and one dubbed Mother of the Future (which focuses exclusively on Sarah). However, they’re really just slightly altered ways of playing the same thing over again – which is something I’ve done a whole bunch already just pounding through Story Mode. There’s also an ‘Arcade Mode’, which appears to just be Story Mode <em>without </em>continues. This one doesn’t interest me at all, and I’m not quite sure what it’s supposed to emulate. Going to the arcade with a hole in your pocket?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At any rate, T2 is already a perfect film with a perfect ending, so any perversion of it is naturally going to be pretty unsatisfying in comparison (which is a lesson I thought we all learnt watching the first five minutes of Terminator: Dark Fate).</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Terminator 2D: No Fate is totally committed to being an unflinching homage to the 16-bit era. This brings with it an extremely brief runtime – and I’m unconvinced the supplementary modes developer Bitmap Bureau has injected are going to be enough to have me guarantee I’ll be back – but it can’t be understated just how much it succeeds as a wonderfully realised tribute to one of the single greatest movies ever made. It arguably under-utilises its supreme asset in the titular Terminator itself, but it’s otherwise a consistently entertaining and rewarding time capsule punctuated with pitch-perfect music, exquisite pixel art, and brilliant Easter eggs. Terminator 2D: No Fate isn’t just the best Terminator 2 game ever – it may just be the best way to revisit the ’90s this side of hitching a ride to the past in a ball of electricity with your junk out. Trust me.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-review]]></content:encoded>

Unlike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, the IGAs are an awards-only online ceremony that's dedicated to honoring its nominees rather than splitting the focus with game-reveal trailers. GameSpot is one of the partners for this year's IGAs, and below you can see .</p><h2>Where Can I Watch The Indie Game Awards?</h2><p>You won't have to go far to watch it. GameSpot will be livestreaming The Indie Game Awards on Thursday, December 18, starting with the countdown show at 3:30 PM PT / 6:30 PM ET. You can check it out in the embed below or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNK_iZK6l8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameSpot's YouTube channel</a>.</p><h3>Indie Game Awards Start Time</h3><ul><li>3:30 PM PT</li><li>6:30 PM ET</li><li>11:30 PM GMT</li><li>10:30 AM AET</li></ul><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNK_iZK6l8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvNK_iZK6l8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Who Is Hosting The Indie Game Awards?</h2><p>Six One Indie's Mike Towndrow, Kelsey Lynn Towndrow, and Kyle Stephenson will share hosting duties at this year's Indie Game Awards.</p><h2>Who Are the Nominees For The Indie Game Awards in 2025?</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQY7JgJXKmc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gQY7JgJXKmc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's a sign of how well indie games did in 2025 that titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> were nominated for top prizes in both The Game Awards and The Indie Game Awards. However, the various categories for each game are designed to spread the love, so to speak. That means a single title isn't likely to dominate the IGAs the way that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 did at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a>.</p><h3>Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Absolum</li><li>and Roger</li><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Consume Me</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keep Driving</li><li>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</li></ul><h3>Achievement in Accessibility</h3><ul><li>Abiotic Factor</li><li>Barista</li><li>Calm the Storm</li><li>Peak</li><li>Spray Paint Simulator</li><li>Squeakross: Home Squeak Home</li></ul><h3>African Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Bru &amp; Boegie Get Da Milk!</li><li>Finding Father</li><li>Flibbius McDoogle and The Mysterious Flying Machine</li><li>IKEELYA</li><li>Metavoidal</li><li>Stick It To The Stickman</li></ul><h3>ANZ Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Abiotic Factor</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Mars First Logistics</li><li>PROXIMATE</li><li>Tempopo</li><li>The Drifter</li></ul><h3>Bite-Sized Game</h3><ul><li>CARIMARA - Beneath the Forlorn Limbs</li><li>FlyKnight</li><li>Many Nights a Whisper</li><li>The Dark Queen of Mortholme</li><li>this game will end in 205 clicks.</li><li>Time Flies</li></ul><h3>Black Voices in Gaming Award</h3><ul><li>Advent Neon</li><li>Altheia: The Wrath of Aferi</li><li>Sorry We’re Closed</li><li>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</li><li>Sunken Stones</li><li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</li></ul><h3>Community Management</h3><ul><li>Consume Me</li><li>Date Everything!</li><li>IKEELYA</li><li>PEAK</li><li>Soulstone Survivors</li><li>Strange Scaffold</li></ul><h3>Debut Game</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Discounty</li><li>Fretless - The Wrath of Riffson</li><li>ILA: A Frosty Glide</li><li>Sorry We're Closed</li></ul><h3>Emotional Impact</h3><ul><li>Afterlove EP</li><li>and Roger</li><li>Don't Get Your Hopes Up</li><li>Henry Halfhead</li><li>Wanderstop</li><li>Wednesdays</li></ul><h3>Gameplay Design</h3><ul><li>Absolum</li><li>BallxPit</li><li>Dawnfolk</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keep Driving</li><li>Look Outside</li><li>Öoo</li><li>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</li><li>The King is Watching</li></ul><h3>Innovation</h3><ul><li>Blue Prince</li><li>FREERIDE</li><li>Gas Station Story</li><li>PBJ The Musical</li><li>Ruffy and the Riverside</li><li>Taria &amp; Como</li></ul><h3>Latin American Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Adventure of Samsara</li><li>despelote</li><li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo</li><li>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</li><li>Taria &amp; Como</li><li>Tormented Souls 2</li></ul><h3>Music</h3><ul><li>Everhood 2</li><li>Herdling</li><li>Rift of the NecroDancer</li><li>SONOKUNI</li><li>Sword of the Sea</li><li>Wheel World</li></ul><h3>Narrative</h3><ul><li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li><li>Consume Me</li><li>Promise Mascot Agency</li><li>The Drifter</li><li>The Roottrees are Dead</li><li>The Séance of Blake Manor</li></ul><h3>Solo Development</h3><ul><li>Lushfoil Photography Sim</li><li>Megabonk</li><li>NAIAD</li><li>Spilled!</li><li>Tall Trails</li><li>Vile: Exhumed</li></ul><h3>Southeast Asian Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Afterlove EP</li><li>Artis Impact</li><li>Glyphica: Typing Survival</li><li>SEDAP!

<p>It was announced as a "fall 2025" release</p>

<p>In September, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone lifted the lid on a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/stardew-valley-to-dig-up-mouse-controls-on-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> of his farming and life sim. During the Nintendo Direct reveal, it was noted how this version would be <a href="https://youtu.be/8ac2-LRIAeU">arriving in "Fall 2025"</a>. We're now just weeks out from the end of the year, so what's the status of it?</p>
<p>If you have been wondering where the Switch 2 version is (and the free upgrade for existing Switch players), apparently, there is going to be <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001155907833753682">"something" announced "very soon"</a>. Barone also apologised to fans for the wait – here's what he had to say on social media:</p><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr3KMxc-vq0o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359grwkvx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p><strong>Eric Barone:</strong> "I'll announce something very soon sorry about the long wait"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the game's anticipated 1.7 update, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409">the creator has now shared</a> details about some of the content fans can expect, and there's "lots more" planned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case you missed the original announcement, the Switch 2 Edition of Stardew Valley will come packed with mouse controls, four-player split-screen and eight-player online multiplayer. There'll also be GameShare support, so Switch and Switch 2 users without a copy of the game can join in on the fun.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, developers have been rolling out all sorts of upgrades for existing titles. With this in mind, the latest one announced is for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/beyblade_x_evobattle">Beyblade X: Evobattle</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/beyblade-x-evobattle-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Beyblade X: Evobattle - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> arrives in Japan today on <strong>18th December 2025</strong>. It is a 1,000 yen paid upgrade for existing Switch owners who purchase the "Upgrade Pack". Local pricing hasn't been announced just yet.</p>
<p>Like other Switch 2 Editions, this upgrade comes with higher resolution graphics and a higher frame rate. There'll also be faster load times (thanks, Gematsu).</p>
<p>Beyblade X: EVOBATTLE was launched on the Switch eShop last month. Here's a bit more about it from the Nintendo website:</p>

                <p>Developer Santa Ragione is reporting that its controversial indie horror game <a data-target="true" href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Horses</a> sold 18,000 copies in two weeks. That was apparently enough to save the studio from financial ruin, but perhaps not enough to pay for production a second game.</p><p>According to a statement released by the developers, Horses generated $65,000 in net revenue, which allowed Santa Ragione to repay its loans and pay the royalties it owed to Andrea Lucco Borlera, the author and creator of Horses. However, the income won't allow the team to immediately begin working on another game.</p><p>"This result is not enough to begin production on a new game," reads the statement. "The money primarily covers obligations created by a prolonged end of development. If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime. Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siQWaPrkrI0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/siQWaPrkrI0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's been an uphill battle for Santa Ragione and Horses. The studio recently revealed that its title had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">banned by Steam in 2023</a> without explanation. Subsequently, Horses was also banned by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/another-store-bans-this-new-indie-game-and-the-developer-has-questions/1100-6536662/" data-ref-id="1100-6536662">Epic Games Store and Humble Bundle</a> just before its release. </p><p>The cancellation of Horses <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/" data-ref-id="1100-6537012">by three of the major PC game distributors</a> comes after a recent effort to target adult-oriented games on storefronts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">Itch</a>. There is definitely material meant for mature audiences in Horses, but the development team is calling for more transparency in the industry after it says it wasn't given a chance to make any changes to Horses in order for it to be released on Steam.</p><p>"We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," wrote Santa Ragione's spokesperson. "For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p><p>Horses is now available for $5 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://santaragione.itch.io/horses" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Itch.io</a>.</p>

                <p>If you've been looking for more of a challenge from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, then you're about to get it. Developer Techland has dropped Update 1.5 for Dying Light: The Beast, and it's giving players the chance to test their skills in the Nightmare Experience.</p><p>To turn up the heat on players, human and infected enemies are now smarter, more aggressive, significantly stronger, and more reactive to the players' actions. Volatiles may now even appear during the day in some of the Dark Zones, and players have far fewer resources to deal with them all.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, there's a new super enemy, the Alpha Volatile. Techland calls it "the most intelligent Volatile in the history of Dying Light." It's even smarter than the traditional Volatiles and its heightened senses can track the player across the entire map unless they reach a safe zone. The Alpha Volatiles can be killed, but good luck trying to pull that off. At night, the player is the prey for this creature. Players can also get new finishing maneuvers, including one-handed blunt weapons and one-handed slashing weapons.</p><p>The dev team must not have thought the new Volatiles were enough to make Nightmare Experience a true challenge. Now players have to deal with hunger, which is tracked through The Hunger System. If players don't keep their character fed, they will succumb to debilitating effects that will weaken their stamina, health regeneration, and combat efficiency. The developers even added more challenge to the game by using the flashlight--its battery can become too low to use if players don't periodically recharge or replace it.</p><p>The rest of the additions to the game are included below.</p><h2>Dying Light: The Beast Update 1.5 Notes</h2><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>New Game+ &amp; Legendary Levels</h3><ul><li>Adjusted the NewGame+ and Legendary Levels progression curves to reduce farming exploits and balance the experience better.</li><li>Starting a NewGame+ will now check the Legend Level of players to adjust enemies difficulty accordingly.</li><li>Reaching Legend Level 300 before reaching NewGame+ 10 will make enemies' difficulty adjust accordingly.</li></ul><h3>Legend Levels</h3><ul><li>Fixed the possibility for players with no Legend Levels progress to pick up Legend Levels reward weapons left by coop teammates and obtain blueprints of such weapons</li><li>Balanced mods bonus damage related to Legend Levels Rewards</li><li>Balancing of durability of legend weapons Balanced situation where car HP scaled inconsistent with player damage for legend levels</li><li>Fix for the buff “+15% damage (humans) of “Butcher’s Dream” failing to apply correctly</li><li>Fix for critical hit damage does not scaling accordingly with legend levels</li><li>Fixed cases of weapon mods and charms multiply base damage different than the one visible to the player</li></ul><h3>NewGame+</h3><ul><li>Balancing amount of XP granted on higher NewGame+ levels</li><li>Suiciders, Gas Tank Bitters and Gas Tank Virals fixes of explosion strength for higher NewGame+ levels</li><li>Fixed the case of XP loss on Story Mode NewGame+ upon player’s death</li><li>Fixes related to AI having higher ranks than quest rank in cases where it is not intended</li></ul><h3>Performance &amp; Stability</h3><ul><li>Fixed multiple COOP crash cases when peer joins the host</li><li>Fixed a crash triggered by changing FPS limiter values</li><li>Fixed instances of FPS drops when switching graphics settings from Ultra to High</li></ul><h2>Graphical improvements</h2><h3>Raytracing</h3><ul><li>Fixed laggy tree shadows when Raytracing enabled</li><li>Applied various lighting fixes in Side Quest interiors on Raytracing mode</li><li>Fixed COOP synchronization issues on PS5</li><li>Fixed graphical artifacts in the Exile cave upon adjusting Upscaler settings</li><li>Implemented various occluder fixes across the environment</li><li>Fixed rectangular blood shapes on the Peacekeeper weapon</li><li>Fixed of reward icons glowing irregularly depending on how players highlight or claim rewards</li></ul><h2>Environmental &amp; navigational fixes</h2><ul><li>Resolved an environmental issue in the Exile Cave where players get stuck behind a tent</li><li>Corrected several geometry gaps visible when climbing ledges in the old town</li><li>Addressed several geometry gaps visible when climbing ledges in the swamps area</li></ul><h2>UI &amp; Audio</h2><ul><li>Fixed the big message for Legend Level gained suggests using "U" key for the Skills Menu instead of the correct "L" key</li><li>Resolved missing strings related to Legend Levels</li><li>Applied several Steamdeck UI issues related to misaligned or overlapping text</li><li>Fixed weapon damage display for high Legend Levels (above 10m)</li><li>Fixed the crest of recommended Legend Levels in the NewGame+ config screen not matching the actual Legend Levels crest of players on higher NewGame+ levels</li><li>Re-enabled Photo Mode at the beginning of NewGame+</li><li>Adjusted the NewGame+ category title in Public Games section to prevent overlapping with other titles in certain languages</li><li>Corrected the camouflage skill sound not playing correctly</li></ul>

      <p>Toys? Sweaters? Those are gifts of Christmas Past. You should take a look around at the state of the world, at tariffs and shipping costs for material goods, and consider giving a gift that can be enjoyed by anyone on the planet, wherever they are and however they use the internet.</p><p>I'm of course talking about an Aftermath gift subscription, which can be purchased <a href="https://aftermath.site/gift-subscription/" rel="noreferrer">here</a> and will grant the lucky recipient a whole year of access at our 'Member' tier, which lets them read every blog, score an invite to our community Discord, unlocks merch discounts and even includes a link to their own full-text RSS feed of the site.</p><p>As an added bonus, the money spent on the subscription will also go toward supporting Aftermath's full-time staff, contributors and freelancers, allowing us to continue the access-free, no-bullshit work you've come to expect from a worker-owned, reader-supported website. </p><p><strong>Note 1</strong>: To have the subscription delivered on a specific day, make sure to select the desired 'Start Date' on the purchase form. You as the giver will be charged immediately upon purchase, but the recipient won't be notified (and their sub won't start) until the selected date. If the date is left as today's date, they'll be emailed (and their sub will begin) immediately. </p><p><strong>Note 2</strong>: Gift subs can't be purchased for readers with existing paid subscriptions because...our system already recognises them as paid subscribers. They can be <em>purchased </em>by anyone though, whether they're an existing subscriber or not.</p><div>

</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I don't want to be the Game Announcement Police here, ACAB, but over the last month there have been two big, new video games revealed that were notable not for what they showed off, but for what they didn't.</p><p>First up was <em>Total War: Medieval III</em>, which was announced via a live-action trailer (below) and<a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/welcome-to-total-war-medieval-iii?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>blog post</u></a>:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFKhUJTnC-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Total War: MEDIEVAL III - Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Amazing news! There hasn't been a proper historical <em>Total War </em>release since <em>Three Kingdoms</em> (<a href="https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release/"><u>I'm not counting <em>Pharaoh's</em> mea culpa</u></a>), and <em>Medieval </em>is a long-time fan favourite, so this should have got people excited. Only problem is that there wasn't any gameplay shown. There weren't any screenshots. There wasn't even much art for the game, aside from<a href="https://www.totalwar.com/news/our-vision-for-total-war-medieval-iii?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a single piece shown at the top of a follow-up blog</u></a>.</p><p>Only days later, Creative Assembly announced a <em>second</em> upcoming <em>Total War </em>game coming out much sooner, this time set in the<em> Warhammer 40K </em>universe, and its debut trailer was <em>packed </em>with gameplay footage, right down to giving us a look at the menus and interface.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QeCItSg-wmI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Total War: Warhammer 40,000 – Announce Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>I'm not drawing a very long bow here to speculate that the <em>Medieval </em>announcement was made a few days prior in an attempt to head off any uproar over the <em>40K</em> announcement. For those unfamiliar with the franchise, there's a kind of uneasy divide among some in the community, with <em>Total War's</em> longest-serving fans (going back to 1999's <em>Shogun</em>) preferring the series' historical focus over the wilder, more fictional stuff that has featured in the <em>Warhammer </em>(and now <em>40K</em>) entries. They look at how much money and effort has been poured into the Creative Assembly collab, then look at the relative neglect shown to the historical games (from ending<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/creative-assembly-faces-backlash-over-decision-to-end-support-for-total-war-three-kingdoms?ref=aftermath.site"> <u><em>Three Kingdoms</em> support early</u></a> to whatever the hell happened with <em>Pharaoh</em>), and get pretty mad.</p><p>While getting <em>Medieval III</em> out in front like that probably made diplomatic sense to publishers Sega and developers Creative Assembly, I dunno, I think I'd rather a game be announced on its own merits and with something genuine to show off and talk about, rather than shoot a clip and write a blog just so you make some of your own fans less angry. <em>Medieval III</em> is clearly <em>years </em>away (they didn't even hint at a broad window for it to come out), and you went and announced a whole other game a few days later– you didn't have to <em>Elder Scolls VI</em>-ify your next big game!</p><figure><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 Announcement Is Now as Old as Skyrim Was When The Elder Scrolls 6 Was Announced - IGN</p><p>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement is now as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced, and developer Bethesda hasn’t shared another snippet since.</p><p><span>ryan_dinsdale</span></p></div></a></figure><p>The second game I wanted to talk about is even funnier. Earlier today Netflix<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/fifa-mens-world-cup-2026-game-on-netflix?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>announced</u></a><u> </u>that Delphi, a company you've likely never heard of (they're relatively new, and their only public credit is as support on IO's upcoming <em>007 </em>game) will be both developing and publishing a new FIFA game. You might remember that<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/10/electronic-arts-ditches-fifa-ea-sports-fc?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>back in 2022 EA Sports (developers of the long-running series) and FIFA (the world governing body for football) split</u></a>, and ever since EA's series has been called <em>EA Sports FC,</em> or <em>EAFC</em> for short.</p><p>Netflix's announcement contains zero images or video of the game. And there's probably a good reason for that: the press release says stuff like "All you need is Netflix and your phone", and "We want to bring football back to its roots with something everyone can play with just the touch of a button", suggesting that whatever Delphi is cooking up, it'll be a lot closer to a casual mobile experience than the blockbuster simulation football fans have long come to expect from series like <em>FIFA </em>(now <em>EAFC</em>) and <em>Pro Evo</em> (now called <em>eFootball</em>).</p><p>That obfuscation has paid off handsomely, though, with a ton of mainstream coverage of the announcement hitting today with headlines like:</p><figure><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93w7dp42z2o?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Fifa video game to return after four years in Netflix exclusive</p><p>The game will be made by Delphi Interactive and released in time for the 2026 World Cup.</p><p><span>BBC News</span></p></div></a></figure><p>There's a <em>small </em>mention of what I've just said above at the bottom of that BBC article, but as a mainstream article intended for a mainstream audience, I guarantee Delphi and FIFA will be thrilled at the number of water cooler and group chat conversations this week that will revolve around the talking point "Boys, did you hear FIFA is coming back?"</p><p>I should point out that this isn't the first FIFA game to "return" since the body split with EA; there's already a game called <em>FIFA Rivals</em>,<a href="https://fifa.rivals.game/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which is basically an antique NFT scam with a playerbase best summed up by the fact the game's official site has a Telegram account</u></a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-says-17-update-will-contain-more-charactersocial-stuff-and-a-new-farm-type</link>
            <guid>1386643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">News of a Switch 2 version will be announced "very soon."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Stardew Valley fans continue to wait patiently for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-eric-concerned-ape-barone-confirms-update-17-is-coming-but-he-doesnt-want-too-much-hype-at-this-point">previously announced 1.7 update</a>, creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) has dropped a couple small, vague, yet exciting hints about what said mysterious update might entail: a new farm type, and "more character/social stuff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a tweet/X post from ConcernedApe, where he was asked if he could give any hints about the upcoming update. His response was pretty simple: "there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's not a ton of detail, but certainly enough to spark the imagination. The new farm type was indeed to be expected. Stardew Valley started with just one style of farm map, and since its release, most major new content updates have added at least one for a total of eight different options. Each farm map centers around a different specialty, with the Standard map being fairly generic and open-ended, and other maps promoting fishing, foraging, mining, combat, multiplayer, a combination of fishing and foraging, and animal raising. Currently, this means that basically every type of playstyle is supported, so there's a lot left to wonder about when it comes to imagining what new farm type could be added. Perhaps something that encourages building NPC friendships?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "character/social stuff" is a little more vague. This could mean anything from new scenes and events with existing characters to new characters entirely. It's really hard to say at this stage!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Popular fan requests for future Stardew Valley features include more NPCs, including more romanceable NPCs, more dialogue and world lore, but also just generally more of everything: more animals, more crops, more decorations, more clothing, more enemies to fight, dishes to cook, and so forth. ConcernedApe <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-eric-concerned-ape-barone-confirms-update-17-is-coming-but-he-doesnt-want-too-much-hype-at-this-point">hasn't really revealed anything so far about what 1.7 will contain</a>, or even when we might expect it. He's given no release date, only suggested that it's possible it doesn't come out until after Haunted Chocolatier releases. Maybe. It'll be ready when it's ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ConcernedApe did drop one other thing, though. When asked about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 edition, he said he's announce something "<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001155907833753682?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very soon</a>." A Switch 2 edition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/stardew-valley-official-nintendo-switch-2-edition-trailer-nintendo-direct">was first announced back in September</a>, and will bring mouse controls, four-player split screen multiplayer, and Game Share multiplayer to the Switch version. No release date has been given yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We re-reviewed Stardew Valley in 2024 to account for its many, many updates since launch in 2016. While our original review gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/25/stardew-valley-review">an impressive 8.8/10</a>, the re-review <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">called it a 10/10 masterpiece</a>, saying, "Stardew Valley is not only the best farming game I’ve played, it is one of my favorite games of all time. That myself and others keep returning to this eight-year old gem each time it gets even the smallest update speaks to how it’s truly a masterpiece in the genre it both reinvigorated and has come to define."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

              <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/07/12/longtime-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-retires-from-games-industry">James Ohlen</a> joined Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/james-ohlen-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">back in 2019</a> after a 22-year stint at BioWare to create a new IP for the Hasbro-owned tabletop gaming company. Six years later, after cofounding Archetype Entertainment to ship a very <em>Mass Effect</em>-looking RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/exodus-trailer-scifi-rpg-matthew-mcconaughey-1851674488">called <em>Exodus</em></a>, he’ll no longer be head of the studio when the game eventually ships in 2027.</p> <p>“At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,” Hasbro VP of Communications Abby Hodes <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/hasbro-hires-new-video-game-boss-as-exodus-studio-head-steps-down?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjAwNjU2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjExMzYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0ZOOEpLSVAzSlQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.DsXTL5uiyiElHnbXg3lBhhoGNbYoIOcplrfvRhfCrLw">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a statement. She added that Ohlen asked to “shift his creative focus” and would remain a consultant for the company on tabletop gaming.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is James Ohlen. He was the lead designer for Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Dragon Age: Origins, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and now he's making EXODUS.</p> <p>He has been referred to as the "godfather of Bioware design".

It’s an expensive-looking game from a brand new studio that began work during the pandemic, which might be part of why the delayed project is still a couple of years from launching.</p>

 <p>But <em>Exodus</em> isn’t just the potential start of a new franchise, it’s an entire world that Hasbro wants to use as a springboard for other products. Wizards released an <em>Exodus</em> <a href="https://ttrpg.store.exodusgame.com/?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwMR2gNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp9kE9hc3UJPQ0PP0i_inu10Pi6VbPjeWCFVkVhGOOKLvOciRaubmZ8vQQP9g_aem_OILHflwjwSOk5SahfUXFWw">TTRPG book</a> earlier this year and would no doubt love to look at trading card and TV spin-offs if the game eventually becomes a <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>-like hit.</p> <p>Bloomberg also reports that Ohlen stepping down comes alongside Blizzard veteran and <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-launches-dreamhaven-1845152912">Dreamhaven</a> co-founder Paul Della Bitta becoming head of Wizards’ Digital Ventures division underneath fellow Blizzard veteran John Hight. Plenty of other BioWare veterans still remain at Archetype, including Chad Robertson and Drew Karpyshyn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This time of year makes me miss being a kid and <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-s-the-best-or-worst-gaming-gift-youve-ever-recei-1845928462">unwrapping a cool new RPG</a> I could then spend the winter quietly toiling through. Not an internet guide in sight. Just a fan living in the moment. So I’m always on the lookout to see what games are getting discounted during the holiday sell-off in case there are one or two things I can pick up and add to my physical collection for cheap. I might even wrap them and put them in a stocking or under the tree and pretend they’re from Santa.</p> <p>Here are a few of the good deals out there so far. I’ll be on the lookout for more and will update the list if I find them. Please feel free to share any good ones you’ve spotted in the comments as well.</p> <h2><em>Visons of Mana&nbsp;</em></h2> <p>The whimsical action-RPG is currently <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/visions-of-mana-playstation-5/">just $20 everywhere</a> across both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S (physical only). It’s a surprisingly decent stab at reinvigorating the <em>Mana</em> franchise after more than a decade without a real sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></h2> <p>This one’s also $20 <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/final-fantasy-xvi-standard-edition-playstation-5/JXL9RG8LSC">at most stores</a> this week, a steal for a 2023 GOTY contender that shines despite its most glaring flaws. The music, performances, and cinematic boss fights are all top-tier and the action feels great even when it gets repetitive.</p>

 <h2><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></h2> <p>This Vanillaware strategy RPG also gets a bit repetitive in the back half but is worth it for the current price of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Overlord/dp/B0CJ4KF5J7?tag=kotaku01-20">just $25 across PS5 and Switch</a>. The story makes no sense but the art is exceptional and the mash-up of turn-based combat and RTS micro-management is enough to keep you powering through.</p>

 <h2><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></h2> <p>I’m still not very far in Warhorse Studios’ open-world immersive sim but I’m liking it a lot more than the first game. It’s also surprisingly cheap for a 2025 Game Awards nominee. It’s just $40 for PS5 and only $30 for Xbox. The PS5 version’s also been going <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii---playstation-5/408117.html">in and out of stock</a> at GameStop for the same lower price.</p>

 <h2><em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em></h2> <p>Don’t let the mobile game origins fool you. <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> is the good stuff. Mistwalker’s Hironobu Sakaguchi channels his early <em>Final Fantasy</em> roots to deliver a slick turn-based adventure that feels like it would have been right at home on the PS1. Amazon has the PS5 and Switch copies for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASIAN-Neo-Dimension/dp/B0DHYGHQCJ?tag=kotaku01-20">just $30</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection</em></h2> <p>I’ve been meaning to pick this one up for a while and for some reason it’s just $20 right now <a href="http://Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection">on Amazon</a>. The games themselves are very similar but the hybrid strategy gameplay remains peak Game Boy Advance nostalgia.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</em></h2> <p>I feel like <em>FF12</em> is a bit underrated these days. It’s pound-for-pound one of the densest entries in the series and the remaster does an excellent job of polishing up the PS2 visuals and improving some of the job board progression to make it feel more like a familiar job-based MMO system. It’s only $25 on both PS5 and Switch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-XII-THE-ZODIAC-AGE/dp/B01GOQHDJ4?tag=kotaku01-20">at the moment</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em></h2> <p>Is the Pixel Remaster collection overpriced? Yes. Are the smoothmaster visuals a bummer? Also yes. But you can’t get too picky about owning a piece of history. Adding it to your collection <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-I-VI-Pixel-Remaster-Collection/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=kotaku01-20">for just $40</a> isn’t bad.</p> <h2><em>Super Mario RPG</em></h2> <p>You’ll probably never own the original SNES version of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. Used copies start at $50. Nice ones are quite a bit more. The Switch remaster, which looks excellent and improves combat with a new ultimate system, is a great pickup <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/super-mario-rpg---nintendo-switch/396423.html">at just $25 right now</a>.</p> <h2><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2> <p>The physical version for PS5 is currently just $17 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Persona-3-Reload-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGFCC193?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> and only $25 a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/persona-3-reload-launch-edition-playstation-5/">Best Buy</a>. It’s a stellar remake and probably my favorite game in the series at this point. Not as flashy as <em>Persona 5</em> but with way better melancholy teen vibes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it's not enough to fund a new project.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses, the indie horror game that was banned from both Steam and the Epic Games Store ahead of its launch two weeks ago, has nonetheless managed to sell over 18,000 copies, says publisher Santa Ragione. However, that's not enough for the publisher to fund a new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a press release sent today by Santa Ragione, which says Horses has generated approximately $65,000 in net revenue thanks to sales on GOG and Humble [Disclaimer: Humble and IGN are both owned and run by IGN Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, Inc.]. That was enough to pay royalties owed to creator Andrea Lucco Borlera, as well as pay off the loans the publisher took out to finish development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not enough to begin work on a new game, and it doesn't seem likely that amount will be reached despite the significant attention the game's controversy gleaned. The team members are still planning to take on other jobs and projects, with the hope that the publisher may be able to fund a new prototype in the future if sales remain steady for long enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While the launch of HORSES compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," the publisher said in a statement. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is a horror game that follows a young man who travels to a horse farm to work for several weeks during the summer, only to discover that the farm's "horses" are actually naked humans with horse masks forcibly attached over their heads. The game explores themes of complicity and what horrors people are willing to participate in, via the farmer and eventually protagonist's treatment and continued enslavement of these people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game contains a lot of disturbing imagery, including violence and sexual content, but none of that's new for either Steam or Epic. Nevertheless, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">Horses was banned from Steam two years ago</a> after the team submitted an in-progress prototype. While some suggestions were given as to the reason for the ban, no specifics were shared with the team at the time, nor was there an opportunity to appeal. Santa Ragione believes Valve may have objected to a scene present in the earlier version where a child "rode" one of the naked horses by sitting on their shoulders and being carried around. That character was aged up to an adult in the final version of the game, and there are no underaged individuals in the released version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Valve unbending, Santa Ragione said at the time it may have to close its doors, due to the overwhelming necessity of a Steam release for most games to recoup development costs. The publisher put its hopes in Epic, GOG, and Humble, but at the last minute right before launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">Epic also banned the game</a>, with Epic citing violations of its policies on "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bans prompted a wave of criticism from developers and audience members, who called out the banning of the game as both censorship as well as hypocritical, given some of the other content that's allowed on Steam in particular. Santa Ragione specifically has called out Valve for having unclear policies and communication, problems that it feels essentially ensured the studio's demise.</p><blockquote>We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Critical response to Horses has been across the board, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">our own reviewer</a> giving it a 7/10 and calling it "an affecting first-person horror game that, despite some repetitive tasks and signposting issues, delivers a harrowing story you won’t forget in a hurry." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Santa Ragione has a long history of both developing and publishing standout games. Its most recent successes are Mediterranea Inferno, which it published from developer Eyeguys and which won Excellence in Narrative at the 2024 Independent Games Festival, as well as nominations for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Nuovo Award. Saturnalia, developed in-house and released in 2022, received generally positive reviews. Both games remain available on Steam and Epic.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-sells-over-18k-copies-pays-back-loans-and-royalties-despite-removal-from-steam-and-epic]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Harry Potter game Hogwarts Legacy has now sold more than 40 million copies worldwide, making it among the best-selling games of all time.</p><p>Warner Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, <em>Warframe</em>’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon/"><u>hotly anticipated <em>Old Peace</em> update</u></a> launched, kicking off a saga that digs into the very foundations of the nearly 13-year-old game’s lore. Of course, like clockwork, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/warframes-the-old-peace-update-servers-issues/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>servers immediately took a tumble</u></a>, resulting in crashes, outages, and chat issues. But why has this pattern become so predictable with online games? Especially when developers are well aware that a storm of their own making is on the horizon?</p><p>During a Game Awards-adjacent event celebrating <em>The Old Peace</em>’s launch last week, I asked creative director Rebb Ford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"You've gotta spin up capacity,” she told Aftermath, referring to the practice of paying money to a distribution partner for additional servers ahead of or during moments when many players will be trying to access content. “You're allowing so many connections. We're an always-online game, right, so every time a player does something, there's a server call. There's something that needs to be verified server and client side. … Login, mission complete, anything that needs to talk to us to say 'You did this, you did that’ – it happens to us at a volume level that's very hard to account for."</p><p>In <em>The Old Peace</em>’s case, Digital Extremes was ready for a stampede the moment it opened the gates, but not quite ready enough.</p><p>"We actually didn't fall over as much as I thought we would,” said Ford. “That's when we realized 'Oh, we didn't think this was gonna be bigger than TennoCon [<em>Warframe</em>’s annual convention that often drives record player numbers].' We spun up IRC servers, we spun up things just to deal with volume. But sometimes you just cannot be prepared enough when you didn't predict it to be the third-best day in the history of the game. That was an error on our part, but it's not so much a tech error; it was an anticipation error. We fixed it very quickly."</p><p>The ability to quickly rectify server issues is also the result of preparation – in some cases <em>years </em>of preparation.</p><p>"One of our most important things to do is make sure people can get the content as fast as possible,” said Ford. “With <em>Warframe</em>, when we have the build or the update, we release it to our distributing partners, and we do something called a pre-heat of our CDN, or content delivery network – which is basically us saying 'People shouldn't all be fetching the game data from one node.' Because that will take forever. It'll get congested. So we distribute it, and this is through years of network partner shopping, working with really good network partners. We have content servers in 16 or 17 central population hubs."</p><p>The pre-heat, Ford explained, ensures that the whole network doesn’t hinge on a single point of potential failure.</p><p>“So sometimes you'll be going in the Philippines instead of being routed to our deploying headquarters, which is Ontario,” she said. “We pre-heated our server structure across the globe so that people can fetch [new content] quicker, and that takes a lot of load off.”</p><p>But that’s only one stair in what Ford characterized as a winding staircase of individual, overlapping needs.</p><p>"So that's the first point of failure: Can you download the game at all?” she said. “Second point of failure is: Can you login at all? When that happens, that all comes to us through login capacity. That one, you just have to spin up more capacity. Then you have the question of 'Can people play missions?' So you can kind of see the staircase: Can you download the game? Can you login to the game? Can you play the game? And each one of those is a slightly different sector of stability."</p><p>In <em>Warframe</em>’s case, elements can function independently, but if they’re not all working in conjunction, players quickly begin to see the seams.</p><p>“A lot of people can be logged into the game, and that's cool, but if you can't play, [then there's a problem],” said Ford. “It's like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Can you chat? You don't need chat to play the game, but chat servers run independently. Those were hit the hardest [on <em>Old Peace</em> launch day], and we fixed it fairly fast by spinning up more capacity."&nbsp;</p><p>Games are complicated, as is the process of distributing them to millions of different computers with as many hardware configurations as there are stars in the sky. You will not be surprised to learn, then, that many other things can also go wrong.</p><p>“We have issues where we release new code in this build, and then maybe one piece of code fires every second on a heartbeat,” Ford said. “And sometimes we find these heartbeats, and we're like 'What is pinging the servers every second on the second,' and we're like 'It's the new title system we put in,' for example. ‘It's checking against server-client to issue you a title, but it's doing it in a way where we were unsure because it's checking all this indexed stuff.’"</p><p><em>Warframe </em>has been around for over a decade and regularly pulls in tens – or in <em>Old Peace</em> launch day’s case, hundreds – of thousands of concurrent players. Nonetheless, said Ford, Digital Extremes still frets about The Ramifications as though it were a much smaller company.</p><p>"We still feel very young and scrappy, and we're like 'Can we even afford $600 more per month in capacity?'” she said. “That's the kind of question we ask ourselves on launch day. And then we're like 'Just do it! Just do it!'"</p><p><em>Warframe</em>’s servers weren’t quite able to withstand the sheer weight of years’ worth of anticipation on launch day, but Ford was relieved that they didn’t go down for “hours and hours,” which would’ve necessitated a suitably less jubilant speech at the launch event in LA.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's exciting. It's thrilling. Everyone did an amazing job,” she said. “We asked our team to do the impossible with this update, so even though those little hiccups happened, we had two speeches prepared – funeral or the celebration – and we undoubtedly got to do the celebration."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/runescape-jagex-engine-sound-development/"><div><p>Let’s Meet A Runescape Developer Who Worked On Everything From Billing To Engines To HTML5 - Aftermath</p><p>‘I gave RuneScape 32-bit sound’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Fresh from awarding their coveted Peace Prize, FIFA are returning to gaming and it is Netflix, rather established software giant, who are to release the game in time for the 2026 World Cup. You will also be able to play it on “selected” televisions with a controller and on your phone via the Netflix mobile app.</p>
<p>The game will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, a company that has yet to release a game but is actually involved with 007: First Light. Delphi licensed James Bond and then partnered with IO Interactive who will make and publish the game.&nbsp; Delphi’s CEO Casper Daugaard has said “We believe that, on average, the legacy publishers have become fundamentally misaligned with the owners of the world’s biggest IP.”</p>


<p>“The FIFA World Cup is going to be the cultural event of 2026, and now fans will be able to celebrate their fandom by bringing the game right into their living rooms,” said Alain Tascan, President of Games at Netflix. “We want to bring football back to its roots with something&nbsp;<i>everyone</i> can play with just the touch of a button.”</p>
<p>The game, if you believe the press release from Netflix, will let you “experience the emotion and drama of the tournament in its purest, most joyful form, &nbsp;in a format that’s fast to learn, thrilling to master, and built for anyone to jump in.”</p>

<p>You will be able to play solo or online, “All you need is Netflix and your phone.”</p>

			<p>The Game Awards 2025 might've received <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999330579041730881">a 'D' grade from viewers who voted in the poll</a> that the show's host and creator, Geoff Keighley, puts up on X (formerly Twitter) every year, but that didn't get people to turn away from the show. Keighley and his Game Awards team have, as they do every year, reported the viewership numbers from this year's show. Just like last year, it's another record-breaking year.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 was the most-watched Game Awards ever, with 171 million livestreams of the entire show across the globe. Viewership was up 11% compared to last year, conversation about the show on X (formerly Twitter) was up 12% compared to last year, and there were 23,000 co-streams of the show across Twitch and YouTube, which is more than a 50% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p>And all of that doesn't even include the viewership numbers from Amazon Prime Video, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">as the show made its Prime Video debut this year</a> as one of the streamer's live events. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you for making 2025 the most-watched <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> ever.</p><p>📈 Viewership up 11% YoY<br>🌍 171M+ global livestreams of the full show<br>💬 Conversation on X up 12% YoY<br>🎥 23,000 co-streams on Twitch &amp; YouTube (+50% YoY) <a href="https://t.co/8ZL95TIsPS">pic.twitter.com/8ZL95TIsPS</a></p></div>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/2001382103880249581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The show is undeniably the biggest event of the year within the video games industry, even if it's not the most impactful to the industry, and it has continuously grown exponentially for years now. It's a credit to Keighley and his team that they are able to improve on the show's viewership and reach every year, even if the content of the show itself fluctuates far more than anyone would like to see.</p>
