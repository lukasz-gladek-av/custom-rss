            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it still feels far, far away.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the wake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-announced-from-former-kotor-and-mass-effect-director-casey-hudson-the-game-awards-2025">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic’s big announcement at The Game Awards</a>, you might have seen social media posts saying the game won't be out until 2030. Director Casey Hudson has now stepped in to address those posts, insisting the game will be out before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development at Edmonton, Alberta-based developer Arcanaut Studios, which Hudson and his partners only founded in July. It stole the show at The Game Awards with a flashy, tantalising CG trailer that contained no gameplay. But fans are particularly excited because Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is billed as the spiritual successor to the much-loved Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, which Hudson directed while at BioWare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So where did all the “not till 2030” posts come from? It seems <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a social media comment</a> from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier, in which he called a 2030 release window an “optimistic guess” based on the fact the studio was founded this year, ended up being framed elsewhere online as “Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic may not release until at least 2030.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Hudson himself has stepped in. “Don’t worry about the ‘not till 2030’ rumors,” <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hudson tweeted</a>. “Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in “early development,” so it still feels a fair while away. But based on Hudson’s comment, it will launch at some point in 2029 <em>at the latest</em>, which is four years away. In that time, Hudson will need to build out his new studio (almost certainly a factor in announcing the game so early), which will be a huge effort all on its own, as well as build what is expected to be a high quality AAA game with huge fan expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are thin on the ground, but we do have some top-line information as well as enthusiasm from LucasFilm Games, which is collaborating with Arcanaut Studios on the project. Obviously Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is set in the Old Republic era, given its name. It’s a “narrative-driven single-player action RPG” where you “step into the role of a Force user on a journey through a galaxy on the edge of rebirth.” We’re told players can expect an experience “where every decision deepens their journey toward light or darkness.” It sounds a lot like KOTOR, and while it may end up feeling a lot like KOTOR, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is a completely new and different story that will introduce new characters.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re still early in development, with many challenges ahead,” Hudson said in a blog post on <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StarWars.com</a>. “I’m grateful to have enjoyed the support of KOTOR fans for many years, and I look forward to embarking upon this journey together, sharing more of what we’re doing as soon as we can!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite Hudson’s comment reassuring fans, there is some debate about whether Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic will end up missing the current generation of consoles and end up launching on the PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox, as well as PC. Time will tell.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>
There is something that lies in the belly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metamorphosis">Metamorphosis</a> that makes me recoil. The surface level concept is easy enough to follow. It is a 2D pixel art <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> where you play as a "forsaken nun" who "walks the long road to absolution." The world you find yourself in in the game's demo is overbearing, crushing. Initially you find yourself in the depths of a church, and even that is worth questioning - what church has depths? When you come across a device, and what on the offset looks like gothic horror a la <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> becomes perplexingly technological.
</p>
<p>
This device is, mechanically speaking, your main menu. Booting up this menu, you are met with a voice, in text form, that asks you to speak to it. You type in help, literally, with your real-world keyboard, and it gives you a list of options: inventory, journal, settings, all of them with appropriate descriptions, and then OS, the only bit of detail about this option being "me." What else could OS be but operating system, and if that's true, what kind of a world is this?

<p>
These questions go unanswered in the demo, because why would they be, but we must press on. Which would be all well and good if pressing on wasn't such a challenge. Metamorphosis harbours a cruel reality, one where you can die quite quickly and easily, its disgustingly abstract enemies frightening enough to cause you to panic, the purposefully dim lighting causing you to second guess every shadow and precarious jump. Dying puts you right back to where you last saved, which can, of course, be longer ago than you wished it was, and further back to - you can only save at certain points, unless you have some candles to make temporary restore points.
</p><p>
Despite writing for a PC site, I am not particularly good at playing with a keyboard and mouse, and while Metamorphosis is playable on controller, most of the tutorialisation UI is for PC only, forcing me into the old ways as I wasn't sure which button did what. There are a lot of buttons to keep in mind in this game, making it a touch challenging in a potentially unfair way, though I can forgive this for now, as the atmosphere has won me over.
</p>
<p>
Metamorphosis doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam, and maybe check out its demo for yourself, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3470140/METAMORPHOSIS/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has secured a prestigious place in the grand final of the Budapest Major after a thrilling semifinal victory over Team Spirit, one of the favorites to go all the way. In one of the most anticipated fixtures of the tournament, the powerhouse platform of Vitality easily overcame Team Spirit, issuing a 2-0 sweep to kick the Russian side out of the running.</p>



<p>Now, Team Vitality will wait patiently in the grand final slot, and Natus Vincere and FaZe Clan will duke it out for a shot at the grand final and the $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>If you want to place a wager on what’s left of the playoffs, Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the StarLadder Major Budapest 2025. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a>&nbsp;to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-navi-and-faze-remain-in-budapest">Team Vitality, NAVI, and FaZe Remain in Budapest</h2>



<p>Team Spirit had one heck of a run thus far, with donk going so far as to set a new record, but it wasn’t enough to beat Vitality to the punch in Budapest. The first map of the series, Mirage, proved to be a tenuous enough battle, going long into overtime, but the second map, Dust II, was much easier for Vitality to handle.</p>



<p>Vitality has had a remarkable run in Budapest. The team failed to secure a perfect record in the tournament’s third stage ahead of the playoffs, but the squad has made up for that in the bracket by refusing to drop a single map.</p>



<p>The streak has been enough for ZywOo to rack up a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-secures-record-for-best-map-performance-starladder/">new single-map Major record</a>.</p>



<p>In our recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/budapest-semi-finals-predictions-and-betting-tips/">predictions piece for the semi-finals</a>, we accurately predicted that Team Vitality would make it through to the grand final, and we also suggested that Natus Vincere would rise to meet them. The accuracy of that prediction will be revealed very soon.</p>



<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> who you think will secure the trophy tomorrow in Budapest.</p>

There has never been a time where the presence of a big Hollywood celeb making an appearance in a video game has drawn me in. Who cares! Most of the time they are not voice actors, and are just doing their own voice, maybe sometimes lending their face. And yet here we are with Matthew McConaughey, a man who is <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice-elevenlabs-1236574041/">happily lending his voice to some AI software</a>, in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a>, a game that's basically just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> from some folks who actually made Mass Effect. But! Said folks would like you to know that McConaughey's performance is all him, thanks very much.

<p>
"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," co-founder of Exodus studio Archetype Chad Robertson explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-ai-voice-generation-but-sci-fi-rpg-exodus-authentically-him">Eurogamer</a> when asked if the Ghosts of Girlfriends Past actor was at all AI-generated in-game.

"He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used. The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific."
</p><p>
Robertson also touched on what the studio's long-term stance on AI is, which is currently essentially they have none, but will "have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves," as the tech becomes more widely used. When it comes to Exodus, Robertson also clarified that there's no AI to be found in it: "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan."
</p>
<p>
A current lack of AI doesn't convince me of the game right now, personally. There's nothing about it that screams particularly unique <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">sci-fi</a>, just perhaps expensive sci-fi, which is often the worst and most boring kind. Still, it's a while away until any of us find out if that is the case or not, as its Geoffies trailer also positioned it for a 2027 release date.

            <p>Former Striking Distance and Sledgehammer founder Glen Schofield has shared his concerns about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">the sale of his former employer, EA</a>, saying it's a "bittersweet moment" that reminds him of the sale of Activision to Microsoft.</p>
<p>"in the span of just a few years, the two publishing giants who shaped the last 20+ years of our industry have both entered new eras," he said.</p>
<p>"I spent roughly a decade at each company, right in their primes," he wrote to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_ea-and-activision-thank-you-when-the-news-activity-7405032019358851072-hPut/">LinkedIn</a>. "Watching them fade from their roles as dominant publishers and powerhouse training grounds hits harder than I expected."</p>

<p>"EA was buttoned-up, disciplined, and structured in a way that forced you to rise to the level of the room. Franchise reviews were intense – no shortcuts, no guessing. You had to know every inch of your game. And they’d challenge you, push you, test you. But when you walked out of that meeting, you knew exactly where you stood."</p><p>Reflecting on his first meeting as an executive producer, Schofield revealed that "being [at EA] felt like a creative all-star lineup", with "so many legends in one place". Activision, by contrast, "was a storm of A-type personalities, but in the best possible way".</p>
<p>"Review meetings were loud, passionate, borderline chaotic, with people calling out questions over one another," he said. "But the questions were sharp, focused, and always aimed at making the game better. A one-hour meeting becoming two and a half was normal and somehow, the time always felt well spent.</p>
<p>"So yes, it’s tough to watch these companies step back from what they once were: major publishers, major developers, and incredible places to grow, learn, and sharpen your craft. They trained generations of us. They made careers. Mine included."</p>
<p>But despite the "bittersweet" nature of his message, Schofield did acknowledged that the "bright side" of the acquisition means others will now be able to step up.</p>
<p>"New leaders. New studios. New publishers. Someone will take that mantle, we always do as an industry. And when they do, I hope they lead, teach, and invest in talent the way EA and Activision did. They set a bar that pushed all of us to be better. They’re both still around, and I sincerely wish them success in whatever comes next.</p>
<p>"From the bottom of my heart, thank you EA and Activision for an amazing run and for everything you helped me become."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Eurogamer reported that Dead Space creator Glen Schofield <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-hopeful-eas-new-owners-will-let-him-make-dead-space-4-promising-to-save-them-millions-of-dollars">was "already making calls" to EA's new owners in the hope he can make Dead Space 4</a>. Schofield was executive producer on the first Dead Space game in 2008, and while he wasn't involved in its two follow-ups, he later developed the spiritual successor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> at Striking Distance Studios in 2022. He  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-departs-callisto-protocol-studio-after-flop">left Striking Distance in 2023 after the game flopped</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Schofield posted on LinkedIn the games industry is "tough" after failing to obtain financial backing for his latest project, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-hints-at-retiring-from-game-development-after-struggling-to-fund-latest-project">hinting he may have directed his last game</a>.</p>

            <p>
It's funny to think that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape-dragonwilds">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a>, one of those cosy-ish, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafty type of games doesn't have farming just yet, but I suppose that's understandable given it is an early access game. Doesn't matter much either, as farming will be coming to the game next week as part of its Fellhollow update, which just got another look-in through a new gameplay trailer that also shows off all sorts of undead bashing you'll be doing.
</p>
<p>
Where thus far the game has presented a slightly more idyllic fantasy world, Fellhollow looks like it is filled with giant, very indigo orcish brutes, zombie-esque creatures with three flavours of haircut (bald on top, bald at the front, bald), a dragon (it's in the name!), and quite angry skeletons. Well, there's one friendly skeleton that's only a skull who makes a pun so groanworthy not even the strapline of an RPS story would welcome it.
</p>

<p>
That aforementioned dragon is a smaller one that appears to appear somewhere in the overworld, though it also looks like you'll be able to do noble battle with a much bigger, sometimes invisible, always with its chest completely cut open dragon that'll probably do a number on you and your mates if you're not careful.
</p><p>
And, of course there's the farming, which sounds suitably in depth. The type of seed your planting will need to be planted in a different kind of planter, ash, oak, or willow. Watering them requires some thinking, as you can either use dirty water from your watering can, or clean water from a well or raincatcher barrel. You can also forgo doing the watering yourself and cast a spell instead. There's even composting! And there are other new spells too like uproot, which as you can probably guess uproots any of your veggies from the ground.
</p>
<p>
It all seems varied enough, and I'm sure it will be enjoyable if you're particularly into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>'s flavour of fantasy. Fellhollow will be available as a free update next week, December 15th.

            <p>
Satire is a genre that you find often enough in mediums like film and television, but there is an argument to be made that it doesn't happen as often in games, and that maybe, this is due for a reckoning. This is the argument that Davide Soliani (Mario + Rabbids) and Christian Cantamessa (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>) are making about the game they're co-directing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bradley-the-badger">Bradley the Badger</a>, a comedic, half-throwback, half-fresh-take <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> revealed at The Geoff Keighley Night this week.
</p>
<p>
"The film and television industry has a long history now of parody and satire," Cantamessa told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/this-is-a-love-letter-to-games-first-look-at-davide-solianis-game-awards-surprise-bradley-the-badger/">VGC</a> in an interview that went up alongside the reveal. "In Hollywood, they call it navel-gazing, but it’s healthy, it’s humorous, it’s fun. It opens up some of the dusty closets to the audience, which always has an interest in how the sausage is made."
</p>

<p>
He went on to mention Seth Rogen's recent Hollywood satire show The Studio, noting if the TV industry is ready for that, "and the film industry has Birdman, the comic book industry has Deadpool… I think the games industry is ready for a healthy dose of satire."
</p><p>
This is, perhaps, a bit of an odd framing to take, in that it makes it sound like there has never been any satirical games, though I think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, Portal, and even arguably much older games like Earthbound might have something to say about that. Hell, let's not forget Conker's Bad Fur Day, a game that Bradley the Badger clearly partially pulls from.
</p>
<p>
To give the game some credit, it does look quite fun! A game about a game falling apart and seeing behind the code so to speak is not a novel concept necessarily, but I like the look of the systems that let titular Bradley be a game dev himself. And it's being more directly satirical of games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> and Cyberpunk, which is admittedly not a common thing to do, though I wonder if this didn't have such big industry names attached to it whether it would get away with such presentations.
</p>
<p>
Whether Bradley the Badger will be successful in its satire, or even just being a good game, we'll have to wait and find out, but you can wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">here</a> if you're curious about it all the same.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nex Playground is apparently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p">one of the hottest</a> consoles this holiday season thanks to its kid-friendly games and fun, motion-controlled gameplay. And now through December 14th, the cube-shaped console is on sale for its Black Friday low of around $199 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Playground-AI-Powered-Transforms-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. There are some other great deals still available you might have missed this week, too, including a sizable discount on the new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B0FGKTDTRB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Google Pixel Buds 2A</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Moonbase-Desktop-Charger-Moonlight/dp/B0FL1RBYJR/ref=sr_1_2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Genki’s Moonbase Charging Station</a>, which looks straight out of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p><div><div><h2>Featured Products</h2></div><ul><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div><p>The <strong>Nex Playground</strong> easily connects to your TV and provides a clever interactive solution that encourages you and your family to move around. A built-in camera and AI software track your movements with precision, so <em>you</em> are the controller. The cube-shaped console comes with five games (<em>Fruit Ninja</em>, <em>Starri</em>, <em>Party Fowl</em>, <em>Go Keeper</em>, and <em>Whack-a-Mole Deluxe</em>), but there are a ton of others you can download; however, a three-month subscription ($49) or an annual Play Pass ($89) is required to enjoy the full catalog and seasonal drops.</p><p><strong>Genki’s Moonbase</strong> features a sleek retro-futuristic design, and it’s currently down to an all-time low of $89.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GENKI-Moonbase-Desktop-Charger-Moonlight/dp/B0FL1RBYJR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>. The power strip features three AC plugs (1,250W max power) and four USB-C ports that can deliver up to 240W of total power; a single USB-C port, meanwhile, can go up to 140W with the right cable, though one isn’t included with your purchase. The strip also features a non-removable, 1.5-meter braided cable, making it easy to reach the nearest outlet.</p><p>Each AC plug is spaced far enough apart to accommodate larger power adapters, but the main selling point here is a touch-sensitive button that lets you cycle through colors and toggle the charging station’s lights on and off. All in all, the Moonbase is a powerful power strip that looks cool and lets you charge up to seven devices simultaneously.</p><p>Google recently <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/us/collection/offers?" rel="sponsored">launched a holiday sale</a> that runs through December 24th, with many items matching the pricing we saw during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. One of the standout deals is the <strong>Pixel Buds 2A</strong>, which have returned to their all-time low of $99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Buds-Cancellation-Transparency/dp/B0FGKTDTRB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fgoogle-pixel-buds-2a-wireless-earbuds-with-active-noise-cancellation-bluetooth-headphones-hazel%2FJ39TC8J6Z8%2Fsku%2F6642707" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://store.google.com/product/pixel_buds_2a" rel="sponsored">Google Store</a>.</p><p>The Pixel Buds 2A are Google’s latest, most affordable pair of wireless earbuds, but they don’t skimp on features. They offer active noise cancellation and a natural-sounding transparency mode, along with excellent sound for the price. They also provide hands-free Gemini support, allowing you to quickly get directions, brainstorm ideas, and summarize messages. The earbuds offer up to 10 hours of listening time with ANC disabled and carry an IP54 rating, too, which isn’t great but should provide at least some protection against rain and sweat.</p><div><p id="a-few-more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>A few more deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Apple’s <strong>M4-powered MacBook Air 13</strong> is on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2025-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0DZDC3WW5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-inch-laptop-apple-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight%2FJJGCQ8RH7G" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> starting at $749 ($250 off), which is just a few dollars shy of its Black Friday low. However, if you purchase it at Best Buy, you’ll also get a free $25 gift card. The slim laptop offers an impressive combination of performance and battery life, with double the base RAM of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24114684/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-15-inch-2024-review">predecessor</a> (16GB versus 8GB) and two Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C ports. It’s still relatively limited with 256GB of base storage, but it remains one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops">best laptops available</a>, especially with the current discount. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>Hoto’s new <strong>PixelDrive electric screwdriver</strong> is on sale for the first time at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKBJL68H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, where you can snag it for $59.99 ($20 off). The cordless PixelDrive is great for small- to medium-sized projects, whether you’re assembling electronics or putting together furniture. It features up to 6Nm of torque, along with a single multi-function button that allows you to change the screwdriver’s direction, switch to an 80RPM precision mode for delicate tasks, or boost up to 200RPM with one finger. It also has a built-in pixelated display, so you can quickly check the battery life and see which of the six torque levels you’re using.</span></li><li><span>The <strong>Lego Super Mario Goombas’ Playground</strong> set is as adorable as it sounds, and it’s currently down to $8.99 ($6 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV25P9MF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Flego-super-mario-goombas-playground-super-mario-toys-and-playset-71433%2FJXPLL2HJ4Z%2Fsku%2F6582434" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. The set comes in at a relatively light 171 pieces, which you can use to build three Goomba figurines, a tree trunk, and a seesaw. Each Goomba has its own evil (but cute) expression, and they can stack on top of each other to make a small Goomba tower. There’s even a lever on the back of the tree trunk that can make a Goomba pop out, so you can play a round of peekaboo before placing the set on a desk or bookshelf.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/844093/nex-playground-google-pixel-buds-2a-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has once again publicly congratulated Sandfall Interactive for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, this time for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">securing a record-breaking nine wins at The Game Awards earlier this week</a>.</p>
<p>"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has just been named Game of the Year in Los Angeles. A historic first for a French title!" Macron announced on Instagram.</p>

<p>"Great pride for Montpellier and for France. Congratulations to the Sandfall Interactive team. For future generations and those that follow!"</p>
<p>Some commenters, however, have taken the opportunity to remind the President that he once suggested video games had "poisoned" the minds of young people during the 2023 riots, although shortly thereafter, Macron did clarify his position, insisting he only said that because " video game codes had been used by offenders to trivialise violence on social networks", adding: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-clarifies-view-on-video-games-after-blaming-them-for-riots">it is this violence that I condemn, not video games</a>.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>"Video games are a culture, an entertainment, a spectacle! They are a ground for artistic experimentation, a fascinating learning space, mixing all the arts," he said at the time. "Playing means listening to music, immersing yourself in stories, feeling emotions, travelling through time. It is exploring visual universes that write a new chapter in the history of art."</p>
<p>French President Emmanuel Macron also congratulated Sandfall Interactive back in May, calling its RPG a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-shining-example-of-french-audacity">"shining example of French audacity and creativity"</a>.</p>
<p>All in all, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 had a pretty fantastic night, taking home not only the coveted Game of the Year gong, but eight other awards too.

<p>With enemy "Al designed to adapt and react to whatever tactics you use", it's thought the gameplay will balance combat with platforming and puzzles, with an emphasis on stealth and resource management in a single-player arcade survival horror game.</p>
<p>The anonymous source also revealed character names and abilities – such as a grappling hook and magnetic boots – and teased the team "hopes" Sigourney Weaver will reprise her fan-favourite role as Ripley, but this is in no way confirmed as yet.</p><p>Interestingly, the source also intimated that the budget for the game is around £56 million ($75 million) and is hoping to release "for all major platforms" in 2028, which means there's plenty of time for details and mechanics to change between now and then.</p>
<p>Eidos Montreal declined to comment.</p>
<p>Alien actress <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-eyes-alien-actress-sigourney-weaver-for-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Sigourney Weaver will star in the live-action Tomb Raider adaptation from Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> as Wallace.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/840324/sektori-review-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s</link>
            <guid>1382509</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Sektori</em> is an old-school twin-stick shooter. Created by a former developer at <em>Returnal</em> studio Housemarque, it puts you in the role of a little ship that blasts through swarms of enemies, and you have to weave through them to get upgrades to help you survive. Often, my runs end after less than a couple minutes, like a retro arcade game. But creator Kimmo Lahtinen brilliantly weaves modern ideas from roguelikes with pulsing visuals and music that make <em>Sektori</em> a mesmerizing experience.</p><p>A key part of what makes <em>Sektori</em> good is how it puts you into a flow state. “<em>Sektori</em> is a place, a form of being, a method of transformation,” reads the description of the game’s campaign mode. “<em>Sektori</em> is seeking, processing, shaping. <em>Sektori</em> is a specter of your zero state.” It may be fancy, high-concept language, but bear with me as I detail how the game actually works. It took me a while to understand it, and how everything connects is what makes the game actually reach those lofty heights.</p><p>When you start a campaign mode run, your tiny ship is dropped into a small playing field. You initially have two ways to attack: a gun that fires infinite laser bullets in the direction you point your right stick and a “strike” that surges your ship forward but has a short cooldown. Enemies are mostly polygonal shapes that briefly appear as red outlines, giving you a moment to get out of the way before they solidify and become threats. If you take a hit, you lose one of the three shields that you start with. When you destroy enemies, they leave little triangles called “glimmer,” and if you collect enough, you can pick up upgrades.</p><p>The upgrade system is the game’s secret sauce. On the left side of the screen, you’ll see a list of upgrades covering speed, score, strike, shield, missile, and blaster. When you pick up a selector token, it moves the potential upgrade up one notch on the list, but when you actually pick an upgrade, it starts the selector from the beginning again. So, for example, if you pick up enough selector tokens to get a missile upgrade, the next selector token you get afterward will make you eligible for a speed upgrade.</p><p>The system means you’re constantly having to make decisions, often while surrounded by enemies, about whether you want to take a more easily attainable speed or strike upgrade or hold out for the more valuable improvements higher up the stack. Complicating things further is that you can only use selector tokens to get five extra shields total during a run, so you’ll often have to weigh if you want to pick up a shield or gamble on staying alive to grab a missile or blaster upgrade that could help more offensively.</p><p>Occasionally, you’ll come across “evolver tokens” that give you other, more substantial upgrades you can pick from a deck, like drones that fly around your ship or a gun that fires behind you. Every once in a while, you’ll also see a token with a rotating set of letters, and if you pick up all of the letters to spell a word (the harder the difficulty, the longer the word), you’ll enter a brief, rainbow-filled superpowered state that’s kind of like getting a star in <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><p>Complicating things even further is the fact that the arena is constantly shifting and changing around you. Every few seconds, the map grows, shrinks, and sometimes even briefly blocks you off from previously accessible areas. If you’re in an area that gets cut off the map when it’s removed, which is marked by flashing red spots ahead of its disappearance, it’s an instant game over. Survive for long enough, and the arena shifts into a boss battle, such as a giant, <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Moldorm_(Boss)">Moldorm-like</a> snake, and if you beat the boss, you’ll move on to the next, harder level. Survive for five levels and you’ll win the run.</p><p>It can be a lot to manage. Most of my runs never get off the ground because I can’t get upgrades fast enough to survive the onslaught of enemies. Even with a strong build, success feels like it hangs on a knife’s edge. But that’s what makes the game gripping; when a run gets going, <em>Sektori</em> turns into something special as you zip across levels, blast away enemies, keep chasing upgrades, and, against the onslaught, keep surviving — all while colorful graphics and the driving techno soundtrack overload your senses.</p><p>I’ve only beaten the game a single time. But during that one magical run, I finally understood what <em>Sektori</em> is all about.</p><p><sup>Sektori<em> is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X / S.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/840324/sektori-review-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161147/large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">Warhammer</a>, I have to say, is something that I've only come to really appreciate properly in recent times. I was never particularly bothered until I picked up a big starter pack of wee guys and big monsters to paint (y'know, for my kids), and then a proper, no-holds-barred addiction set in.</p>
<p>I needed lore. I needed more! And so video games, as ever, have ended up being a very important part in my journey, and this time it's a journey towards a deep understanding of Warhammer. Something like that. Anyway, in short, I've been banging through your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_boltgun">Warhammer Boltguns</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">Mechanicuses</a> (Mechanici?) in order to get myself all up to pub-chat levels of knowing stuff about the franchise. Breezily japing with the lads over a bevvy without sweating being found out. That's the goal.</p>
<p>Luckily for me, recent times have brought us a swathe of what I'm gonna go ahead and proclaim as the best Warhammer video games we've ever had. The licence is being wielded wisely, and the likes of the aforementioned Mechanicus and Boltgun on Switch, alongside the mighty <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/warhammer_40000_space_marine_2">Space Marine 2</a> on other platforms, have gifted fans of all things space murder a blood-soaked smorgasbord of shotguns and shot wrong'uns. Again, something like that.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161150/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>"Stop rambling and get on with the review, Grimgor, we don't all have hundreds, or possibly even thousands, of years to spend chit-chatting!" (Check out that pub-level knowledge, amirite folks?). So, now, we've got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> arriving on Switch 2, and this is another one of the games that I've dug into (on another platform, for shame) over the past year or so in order to sate my big Warhammer appetite. And it's excellent. Let's just get that out of the way. I'm already a big fan of this one before booting into its Switch 2 port, so all they need to do here — all they <em>need</em> to do to stroll to an easy victory — is dish out the goods in working order and we're all in for a treat.</p>
<p>Before we get into the performance, though (as if you can't see that score), let's first get into what's involved in Owlcat Games' epic — you're looking at well over 100 hours here, chief — isometric adventure. Rogue Trader (not be confused with the terrible Ewan McGregor movie) sees you dive into intergalactic battle in the Koronus Expanse, as anyone with pub-level Warhammer knowledge will know is a very dangerous place indeed.</p>
<p>Taking control of a party of six combat units, and in keeping with the original TTRPG, the game thrusts you into strategic, turn-based combat whilst peppering the action with big dialogue choices and player-driven decisions that feed into a unique "Realm Building" mechanic. This sees the world affected by the path you choose to forge, and it's this mechanic that really ties together and elevates a game that also delivers the goods in terms of its strategic scraps and worldbuilding. It's a very solid package indeed.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161143/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>If you've played the likes of Mechanicus (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_mechanicus">which is another banger by the way</a>), you'll sort of know the drill. The Warhammer universe suits this sort of video game down to the ground, and as usual there's depth to spare in the combat skirmishes, tons of replayability built into its ever-changing narrative, and loads of fun to be had in co-op modes - and even a bit of ship-to-ship combat.</p>
<p>Now, I'd love to go on and on and really gild this lily big time, whilst telling you how this Switch 2 port's slick performance helps bring all of this cleverness to life and make it pop, but unfortunately as things currently stand, there's no real point. Indeed, I have to say, this is one of the worst-performing things I've played on Switch 2 so far. Emperor's bowels, indeed.</p>
<p>From the moment you boot into Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader on Nintendo's console, you can tell you're in for a very bad time. The first swooping camera shot of the entire thing, as the game settles down upon your player character and another NPC, stutters and strains as it circles a big tower that's very obviously had all of the graphical spit and polish removed from it. A big visual downgrade, and one that chugs and splutters along, easily down into sub-20fps territory, whilst also crashing consistently, taking an absolute age to load between scenes, and having you stumble about in unresponsive menus. It's not good.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161144/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The combat excels in its brutality, with opportunistic attacks which make for devilishly fluid face-offs that can turn on a dime, but it's derailed thanks to controls that are ruined by the frame rate. It's genuinely hard to place the movement cursor where you want it at times.</p>
<p>So, instead of having a great time (and it's easily a great, if not excellent game when working well) building our own rogue trader's empire, exploring space, and interfering in the fates of planets, we're left in a situation where I think it's best nobody be tempted to buy this thing until it's been fixed up. Until you can shotgun the face off an enemy with nary a stutter.</p>
<p>It's very frustrating. The combat is so crunchy and brutal and full of strategy, it really is some fine stuff, and there's cunning required on anything but the lower difficulty settings to best some ferocious and wonderfully well-designed foes. The narrative is also solid overall, especially given the genre (I shan't spoil in the hopes we get a magical patch in the future), and the decisions and dialogue tree aspects all come off really well thanks to some top writing and perfectly gruff voice-acting. Replayabilty is built in here, and it's one of those things that portable play makes sing, absolutely.</p>
<figure><a title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161149/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Gosh, I so want to give this game the score it deserves! However, it's a big-time swerve. I should also note that, whilst I had zero issues with this game on a high-powered PC, I am aware that it does run like trash on Steam Deck, so perhaps this is something worth noting. We shall need to wait and see.</p>
<p>For now, though, a wildly vacillating frame rate, unstable resolution, hugely downgraded visuals, unresponsive and sluggish controls and menus, and multiple crashes to the Switch home screen put this one far beyond a recommendation.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a cracking bit of turn-based Warhammer action that delivers big on strategic and atmospheric combat whilst also serving you a top-notch, choice-driven narrative and campaign. Hooray. However! This Switch 2 port, at release, is a borderline disaster, and not something I recommend anyone pick up until it's had some patching done.</p>
<p>A constantly stuttering frame rate, long loading times, unresponsive and laggy menus and controls, a huge graphical downgrade, and hard crashes aplenty make for a mess of a port. Let's hope they fix it up, because for now, it's a hard pass for a great game.</p></section>

<p>"Adding support for two new languages"</p>

<p>It's been a huge week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man</a>, with Capcom <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/mega-man-returns-in-2027-with-a-brand-new-entry-for-switch-and-switch-2">revealing a brand-new entry</a> in the series will be coming to the Switch, Switch 2 and other platforms in 2027.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Capcom has another announcement to share about Blue Bomber. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mega_man_11">Mega Man 11</a>, which was released on the Switch in 2018 (<em>that's</em> <em>seven years ago!</em>), has received a new update. It adds support for two new languages to the game: Latam Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.</p>
<p>Players will be able to swap languages from the options page under the Language Settings. Here's the official announcement:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zyxvjl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>This has already led to some fans on social media requesting more updates for this particular entry – including calls for a resolution and performance upgrade on the Switch 2. Capcom hasn't said anything about additional updates for Mega Man 11 in the future, and this update was out of the blue.</p>
<p>If you haven't already played Mega Man 11, there is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/capcom-game-awards-switch-and-switch-2-eshop-deals-save-up-to-85percent">currently a sale for the game</a> taking place on the eShop (reducing it to £3.74 / $4.49), and you can also download a demo. In our review here on Nintendo Life, we gave this title nine out of ten stars, calling it a glorious return for one of gaming's greatest heroes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mega Man 11 is an excellent resurgence for the Blue Bomber, imbuing the tried-and-true classic gameplay with modern touches and new ideas that expand on existing concepts in interesting ways. The underlying action platforming gameplay is just as tight and challenging as you remember, and when combined with the new visuals and extra options for replayability, you’ve got a game that’s every bit as good as those that came before, while surpassing them in some ways."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><span>Closing out this year’s ceremony, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-game-awards">The Game Awards</a> gave us our first look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/free-to-play-pvp-shooter-highguard/">Highguard</a>, an upcoming PvP shooter launching early next year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, in the time since its big reveal, online discourse surrounding Highguard has quickly turned sour, with the announcement trailer receiving a 10:1 dislike ratio and plastered with disparaging comments. But why has the backlash been so strong and is it at all justified?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Highguard World Premiere Trailer from The Game Awards 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/twK-acOec9o?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><span>As far as final reveals go at The Game Awards, Highguard’s debut wasn’t the mic drop moment it was hyped up to be. The short two-and-a-half teaser, while flashy, did little to support the claims being made that this is a truly new breed of online shooter. Even as someone who is excited to get some hands-on time with Highguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">and one of the few people who enjoyed Concord</a> – we had already seen more eye-popping reveals earlier in the show. Highguard didn’t fit the normal template we’ve become accustomed to. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic">Fate of the Old Republic</a> might have been a better closer, dropping a vague cinematic announcement despite being years off from release.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Highguard may have received an almighty signal boost thanks to The Game Awards but how many will tune in to play a new hero shooter with MOBA elements in 2026? The biggest problem for new developer Wildlight Entertainment is the ongoing fatigue surrounding the subgenre which, at its peak, unceremoniously eliminated Sony’s big budget contender, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>It’s not all doom and gloom for online shooters, of course. <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> managed to pull it out of the bag for Embark Studios despite the PvP extraction subgenre also showing its age. As long as a game can meaningfully iterate on an existing formula – or appear different enough from its competitors – it has a fighting chance.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why some of the knee-jerk negativity surrounding Highguard seems premature. The presence of mounts suggests there will be large maps, with Wildlight labelling the game as a “raid shooter”, meaning that it won’t ascribe to traditional game modes as seen in Overwatch. As for the visuals, which have been called generic and uninspired by online commenters, we can’t help but feel sorry for the art team. Anything particularly toonish or stylised would immediately get called out as derivative and, while some of the character designs don’t scream out to me, I like Highguard’s gunslinging/fantasy vibe.</span></p>

<p><span>Ultimately, we’ve yet to see the game in action, and we’re always willing to see what a new studio can come up with, especially one helmed by Titanfall and Apex legends veterans. The negative response to Highguard hints at a growing problem in the industry, where commentators are quick to form narratives about a game’s success without ever playing it for themselves. These are the same people who will be desperately watching Steam stats when Highguard launches, salivating at a chance to publish a “dead on arrival” takedown of the game they’ve already got saved in their drafts.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if Highguard doesn’t live up to the scorching hype levels stoked by The Game Awards, we need to give developers a chance, even if they are iterating on concepts and ideas that feel done to death.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Arguably, the biggest surprise at The Game Awards 2025 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the announcement of Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. Leaker Kurakasis had mentioned that there would be a Star Wars game whose title ended with 'Old Republic', but everyone thought it would be a new look at the Knights of the Old Republic remake.</p>



<p>Instead, viewers were treated to the unveiling of a brand new project, spearheaded by Casey Hudson, the Game Director and Producer of the original KOTOR (as well as Game Director of the Mass Effect trilogy). Hudson founded a new developer called Arcanaut Studios, headquartered in Edmonton, Alberta, with additional offices in Kelowna, British Columbia.</p>



<p>The fact is, the studio's foundation was relatively recent, having been officially dated to July 2025. This makes sense, given that Hudson had previously been busy with another studio, Humanoid Origin, which he <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-trilogy-directors-aaa-sci-fi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded years ago</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down in late 2024 due to a lack of funding</a>.</p>



<p>This realization chilled a bit of the excitement surrounding Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic as players realized it would take a long time before they could play it. It didn't help that other <span>major Star Wars game projects, such as the KOTOR remake and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-announced-by-quantic-dream-and-lucasfilm-games/" target="_blank">Quantic Dream's Star</a></span> Wars: Eclipse, suffered a similar fate: being announced way too early. Bloomberg's Jason Schreier compounded those fears in a message <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m7sj6bcoxk2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on the social network Bluesky</a>:</p>



<p><em>Last night's biggest surprise was Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, led by Casey Hudson, who directed KOTOR (and Anthem). Exciting news for lots of people… but Lucasfilm says the studio was founded this year, which means that 2030 is an optimistic guess. Maybe it'll be a PlayStation 7 game.</em></p>



<p>Schreier's guess was indeed solid on the surface, since the average development timeframe for a triple-A game is five years at the least. However, Casey Hudson himself later <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimed in on the release window</a>, telling fans to discard the 2030 rumors as the game would launch before that year.</p>



<p>Given the source, we have to trust that there is indeed a plan to get the game out in four years at the most. Is that even possible, though? Sure, depending on a couple of factors. The first is the game's scope. While the details are scant at this point (other than the project's status as a spiritual successor to KOTOR rather than a direct sequel), Arcanaut and Lucasfilm explicitly said this will be a 'narrative-driven' action RPG. </p>



<p>In current developer lingo, this definition usually suggests a tight, story-focused experience that won't feature expansive open worlds with plenty of side content and activities. In short, don't expect to be roaming vast regions of Tattooine or Coruscant or Hoth or what have you as you solve problems for fairly inconsequential citizens of the galaxy. Instead, as Hudson noted <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-trailer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his interview with the official Star Wars website</a>, the developers will focus on delivering a 'powerful, cinematic adventure driven by player agency, narrative depth, and immersive world-building'.</p>



<p>This isn't so different from the original Knights of the Old Republic game, which was relatively linear and only included around seven and a half hours of side content, according to the average playthroughs listed <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/9111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by HowLongToBeat.com</a>. With this in mind, it would not be impossible to see Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic launch at some point in 2029. Another potential accelerator could be the use of AI during development, which might certainly cut down development times if used effectively. However, it may not be well-received by some fans.</p>



<p>Even so, we have at least a few years to wait before we can play this title. Thankfully, a recent report <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the KOTOR remake is still alive and being worked on at Mad Head Games. Fingers crossed, but it should certainly launch before 2029, if all goes well. The same goes for Eclipse.</p>



<p>To round up the slate of upcoming games set in the faraway galaxy created by George Lucas, Respawn is <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making the third and final entry in the Star Wars: Jedi series</a>. The second game launched in April 2023, so we might be looking at late 2027 or early 2028 for the next installment.</p>



<p>Star Wars fans will have two new games to play next year, anyway: the newly announced arcade racing game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-the-game-awards-2025-fuse-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galactic Racer</a> and the turn-based tactics game <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zero Company</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic Director Says Game Will Release Before 2030]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-release-date/</link>
            <guid>1382452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic Director, Casey Hudson, has hit back on the rumors and speculation that his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-years-away-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game will not release until at least 2030</a>.</p>







<p>Speaking on X, Hudson said, “Don’t worry about the “not till 2030” rumors. Game will be out before then. I’m not getting any younger!”</p>



<p>Of course, the post was met with a lot of optimism from players, with some jokingly saying it means the game is confirmed to launch in November – December 2029.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-4-years-of-development-doable">Is 4 Years of Development Doable?</h2>



<p>One of the most serious questions asked after Hudson’s tweet was whether a four-year development cycle is even feasible in this day and age—Afterall, Hudson’s studio, Arcanaut Studios, only formed in the summer of this year. </p>



<p><strong>MORE GAME AWARDS:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025—Everything Announced</a></strong></p>



<p>Typically, AAA games of Star Wars: The Old Republic’s magnitude would usually take between 6 and 8 years of development. This includes the conceptualization and research of the project, which can take a couple of years. It’s possible, given Hudson’s previous work, that the game could already be good to go in terms of what it will be, and the only thing needed is the talent to make it. </p>







<p>Regardless, Hudson’s denial of the rumors in the grand scheme of things squashes negative talk of the game, and even if the game does end up releasing in 2030 and beyond, by that point… Who really cares?</p>



<div><p>On the game’s announcement, Aranaut said on the game,</p><p><strong>“Blending innovative storytelling, memorable characters, and heart-pounding combat,&nbsp;Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic&nbsp;will immerse you in an unforgettable experience where every decision deepens your journey toward the light…or the darkness</strong>.”</p></div>

            <p>One of the most headline-grabbing things about science-fiction role-playing game Exodus, beyond it looking a lot like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, is that it stars Hollywood actor Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role. He plays the role of C.C. Orlev in the game, a character still shrouded in some mystery, and you can hear his voice narrating the new trailer for the games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2025/nov/11/matthew-mcconaughey-michael-caine-ai-voice">But McConaughey recently made headlines by signing a deal that will allow his voice to be AI-generated</a> in certain situations by the company Elevenlabs, which he also invested in. Which begs the question: is it really McConaughey in Exodus or has his voice been AI-generated?</p>

<p>"No, no. Everything that's in Exodus - 100 percent of what's in Exodus - is bespoke VO recording just for us," Chad Robertson, co-founder of Exodus developer Archetype, told me in an interview. "He has a completely separate deal of his own design that he's worked out with Elevenlabs, which happens to be one of the most prominent, AI voice-generation tools, that is being used by other video game companies. Such that people could leverage his voice in non-bespoke VO sessions in a different way. He has a bunch of really strict rules around how it could be used.</p><p>"The reason I mentioned it more is that even stuff like that catches us off guard, because our engagement with Matthew is very specific. But my point in this is there's a lot more stuff that's going to evolve that way. So if we ask what our long-term studio stance [on AI] is, we want to be smart technologists, and we want to make great games. And if for cost reasons or quality reasons, that becomes something that becomes more acceptable and becomes more commonplace, I think we're gonna have to be smart and intelligent about how we adopt it ourselves. But currently we don't have plans."</p>
<blockquote><em>"We don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it, but we reserve the right to change that"</em></blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, I asked Robertson specifically whether generative AI was used in Exodus' development at all and it's not. "With respect to the game, we don't have plans to use generative AI for any elements of it," he said, "but we reserve the right to change that if things require it to get the game at the quality that we need it, or the timeline or budget that we need. But currently that's not our plan.</p>
<p>"We, as creators, have a ton of respect for art in general. And don't you know it's a hot topic with our team when it's come up - it consumes some of our team meetings every Friday. So our team is super passionate about it. But there's an evolution happening in the industry where I think it's going to become more prevalent and become something that everybody's facing."</p><p>Archetype unveiled a new trailer for Exodus during The Game Awards, giving us another montaged look at the sci-fi adventure in which we'll try to escape a tech-related plague by assembling a ship and crew of our own. In the game, we'll play as hero Jun Aslan, a seemingly regular person who happens to be compatible with ancient and powerful tech they'll find through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exodus-release-date-moved-thirsty-compaions-mass-effect-comparisons">Exodus is a game that looks and sounds like Mass Effect, including in how it has some "thirsty" companion romances</a>, and it's made by many former BioWare developers, including the lead writer of Mass Effect 1 and 2, Drew Karpyshyn. Chad Robertson also hails from BioWare.</p>
<p>Despite the similarities, however, there are some key differences, including most notably time dilation. The nearer to the speed of light you travel at, the more time will pass, allowing you to see first-hand the long-term consequences of your actions. I'll write more about this next week.</p>

<p>With prices ranging from $169.95 to $299.95, the keyboards feature key art from the Sonic franchise, including the Blue Blur himself, Shadow, an 'Escape from the City' theme, and a more retro-style approach.</p>
<p>The Dreamcast model is the most luxury of the bunch, sporting a slick, minimal design and new Dampening Plus technology, with layers that mute everything but the keystroke and provide extra stability.</p>
<p>You can also utilise the Higround Forge browser app to completely customise lighting and keybinds, with profiles and settings stored on the keyboard hardware.</p>
<p>So let's take a closer look at each model...</p>

            <p>Dispatch developer AdHoc has told Eurogamer there's one super-rare game-state that no player has unlocked or achieved yet - something it knows because it has back-end statistics that track these things.</p>
<p>It's to do with a statistic that reflects how you played as Robert, the main character, which is given at the conclusion of the game.</p>
<p>"At the end of the game, we did a little personality test thing, where it's like, 'your Robert was an everyman', based on how you played the game. Or 'your Robert was an anti-hero'," studio co-founder Nick Herman told me.</p>
<p>"There's actually... I've only seen three show up, and there's four. We know the fourth one is actually really hard to get, intentionally. That's just a piece of content I have never seen, and we have stats on the back-end that show that maybe no one's ever gotten it.</p><p>"It's based on gameplay performance," Herman added. "Have you perfected the game, essentially, is what that is. I don't know that anyone's done that." And it's based on perfecting non-randomly generated outcomes in the game, by the way. "We focused it on the non-RNG elements," said Herman.</p>

<p>However, there's a catch. There is a chance that someone <em>has</em> played Dispatch in such a way that they should earn this elusive game-state, or response, but it simply isn't registering their efforts correctly. "It might just be a bug," Herman said, casually. "It's so hard to do regardless that we were like, 'Well of course no one's gotten it,' but it's probably a bug."</p>
<p>"We have a permutation that you have not seen because you're not allowed to see it because we broke it," added fellow co-founder Pierre Shorette, the writer of the game, laughing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone">Dispatch, a superhero workplace comedy, raced to 2m sales earlier this year</a>, proving that an appetite for Telltale-like episodic series was still very much there. Attention now turns to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about">a possible Dispatch sequel, or second series</a>; to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-writer-regrets-cutting-sex-scenes">potential reinstated sex scenes</a>; and to The Game Awards this week, in which Dispatch is nominated for Best Debut Indie Game. These are all things I spoke to Herman and Shorette about at much greater length. Look out for a fuller interview soon.</p>
