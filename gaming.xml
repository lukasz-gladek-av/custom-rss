		<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition was supported with no less than eight DLC packs but you will not be getting a single one for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The news was confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone who say Bioware have now moved all their staff on to working on the next Mass Effect game.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/06/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dreadwolf-single-player/">previously known as Dragon Age 4 and then as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> – is the long-awaited return of one of BioWare’s most popular RPG series. The game is currently sitting at ratings of 70 for the PC version, 84 for the PS5 version, and 93 for the Xbox version over on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Metacritic,</a> our review is still in progress.</p>


<p>The next Mass Effect title was teased back on N7 Day, 7th November 2022, when Bioware said “Pre-production development has been proceeding very well. The team, comprised of Mass Effect franchise veterans as well as some amazing new additions to BioWare™, has grown steadily! They’ve been hard at work crafting new characters and locations that you’ll love, as well as revisiting many that you’ll remember.”</p>
<p>The game is set to follow on the from the original trilogy and will be a single player game.&nbsp; In the interview with Rolling Stone veteran Bioware creative director John Epler notes that while he likes multiplayer games, they are very hard to make.</p>
<p>“It’s possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game.<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV </em>does an excellent job,” he said. “Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world, and the world changes.” For games like <em>Dragon Age</em>, the consequences of a player’s choice are intended to impact the narrative moving forward, but for a multiplayer game, it isn’t quite as simple. For example, one player could choose to save a certain person from their fate while another could do the opposite.”</p>


<p>“It’s funny, because the games I play the most on my personal time are actually multiplayer games,” he says. “But when it comes to crafting these worlds and crafting the experiences, I love the focus that single-player can give you.”</p>
<p>With N7 day just round the corner, maybe we will get an update then.</p>

Well, then you deserve to celebrate making it to this downtime with another bunch of free games, and that’s precisely what Prime Gaming offers. An extension of Amazon Prime, Prime Gaming bestows subscribers with waves of free games every month, and these titles can be redeemed on a number of different storefronts. Up for grabs at the start of November, 2024 is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-s-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-kotaku-review-1847927644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-s-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-kotaku-review-1847927644"><em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mafia-definitive-edition-is-a-great-remake-of-a-clunky-1845182811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-definitive-edition-is-a-great-remake-of-a-clunky-1845182811"><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition</em></a></span>. But don’t worry, the lineup only gets more diverse as the month continues.</p><h2 id="h255"><a id=""></a><em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em></h2><p><em>Mafia</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> are both sorely overlooked. You’ve likely heard it a dozen times before, but <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy </em>is actually a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-surprises-of-2021-1848226625&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-surprises-of-2021-1848226625">really great</a></span> squad-based third-person shooter. It’s like a more simplified and linear <em>Mass Effect </em>game starring the oddball crew of the popular Marvel movies. These versions of the characters feel way more profound and you’ll get to know them better thanks to the game’s significantly longer runtime compared to the film. It’s a wonderful title to enjoy over the course of a lazy weekend. You will not regret picking it up for free.</p><h2 id="h256"><a id=""></a><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition</em></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mafia-remake-is-a-complete-overhaul-of-the-original-gam-1843544095&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-remake-is-a-complete-overhaul-of-the-original-gam-1843544095"><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition</em> </a></span>is a remake of the original 2002 game which would later spawn a franchise. It is, in fact, a ground-up recreation of the first title with modern graphics, expansions on the original content, and mechanics borrowed from recent installments. This remake even features new cast recordings as well as an original score. I’ve always had a soft spot for the <em>Mafia </em>games; they’re much moodier than the open-world sandboxes of the <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>series and are focused much more on realism and simulation. The original 2002 <em>Mafia </em>is a bit of a clunky classic, but the free remake on offer here seems like a great opportunity to jump into the series, especially with a n<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-the-old-country-trailer-gamescom-hangar-13-2k-1851627259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-the-old-country-trailer-gamescom-hangar-13-2k-1851627259">ew prequel set in Italy coming in 2025</a></span>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b759a123113e86c62071a5f3d8eb8aa3" data-recommend-id="image://b759a123113e86c62071a5f3d8eb8aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Mafia: Definitive Edition showing the player character walking down the street with a Tommy gun in hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Mafia: Definitive Edition showing the player character walking down the street with a Tommy gun in hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hangar 13 / 2K Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b759a123113e86c62071a5f3d8eb8aa3" data-recommend-id="image://b759a123113e86c62071a5f3d8eb8aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Mafia: Definitive Edition showing the player character walking down the street with a Tommy gun in hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h257"><a id=""></a><em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Super Meat Boy</em> and more games coming for free in November</h2><p>The rest of the month features a smattering of great games. On November 7, Arkane’s excellent immersive sim <em>Dishonored </em>will be coming to subscribers with all of its DLC included, as well as <em>Close to the Sun</em>, a game I remember as feeling like <em>Bioshock </em>if it were made by an indie studio. </p><p>Later in the month, subscribers will also get <em>Tomb Raider: Anniversary</em>, the cooperative cooking game <em>Overcooked</em>, the space-faring epic <em>Elite Dangerous</em> and the daunting 2D platformer <em>Super Meat Boy</em>. At the very end of November, you’ll even be able to snag <em>Jurassic World Evolution</em>, a management game that allows you to build your own dinosaur-filled theme parks. Maybe this time, the park won’t erupt into violence. </p><p>Suffice to say, there’s a lot coming this month for Prime Gaming subscribers. Here’s everything that’s being rolled out, and the platforms that the games will be available on. </p><p><strong>Available now:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li></ul><p><strong>Available November 7:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Dishonored - Definitive Edition (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Duck Paradox (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Close to the Sun (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Disney•Pixar Cars (Amazon Games App)</em></li><li><em>Bang Bang Racing (Amazon Games App)</em></li><li><em>Snakebird Complete (Epic Games Store)</em></li></ul><p><strong>Available November 14:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Ms. Holmes: The Case of the Dancing Men Collector’s Edition (Amazon Games App)</em></li><li><em>Chasm: The Rift (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>House of Golf 2 (Epic Games Store)</em></li><li><em>Tomb Raider: Anniversary (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Blade of Darkness (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li></ul><p><strong>Available November 21:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Max: The Curse of Brotherhood (Amazon Games App)</em></li><li><em>Overcooked: Gourmet Edition <strong>(</strong>GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Gloomy Tales: One-Way Ticket Collector’s Edition <strong>(</strong>Legacy Games Code)</em></li><li><em>Super Meat Boy (Epic Games Store)</em></li><li><em>Moonscars (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>RIOT - Civil Unrest (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li></ul><p><strong>Available November 27:</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Elite Dangerous (Epic Games Store)</em></li><li><em>Sir Whoopass - Immortal Death (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li><li><em>Jurassic World Evolution (Epic Games Store)</em></li><li><em>Mystery Case Files: The Dalimar Legacy Collector’s Edition (Amazon Games App)</em></li><li><em>Shogun Showdown (GOG<strong>)</strong></em></li></ul><hr><p>There’s nothing stopping you from picking up all of these games (which I heartily recommend) but if you’re looking for a particularly enjoyable time, I say go with <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. It’s a breezy title that rarely ever gets to be so complex, making it approachable. It’s also both funny and touching, making it a perfect game to chip away at in your free time when you can’t really decide what it is you want to do or enjoy! You will not regret the ride this game will take you on.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This includes a new starting farm layout that lets you get an early start on raising chickens, a few new seasonal crops for easy money in the early game, and optional micro-festivals that provide some useful rewards for a starting player.</p><p>At this point, however, <em>Stardew </em>is such a pillar of the genre that it can be mildly intimidating. It’s developed a legion of fans, some of whom are hardcore enough that they’ve gotten the game down to a science, and that’s chased off some newcomers. If you’re looking to start<em> Stardew Valley </em>in 2024, here are some useful things to know beforehand.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-recommend-id="image://769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-recommend-id="image://769455c291937a8b945933c5508001de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the first things you notice when you play <em>Stardew </em>in 2024 is that over the last four years, much of the “cozy” subgenre of gaming was specifically made as a reaction to it. Many more recent games such as <em>Fae Farm</em> or <em>My Time at Sandrock </em>have made decisions that address <em>Stardew</em>’s weak points or focus more heavily on its strengths.</p><p>A particular sticking point is the beginning of the game, as <em>Stardew </em>starts you very low on what another game might call its power curve. You initially have little stamina, don’t know any of the good cooking recipes yet, and are usually forced to keep yourself going through the day by eating random things that you found on the ground. Spring 1, Year 1 farming in <em>Stardew </em>is done on a steady diet of dandelions.</p><p>As you get more established, you slowly get better options, more stamina, and time-saving machines like sprinklers, but every day in <em>Stardew </em>is still a race to get as much done as possible before you’re forced to go to bed. There’s a reason why long-time fans all have strategies that revolve around pure efficiency.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-recommend-id="image://313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-recommend-id="image://313e445d5b32d8b23fffbb97c5dca576" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite that, however, <em>Stardew </em>is built in such a way that you might have inconveniences, but not setbacks. There aren’t many problems that you can’t fix, solve, or recover from.</p><p>The worst-case scenario in <em>Stardew </em>tends to be missing out on seasonal opportunities. For example, it’s possible to lose your initial shot at growing one of the most valuable crops, strawberries, as you can only buy the seeds from Pierre during the Egg Festival on Spring 13. If you don’t know that, you’ll have to either wait until the next year or hope a Strawberry shows up on the<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Traveling_Cart&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Traveling_Cart" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> traveling cart</a></span>.</p><p>That’s no great trial, however, and there’s no way to do <em>Stardew </em>“wrong.” It’s a game that’s meant to wrap itself around you, and anything you don’t want to do will usually patiently wait until you’re ready. Despite its occasionally hectic daily schedule, you’re meant to take this at your own pace.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-recommend-id="image://811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-recommend-id="image://811f20dde822714652cf2082d46ce873" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>To “win” <em>Stardew Valley</em>, you have to get 100% Perfection, which involves mastering most of the game’s individual mechanics, minigames, and exploration challenges, as well as becoming every single villager’s best friend. It can take quite a while to get anywhere close to Perfection, especially if there are parts of the game that you simply don’t care to engage with.</p><p>One of the biggest hurdles, however, is just earning straight cash. You’ll be fine for everyday expenses if you’re smart about which crops you focus on (potatoes, strawberries, blueberries, melons, pumpkins), but many of the endgame challenges in <em>Stardew</em> involve making fat stacks. If you want that elusive 100%, you need 14 million gold to build all four Obelisks and the Gold Clock.</p><p>The time-tested way to become a cash-money millionaire in <em>Stardew </em>usually involves turning your farm and/or beach house into a production facility for high-quality starfruit wine. As you’re going about your business in the mid-to-late game, it’s worth having Robin build you a storage shed, and then filling it with kegs and preserve jars. When you’re ready to cash out, install a bunch of casks in your farmhouse basement, age all your stockpiled starfruit wine in them, and practice using terms like “mouthfeel” and “oaky” like you know what they mean.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-recommend-id="image://b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->ConcernedApe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-recommend-id="image://b643a53411458dd02758f186a4545f2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Stardew Valley gameplay" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you’re coming back to <em>Stardew </em>after a while or you’re a new player, it’s worth pointing out one of the biggest new additions to the game in patch 1.6.</p><p>Once you’re updated to 1.6, a new cave appears in the forest south of your farm, about halfway down the cliffside to the east.

The five ways refer to your five skills: farming, mining, combat, foraging, and fishing. When you reach level 10 in all five, you can now enter the cave. This sets you up to unlock a number of new tools and passive buffs that grant you several solid quality-of-life bonuses for <em>Stardew</em>’s endgame. This includes the new “trinket” equipment slot, some high-end blueprints like the Treasure Totem, a new iridium-quality fishing rod and scythe, and the ability to find valuable Golden Mystery Boxes.</p><p>There are quite a few other things to see and do in patch 1.6, but the skill mastery system should be your first stop. It makes you better at all the things you were already doing and really smooths out <em>Stardew</em>’s endgame.

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance is perhaps the most realistic medieval RPG ever made. It debuted in 2018 after several years of development that began with a Kickstarter project. In the time it has been on the market, ‘KCD’ has done remarkably well, and the developer, Warhorse Studios, has just revealed that the game has sold a whopping 8 million copies.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-henry-s-come-to-see-us">Henry’s Come To See Us!</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance is a phenomenal RPG set in a real-world location – and it even sticks to events that <strong>actually happened</strong>. In this wonderful game, players lose themselves in an adventure that could last hundreds of hours and is extremely accurate in its representation of the period.</p>



<p>From true-to-life sword combat mechanics to the need to scavenge, barter, and bargain to survive, Kingdom Come Deliverance is a brilliant game for anyone wanting to immerse themselves in 15th-century Bohemia.</p>



<p>On social media, Warhorse Studios shared a brief celebration of the latest milestone:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In February, the team at Warhorse Studios will release Kingdom Come Deliverance II, a direct follow-on from the 2018 title that promises to improve on every angle of the first game.</p>



<p>When I was at Gamescom, I was fortunate enough to play an extended, press-only trial of the game, and being a fan of the first game, I was blown away. It’s everything I hoped for – and I’ll leave it at that.</p>

But the demo was built in a version of the <em>Halo</em> engine that no longer exists, and the assets were not compatible with any other existing versions of <em>Halo 2</em>.</p><p>“This put us in a bit of a quandary,” <em>Halo</em> senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters said. “Even the original executable is difficult to work with, as you need an Xbox developer kit to get it to boot, which is in increasingly short supply even within the studio. But now, in 2024, we have the Digsite-developed tools to analyze and automate up-porting old assets, and the unearthed knowledge to know why <a title="Companies > Bungie [224 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> built things the way they did in the demo.”</p><p>Peters continued, “Steven Garcia (known to the community as General_101) was vital in getting this scenario stood up and even improved over the original. He was a one-man army and did a significant chunk of the work in developing tools, updating scripts, and even arting the levels. Digsite team members Ludus, Neo Te Aika, Sean T, xScruffyDaSasquatchx, and Killzone then provided finishing touches to replicate the original demo experience and test for bugs. Without them, we would probably have only had a rather unceremonious drop of raw assets and that was it.”</p><p>Xbox Game Studios did not announce any plans to release the level for the Xbox Series or PC (<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/halo-the-master-chief-collection/9mt8ptgvhx2p" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>) versions of the game.</p><!-- AD: content -->

feedback from internal analytics, user tests, reviews, media feedback, crash reports, and more, Rechner said. He also noted that Ubisoft has seen the feedback on YouTube, Reddit, Discord, and other social media sites. "We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you're enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you," Rechner said.</p><p>Ubisoft has so far released three title updates for Star Wars Outlaws that have addressed some of the "biggest concerns" from fans, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-effort-to-save-star-wars-outlaws-continues-with-huge-patch/1100-6526900/" data-ref-id="1100-6526900">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-update-aims-to-make-stealth-missions-less-frustrating/1100-6527363/" data-ref-id="1100-6527363">improvements for the game's stealth missions.</a> That said, Rechner explained there are three additional areas the team is looking to address. The first of these is adding "more depth and excitement" to the combat systems with the aim of "further rewarding" tactics and precision.</p><p>The second area is stealth. Rechner said includes "improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection," along with "choice in how you want to approach each encounter." Third, Rechner said the team is trying to refine the control experience, including "improving the reliability of cover," as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. In general, Rechner said Ubisoft wants the controls overall to be more consistent.</p><p>Rechner said Ubisoft will provide "more specific details" about these changes and more in the coming weeks. The next title update, Title Update 1.4, will launch on November 21, alongside the game's debut on Steam and the launch of the game's first story expansion, Wild Card.</p><p><i>"</i>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us," Rechner said.</p><p>After Star Wars Outlaws launched in August, Ubisoft said the game's sales were worse than expected, and noted that its teams would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">"fully mobilized" to improve the game.</a></p><p>It was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/18oNmwEFQzGDu0TYVOAcJN/julian-gerighty-appointed-executive-producer-for-the-division-brand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">always the plan</a> for Gerighty to move on to become the executive producer of The Division franchise after Star Wars Outlaws was released.

		<p>Nacon and studio KT Racing have announced&nbsp; free in-game items for those who purchased and played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown before the first major patch which was released on &nbsp;September 30th 2024.&nbsp; The goodies are compensation as the game suffered server issues when it launched with a reported 55% of players failing to log in to the game.</p>
<p>“NACON and studio KT Racing have decided to offer them two unique items: an exclusive special edition of the&nbsp;1986 Porsche 911 Carrera Coupe custom-built as an&nbsp;“Adventurer” edition, fully equipped for the island’s off-road roads, as well as a pack of 5 exclusive stickers for customizing their cars,” said Nacon in a press release.&nbsp; “This compensation will be offered to all players who played Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown before the arrival of the first major patch, which was released on September 30. These items will be automatically added to players’ inventories in December, for the opening of Season 2.”</p>


<p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, November 5th, the second patch will be released. “This update primarily focuses on graphical enhancements for PS5,” comment Nacon. “The patch also optimizes game performance on PC and Xbox Series. Additionally, it includes network upgrades, improved peripheral compatibility, and numerous bug fixes.”</p>
<p>“We understand your frustration, given the difficulties that have been encountered during the launch of TDUSC. We are sorry for this situation and we want to acknowledge your concerns. We genuinely appreciate your patience and commitment to Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown.”</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown review</a>,&nbsp; Stefan said, “After years and years of waiting, Test Drive Unlimited is back. Kind of. Solar Crown is an open world racer for gamers who don’t need constant gratification, but can be patient and work toward a key unlock and crowning car. It’s just a shame that the game at launch will require patience while KT Racing fix, improve and hopefully expand it to meet more of its potential.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch.1027191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-has-double-the-amount-of-enhanced-games-than-ps4-pro-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PS5 Pro is fast approaching, and with it comes a ton of enhanced games that will be released on the console, offering <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-pssr-is-a-game-changer-to-bring-visual-fidelity-to-the-next-level-says-insomniac/">new graphical fidelity</a> options and upgrades to make it a worthwhile experience to play on that console rather than the ordinary PS5. The list of PS5 Pro-enhanced games is already pretty hefty and continues to grow. As a matter of fact, it's double the list of games that the PS4 Pro had when it launched. When the PS4 Pro launched, it had over 40 enhanced games, with the console being released in November 2016. So far, the PS5 Pro has a <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/11/03/ps5-pro-enhanced-games-double-than-ps4-pro-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed list of over 80 games</a> thus far, with the console officially launching on November 7.</p>
<p>There is already quite a hefty list of games that will be available on the PS5 Pro, with quite a few of them bound to be a smoother experience overall than the experience you'd ordinarily have on the PS5. This is due to updates and hardware that will help make the game run smoother. While PC has generally been seen as the advantageous platform to choose from, in modern days, games typically run better on console at launch, as there is a lot less to consider when patching the game and making updates for compatibility.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no guarantee that games will look or even feel better on the PS5 Pro, but you'd certainly hope so, as that is what you're paying for. It will be a matter of "wait and see," but there is a great catalog of games available for those who are planning on picking up the new and improved PS5. Some of these games had some issues on the PS5 when the titles were released, so it'll be interesting to see that once the PS5 Pro comes out, they will have improved performance after all. It's worth noting that some of these games haven't been released yet, so the PS5 Pro enhancements at launch apply to the launch of the game in this case rather than the console.</p>
<p>Games such as Baldur's Gate 3, Demon's Souls, Dragon's Dogma 2, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered are some that will be ready for the PS5 Pro when it launches and will provide new graphical updates and smoother performance. Considering that there were complaints about performance for both Dragon's Dogma 2 and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, it will certainly be interesting to see if the PS5 Pro version of the game helps to improve it in any way.</p>

H2<em> </em>With Sprinkles and <em>Halo 2: Uncut</em> don’t just aim to expand the original game, but they aspire to do so by restoring content that was seen in previous builds of the original, with new weapons, vehicles, and redesigned encounters.</p><h2 id="h3285"><a id=""></a><em>H2</em> With Sprinkles</h2><p>I’d argue that for every addition <em>Halo 2</em> made to the game’s core gameplay, it also suffered from some not-so-great omissions. Chief among them? The damn Assault Rifle.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-recommend-id="image://cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Master Chief fires an Assault Rifle during the opening of Halo 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Master Chief fires an Assault Rifle during the opening of Halo 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Halo Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-recommend-id="image://cc0d069b44788f60268c04a3f5970c46" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Master Chief fires an Assault Rifle during the opening of Halo 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>’s Assault Rifle doesn’t necessarily perform like a modern <em>Call of Duty</em> bullet hose—it’s a bit more old-school and less accurate than what you’d find in a shooter today. But the gun’s thunderous bullet output, unique visual stylings and readable on-weapon bullet counter made for a signature look that shouldn’t have waited until <em>Halo 3</em> to rejoin the series. <em>Halo 2</em> yanked the assault rifle in favor of the more dull-looking and crappier-sounding SMG. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3005851002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3005851002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">H2 With Sprinkles fixes that</a></span> by adding the Assault Rifle back, thank god. And I’d argue it’s not a redundant admission next to the SMG. The presence of the Assault Rifle means that you can go back to a run-and-gun style of gameplay with high bullet output that doesn’t sacrifice grenade throws like dual-wielding an SMG does. </p><p>There are a few other notable new guns too: Alongside the traditional three-round-burst Battle Rifle, H2 With Sprinkles adds a single-shot Battle Rifle, as seen in the very <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.halopedia.org/Halo_2_E3_demo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.halopedia.org/Halo_2_E3_demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first demo for the game in 2003</a></span>. There’s also a satisfying automatic, portable plasma cannon that deals plenty of damage before needing to cool down. </p><figure id="" data-id="50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-recommend-id="image://50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Scorpion tank takes aim at a Covenant transport vehicle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Scorpion tank takes aim at a Covenant transport vehicle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Halo Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-recommend-id="image://50b67046d9faeeb931fa59d1dc7d2024" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Scorpion tank takes aim at a Covenant transport vehicle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Perhaps my favorite addition, however, is the boost in friendly NPC forces when you land on Earth. Compared to <em>Combat Evolved</em>’s larger spaces, particularly on levels like “The Silent Cartographer” and “Assault on the Control Room,” <em>Halo 2</em> sometimes feels a little too empty, with smaller-scale battles. Extra marines and vehicles, however, make the entire tone of the fight on Earth feel more epic. This is particularly the case with the beach battles on “Outskirts,” and the vehicular showdown toward the end of “Metropolis.”</p><p>There are a few rough edges to be aware of, however.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hannah-telle-interview-life-is-strange-double-exposure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is finally here, bringing Max Caulfield back to our screens after almost a decade. Aside from a brief reappearance in the Before the Storm ‘prequel episode’, this is the first major appearance of Max Caulfield in a Life is Strange game since the first title debuted in 2015.</p>



<p>I had the phenomenal opportunity to sit down with Hannah Telle, Max Caulfield’s actor, to talk about the impact of returning to this iconic character after so many years.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video interview:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="INTERVIEW: Hannah Telle Talks Life is Strange: Double Exposure" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahYHgKBFat4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-max">Return of the Max</h2>



<p>Double Exposure is already becoming a fan-favourite title studded with twists, turns, and emotional sequences—much like the other games in the series. It was assembled by Deck Nine over three years and is a direct follow-up to the episodic game released in 2015.</p>



<p>The difference is, that this is a one-shot game – there are chapters but no iterative episodes to download or wait for.</p>



<p>Hannah walked me through the changes she had to take on board to ensure that an ‘older’ Max Caulfield was properly represented in Double Exposure:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was so excited that people wanted to see more Max and that she was going to get to continue her story. I love this character and I hold her very dear to my heart.</p>



<p>I knew that there would be a lot of people who had very strong opinions about what they thought Max would be like as an older person. I had a lot of pressure and wanted to make sure that the fans would be happy. </p>



<p>I also wanted to make sure that I stayed true to this character’s organic trajectory, and I really related to her journey of experiencing some success as an artist.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While many people expected a new Life is Strange title, not many could have predicted the return of Max Caulfield. In our interview, Hannah explained how she had to go off the radar and become very vague about her life as Square Enix facilitated a relocation across the country from California to Colorado to work on Double Exposure in the utmost secrecy.</p>



<p>By the end of the development cycle, Hannah had spent three years working on motion capture and various avenues of voice acting for Double Exposure’s Max Caulfield.</p>



<p>It’s not the end for Max, though. At the end of Life is Strange: Double Exposure, players are advised that the character will return in the next game – but Hannah was tight-lipped about that:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of the future, I don’t know anything, but I’m really, really excited, and I hope Max is coming back, and that we get to learn more about her future and her inner world, and I think she’s got worlds within her.</p>



<p>There’s so much to explore with her, and I’m just excited to see where she ends up. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>In case you were wondering, in a world where powers are possible, Hannah Telle would opt to become invisible at will, using that power to spy on people and be present without anyone knowing she was there. </p>

This year, major retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">Amazon</a>, Best Buy, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">Walmart</a> are all expected to offer unbeatable prices on everything from controllers to must-play games, and the deals will only ramp up as we get closer to Black Friday itself. So, what can you expect on the Xbox front this year? Here’s our preview of what to keep an eye out for, and stay tuned, as this season’s deals could be worth the wait.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Series X|S: Black Friday Console Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, Xbox Series console bundles dominated the holiday sales, especially at Walmart. While <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/11/15/xbox-black-friday-cyber-monday-2023/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft initially offered $50 off</a> select Xbox Series X and Series S consoles, many retailers took things further, rolling out even bigger discounts and bundles – like the Diablo 4 Xbox Series X bundle, which dropped to $439 and made a major splash in the sale season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This Black Friday, we’re likely to see similar deals, with Xbox consoles getting solid discounts and even better bundle options. Stay tuned for updates, and check out our guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-xbox-consoles-online">where to buy Xbox Series X and S consoles for the latest options</a>, including the new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-galaxy-black-robot-white-xbox-series-x-s">2TB Galaxy Xbox Series X</a> and 1TB Xbox Series S, which could also see holiday discounts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Last Year’s Xbox Black Friday Timeline</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In recent years, some of the best Xbox Black Friday deals have started surfacing around <strong>mid-November</strong>, with the biggest discounts dropping in the final days leading up to Black Friday. For fans of digital downloads, the Xbox Store typically joins the fray, offering deep discounts on popular franchises and exclusive digital content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Xbox’s Black Friday sales were announced on November 15, kicking off on November 17. <strong>While this year’s offers haven’t been confirmed yet</strong>, we expect a similar timeline and range of discounts. For context, here’s a snapshot of last year’s highlights:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Up to 50% off digital games</li><li>Up to 65% off select Xbox Game Studios titles</li><li>Up to 67% off select PC digital games</li><li>$50 off select Xbox Series X and Series S consoles</li><li>Up to $25 off select Xbox Wireless Controllers</li><li>Free engraving on Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 via Xbox Design Lab</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Xbox Game I'd Like to See On Sale for Black Friday</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">With its intense third-person combat and rich Warhammer lore, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2</a> has become a must-play for fans of the genre. A Black Friday deal would make it a fantastic gift option for Warhammer enthusiasts, making it a holiday highlight for any fan of brutal action and immersive storytelling.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Resident Evil 4</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The remake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-review">Resident Evil 4</a> is still going strong with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-4-ps5-deal">impressive $19.99 price reduction this week</a>. Given its acclaim as one of the best remakes in recent years, an extension or further reduction during Black Friday would be a win for players who haven’t picked it up yet.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sonic X Shadow Generations</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Just released, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> could also see early Black Friday discounts. Sega has a history of marking down recent titles, as seen with Sonic Frontiers last year. Currently priced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-on-sale-woot">$39.99 on Woot</a>, we might see an additional price cut soon. Leaker <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">billbil_kun</a> has hinted it could reach around €26.99 in Europe, which could translate to a similar discount in the US.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Elden Ring</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">A standout in gaming, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">Elden Ring</a> has gained even more depth with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion. This popular game has held its value, but Black Friday could be the perfect chance for a deal on the main game or its complete edition. Any discount would make this one of the season’s most tempting offers.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Star Wars Outlaws</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/a0XGle?object_uuid=940e9ed7-11b3-4f68-8cd8-0aabc298a665&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Star Wars Outlaws</a> has received a steady stream of updates since launch, improving performance and gameplay. A Black Friday discount would be a great opportunity for newcomers to explore Ubisoft’s expansive Star Wars universe. With updates driven by community feedback, Outlaws is shaping up to be a thrilling experience for fans of open-world sci-fi games, and a sale could make it even more accessible.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Robert's Favorite Games Played in 2024 (So Far)</h3><p>Everything I've loved playing this year, which also includes some games I revisited, and even some oldies I played for the first time. </p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Game Pass Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a hot question: Will we see any discounts on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-game-pass-deals">Xbox Game Pass during the Black Friday sales</a>? It's a tough one, as we've already seen plenty of unreal discounts on Game Pass in recent months, especially at <a href="https://zdcs.link/aepwy6?object_uuid=940e9ed7-11b3-4f68-8cd8-0aabc298a665&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1195960001.1647009307" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Woot</a>. But, Black Friday offers Microsoft a unique opportunity to ride the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-biggest-call-of-duty-launch-ever-sets-new-single-day-game-pass-sub-record">Black Ops 6 wave and launch Game Pass subscriber numbers</a> into the stratosphere. Although it's not for certain, I do anticipate Game Pass getting a discount for Black Friday, and I'm hoping it'll be something like three months of Ultimate for $30, for example. We'll just have to wait and see!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Controllers: $39 or Less for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-controller"><u>Xbox Wireless Controllers</u></a> were a hot item last Black Friday, available at a discounted price of $39, up to $25 off the regular cost. We’ve seen a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-xbox-controller-early-black-friday-deal-2024">similar deal recently crop up at Lenovo</a>, but it often quickly sells out and is limited in what colors are available. If this returns for Black Friday, and consistently stays in stock for all color variants, then this will be the best time to buy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Expandable Storage SSDs Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssds-for-xbox-series-xs">Xbox SSD expansion cards</a> are consistently one of the most popular deals console gamers are looking for over big sale events. They're expensive, so everyone who wants one is trying to find it at a reduced price. Looking at recent deals on Xbox-compatible SSDs, we expect to see 1TB cards drop to around $100-125, similar to the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-1tb-expansion-card-october-prime-day-2024">October Prime Day event</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Black Friday Shopping Tips</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before you dive into the Black Friday shopping frenzy, keep these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shopping-tips-for-black-friday-deals"><u>Black Friday shopping tips</u></a> in mind:</p><ol data-cy="list"><li><strong>Plan Your Spending</strong>: Set a budget and stick to it. Only buy games or accessories you genuinely intend to use.</li><li><strong>Create a Wishlist</strong>: Make a list of the items you want to buy and stick to it to avoid impulsive purchases.</li><li><strong>Compare Prices</strong>: Double-check deals at different retailers to ensure you're getting the best price.</li><li><strong>Act Swiftly</strong>: Exceptional deals may sell out quickly, so don't hesitate to grab them.</li><li><strong>Don't Worry If You Miss Out</strong>: If you miss a deal, it might come back on Cyber Monday or during the next Prime Day.</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for deals right now? Have a look at our roundup of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals">best PlayStation deals</a> to see the biggest discounts available today. Or, if you'd like to see what's caught our eye on other platforms, have a look at our individual roundups of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-deals">best Xbox deals</a> or our overall look at the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-game-deals">best video game deals</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals season will begin a lot sooner than that. Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance. Walmart, for example, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">announced its official sale</a> for November 11 this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

Discover what happened to Cosmopolis and our hero, and make an important choice!</li><li><strong>New Rooftops</strong> – Remember all those “coming soon” zones? Well now you’ll be able to visit all the rooftops you’ve been curious about. Plus we’ve added several bigger new locations!</li><li><strong>The Carnival</strong> – We know you’ve all been eagerly waiting to visit The Carnival since we last showed it off, and it will finally be accessible with this new update.</li><li><strong>A New Friend</strong> – In the last update, we introduced the relationship system with characters, and of course, we’ve added a new character in version 1.0! Meet Bombshell Barbara—a woman with an explosive personality who needs your help. Befriend her, help her work through her problems, and she’ll make sure nobody messes with you!</li><li><strong>Smart Tower Levels</strong> – We’ve added level three and level four of the Smart Tower, meaning you can now travel to every corner of Cosmopolis and and visit all those previously locked locations! You’ll also be able to unlock new upgrade modules, including the weather control module, solar generator, and battery upgrades, and don’t forget the enhancements for minions, batteries, and tools. Get ready to explore!</li><li><strong>Resource Progression</strong> – As technology advances, so do production methods. We’ve added a third level for the press, along with Nano-Forge—a new structure where you can create entirely new materials like techno-wood, tungsten, carbon, and reactors! And, of course, you can finally now fully upgrade all your tools to the max level!</li><li><strong>Teleports</strong> – The rooftop was already pretty big and now it’s even bigger. Moving around has become a real issue, but we have a solution: teleportation. Place one here, place another there, and voila! Mow no one will be able to keep up, except maybe the game camera.</li><li><strong>Farming, Fishing, and <a title="Genres > Cooking [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">Cooking</a></strong> – New plants and crops have arrived: cream beans and noodle grass. And you thought the cheese tree was the height of Cosmopolis agriculture? You can now upgrade the fishing rod to level three to catch four new delightful post-apocalyptic fish. And with all these new ingredients, we’re thrilled to announce the arrival of the fourth and final level of the kitchen, along with dozens of new recipes for you to try.</li><li><strong>Progression</strong> – We’ve added all the missing structure levels :level two and three for the cultivator and UV tower, level three for the biogenerator crypto farm and anti-infection spray, and, of course, level four for the barricade.</li><li><strong>Recycling</strong> – A few words about our latest addition: recycling. We’ve expanded resource recycling in the game with dismantling options now available on the workbench, farmer’s table, and synthesizer including level two and level three. All your “spam” resources (we promised we didn’t mean for them to be spam) are now integrated into the broader resource system. Pre-created resources can now also be broken down into their components.</li></ul><p>Don’t worry we’re not stopping here, we will continue improve the game as we’re already getting started on the next update for you. After all who said that version 1.0 was the end? We want to thank you for your constant trust and support whilst we’ve been developing this game. Early Access was a huge experience for us and we’re glad we didn’t disappoint, bringing the game into its full release! Mark your calendars! On November 13, 2024, we will return to Cosmopolis in a whole new way! See you in the future!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>
It's seven months since the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">massive 1.6 update</a> and developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is still introducing new features and fixes for the beloved farming life sim; and that continues with today's 1.6.9 update - released alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-version-16-console-release-date">1.6 for consoles</a> - which, among other things, adds a new friend to retrieve lost items.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, once Stardew Valley's 1.6.9 update is installed, players who've unlocked and then lost a unique item will find a special shop now materialises in the secret woods at midnight. Items that can't be re-obtained any other way will be available to purchase here for 10,000g, and Barone notes anyone can buy lost items in multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, players can now put legendary fish in fish ponds, albeit with a limit of one per pond. These will then produce legendary fish roe with fish having a unique water colour. There are also new Easter eggs, dialogue tweaks, JojoMart work portraits for Sam and Shane, and the ability to place beds and sleep in any constructed building (as long as they permit furniture). Additionally, objects dropped in water now float, meaning there's a short time to retrieve them.

<p>
That's on top of balance changes and quality of life updates, including improved automatic save game recovery and tweaks that'll resend most achievements, recipes, and important mail if players manage to miss them. Stardew Valley's 1.6.9 update is available now on PC, and <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/">full patch notes can be found on Barone's website</a>. Additionally, all 1.6.9 features are included in the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">mayonnaise-guzzling</a> 1.6 update, which arrives on consoles and mobile today.
</p><p>
Whether that's it for Stardew Valley updates remains to be seen; Barone hasn't shared his plans for the farming life sim beyond his 1.6 console release, but he did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-developer-has-not-touched-haunted-chocolatier-in-a-long-time-due-to-ongoing-update-work">previously admit</a> he'd been so "committed to finalising Stardew 1.6", he hadn't done any additional work on his next game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, "in a long time". So probably don't expect news on that anytime soon.

            <p>
Remember being told in the school playground that holding Down and A when you saw your Pokéball wobble meant you had a better chance of catching the creature inside?
</p>
<p>
It was all nonsense, obviously, but that didn't stop the conspiracies from spreading. As an avid <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> player, I've seen similar rubbish spread via word of mouth at meetups, from players who insist you'll have better luck if you quit battles at a certain time/spend money/stand on one leg, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
And so, with the launch of Pokémon TCG Pocket, it's unsurprising to see the same kinds of conspiracy theories spreading once again. Here, as you'd expect <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-focus-is-on-pack-opening-but-theres-a-promising-version-of-the-card-game-underneath">from a game essentially about paying to open digital card packs</a>, the prevailing theories are all based on how to get better cards. 
</p>
<p>
First, one that seems like it has a chance of actually working. X user MetaTradingCo has suggested using your phone's screen recording feature to capture the game's Wonder Pick shuffle, so you can play it back in slow motion and work out where specific cards land. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">𝗣𝗼𝗸𝗲́𝗺𝗼𝗻 𝗧𝗖𝗚 𝗣𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗪𝗼𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝗣𝗶𝗰𝗸 𝗛𝗮𝗰𝗸<br>1️⃣ 𝖲𝖼𝗋𝖾𝖾𝗇 𝖱𝖾𝖼𝗈𝗋𝖽 𝗌𝗁𝗎𝖿𝖿𝗅𝖾<br>2️⃣ 𝖯𝗅𝖺𝗒𝖻𝖺𝖼𝗄 𝗂𝗇 𝗌𝗅𝗈𝗐-𝗆𝗈𝗍𝗂𝗈𝗇<br>3️⃣ 𝖶𝗂𝗇 <a href="https://t.co/hKJjtGvXGE">pic.twitter.com/hKJjtGvXGE</a></p>— 𝙆𝙃𝙄𝙍𝙊 (@MetaTradingCo) <a href="https://twitter.com/MetaTradingCo/status/1852936365576786265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
Several theories spotted by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-conspiracy-theories-gacha/">ComicBook</a> include one that X user hawaiinguy808 describes as a "pretty significant glitch". 
</p>
<p>
"If you do a Wonder Pick and skip the shuffling cutscene and immediately choose the spot that had the card you want, you will get it 90 percent of the time," they wrote, posting footage of an Articuno EX card as proof. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There’s a pretty significant glitch in Pokémon TCG right now that I figured out.</p><p>If you do a wonder pick and skip the shuffling cutscene and immediately choose the spot that had the card you want, you will get it 90% of the time.</p><p>I’ve now done this with 10 rare ex’s <a href="https://t.co/FnRe2JhRRK">pic.twitter.com/FnRe2JhRRK</a></p></div>— USOVINNY🇼🇸 (@hawaiinguy808) <a href="https://twitter.com/hawaiinguy808/status/1851895072557867193?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Next up, "the folded crimp trick". This involves fondling your digital card pack until it faces sideways, then looking for a specific wrinkle in its packaging. 
</p>
<p>
"If you see it look a bit folded/wavy instead of perfectly straight, there's a hit in the pack," X user SteeloAndKri wrote. "It's not every time," they added. "Does seem to drastically increase hit rates though?"
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Holy crap. The folded crimp trick actually works. When you look at the packs, turn them sideways. Then look at the top of the pack. If you see it look a bit folded/wavy instead of perfectly straight, there's a hit in the pack. <a href="https://t.co/9JDj25HdOy">pic.twitter.com/9JDj25HdOy</a></p>— SteeloAndKri (@SteeloAndKri) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852400344690766183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 1, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
While we wait for a Pokémon theory that does actually pan out, here's a look back at how the actual Pokémon Red and Blue catching mechanics operated behind the scenes. Did you know that you didn't actually need to lower a creature's health down to 1HP for the best chance at capturing it? Now you do.

			<p>Human staff have been the victim of recent layoffs over at Netflix as they begin to close down some of their game studios. This includes their triple-A development studio in Los Angeles, which was founded by Chacko Sonny, a former Overwatch Executive Producer. However, Netflix has decided to close this studio and has now admitted that the video game division of the company is investing in generative AI. This is supposedly to "accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players." This will come like an extra kick in the teeth for those who were part of the layoffs and <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-closes-down-aaa-game-studio-that-was-working-on-a-third-person-arpg-for-pc/">the studio closure</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on LinkedIn</a>, Mike Verdu, the Vice President at GenAI for Games at Netflix, used the post to announce his new title. "I don't think I've been this excited about an opportunity in this industry since the 90s, when we saw a new game launch every few months that redefined what was possible. It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months."</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not quite certain how 'good' the AI is that is being used in game development. When it comes to generative AI that's used in artwork, it's still very obvious when the pictures are AI. Whether it be due to weird hands or same-face syndrome, there's always a level of uncanny valley. Whether this kind of thing will translate over to games as well is something that we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Verdu's statement continues with, "Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games. What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition," he says. Despite that, it doesn't make the fact that a studio has been shuttered and 35 people lost their jobs any better, especially if their plan is to replace their efforts with AI.</p>
<p>At this point it's uncertain what the plan is for the use of generative AI in the video game department over at Netflix. There is a lot of possibility and potential for it, as generative AI game engines are coming out, and the AI can be used to create concept art, voice performances, in-game dialogue and much more.</p>
<p>"I am focused on a creator-first vision for AI, one that puts creative talent at the center, with AI being a catalyst and an accelerant. AI will enable big game teams to move much faster and will also put an almost unimaginable collection of new capabilities in the hands of developers in smaller game teams," says Verdu.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the use of AI in the games industry? Do you think this move will work out for the Netflix game department? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Netflix’s <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/2869704">“Interactive Specials” page</a> lists 24 titles, but only four will remain: <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em>, <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend</em>, <em>Ranveer vs. Wild with Bear Grylls</em>, and <em>You vs. Wild.</em></p><p>The removal of the titles marks a disappointing conclusion to Netflix’s earliest efforts into interactive content. The company first launched the interactive titles in 2017 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15834858/netflix-interactive-shows-puss-in-boots-buddy-thunderstruck">with <em>Puss in Book: Trapped in an Epic Tale</em></a>, and I remember being wowed (and horrified) by paths in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"><em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em></a><em>.</em></p><div><p>In addition to specials based on franchises like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"><em>Carmen Sandiego</em></a> and <em>Boss Baby,</em> Netflix also tried ideas like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/3/22960212/netflix-daily-series-trivia-quest">a daily trivia series</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23446101/netflix-triviaverse-trivia-game-one-two-player">a trivia game you could play with a friend</a>.

I can’t tell you my thoughts on that until later this week. But I can walk you through the process of opening the box and comparing the console to the old PS5.

It’s in the spot where my base PS5 used to reside, hence the huge amount of extra space. </p><p>Overall, I’m pretty happy with the actual console’s shape, size, and feel. It seems like a premium piece of hardware and a big improvement over the base PS5. I imagine people who have owned a PS5 Slim for a bit might not be as impressed, but still, it’s nice that the Pro is theoretically the most powerful console out there, while also not taking up more space in my office. </p><p>How do games play on this thing? Well, I’ll have more on that later this week.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From a service I’d check every week in case there were new gems to install, I’ve reached the point of forgetting to look for weeks on end, so lackluster has the cycle become. However, this month’s first batch of games offers a decent range that’ll certainly take up some of my SSD space.</p><p>The headline here is obviously <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, the follow-up to the genuinely excellent return to form in 2020 for Microsoft’s extraordinarily long-running flight sim franchise. The game releases on November 19 and is included in Game Pass as part of Microsoft’s promise to stick everything third-party on there. Although now it only appears at the new eye-watering $20 per month tier, introduced in time to catch the enthusiasm accompanying <em>Black Ops 6</em>'s arriving on the subscription. </p><p>Also added to Ultimate this month is <em>Goat Simulator Remastered</em>, a remake of 2014's extremely silly <em>GTA</em>-spoof, where you play as a rag-dolling goat. It joins the sequel, oh-so-hilariously named <em>Goat Simulator 3</em>, on Game Pass. Then there’s also <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>, a spin-off from the beloved franchise, from a new studio and new publisher. It’s out tomorrow, November 5, so it’ll be on Game Pass then.</p><p>The “Standard” tier gets four games, also included for Premium payers. This really is a very decent selection of indie games, including the extremely funny <em>Turnip Boy Robs A Bank</em>, twin-stick shooter <em>Go Mecha Ball</em>, and claymation adventure <em>Harold Halibut</em>, all from this year. Then, the rather left-field arrival of the fantastic 2021 puzzle game, <em>The Rewinder</em>.</p><p>It’s an interesting demonstration of how Game Pass seems to work now. For the big ticket price, there are those brand-new, big-name games. But for the more reasonable Standard level, you’re introduced to really excellent games you might never have heard of otherwise.</p><p>Of course, there will be a second wave of announcements for Game Pass in November. Because short of yet another slip, <em>STALKER 2</em> is finally coming out, some two years later than planned and after <em>22 years</em> in development.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-reveals-why-the-game-was-delayed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay was recently addressed by the franchise’s Vice President Executive Producer, Marc-Alexis Côté. Côté addressed the franchise’s “inconsistency in quality” over the years and talked about “changing that narrative,” not just for the franchise but for the entirety of Ubisoft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the Bafta event yesterday, Marc-Alexis Côté was able to answer several questions regarding Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ delay through an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. Côté started by acknowledging that “Ubisoft’s portfolio has faced criticism in recent years for a perceived inconsistency in quality.” He speaks about how the community wishes for “more polish, more innovation and deeper engagement” from the games they release, which is helping them “to be better”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Côté explains that by delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, they have the opportunity to “change that narrative, not just for Assassin’s Creed” but for the whole of Ubisoft. Côté expands, stating that the upcoming game “has the potential to be one of the best in the franchise’s storied history”; however,&nbsp; he knows that “being amongst the best is just not enough anymore.”</p>



<p>This is why Côté decided to delay the game. The playtests and feedback “made it clear” that the game has immense potential, but it needs more time to meet the players’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the “most ambitious and complex project” for the franchise, featuring “interconnected mechanics, narrative and technology” while being released across a larger number of platforms. With the delay, the developers can “polish every aspect and set a new standard for the franchise”. The decision will reflect their “commitment to delivering an experience worthy” of their players’ time and attention on day one.</p>

Empire of the Ants – based on the Bernard Werber novel of the same name – is the first game to fully capture that beauty and wonder on modern systems, bringing the insectoid kingdom to life in a way that simply wasn’t possible before.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xJDlwPZqv28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It will give you some insight into our household that the first few hours of Empire of the Ants were accompanied by hooting, hollering, whistling and gasping. Our now-teenage son has always been fascinated by ants and other bugs and creepy crawlies, and it’s an interest that’s spread throughout the house (at times quite literally when ants have escaped from his ant farm).</p>


<p>Empire of the Ants first and greatest trick is its visuals. Utilising Unreal Engine 5, it is nearly photorealistic, and the natural landscape of woods and gardens play home to some of the most stunning ant and insect-based animations you will have ever seen. Everything is alive, everything is moving, and as the colony sets about individual tasks you can wander about as Ant 103,683rd, marvelling at just what Tower Five have created.</p>
<p>The visual magic is enhanced by the audio, in particular the orchestral soundtrack, which lends itself perfectly to magnifying the sense of wonder and drama. It’s particularly high-quality, making Empire of the Ants feel as much like an animated film or an Attenborough documentary as it does a video game.</p>


<p>You play sister Ant 103,683rd – I didn’t know that all ants are female prior to playing, and that was only the first of many things I learned along the way – and you’re the ant that everyone seems to turn to in times of need. Bel-o-kan, your home colony, is consistently under attack by outside forces, or in need of expanding and protecting its territory, and you are a very singular ant amongst many.</p>
<p>There are different mission types for you to tackle in Empire of the Ants, with platforming and RTS sections the two main options. The RTS sections see you take command of a small legion of ants. At first, you have access to a couple of units, growing as you progress, and they’re made up of Workers, Gunners and Warriors, alongside different support units, before you start to unlock more powerful variants. There’s a nice combat triangle at work here, with different units strong against different enemy types, and if you want to maximise your efficiency you need to choose the right group for the job, while also thinking about positioning them in the most useful place.</p>
<p>That’s not to say you can’t launch every unit you have at a single one to overpower it, but eventually, you’ll see a clear downside to doing so. Rather than forcing you through a bunch of menus, all of the resource and upgrade tree is centred on your nests, with the UI appearing on the ground within them. You have to directly interact with them, which later on becomes a bit tiresome, but does make you feel an integral part of this ecosystem, and that these are real locations that you can directly affect.</p>

<p>The platforming sections are tricky, particularly if you’re attempting to catch something along the way, but they become easier if you think and behave more like an ant, feeling out your way across leaves and up stems rather than trying to rush across without any thought. They’re very rewarding when you get them right, and I never tired of leaping from rock to rock on my way to the destination, not least because of 103,683rd’s bum wiggling each time you do.</p>
<p>There a few foibles to Empire of the Ants that start to nag the longer you spend with the game. One of them is the visual presentation of the menus and UI, which just feel a little lifeless and low-rent compared to the stunning visuals in-game. The other is controlling your ant who, as an ant, is capable of sticking to whatever surface they’re walking on. This is great for traversing logs, branches, leaves and trees, but you can often find yourself upside down and turned around, and not quite sure which way is forward or back. You do get better at it, but it never completely goes away. Fortunately, neither of these things is a dealbreaker.</p>
<p>Empire of the Ants is largely a very tranquil game, punctuated by the more action-packed RTS sections. It’s often just you and nature, with the gentle music being replaced by the sounds of crickets and distant birdsong. I don’t think it’ll be for everyone, but I really enjoyed each section’s alternating atmosphere. That said, it doesn’t hold your hand, so you’re often left to explore and figure things out for yourself, which is actually refereshing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big sales barrier just a few months before the sequel is due to launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has sold eight million copies since launching back in 2018, which works out at more than a million copies a year (on average, at least; the studio doesn't break down when those sales occurred, of course).</p>

<p>This also means&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>has managed to sell around two million copies in around nine months; back in February, it was announced that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-six-million">crossed the six million mark</a>. Looks like Warhorse's RPG really is a steady seller.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m-battle.jpg?itok=Xx-RyetO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m-battle.jpg?itok=4wRzL0CH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>are (kingdom) coming along nicely.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>'s new sales milestone arrives as Warhorse gears up to release the sequel, which was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-leak">announced back in April this year</a>&nbsp;(after being ignominiously and accidentally leaked by IGN, that is).</p>

<p>Originally due to arrive this year,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>will instead be launching on February 11th; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay">delayed back in August</a>&nbsp;owing to a need for "a tiny bit more time" on Warhorse's part.</p>

<p>When it does arrive, however,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is promising just as weighty and lengthy an RPG as its predecessor. In late August, it was revealed that the game's script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words">will have over two million words</a>, so if you like a lot of dialogue and text in your RPGs, you're in luck.</p>




<p>As for the original&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaimed-open-world-rpg-kingdom-come-deliverance-coming-to-nintendo-switch">ported to Nintendo Switch</a> earlier this year, which means it's now possible to play the RPG on all major platforms (and I'd recommend you do so if you want to be fully prepared for the followup).</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/379430/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-CUSA07238_00-KCDGAME010000000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance/BNBWFH89FCF1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-royal-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it's also playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility. The sequel is due out on February 11th, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-preview-bigger-better-and-more-approachable">our preview of it here</a> if you want to know how it's shaping up.</p>

That’s because people desperately hunting for an EX Charizard or Misty trainer will take any advantage they can get, even if it’s 100 percent made up.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,192995,193974" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The free-to-play mobile <em>Pokémon</em> trading card sim <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837">revolves around opening booster packs</a></span>. Every pack contains five cards, with disclosed odds about what’s likely to drop. A slowpoke or Rattata is many times more likely to appear than a Blastoise or Raichu. The special, more powerful EX cards of existing fan-favorites like Pikachu and an Mewtwo, and alt-art cards with larger illustrations, are especially hard to get. </p><p>But opening each booster pack is more than just a tap on the screen. <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> will generate a bunch of booster packs at once in a virtual carousel and let you peruse them at your leisure, flipping them back and forth before you decide to pick one and swipe to rip off the top of the wrapper. That’s where a new mass conspiracy about “wrinkled” packs with “bent” corners comes in. </p><p>The theory took hold shortly after <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s launch on October 30, when viral posts began to claim that opening packs with visual irregularities in their virtual wrappers were giving them outsized numbers of rare and powerful <em>Pokémon</em> cards. Japanese X user Jedis_tm <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Jedis_tm/status/1852035356801085939&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Jedis_tm/status/1852035356801085939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was the first one I saw</a></span> to begin circulating the idea on October 31, encouraging players to scour their booster pack options for ones with any slight twists, wrinkles, or bent edges in the wrappers when the packs are rotated on their side:</p><p>Jedis_tm wasn’t completely convinced of the alleged discovery. “This may not be a guaranteed hit, so consider yourself lucky if you get it,” they wrote in a follow-up tweet, according to the platform’s translation. Even some who have mocked the idea as obviously bunk have been pulled in by the alluring possibility that maybe, just maybe, it does somehow impact the card pulling odds in their favor. “NVM IT’S NOT EVERY TIME,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852403677371277544&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SteeloAndKri/status/1852403677371277544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another user. “Does seem to drastically increase hit rates though??”</p><p>Even people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghks1c/is_it_true_that_if_a_pack_has_a_crease_at_the_top/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ghks1c/is_it_true_that_if_a_pack_has_a_crease_at_the_top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the game’s subreddit</a></span> aren’t sure what to believe at the moment. “done it twice and got jack shit both times so idk,” wrote one player. “Definitely a better chance. Got 2 exs out of 4 curved packs,” responded another. Others believe the entire carousel doesn’t matter at all and that the cards in a pack are decided the second it’s selected. One player recently claimed to have seen everything their friend was going to pull <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj82tq/cards_in_packs_are_predetermined_wonderpick/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gj82tq/cards_in_packs_are_predetermined_wonderpick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by checking their Wonder Pick as it was happening</a></span>. </p><p>Anecdotal reports can’t really tell us anything meaningful about statistical probabilities on the whole, but it can activate that little voice in the back of your brain that says, “Well this is obviously completely made up...but what if it isn’t?” I’ve taken to checking every booster pack I open for wrinkles now, and have yet to get any startlingly good pulls that left me convinced it was making a difference. In fact, I’ve personally gotten more EX cards from packs I <em>didn’t</em> check beforehand for bent corners.</p><p>And yet I’m still doing it, because that’s what happens when people’s <em>Pokémon</em> fandom encounters the unintuitive black box of statistical mathematics. Even if there’s no truth to the conspiracy whatsoever, it makes the lizard part of my brain feel better while trying to navigate the whole probability-based encounter. It’s the same reason I still hop over cracks in the sidewalk and still held down the B button while trying to catch Gigantamax in <em>Pokémon Sword</em> and <em>Shield</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
