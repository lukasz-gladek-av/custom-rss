			<p>While we wait for 2K and Cloud Chamber's <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-4-in-development-since-2015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BioShock 4</a>, a stunning new graphical showcase of 2010's BioShock 2 has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC2Ttbm8m8I" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a>.</p>
<p>Created by German YouTuber 'Digital Dreams', this new showcase shows 2K's Bioshock 2 running in 8K resolution at 60FPS on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU combined with an AMD Ryzen 9 7950x CPU. For this showcase, the YouTuber used '<a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CompleteRT</a>' Ray Tracing ReShade shader that adds Ray Traced Diffuse Illumination as well as Ray Traced Reflections. "<em>One of the most advanced&nbsp;<strong>Screen space Ray Tracing</strong> Shaders, lets you add [Global illumination], [Ambient Occlusion], Matte, and Glossy Reflections to your favorite games using Reshade</em>", the description of this Ray Tracing shader reads.</p>
<p>As expected on this setup, the game runs on the highest-possible settings, and the results are pretty spectacular, especially for a 14-year-old title - Rapture has never looked this great. Check out the new BioShock 2 showcase below and judge for yourself:</p>
<p><iframe title="[8K60] Bioshock 2 - CompleteRT -  ultra Settings BeyondallLimits - ULTRA GRAPHICS SHOWCASE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tC2Ttbm8m8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Released in 2010 for PC and the available consoles at that time, the PS3 and Xbox 360, BioShock 2 is considered a worthy sequel to 2007's BioShock. Some even consider the sequel better than the 2007 original due to the improved gameplay and combat. "BioShock represented a watershed moment in the gaming industry when it illustrated that games, like feature films, can be viewed as art - both in art design and in the rich depth of the narrative," Christoph Hartmann, then president of 2K said in 2010. “Most importantly, the media are stating what we’ve known all along; that whether or not you’ve played the original, BioShock 2 is a worthy successor to one of the best games of all time that should not be missed.”</p>
<p>As said, 2K and developer Cloud Chamber are currently actively working on BioShock 4 with Cloud Chamber r<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioshock-team-ramps-up-recruitment-with-30-job-offers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ecently looking for numerous new team players in order to ramp up development on the game</a>. Meanwhile, the creator of the original BioShock, Ken Levine, is currently working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a> with his studio <span>Ghost Story Games.</span></p>

<p>The Call of Duty League’s ‘regular season’ has now wrapped up and players are preparing to make it big on the stage at COD Champs in Texas later this month. It has been a tough year for many involved, with some teams putting up an abysmal performance that saw loss-streak records broken dramatically, and for others, it has been a jubilant season filled with success. </p>



<p>However, despite the ups and downs, the drama and the clutch moments, viewership for the Call of Duty League has dropped around 29% since 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-way-down">On The Way Down</h2>



<p>In a string of <a href="https://escharts.com/news/cdl-2024-regular-season-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statistics revealed by escharts.com</a>, it was highlighted that viewership during this year’s CDL regular season tanked by almost a third. The average viewer count dropped by 28.5% while the peak viewer count saw a decline of 26.8% – the airtime remained almost the same, though.</p>



<p>It might seem bizarre to some, but the COD League’s official channel barely managed to retain the strongest market share in terms of viewership. On YouTube, the CDL channel pulled in just 38.6% of viewers, with Scump’s iconic ‘watch parties’ grabbing a whopping 36.8% of the market. At the start of the season, an exclusivity deal threatened the watch parties hosted by Seth ‘Scump’ Abner and other personalities, such as ZooMaa – without them, this year’s viewer count would have collapsed in on itself.</p>



<p>This season’s peak came during the Stage 3 Major between Atlanta FaZe and OpTic Texas, which is considered the El Classico of Call of Duty. In a dramatic showdown, OpTic Texas secured its first trophy in more than 800 days, beating FaZe while a peak count of 335,170 users watched on. The team would later decimate Toronto Ultra to snag the trophy.</p>



<p>With that drop in mind, we now look to COD Champs, which is set to run from July 18 – 21. There’s a $2.2 million prize pool on the line but with viewership going the way it is, how much of an audience will be there to see this season’s champion crowned? </p>

            <title><![CDATA[That New Tarkov Update Has Basically Ruined PvE]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-tarkov-update-ruined-pve/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/that-new-tarkov-update-has-basically-ruined-pve.920316/</guid>

<p>Battlestate Games recently deployed a major overhaul to Escape from Tarkov’s PvE platform, making it so that solo players can run the game on their local PC as opposed to a centralised server. It was intended to reduce matching times to mere seconds, and while that box was ticked, the changes introduced a string of problems that are getting up the noses of players worldwide – as if BSG needed more bad publicity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-they-broke-it">They Broke It</h2>



<p>Along with the ‘offline PvE’ changes came several tweaks to how the game’s ‘player-vs-environment’ AI characters behave, particularly when roaming the map and interacting with loot crates and such. Battlestate applied a serious update that makes them much freer, which immediately means that players are having a tough time predicting their movements. This is where the issues begin – and it’s a long road from there.</p>



<p>Due to new ‘homing AI’ updates, if the computer-controlled enemies know where you are, they’ll descend upon your location with reckless abandon, which just isn’t right. Players are reporting ‘Scavs’ and PMC characters – again, all AI – almost joining forces in an unrealistic way to combat the solo <strong>and terrified </strong>players exploring a little PvE.</p>



<p>There are also reports of PMCs ‘over-spawning’ on maps, with the most extreme claims suggesting that more than double the normal amount of PMCs are appearing in AI form. They’re smarter, more tactical, and less afraid of making a group push towards a player cowering in a corridor somewhere, holding that angle.</p>



<p>Further, the ‘offline PvE’ change seems to have made it tougher for people to run the base game without experiencing issues. On certain maps, frame rate drops are now commonplace, with some players complaining that Escape from Tarkov has ‘become unplayable’. Battlestate Games has promised that further tweaks are inbound to address these issues – as always.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game Delayed For 22 Years Has Just Been Released – On GBA]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kien-delayed-22-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-delayed-for-22-years-has-just-been-released-%E2%80%93-on-gba.920307/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kien-delayed-22-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It might have slipped through the nets of gamers worldwide, but Kien, a game that entered development in the early 2000s, has just been released on Game Boy Advance. Back in 2002, a group of aspiring developers got to work on Kien, seeking to produce a game for the GBA platform – fast-forward some 22 years and only one of the original developers remains with the project, but he never gave up hope.</p>



<p>From facing financial ruin to balancing game development and marketing while studying at university, Fabio Belsanti from Italy finally crossed the finish line a couple of weeks ago, releasing Kien in physical form for the Game Boy Advance after a 22-year delay.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-that-s-got-to-be-a-record">That’s Got To Be A Record</h2>



<p>Kien is a full-fledged GBA title that sees players assume control of either a fearless warrior or a mystical priestess, fighting through a series of environments on the way to save the planet of Malkut. Here’s the trailer for Kien:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Kien - Official Game Boy Advance Trailer #2 (2024)" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kk0-yXB3Wvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Belsanti, who was the sole developer left working on the project when it was finally released in June, addressed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/04/kein-the-most-delayed-video-game-in-history-released-after-22-years" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">why it felt like the right time</a> to push the game into the market:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I believe we are in a phase similar to the revival of vinyl or cassettes for music – a return to previous, more primitive forms of the medium driven by nostalgia from the generations who lived those eras, and curiosity by those who came after such technology. On a romantic level, the thought of releasing the game on its original console is simply magical. To see Kien come to life on the very platform it was designed for is a dream come true.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The feedback already received on the trailers has been stellar, with retro gaming fans welcoming the arrival of an entirely new game some 15 years after the Game Boy Advance was discontinued. It promises to take them back to days gone by, fuelling their nostalgia-riddled passion for gaming that was likely kickstarted decades ago. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-on-xdefiant-bugs/</link>

<p>This week, XDefiant’s Season One update arrived, bringing about new maps, weapons, and mechanics, along with a series of tweaks, quality-of-life improvements, and of course, new <strong>issues</strong>. It also introduced Ranked, which hasn’t landed well with the majority of the player base on account of it not <strong>feeling </strong>like a Ranked mode.</p>



<p>Shortly after the new update dropped, Ubisoft’s Mark Rubin took to social media to explain why XDefiant is experiencing so many issues, defending the game against those claiming it was released too early and ‘rushed out’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-built-up-from-the-ground-floor">‘Built Up From The Ground Floor’</h2>



<p>XDefiant was released on May 21 to a relatively positive reception, with hundreds of thousands of players pouring onto the platform in the first hours of the game going online. It was a long-awaited arrival that came following months of delays and postponements, so eager players were just happy to finally receive it – and then the teething issues surfaced. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1809020713954914444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking candidly on social media</a>, executive producer, Mark Rubin explained why XDefiant’s launch hasn’t been smooth sailing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO. And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else. That being said the engine is really great but it does require a lot of work and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out. We’re not a shooter that’s been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do stick around and you’ll see things improve and new features get added. <strong>But if the game isn’t for you that’s ok you can move on.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>From the horse’s mouth, if you can’t stomach XDefiant’s core issues, then feel free to go away. Plenty of problems have surfaced in the last month and a half, ranging from hit detection to net code and from menu bugs to animation-based issues, and while Ubisoft is working on them, it seems that each major patch just brings more problems to the table. </p>

In this ATLUS Exclusive <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> story version, we would like to introduce more about the narrative and the characters. The registration for digital pre-order and wishlist are open, so please be sure to pre-order or wishlist.</y></p><p>Before we begin I would like to preface just in case that this introduction is limited to the opening section of the story. However, for those who would like to enjoy the story without knowing anything at all, please feel free to end the video here and please look forward to the release of the title.</p><p>Is everyone ready? Now it is time to begin this presentation on the story. We hope you will stay until the end.</p><p><strong>■ Premise of the Story</strong></p><p>The game depicts a story of weaving bonds and becoming a king in a unique setting. The setting is a kingdom in turmoil rocked by a major incident in which the king is assassinated. The protagonist, a young boy, is on a journey with his partner, the fairy Gallica, to save a cursed prince. However, in the midst of all this an unprecedented election magic is invoked. The protagonist is swept into this unprecedented upheaval and ends up embarking on a journey around the world. In this exclusive showcase, let me share with you the beginning part of the story explaining why the protagonist decides to pursue the throne and some details on the allies who will support him.</p><p><strong>Monsters Called “Humans”</strong></p><p>First of all, what threats are the people of this world under? I would like to talk about the biggest cause for this, the monsters known as “humans.”</p><p>In the setting for <em>Metaphor</em>, the atmosphere is filled with particles of anxiety created by people’s feelings of anxiety. This is the source of the magic of this world, which impacts the world in various ways. The particles called “magla” are sucked up and collected by a special device in the city. It is widely known in this world, for example, as a source of funding for this kingdom. In recent years, the amount of magma has increased and monsters have arisen in response. The most prominent example of this is the monster known as “human.”</p><p>The design of the human was inspired by the many fantastic paintings left behind by the medieval artist Hieronymus Bosch. The mysterious creatures in Bosch’s paintings are sometimes described as the world’s first depiction of monsters or fantasy creatures. <em>Metaphor</em> has invited guest artists such as Koda Kazuma for background concept art, Ikuto Yamashita for the Gauntlet Runner designs, and Yuji Himukai for some Archetype designs. For this title, Hieronymus Bosch can be seen as the fourth great guest artist to join, lending us his hand. The protagonists will meet people suffering from these monstrous threats, and their journey will be filled with turbulence. N</p><p><strong>World Affairs</strong></p><p>Now let’s talk about what sort of situation this world is in. The story takes place in the “United Kingdom of Euchronia,” a country that was originally divided into three separate countries that were then annexed into one. However, the power of the royal family has already waned and a cadre of officials from the state religion known as “Sanctism” now effectively rule the country. At the top of the list is Sanctifex Forden. The aging king had no heir, and many of the people were beginning to look to the moderate Forden as their next leader to avoid political instability. On the other hand, there are a few who do not agree with Forden and the Sanctist vision.</p><p>The person leading the charge on that end is a man named Louis, who at a young age became a powerful military elite. Louis is a man who declares that the kingdom has become infested with humans because of the anxiety brought about by the king and Sanctism, and he seeks to protect the weak who follow him from the monsters by force of arms. He is also a charismatic figure with a growing number of enthusiastic sympathizers in various locations. The story of <em>Metaphor</em> opens with a shocking scene in which Louis assassinates the king with his own hands. In fact, Louis is a great traitor who not only killed the king, but also plotted the assassination of the prince who was heir to the throne. Now that the king has been killed, if Louis wins the battle with Forden, a man who killed two generations of the royal family could potentially become the next king—a situation that the supporters of the royal family would risk their lives to prevent.</p><p>So far we have revealed that the protagonist is traveling with the fairy Gallica to save the cursed prince. But in fact, his mission is to defeat Louis, the one who casted the curse. From the beginning of the story, the protagonist and Gallica have been on a mission to assassinate the treasonist, Louis.</p><p><strong>■ Purpose of the Journey</strong></p><p>Assassinating Louis is a tremendous journey for the protagonist unnamed boy and his partner Gallica. The symbol of Louis’s power is the Charadrius, the world’s only flying gauntlet runner, which also serves as his headquarters. However, the protagonist encounters a human before he even meets Louis, and in the process, he awakens an Archetype—a power of heroism that lies deep within him—and he survives, albeit painfully.</p><p>The protagonists make their attempt on Louis’s life at the royal funeral. However, the face of the king, who should already be dead, appears in the sky, and a proclamation is made that the next in line to the throne will be the one who is most desired by the people. This is the result of a formidable magic power inherited only by the king, from generation to generation, which he had arranged to be triggered upon his death. Thus, an unprecedented upheaval ensues, with the entire population of Euchronia competing to gather support by a set deadline.</p><p><strong>Election Magic</strong></p><p>This is the background of the invocation of the election magic, which is the first turning point in the story. Immediately after this magic is invoked, the king’s face in the sky above shows the current popularity rankings and the faces of Forden and Louis appear, big and bold. In other words, at the start of the story, we are at the beginning of a conflict between two huge forces: Santifex Forden, who is in effect, the ruler of the country, and Louis, a charismatic rebel in the military. In the process, the protagonist decides to jump into the turbulent journey for the throne in order to save the prince, his best friend since childhood, and to take Louis’s life for that purpose.</p><p><strong>■ Travel Companions</strong></p><p>Now let us introduce you to the allies who will join the protagonist.</p><p><strong>Gallica</strong></p><p>Gallica, the fairy who has been with you since the beginning of your journey, is your partner who guides you along the way and provides you with direction. Fairies are rare in this world, and although they cannot participate directly in battle, they are especially important because they are companions who can help confirm plans and provide local information, guiding the protagonist in both nagging and kind ways, so that he does not get lost. However, she sometimes gets complaints from other team members saying that they can’t sleep from the sound of her wings when she flies around while they sleep.</p><p><strong>More</strong></p><p>Here is the keeper of <a title="Games > Aka [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/aka">Aka</a>demeia, the facility for Archetype customization, who I mentioned in another video. His name is More. More is the author of one of the key items in the game, the fantasy novel that the protagonist carries. He is imprisoned in this mysterious space. He is well-versed in a variety of knowledge and offers various advice to the protagonists as they research their Archetypes. He is also a supporter and one of the followers we introduced in another video, meaning you can nurture your bond with him. As a person who has been exploring this world since his youth, he as a follower, governs the “Seeker” Archetype lineage. The Seeker, which the protagonist first awakens, belongs to this overarching Seeker lineage.</p><p><strong>Grius</strong></p><p>The story begins with the protagonist being assigned the mission of sending a message to an ally. Due to strict confidentiality, only Gallica was informed of the details of the message, namely the mission to assassinate Louis, who cast the curse, in order to break the prince’s curse. Grius is the ally who you need to deliver the message to. He is not only a master of martial arts, but also skilled in magic, and once even attempted to master Archetypes. Louis is not an easy target to approach. However, with the assumption that he will surely appear at the king’s funeral, the protagonist along with Grius, join hands on this mission.</p><p><strong>Strohl</strong></p><p>In order to deliver a message to Grius, who is undercover as a soldier in the Royal Army, the protagonist first volunteers to be a soldier at the recruitment center in the Royal Capital. There he meets Strohl, a young man of noble birth. It is a rare sight to see a noble volunteering for military service, but he seems to have a deep grudge towards humans from prior experience. Perhaps because of this, he has the courage to stand and fight as a noble in front of other citizens, and he has a strong sense of justice, treating everyone equally. <a title="Genres > Party [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a> members can freely swap between the Archetypes that the protagonist acquires during his journey, but the first Archetype that awakens in Strohl is the warrior. His beliefs are embodied in his heroic image and give him new strength.</p><p><strong>Hulkenberg</strong></p><p>The name of this red-haired warrior is Hulkenberg you drew. She is a member of the Holy Order and once served as the prince’s guard. However, during Louis’ attack on the prince, she was unable to fulfill her duty to protect him, and stepped away from the Royal Capital for a long time. She continued her journey, searching for the whereabouts of the prince without a clue as to his safety. In the midst of this disappointment, she learns of the king’s death and returns to the Royal Capital, where she meets the protagonists. She would then throw herself into the fray once again. The first Archetype to awaken in her is the “Knight.” With her pride as a knight and unwavering determination, she is a reliable presence in the party. She can be a bit stubborn and stoic at times, but on the other hand she has her goofy side, such as relishing and eating unconventional food.</p><p>As a side note, when we first announced this work we had a red-haired <a title="Companies > elf [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/elf">elf</a>-like woman as our concept character, and through the development process of the game, we were able to complete her as this character Hulkenberg. Thank you to those who have been waiting patiently to see how she would turn out.</p><p><strong>Heismay</strong></p><p>This is Heismay. With his distinctive appearance, he is a unique character who also joins the party. He has a different and painful past compared to Strohl and Hulkenberg, and in order to overcome it, he decides to face his own anxiety and awakens his Archetype. The first Archetype to awaken in him is the “Thief.” Despite his seemingly comical appearance, Heismay is a skilled and agile fighter. Heismay will expand the range of the party’s tactics to a new level.</p><p><strong>■ New Companions</strong></p><p>Now the traveling companions will be further increased as the story progresses. Let us continue and introduce you to some of the new fellow characters.</p><p><strong>Neuras</strong></p><p>Of course, the party needs legs that’ll take them around the wilderness to fight in the campaign. Those legs are the gauntlet runner, and Neuras is its pilot. He was originally a gauntlet runner designer for the royal family. He’s a man of unique traits, whose only interest seems to be the knowledge of gauntlet runners, but he is also a lively figure who brings a cheerful mood to the trip, not being easily discouraged by the serious problems that could trouble the others. Although he does not take part in dungeon combat, he is one of the key supporters of the protagonist and others on their journey, awakening the “Gunner” Archetype in the protagonist. Also, bonding with him may cause a change in the gauntlet runner itself. Please look forward to that as well.</p><p><strong>Junah</strong></p><p>Let’s continue the introduction further. This is a scene from a major national event. The name of the beautiful woman standing on stage is Junah. She is a songstress, known to have the most beautiful voice in the kingdom. She is even more famous than the royal family, despite the lack of modern media in the world. Junah, in fact, has an unexpectedly important background, and she too awakens an Archetype—the “Masked Dancer”—and later joins the protagonists in their journey. The character art is by Shigenori Soejima, a well-known artist in the <em>Persona</em> series. Junah’s costume is prominent, but in order to achieve the vivid and fashionable art that we are known for, while still fitting in with the fantasy world, we created characters unique to this title, referencing the “Swinging London” fashion movement of London in the 60s. We are pursuing a particular artistic style, which we hope you will enjoy in your gameplay.</p><p><strong>■ Tribes in the World</strong></p><p>We have introduced the companions that will join you on your journey, and one thing to point out is that they’re all from different tribes. In the previous information drop, we have told you that there are eight tribes in this world. The Clemar, averse to irrationality. The Roussainte, who pride themselves on strength. The Rhoag, who are long-lived and see the value in passing something on. The Ishkia, said to be highly intelligent. The Nidia, who are particularly sociable. The Paripus, who love a lively banquet. The Eugief, who value harmony. The enigmatic Mustari, who do not speak much. In addition to those eight, there are the Elda, the protagonist’s tribe, whose existence itself is rare.</p><p>These tribes are set based on a concept unique to this game. The motifs we used were the traits and characteristics that people have. To draw a line with standard fantasy world settings, the tribes in this game were created from scratch, being inspired by the biases of people’s personalities and values. This is one of our efforts to rebuild the fantasy <a title="Genres > RPG [16,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a> from the ground up, and we hope that you will enjoy the freshness of this new experience.</p><p><strong>■ Election Race</strong></p><p>The title also features gimmicks to make the game more exciting, such as the “election magic,” and the great race across the kingdom, which is held as part of the popularity contest. In a kingdom ruled by a monarch, it is truly an event that turns things upside down. In the confusion of not knowing what is right and wrong, what ideas will people come up with, and what will people seek in a king. Although the word “election” may sound formal to some, we incorporated it because we thought it would be a device that would provide unpredictable developments when depicting a fantasy story. Please look forward to the details on this.</p><p><strong>■ Closing</strong></p><p>Well, how was it? In a world where anxiety which we all inherently carry is becoming a real force to be reckoned with, and in order to confront it, we must awaken the heroic powers, or Archetypes, that we are also born with, and overcome our fear of an unknown future. We created this RPG with such a goal in mind. Unlike the contemporary story we have made in the past, there are various settings that are unique to <em>Metaphor</em>. But we have created a game that can be enjoyed by all users. For example, we have a “Memorandum” function that can be activated with a single button during play, to give the freedom to enjoy the details of this world setting. We hope that many people will play the game once it is released, so please stay tuned.</p><p>Once again, <em>Metaphor</em> is scheduled to launch on October 11, 2024. Pre-orders for both the physical and digital versions are now available. We hope you will pre-order or wishlist today. Those who pre-order will receive the “Archetype EXP Chest Set” and the “<a title="Genres > Adventure [1,603 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>r’s Journey Pack” as pre-order incentives. Both items are useful for in-game consumables for battles and party development, so don’t miss out. <em>Metaphor</em> is also available in special deluxe editions for both physical and digital versions. We have a limited number for the Collector’s Edition, so if you would like to secure one, please do so as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>■ Up Next</strong></p><p>In the next exclusive showcase, we will finally reveal what kind of competitors will emerge in the actual campaign, and what kind of supporters will lend us a hand in overcoming those rivals, so please stay tuned.</p><p>In addition, many videos will be released daily by More, the keeper of Akademeia, who will introduce the various world settings of the title to you. We hope you will enjoy this one as well.</p><p>See you again in the next exclusive showcase. Thank you very much for your time today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The two options presented are bats, which will occasionally leave fruit in the cave, or Mushrooms, which will occasionally spawn in the cave. Demetrius appears to make the offer once you have accumulated 25,000G. This choice is permanent, so you will want to pick the option that works best for you. Here are the benefits of each choice.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bats</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose the Bats, fruit will occasionally spawn in the cave. This is an excellent choice if you want to complete the community bundles as early as possible, since you will need several different kinds of fruit for certain bundles. Otherwise, you will need to plant and grow several fruit trees before waiting for the right season for the tree to grow fruit. The fruit doesn't spawn every day, since there is only a chance, which increases if there is already some fruit in there. The fruit never despawns, so you don't have to check every day.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Fruit is useful in the late-game too, since fruit that grows on trees is universally liked, so it's a great steady supply of gifts for villagers. It can also be used for wine as well, which can be nice if you don't want to dedicate a large amount of space for fruit trees. <strong>If you want a steady supply of fruit without needing trees, choose the bats</strong>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Mushrooms</h2><p dir="ltr">If you choose Mushrooms, six mushroom boxes will be added to the cave. Every day the boxes will each have one of the five different types of mushrooms, although the chances are heavily weighted towards the Common Mushroom.</p><p><strong>You should choose the Mushrooms if you really enjoy exploring the Mines or Skull Cavern.</strong> The reason is that the Life Elixir item, which unlocks at Combat level 2, can be crafted using one of each of the other four mushrooms; Red, Purple, Morel, and Chanterelle. Life Elixir heals you completely and there isn't really another way to consistently find every type of mushrooms. Outside of crafting the Life Elixir, there isn't really another reason to choose the mushrooms. You do get a free dehydrator with the mushroom cave, but you will unlock the ability to craft them eventually.</p>

There is a white GH symbol on the wall with the hole you can enter to get the last coin.</p>

                <p>Clay is a relatively common building material found in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, used to make structures and craftable items. Unlike other building materials like Wood and Stone, it isn't always obvious where you can find more Clay. Luckily, there are a few consistent ways to track down Clay in Stardew Valley.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find Clay in Stardew Valley</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4329322-clay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329322" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4329322-clay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329322"></a><figcaption>Clay can most commonly be found by tilling dirt.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4329322-clay.jpg"></figure><p>Clay is most commonly found by tilling either dirt or sand with your hoe. It can be a little inconsistent with how frequently it appears from tilling, but clearing out large areas of dirt, like the patches found near the Carpenter's house, usually yields some Clay. You can also till the large amounts of dirt on your farm--with the exact amount depending on which farm layout you have. You can also till the dirt patches found sometimes in the Mines and Skull Caverns.</p><p dir="ltr">Artifact Spots, which look like worms coming out of the ground, can also yield Clay. Clay can also appear in fishing treasure chests and geodes, but similar to the Artifact Spots, so many different items can appear in these items that it's not a consistent way to find Clay. Clay can also be mined from Clay Veins, but these are only found on Ginger Island, which you won't get access to after completing either the Community Center or the Jojo Mart.</p><p dir="ltr">Clay is used in several crafting recipes and it is used to build a Silo at the Carpenters. Silos allow you to collect and store Hay, which is used to feed Animals, so building it is very important for Ranching.</p>

<p>It’s easy to forget that not everyone plays video games on Windows. Some users prefer Linux, even on a desktop, and there’s nothing wrong with that. Unfortunately, not every developer supports Linux, which makes it challenging to find and play the games you want. So, can you play Zenless Zone Zero on Linux?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-zenless-zone-zero-support-linux">Does Zenless Zone Zero Support Linux?</h2>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero does not natively support Linux, but it does work. So long as developer miHoYo doesn’t make any significant changes, it should still run fine on Linux. The key is to download and install the game using <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heroic</a>. It’s a free-to-use, open-source game launcher capable of running Epic Game Store, GOG, Amazon Prime Games, and more on Linux, Windows, and macOS.</p>



<p>Once you download Heroic and install Zenless Zone Zero, consider running the game via Proton Experimental. Most users seem to have luck there.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-steam-deck">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero on Steam Deck?</h2>



<p>While Zenless Zone Zero isn’t on Steam and will likely never launch on Valve’s digital storefront, it does somewhat work on Steam Deck. There’s no official support, though. As such, you may run into numerous issues and poor performance.</p>



<p>If you want to try to play Zenless Zone Zero on Steam Deck, you can install the gacha game using Heroic or Lutris. It’s the easiest way to download and play the game on the handheld through the Epic Game Store.</p>



<p>Alternatively, the ROG Ally should have no trouble downloading the game, as it runs Windows natively.</p>



<hr>



<p>While Linux remains in the air, what about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-zenless-zone-zero-offer-controller-support-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controller support in Zenless Zone Zero</a>? While you’re waiting for the game to install, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

<h2 id="h-why-you-want-nuka-cola-twist">Why You Want Nuka-Cola Twist</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/today-only-the-2tb-samsung-980-pro-ps5-ssd-is-down-to-135<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">One of the most popular and well rated PS5 SSDs around</h2></div><div><section><p>For today only (July 5), Best Buy is offering a 2TB Samsung 980 Pro PS5-compatible solid state drive (SSD) for only $134.99 shipped. SSD prices are still trending upwards for 2024, so it's much more difficult to find a PS5 compatible 2TB M.2 SSD for the same  low prices we saw last year. This is the best deal we've found so far on one of the most popular and reliable brands around. </p><h2>Samsung 980 Pro 2TB PS5 SSD with Heatsink for $135</h2><div id="199763" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Silicon Power XS70 2TB PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD with Preinstalled Aluminum Heatsink</h3></p></div><p>The PS5 is an outstanding  gaming console, but the 1TB SSD is a real bottleneck. Games like Gran Turismo 7, Elden Ring, Call of Duty, Final Fantasy 16, and NBA 2K24 each take up 100GB or more all by themselves. If you buy a lot of AAA titles, your drive will fill up very quickly. In addition, if you want to expand the PS5's internal storage without compromising on speed, any old SSD just won't cut it. You'll want to pick up an PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 solid state drive with a minimum rated 5,500MB/s read speed.</p><p>Samsung SSDs need no introduction. They've made some of the most popular and reliable <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">PS5 SSDs</a> on the market. The 980 Pro has been out for a while now and has vetted many times over as an excellent candidate for your PlayStation 5's storage expansion. It is fully PS5 compatible in terms of form factor and performance, with speeds of up to 7,100MB/s. This particular model is preinstaslled with a rugged heatsink that's a lot better than the  flimsy paper-thin graphene "heatsinks" you'll find on some other SSDs at the same price.</p><p>If you have a gaming PC instead of a PS5 console, this SSD would also make a great boot drive. There are faster drives out there, but for OS and general app performance, you won't notice any real world performance difference compared to this drive, which is already far faster than any traditional platter hard drive. The capacity is also ideal. For most people, a 2TB SSD should be enough to cover your OS, apps, and games. Sure a 4TB SSD would be even better, but they're very, very expensive.</p><p>If you want more options, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ssd">best SSDs of 2024</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 5, 2024 6:45 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">There was a time when there were a few games based on The Matrix movies, and they were even pretty good at times. Today, while video game adaptations are tougher to come by (although you can be Neo or Trinity in Fortnite), fans shouldn't sleep on a tabletop opportunity to delve into the Matrix, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legendary-Encounters-Matrix-Deck-Building/dp/B0CDQW9K97?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Upper Deck's Legendary Encounters: The Matrix</a> deckbuilding game, available on Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're a tabletop or deckbuilding game fan but unfamiliar with the Legendary series, you're missing out. They're a series of cooperative games you can play solo or with friends where you battle <em>against</em> the deck, and they're constructed really well to capture the feeling of venturing into the licensed worlds they're trying to portray. The first Legendary game was a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Upper-Deck-Legendary-What-If/dp/B0CJL3XLDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel superheroes deckbuilder</a> and has a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=legendary+encounters&amp;i=toys-and-games&amp;crid=2M0C27JSNUE41&amp;sprefix=legendary+encounters%2Ctoys-and-games%2C153&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ton of expansions</a>, but I have the first Legendary Encounters, where the franchise expanded into movies with the Alien franchise. While that one seems to be out of print, the game manages to replicate the specific feel of the original Alien franchise, but with cards, and not only is it a fun and well-designed game, it's genuinely pretty tense for a game you play with cards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329284" data-ratio="0.88046272493573" data-width="778" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329284"></a><figcaption>Legendary Encounters: The Matrix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329284-legendaryencountersmatrix.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Legendary Encounters: The Matrix was released in 2023, and captures the same feel of the films and lets you join up with up to four other players, and includes characters like Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus, as well as villains such as Agent Smith and the Merovingian. The game is played not only with cards, but with a special playmat that dictates the flow of the game and makes learning it a little easier, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">There are actually <em>a ton</em> of Legendary Encounters games, dipping into lots of different media franchises--some of which are even a little unexpected.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/berserk-board-game-set-for-worldwide-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An official Berserk board game is coming. Fans of the iconic dark fantasy manga can relive its most horrific action-packed moments from the comfort of their table. Better still, thanks to some official partnerships, the game will be coming to store shelves worldwide.</p>
<h2>The <em>Berserk</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the design, production, and sale of the <em>Berserk</em> board game will be handled by Monolith Board Games. Monolith is a France-based board game developer. It was founded in 2014 and has a respectable history of well-designed board games, including <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/222514/batman-gotham-city-chronicles"><em>Batman: Gotham City Chronicles</em></a>,<em> </em>and <em>Claustrophobia 1643</em>.</p>

An official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1113444893542668">Facebook post</a> by Monolith provides additional information. It states the game will use an original game system and be accessible, rich, and intuitive.</p>
<p>Monolith Board Games has several partners producing the <em>Berserk</em> board game. One is Hakusensha, the Japanese manga publishing company behind the manga. The other is Digital Catapult Inc. which specializes in producing and selling media overseas. The latter will distribute English and French language versions of the game in Europe and North America.</p>
<p><em>Berserk</em> is a brutal dark fantasy manga the late Kentaro Miura created. It debuted in 1988 under Hakusensha's semimonthly Young Horses magazine. It tells the story of Guts, a swordsman traveling through a hostile world for revenge. The manga was acclaimed for its mix of Western fantasy trappings, visceral bloody action, bleak atmosphere, and Lovecraftian cosmic horror.</p>
<p>After almost forty years, <em>Berserk's</em> cultural influence cannot be overstated. It spawned several anime, film, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/berserk-and-band-of-hawk-review-tell-me-why" rel="noopener" target="_blank">game adaptations</a>. It has inspired character archetypes and weapon designs for Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> series. But its most overt influence is on creative director Hidetaka Miyazaki, the one behind the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dark Souls</em></a> series and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>
<p>At time of writing there is no confirmed date of completion or sale for the <em>Berserk</em> board game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-fallout-76-crossplay-%E2%80%93-answered.920130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-76-crossplay-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the immense popularity of Fallout 76 following the live-action television series, more players than ever are flocking to post-apocalyptic Appalachia. But they’re spread far and wide across multiple systems. With that in mind, is Fallout 76 crossplay?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-fallout-76-support-crossplay">Does Fallout 76 Support Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, Fallout 76 does not support crossplay completely. There’s a caveat, of course, because it shouldn’t be too simple to play with your friends cross-platform, right? </p>



<p>You can play Fallout 76 crossplay between PC and Xbox Series X|S, but only when playing on the Game Pass version of the multiplayer wasteland adventure. </p>



<p>If you purchased a digital copy from the Xbox Store and your pal purchased a copy through Steam, you cannot play together.</p>



<p>Will the game ever receive crossplay support? There’s no telling. Microsoft is making a huge push to put its games on every platform imaginable, and that often means cross-platform support to some extent. However, the most significant blockage preventing crossplay from moving forward successfully is usually Sony.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-transfer-fallout-76-saves-between-systems">Can You Transfer Fallout 76 Saves Between Systems?</h2>



<p>I hope you’re ready for a little more disappointment, sadly. You cannot transfer save files between systems in Fallout 76. If you previously created a character on the PC version but went out and bought an Xbox Series S on sale, you must start an entirely new save file on the console.</p>



<p>At the very least, it’s an opportunity to test out a new build!</p>



<hr>



<p>Whether you jump in-game with a friend or not, you’ll likely want to start accumulating resources for crafting and construction. Here is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-gold-scrap-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get Gold Scrap in Fallout 76</a>!

But one day, a shocking series of murders involving a mysterious <a title="Companies > crim [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>son beast sets the wheels of fate in motion once again. Various factions spring into <a title="Genres > Action [1,990 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> – both those who abide by the law to uncover the truth and those looking to capitalize on any new developments wherever possible, no matter how sinister.</p><p>With chaos once again looming on the horizon, the spriggan Van Arkride receives an unexpected visitor, prompting his own investigation. Who is behind the murders, and what is their goal? The sands of time bring old and new faces together for this thrilling second installment in the <em><a title="Series > Trails [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/trails">Trails</a> through Daybreak</em> saga.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Year 1209 of the Septian Calendar.</p><p>The threat posed by Almata has passed. Peace has finally returned to Calvard. And, for a time, that peace goes uninterrupted—until a CID special forces unit is slaughtered by an unknown assailant.</p><p>With authorities working to contain the situation, criminal forces take the chance to make their own moves.</p><p>Meanwhile, a spriggan by the name of Van Arkride begins his own investigation—after prompting from an unexpected visitor.</p><p>Who could be responsible for this massacre? What was their objective? And how does it all relate to Agnes’ search for the eighth Genesis?</p><p>A crimson beast’s roar. A chance meeting with a boy and girl, both embroiled in a mysterious search. These are the circumstances that lure Arkride Solutions down the trail of an inescapable fate.</p><p><strong>System</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Battle System</strong> – The game builds on the seamless transition between field battles and command battles introduced in the previous game with new mechanics that can be used in both: Cross Charge &amp; EX Chains! Mastering the use of these two combo mechanics can provide you with overwhelming firepower to use against your opponents.</li><li><strong>Cross Charge</strong> – If you manage to Perfect Dodge an enemy’s attack during a field battle, the Cross Charge icon will appear! Pushing the correct button while the icon is on-screen will swap in another party member, who will simultaneously execute a charge attack on your foe! As a bonus, the party member that you swap in will have enhanced attack power for a period of time.</li><li><strong>EX Chains</strong> – EX Chains can be activated by fulfilling specific conditions during command battles. Once these conditions have been met, using a craft or normal attack against a stunned enemy will automatically activate an EX Chain! This allows party members with SCLM activated to launch a simultaneous attack that will also impact nearby enemies, dealing massive damage.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Chapters</strong> – Van and his collaborators will not always travel together during the events of Trails through Daybreak II. At times, some of the group may split off in order to take care of tasks in different areas of Calvard concurrently. Because of this, each act contains multiple chapters you can play in any order. Progress the story in the order you choose! Each chapter features a different cast of characters as we see their side of the act’s story play out. Once you’ve completed your chosen chapter, the next one will start up automatically.</li><li><strong>Unique Missions</strong> – Certain chapters will feature missions that utilize the unique skillsets of the characters in that chapter’s party. For example, directly controlling the holo core AI, <a title="Games > Mare" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a>, to hack the orbal network, or using Swin to silently tail a suspicious individual.</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_896903"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Van Arkride</strong> – The man at the head of Arkride Solutions. A lover of sweets, saunas, and orbal cars. Due to his job as a spriggan, Van has a tendency to take on legally-questionable jobs. However, the fact that he occasionally walks on the edge of the law does not preclude him from doing good by others—as is evidenced by his numerous personal contacts. While tracking down the Oct-Geneses at Agnes’ request, Van developed the ability to transform into an armored form known as the Grendel with the help of Mare, the holo core installed within his combat orbment. It was with this new ability that he was able to fend off the mafia group known as Almata. Having once terrorized the entirety of the Republic, Almata was eventually brought to its knees by the Arkride Solutions team during the fight for the Oct-Geneses. Upon the quelling of this threat, however, they decided to temporarily go their separate ways. Now left to himself in a less-than- lively office, Van is free to return to his lone-wolf lifestyle once more.</li><li><strong>Agnes Claudel</strong> – A first-year at the prestigious Aramis Academy who currently serves on its Student Council. Despite her polite manner of speaking and at times meek demeanor, Agnes has shown great strength and determination while employed at Arkride Solutions—especially when facing off against the seedy underbelly of society. Agnes first met Van while searching for eight prototype orbments known as the Oct-Geneses, which she inherited from her great-grandfather. As thanks for taking on her request, she began working as one of Arkride Solution’s part-time assistants. At present, Agnes has recovered seven of the eight Geneses. Unfortunately, while continuing her search for the last remaining Genesis, she’s had no choice but to also divide her time between preparing for the Aramis Academy Festival and periodically helping out around Arkride Solutions. Regarding her relationship with Van, she both respects and admires him as her employer. However, she seems to be harboring some more amorous feelings for him as well…</li><li><strong>Elaine Auclair</strong> – An A-rank bracer affiliated with the Calvard branch of the Bracer Guild. She is occasionally referred to by the moniker “Beauty’s Blade.” Due to her dignified beauty and masterful skill with a sword, Elaine tends to catch the eye of the media more often than not. Unfortunately, this also leads to talent agencies offering her contracts for modeling and acting—she always declines. Outside of being the poster girl for the Bracer Guild, Elaine has no present interest in joining the world of entertainment. During her high school years, she enjoyed a brief and fleeting romance with Van before he suddenly vanished without so much as a word. It was only recently, after seven years, that the two were able to reunite. Although their lingering feelings for each other have left their current relationship a bit tense, their time fighting Almata together was able to strengthen their bond once more. Some time after the events involving Almata and the Oct-Geneses, Elaine received word that the Central Intelligence Department’s elite Gamma Squad had been brutally murdered by an unknown assailant, and that a ‘crimson’ monster was spotted at the scene of the crime…</li></ul><p><strong>World</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The Republic of Calvard</strong> – A large country located in the central region of the Zemurian continent. Its current leader is President Roy Gramheart. Due to the unfortunate circumstances created by the desertification of eastern Zemuria, Calvard has a substantial history of receiving both immigrants and refugees. The resulting mixture of cultures and ethnicities has made the country into something of a melting pot. One hundred years ago, Calvard was under the heel of its monarchal rulers. It was only after Sheena Dirke and her compatriots brought about a democratic revolution that the nation was transformed into a democratic republic. Though in constant conflict with Erebonia over the control of bordering regions, Calvard has recently been on the receiving end of reparations from the empire following the Battle of Jormungandr. These reparations enabled Calvard to enter a period of rapid growth and development, leading to its eventual overtake of Erebonia as the most powerful nation on the continent. Regarding the region’s recreational interests, recent technological advancements in orbal vehicles and filmmaking have caused a boom in both the motorsports and orbal cinema industries.</li><li><strong>Messeldam</strong> – A moderate-sized city located in the north of Calvard. Due to its long-standing role as one of the Northern Sea’s major trading ports, Messeldam was often tasked during the days of monarchal rule with the delivery of imports to the capital of Oracion—along with fresh seafood, of course. Although the port remains active to this day, developments in airship technology have greatly diminished its significance. The city itself, however, remains an important gateway to Remiferia and its surrounding nations. Unlike Langport, Messeldam possesses very few tourist destinations. That being said, the townscape’s architecture tends to be quite popular with visitors, as its design has seen little change in the past century. The city’s Eastern and Central Eastern populations are fairly meager due to its geographical location. As such, it lacks a community that values cultural traditionalism. This has, fortunately, been a boon for Messeldam, as new art movements and customs are accepted with relative ease. It was this very attitude that led to the city serving as the venue for the Orbal Film Festival for a number of years, until its relocation to Tharbad in 1208.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the western announcement trailer and a <em>Trails</em> series overview trailer below.

He's already injured when you discover him, and from his wailing laments, you learn that he's trying to kill a huge and horrific dragon called Bayle the Dread. Apparently, Bayle already kicked Igon's ass and he can no longer walk, so being the very nice person that you are, you leave him crying on the side of the road.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Bayle the Dread Dragon Guide | Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">You might have thought Igon was a sad, broken man, but you haven't yet seen the depths of his resolve. Later, as you climb the mountain, you slay a few dragons who stand in your way--first one, alone, and then two together. After winning the battle against two dragons at once, you hear laughter. It's Igon, and seeing your performance convinces him that you're the partner he's been waiting for. He <em>cuts off his own finger</em>--that's how summoning NPCs works in Elden Ring--and gives it to you, begging you to summon his soul in your fight against Bayle.</p><p dir="ltr">And reader, you should absolutely summon Igon in the fight against Bayle.</p><p dir="ltr">There are those players who are resistant to using summons, whether they're NPCs, spirit ashes, or other players. The release of Shadow of the Erdtree has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-dlc-difficulty-discourse-is-getting-old-spot-on/1100-6524592/">rekindled a lot of discussion around the practice</a>, thanks to the perception among many that the DLC expansion can be annoyingly difficult. It does, at times, feel a little uneven, especially because of its half-baked <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/">Scadutree Fragment</a> leveling system that's both wholly separate from traditional leveling and highly dependent on exploration and, to some degree, luck, in order to advance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329285" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329285"></a><figcaption>When you first find Igon, he has already been wrecked trying to fight dragons, but he is in no way done.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329285-igonlament.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Summons are a release valve on Elden Ring's difficulty, offering ways to even the odds for players who are maybe less skilled, less dextrous, or generally just less able to deal with some of the game's tougher bosses. And then there are those people who never summon, who make it a point to talk about how they never summon, and who ruin any potential to constructively discuss difficulty in game design and how it might be adjusted so that more people can physically play and enjoy a game while still allowing that game to convey the emotions and experiences the difficulty exists to create.</p><p dir="ltr">The sad vanity and arrogance of some of those people caused them to miss out on Igon. It's almost like From Software specifically used Shadow of the Erdtree to call out those people, because like with Igon, there are a number of points in the DLC where summoning a character is essential for advancing their particular story and includes interesting dialogue and fascinating moments you can't get any other way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63TTIrhZcqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/63TTIrhZcqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">None is so fascinating as the story of Igon, though.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing about Bayle is that he is, like, the worst and most-evil dragon. He once fought the dragon Elden Lord, the multi-headed Lord Placidusax, to a standstill. If you played through Elden Ring already, there's a good chance you found and killed Placidusax yourself in Farum Azula, so you know how rough that battle would have been. You can see what it did to Bayle--he's missing half a leg and uses his tail to keep himself standing, and he has a couple of Placidusax's actual heads still buried in his back.</p><p dir="ltr">Igon made it his vow to kill Bayle, and even with his ruined legs, he intends to finish the job. And when you summon him in the fight, he comes in <em>screaming</em>--"CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURSE YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYLE"--with a monologue that's almost equivalent to the roars the huge Bayle himself is issuing as you challenge him. Actor Richard Lintern (The Crown) makes his video game debut in voicing Igon and absolutely slaughters it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329289" data-ratio="0.96617647058824" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329289"></a><figcaption>Source: Elden Ring Alerts on Twitter. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329289-igonmeme.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The monologue is totally unexpected, and it's what makes Igon incredible. He comes into this fight ready to do <em>murder</em>, literally too angry to die. It was especially fun for me, because as Igon was yelling his vow to destroy Bayle and how we were about to kick this dragon's ass, I'd already been in the fight for a good minute or so, and I was halfway across the arena with a massive dragon swinging me around like a dog with a chew toy.</p><p dir="ltr">I can't stress enough how much of a phenomenal madman Igon is. This dude <em>just met me</em>. I ran into him at the bottom of the mountain with his legs thrashed, which immediately raises the question of, how did Igon, who wanted to go fight Bayle, end up <em>there</em>, already injured? Did he go up against the dragon alone? Did he get <em>tossed</em> there? Is that what happened to his legs?</p><p dir="ltr">He takes a minute to lament his fate and deal with the overwhelming pain, and you leave him. And then you find him again, where he watches you kill a couple of dragons. Despite not having the use of his legs, he got there <em>ahead of you</em>, and he decides that your martial prowess means you're the one he wants to take him back into the fight against Bayle, once and for all. Shadow of the Erdtree's Captain Ahab will stop at nothing to kill that damnable dragon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4329290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4329290-baylewings.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Beating Bayle was one of the best moments of Shadow of the Erdtree for me, and at least half of it was because, as Igon screamed in the background, he and I did it "with a hail of harpoons!" This is the stuff I love about Elden Ring--the stuff that expands the world, that makes it feel like more than just you wandering a dead civilization, killing whoever's left. Fighting Bayle with Igon was phenomenal, with him screaming his head off, contributing almost nothing but hype the entire time, and heightened the danger and intensity of the battle all the more. The fight wasn't diminished because I had help; it was enriched and expanded because fighting Bayle meant something to Igon, and thus, it meant something to me. He has more personality than most From Software characters, and I hope they take a page from his ludicrous bellowing and overbearing obsession to make more memorable folks like him in future games.</p><p dir="ltr">It's pretty clear that fighting Bayle with Igon is the way From Software meant it to be experienced, and I'm glad some weird gatekeeping and purity testing didn't keep that from me. Beating a challenging boss is cool, but I'll remember Bayle a lot longer because of Igon.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has taken to Twitter to call out Apple for rejecting the company's app submission, claiming that it's arbitrary and obstructive.</p><p>"Apple has rejected our Epic Games Store notarization submission twice now, claiming the design and position of Epic’s 'Install' button is too similar to Apple's 'Get' button and that our 'In-app purchases' label is too similar to the App Store's 'In-App Purchases' label," Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1809179988131713090" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained</a>.</p><p>Epic Games continued, saying that it is using the same "Install" and "In-app purchases" naming conventions that are used on multiple different popular app stores and platforms. Epic also said that it is building a store that mobile users can easily understand and is following standard design conventions in iOS apps.</p><p>"Apple's rejection is arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA, and we've shared our concerns with the European Commission," said Epic Games. "Barring further roadblocks from Apple, we remain ready to launch in the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS in the EU in the next couple of months."</p><p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney also chimed in, claiming that Apple is misusing its app review process by delaying possible competitors. "Now it’s disheartening to see Apple twist its once-honest notarization process into another vector to manipulate and thwart competition," <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1809284429350633872" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p><p>Back in 2022, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-eu-laws-force-apple-and-google-changes-making-some-of-epics-dreams-come-true/1100-6505156/" data-ref-id="1100-6505156">European Union passed the Digital Markets Act</a>, which allowed Epic Games to get a developer account from Apple and make its own app store. As a result, Epic Games would be able to sidestep Apple's 30% platform fees. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-return-to-ios-hits-a-new-hurdle-after-apple-cancels-its-developer-account/1100-6521659/" data-ref-id="1100-6521659">Apple revoked Epic's access</a> for a short time earlier this year, but eventually reinstated it.</p><p>Currently, there are no available ways to play Fortnite natively on iOS devices, but thanks to the Digital Markets Act, that'll change in a few months, at least for European players.</p>
