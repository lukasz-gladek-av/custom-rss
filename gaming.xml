			<p>Dino Crisis may be the next CAPCOM series to see a proper comeback in the future, following the return of the Onimusha and Okami franchises, judging from some recent happenings.</p>
<p>As reported by Gematsu on Bluesky, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis on March 4th in Japan. By itself, this doesn't mean much, as companies file a lot of trademarks that end up getting unused just to hold onto their IPs, but there are good reasons to be hopeful in this case. As highlighted by ResetERA forums member <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-trademarked-dino-crisis-on-march-4-in-japan.1131402/post-136887345" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jawmuncher</a>, any trademark filed in Japan usually shows how a company has a real intention to do something with the IP, and there's a precedence of CAPCOM actually reviving a franchise following a similar trademark filing with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha series.</a></p>

<p>While the Dino Crisis series has been left dormant for a good while, the survival horror series by CAPCOM has already made a very small comeback with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">recent GOG releases</a> of the first two entries, complete with new features such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support and much more. Hopefully, the re-release of the two classic games won't be the end of the series, although series creator Shinji Mikami believes CAPCOM has no reason to<a href="https://wccftech.com/shinji-mikami-says-no-need-for-dino-crisis-to-exist-when-monster-hunter-is-so-successful/"> bring back Dino Crisis while the Monster Hunter series continues to be successful.</a></p>

Pokemon GO has over 20 million weekly active players and has been in the top 10 since its launch. Its trainers have explored more than 30 billion miles together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pikmin Bloom players completed 3.94 trillion steps in 2024 and hit its highest active player count last year. Monster Hunter Now launched with surpassed 15 million downloads in 7 months, and over 50% of the audience played the game every day of the week.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There's an old myth in the theater world that Shakespeare's Macbeth is cursed, and any theatre company who tries to put it on will endure some sort of misfortune during the production. One area that hasn't been tested yet, though, is video games--until now, as upstart Specto Studio, led by a former theater director, has announced Hail Macbeth for consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Hail Macbeth is a third-person narrative adventure and an adaptation of the classic Shakespearean play, where players will assume the role of an "unseen force" guiding Macbeth through the story. They will work against what the official announcement calls "the witches," which are "embedded into the game’s UI, subtly revealing or obscuring information, shifting perspective, and distorting reality in ways that make players question the limits of their control."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458186" data-ratio="0.56289808917197" data-width="1256" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458186"></a><figcaption>Hail MacBeth concept art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458187,1300-4458188,1300-4458189,1300-4458190,1300-4458191" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unlike the original work, this version of Macbeth will be set in an alternate version of the 1990s, with castles, corporate high-rises, and “industrial ruins."

                <p>Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer Scopely has announced that it'll be acquiring Niantic's video game division, paying $3.5 billion for the developer behind Pokemon Go. Also included in the proposed deal--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/">which was revealed several weeks back</a>--are several other Niantic titles, like Monster Hunter Now and Pikmin Bloom.</p><p>"With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we're going to make Pokemon Go the very best it can be--with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokemon in the real world," Niantic studio leader Ed Wu said in a <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We have invested to empower thousands of community leaders and ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together."</p><p>According to Wu, the entire Pokemon Go team will be retained through this new partnership, and Scopely offered the studio a development environment that it found "extremely appealing". The acquisition will still need to pass regulatory approval conditions, and Pokemon Go social companion apps Campfire and Wayfarer will also be included in the deal.</p><p>Pokemon Go was first launched in 2016, quickly becoming a phenomenon in the mobile gaming space. While the game saw healthy growth over the years, the COVID pandemic and lockdowns negatively impacted its popularity, leading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">significant layoffs at the company and canceled projects</a> in recent years.

Niantic Spactial will be a "geospatial AI company powered by a next-generation map" that will allow devices to interact with the physical world.</p>

We're talking about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the FPP slasher released in 2020, which completely changed our fate, allowing us to set sail into broader waters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The year 2020 was a special time for the industry. On one hand, it brought development delays due to the need of adapting to remote work, while on the other, it increased demand for games because of home isolation. There's no denying that we benefited from this while working on the first installment of Ghostrunner. For us as developers, it was a break from the grim pandemic routine, allowing us to bring the game from prototype to release in just 1.5 years. Players appreciated our effort, and in October 2020, they jumped into the post-apocalyptic cyberpunk world we had created.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feedback and experimentation—the foundations of ">Feedback and experimentation—the foundations of <span>Ghostrunner 2</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the success of the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we quickly received a proposal from our publisher and current IP owner, 505 Games, to create a sequel. In the meantime, we also released a series of additional content supporting the original game, including a major expansion, Project_Hel, where we had the opportunity to test out some fresh gameplay ideas. These ideas influenced the design decisions made during the conceptual phase of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. As examples, I can mention more frequent opportunities to use the protagonist's special abilities and a general focus on extending the player's lifespan in arenas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When preparing for the production of the sequel, we deeply looked for player feedback on forums, Reddit, and our Discord. Luckily, we received plenty of it, but as often happens with the opinions of such a large group of players, several suggestions started to contradict each other. Some players wanted even faster, more challenging, and competitive gameplay, while others requested it to be more organized and slower. We decided to focus on feedback from those who spent the most time in the game, while also keeping in mind the recurring concerns from more casual players, who were quickly turning away from our game because it seemed too difficult.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players wanted us to expand the core combat and movement mechanics, and that's what we focused on. We created more complex level designs, added new enemies with new abilities, and modified those who didn’t fully suit the gameplay, like for example the Wardens—enemies equipped with katanas. The only way to defeat them was to wait for their attack and block it. We replaced them with Shinobi, who can also be outmaneuvered and killed with a strike to the back or disarmed using one of the special abilities. At the same time, they are extremely fast and can run on walls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to the tempo of the gameplay, we wanted to maintain the speed for players who wanted to rush through levels like pros, while also catering to those who complained about the frantic pace in the first game. We found a compromise by adding two very important mechanics – block and stamina – which allow less experienced players to stop, take a breath, calmly assess the situation, and move on. This action is not mandatory for the ultra-skilled players, who can still play the sequel exactly as they rushed through the first installment of the game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="From fanbase to wider audience—the real challenge of shaping a sequel">From fanbase to wider audience—the real challenge of shaping a sequel</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's clear that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is not a game for everyone, and it was never meant to be. However, aware of the potential benefits of expanding the target audience, we wanted to introduce new features that would make the game more accessible without straying too far from the core mechanics. After all, it’s these mechanics that earned the game the appreciation of a dedicated fanbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We quickly realized that, as a team, we had found ourselves in a completely new situation. We were making a sequel and for the first time we had to meet the expectations of not hundreds or thousands of players, but millions of people from all over the world. After all, each of those players had their own vision of what their ideal </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be. I didn’t expect that this pressure would weigh so heavily on us and, to some extent, even disrupt the creative aspect of game development. Every new feature had to go through a process of double verification—our internal review, followed by a clash with player expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As an interesting behind-the-scenes tidbit, we can tell you that we tested a sword-throwing system, but quickly abandoned the idea in favor of faster and more practical shurikens. We also had concepts that never made it to implementation, like a survival mechanic that would appear during exploration of the wastelands outside the tower. It was built around the idea that the player would not be able to stay in the sun for too long and would have to look for the shade, but we abandoned it due to the potential risk of significantly slowing down the game, as it didn’t support our core gameplay. Some changes were obvious and necessary improvements, like fixing the save system to enable saving during missions, which didn’t always work correctly in the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and often frustrated players. However, these small but impactful changes were few and far between.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Offering players more of what they're looking for">Offering players more of what they're looking for</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What turned out to be a real challenge was our desire to add a motorcycle. The idea was simple, though it might have sounded absurd—our game is already fast, so let’s give Jack (the protagonist of Ghostrunner) a vehicle that allows him to move even faster. The goal was to carry over the rhythm that defines Ghostrunner onto a motorcycle. After months of tweaking the balance and controls (which we eventually made very arcade-ish) and gathering extensive feedback from tests, we managed to deliver a gameplay experience packed with adrenaline, rooted in the fast-paced, trial-and-error mechanic that perfectly aligns with Ghostrunner's core. It’s worth noting that not everything related to the motorcycle was perfect. With a vehicle and an open post-apocalyptic world, we were tempted to explore much larger areas than the levels inside the tower. Looking back, I have to admit it wasn’t the best idea, and although there is a group of fans who enjoyed this more sandbox-like experience, most players didn’t see this element as a good addition. Fortunately, it was only two levels, after which we return to the fast, more linear, and condensed gameplay tracks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, we attempted to achieve what was previously considered impossible, given the budget and the team we had at the time. Step by step, feature by feature, the size and complexity of the game grew closer to the AAA segment. We added elements like a hub with NPCs, dialogue choices, cutscenes blended into the narrative, and a separate roguelike game mode called Roguerunner.exe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To create this unique and complex mode, we drew from the experience gained from Arena Mode in the first game. As an additional mode, Roguerunner.exe offered players a lot: unique, dedicated levels (300 types of combat arenas and 80 parkour challenges), new (and sometimes downright crazy) upgrades to the protagonist’s abilities, and an entirely different emotional experience due to the limited number of attempts for each run. We also utilized some skills that didn’t make it into the main game, such as H.O.T., inspired by the famous Polish indie game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Superhot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where time moves only when the player does.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The dangerous trap of wanting too much">The dangerous trap of wanting too much</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all these new and additional features, along with the separate game mode ready for launch day, the entire project was a massive undertaking for our incredibly talented, yet still under 50-person development team.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We knew that, despite efforts to reach a broader audience, we were still making a hardcore game, which always limits the player base. We introduced a number of changes to balance the gameplay, making it more accessible to newcomers, such as the previously mentioned ability to block attacks, shorter skill cooldowns, powerful special abilities, and a simplified character progression system. However, we didn’t compromise the core of the gameplay, which remains the most hardcore mechanic in our game – one-hit-kill. We couldn’t cross that line, so as not to disappoint the fans of the first game, and we’re proud that we were able to beat this challenge. While designing these adjustments, we feared that they might lead to a sense of blandness and weakness. We were walking on thin ice, but in the end, we stayed on the hardcore side, only slightly reducing its extreme nature. Even though the base version of the sequel may not be as difficult as the first game, the "Hardcore Mode" added shortly after the release is probably even more difficult than the one in the first installment. It offers a challenge designed to be nearly impossible for us, the developers, but we know that our most dedicated players possess skills that far exceed even the most experienced members of our QA team, who have spent thousands of hours in this title.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also learned a big lesson from the bosses in Ghostrunner, who weren’t that well-received by players. While making the sequel, we set a goal: each new boss must require a different approach from the player. Our inspiration came from boss fights in FromSoftware games, where bosses telegraph their attacks, and the player must learn the timing and animation sequences. I believe we succeeded in delivering truly unique bosses, whose designs were based on diverse, challenging mechanics.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lessons learned from creating the sequel">Lessons learned from creating the sequel</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting to the point—as they say, appetite comes with eating, and our ambitions have also grown since the release of the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghostrunner</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2020. Every day, we asked ourselves whether adding one more feature, a skill, or an additional mechanic would be enough to call the game a true sequel. How much of the gameplay needs to change for players to feel it’s a genuine continuation and not just capitalizing on the success of the original?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s probably no simple answer to these questions, as it all depends on the product. For example, when creating another game in a sports franchise, not much needs to change to make a successful sequel. We made the decision to keep the core of the game intact while adding many premium features around it, effectively expanding the overall gameplay experience with new possibilities and experiences (such as the arcade-style motorcycle riding).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, we achieved our goals, delivering a high-quality product that received great reviews and a nomination for Best Action Game at the 2023 Game Awards. However, it didn’t replicate the commercial success of the first installment, leaving us with a sense of unfulfilled potential. Naturally, the question arises: What could we have done better or differently? Perhaps we should have revisited the core of our gameplay and implemented more drastic changes—shed the pressure of competing with AAA giants and instead focus on further elevating the fundamental mechanics. Only time will tell, as we’re certain we still have a lot to offer our players and the fans of the franchise we’ve created and cherished.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The newly inked agreement includes Niantic’s <em>Pokémon Go, Monster Hunter Now, </em>and<em> Pikmin Bloom</em> mobile gaming titles.</p><p>“Niantic games have always been a bridge to connect people and inspire exploration, and I am confident they will continue to do both as part of Scopely,” said Niantic CEO John Hanke. “I firmly believe this partnership is great for our players and is the best way to ensure that our games have the long-term support and investment needed to be ‘forever games’ that will endure for future generations.”</p><p>The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Should the deal go through, it will also bring Niantic’s social companion apps for <em>Pokémon Go</em> — Campfire and Wayfarer — under Scopely ownership. Scopely says it will gain “Niantic’s entire team of exceptional gamemakers and category-leading games.” However, the <em>Peridot</em> and <em>Ingress</em> AR gaming titles, the latter of which is also supported by the Wayfarer mapping app, will remain under the ownership and development of Niantic Spatial.</p><p><em>Pokémon Go</em> attracted more than 500 million players in its first year, but its popularity was impacted in 2020 when global covid lockdowns kept people inside their homes.

We’re talking expanded level caps, new game plus, a brand new difficulty level which grants new skills and weapons, and…weapon reforging. If you’re au fait with <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>and its innumerable spinoffs, weapon reforging should look pretty familiar: If you have two copies of the same weapon, you can merge them to either mix-and-match skills or wholesale increase a weapon’s strength. Do this enough times, and you can theoretically get a +99 weapon with insane attack power. Neat, right?

With my shiny platinum trophy under my belt, I have conquered all the challenges, seen every sight, and felled entire armies by myself. And throughout all of that, not only did I never need reforged weapons to overcome any postgame challenges, I almost made an otherwise easy-to-get trophy way harder on myself. Here’s the breakdown.</p><h2 id="h2729365"><a id=""></a><strong>Why weapon reforging is awesome…in theory</strong></h2><p>Let’s cut to the chase: <strong>weapon reforging <em>technically</em> offers you the best weapons in the game</strong>. As you progress into the endgame, you can find weapons as high as Grade 7 as drops in battle. If you grind out enough Grade 7 weapons, you can merge them into an armament with a whopping 623 Attack stat and a slew of six passive skills of your own choosing. It’s those passives that are key here; normally weapons feature a mix of common and rare passive traits, but nothing’s stopping you from loading your weapon with all rare traits that will push your damage per second to the moon.</p><p>Nothing in the game will quite match the power of a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon. But you <em>will </em>find weapons that come awfully close, and therein lies the rub.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-recommend-id="image://4fee9f009ae2ece60aa47058102f3aa3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the equipment screen from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Rampaging Luan weapon is highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2729366"><a id=""></a><strong>Grade 8 Luan weapons are so much easier to get</strong></h2><p>Yes, while Grade 7 weapons are the best equipment you can find as drops, you can attain mythical Grade 8 “Luan” weapons by completing challenges on the postgame-exclusive Ultimate Warrior difficulty. Considering you can attain these weapons early in your postgame grind, they offer a huge jump in power. We’re talking attack power on par with a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon and a suite of six passive abilities that aren’t <em>great</em>, but are still perfectly acceptable for a non-forged weapon.</p><p>Luan weapons are all unique, so they can’t be upgraded or edited at all via weapon reforging. This is why a maxed out Grade 7 weapon can still outperform a Luan weapon in the end. But is the minor difference in power worth the massive difference in effort?</p><h2 id="h2729367"><a id=""></a><strong>Why Luan weapons are better than Grade 7 weapons in practice</strong></h2><p><strong>Getting a maxed Grade 7 weapon involves a huge grind</strong>. For reference, even after completing <em>everything </em>in the game, I didn’t get a single Grade 7 weapon past +40 with the drops I naturally acquired. Conversely, many Luan weapons aren’t even locked behind especially hard postgame challenges. For example, the Lurking Luan sword is locked behind the “Final Battle against the Yellow Turbans” mission in Chapter 1, and I completed this challenge with time to spare even though I was several levels below the recommended level 71.</p><p>By the time I reached max level through naturally completing Ultimate Warrior missions, I had <em>ample </em>power to defeat anything and everything the game could throw at me. Taking the time to grind out maxed Grade 7 weapons would have been total overkill.</p><figure id="" data-id="7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-recommend-id="image://7201ce68e997b666953a334961062d06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" A screenshot of the Weapon Reforge menu from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The Grade 7 weapon Celestial Sword +23 is highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h2729368"><a id=""></a><strong>The best way to get the Deadly Perfection achievement</strong></h2><p>Still, you don’t want to ignore weapon forging completely. The Deadly Perfection achievement is unlocked by fully upgrading a weapon, so you can’t miss this if you want 100 percent completion. Fortunately, as long as you’re not gunning for a fully upgraded Grade 7 weapon, this one is pretty easy.</p><p><strong>To easily get Deadly Perfection, just save your game and spend all your money on upgrading any weapon Grade 6 or lower</strong>. Since you can find and outright purchase weapons with +20 modifiers already on them, this is significantly easier to grind out as long as you have the cash. In fact, a +99 Grade 6 weapon will perform about on par with a +13 Grade 7 weapon, so you could choose to use one if you’re starting Ultimate Warrior. But if you’d rather save your cash, you can reload your game after getting your trophy.</p><p>To be clear, there’s nothing wrong with wanting a fully upgrade Grade 7 weapon! If you’re down for the grind, it’ll certainly make the rest of your postgame challenge easier. But if you’d rather save your time, you’re not missing much.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You and a squad can channel your inner repo man in 2025’s hit horror spectacle. REPO encourages groups of players to form, forage, and flee, and if it’s free and costs nothing, it would be all the more sweet. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-repo-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> started strongly, instantly gaining a few thousand players daily thanks to its advertised brand of silliness and scares. Within days, its community had exploded, achieving over a hundred thousand players and counting. You can’t help but laugh at REPO—before you inevitably shriek—and the addictive gameplay loop means replayability and longevity aren’t an issue.</p>



<p>More and more players are keen to get involved, and a low-cost entry point (potentially free) could be massive for its long-term success.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-repo-on-steam">How Much is REPO on Steam?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>One more piece of loot. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO costs $9.99 or £8.50 on Steam—the horror title isn’t free to play.</strong></p>



<p>Low-budget indie titles from growing studios are unlikely to make a project free-to-play. The company needs to make money, especially if it isn’t reliant on a microtransaction-driven economy. A $9.99 or £8.50 price tag is great value for what you get with REPO.</p>



<p>We’ve highlighted Steam as REPO is only available on PC for now. A future port can’t be ruled out, but there’s currently no talk of it coming to consoles. Never say never, and if it blows up enough, a future port can’t be ruled out.</p>



<p>There’s already a stellar amount of content in the game. What’s more is developer semiwork is blown away by the game’s success and is not content to sit around and leave players to grow tired of the existing features.</p>



<h2 id="h-future-repo-content-roadmap">Future REPO Content Roadmap</h2>



<p><strong>New enemies, levels, general content, and bug fixes are on the way in REPO.</strong></p>



<p>“Hey everyone, thank you so much for playing R.E.P.O. we are completely shocked and overjoyed with the response! Here’s a video with an update on what we are up to! We plan to release a video every week to make sure you guys are all up to date with our plans!” said the developer on a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3241660/view/515203741912138911?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">March 7 Steam post</a>.</p>

<p>If you have paid for REPO, or you’re planning on it, this is a great time to invest in the hit indie title.</p>



<hr>



<p>Many indie titles enjoy a hot start, and the hype and excitement dip. But Among Us shows that a squirrel finds a nut (or a gun) from time to time. It’ll be fascinating to see if REPO can stand the test of time in 2025—do you hope it can sustain its success?</p>

            <p>Hideki Kamiya has commented further on his decision to leave PlatinumGames in 2023, stating: "I couldn't allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn't agree with".</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/09/150183.html">Game*Spark</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideki-kamiya-wants-his-new-studio-to-inherit-the-teachings-of-resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami/">Automaton</a>), the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> creator discussed his new studio Clovers and disputed its similarity to Capcom's now-defunct Clover Studio (where he worked on Okami and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viewtiful-joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>) is not him "clinging to the past".</p>
<p>"If there's anything I'm particular about, it's Capcom Production Studio 4," he said. "Studio 4 is where my career started, and where I learned from Shinji Mikami - a person who has been absolutely indispensable to my career, both as a creator and as my superior."</p>

<p>Mikami led Production Studio 4, which was responsible for many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, Dino Crisis, Devil May Cry, and many more.</p>
<p>"Back then, we used to call what Mikami taught us the 'spirit of the 4th'," said Kamiya. "The reason I left PlatinumGames was because the company's way of thinking was gradually shifting towards a modern model of game development that doesn't place importance on the creators' individuality."</p>
<p>He added: "Even if it meant the end of my career as a creator, I couldn't allow myself to kill my soul in order to work in an environment that I didn't agree with."</p>
<p>Kamiya is a particularly outspoken figure in the games industry, but his output certainly has a unique and distinctive flair: from the stylish action of Devil May Cry and flamboyance of Bayonetta, to the unique visuals of Okami and Viewtiful Joe.</p>
<p>That spirit of "the creators' individuality" is also particularly apparent in, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">forthcoming Death Stranding 2</a>. Where the industry contains plenty of copycat games and sequels, Kamiya's comments highlight the importance of creating fresh experiences.</p>
<p>Another Kamiya example would be the cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/scalebound">Scalebound</a>, which Kamiya worked on at PlatinumGames with Microsoft. The action game focused on a human protagonist with headphones and a smartphone in a fantasy world with a sidekick dragon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-still-wants-to-resurrect-the-cancelled-scalebound">Kamiya recently stated his interest in resurrecting the project</a>, with a direct callout to Xbox boss Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Kamiya also took a cheeky stab at his former employer in a video on his YouTube channel. It features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-loses-more-game-directors-reveals-former-vice-president-hideki-kamiya">number of prominent developers from PlatinumGames who have recently left</a> all having a drinking party.</p>
<p>Clovers, Kamiya's new studio, is working on a sequel to Okami. The announcement had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-announcement-had-hideki-kamiya-crying-with-the-fans">Kamiya "crying with the fans"</a>.</p>
<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-ninja-gaiden-4s-two-protagonists-will-honour-the-series-legacy">working with Microsoft on Ninja Gaiden 4</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microtransactions have been added to EA's free-to-play Skate revival during the game's closed alpha test.</p>
<p>Skate's in-game currency is known as San Van Bucks, and allows players to buy various cosmetic items. As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/">Insider Gaming</a>, developer Full Circle said this is being added to give players a "positive experience when purchasing items from the Skate store".</p>

<p>A message to Skate's playtesters reads: "To ensure we achieve these goals at Early Access we have enabled the option to purchase and use virtual currency (San Van Bucks) in our ongoing Closed Alpha playtest.</p>
<p>"Your feedback will be greatly appreciated in providing a great experience at Early Access launch."</p>
<p>The developer has told players that any purchases made during the test will be converted back to San Van Bucks prior to the game's early access launch. The currency will be made available again at the start of Skate's early access, but players must ensure they use the same EA account.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">Five years after it was first announced</a>, Skate will launch in early access later this year, although EA is yet to give us a specific date.</p>
<p>On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox and PC. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p><p><span data-fixed="false" data-hashid="" data-init="false" data-poll-position="1"></span>

In other skateboarding-related news, earlier this month Activision announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were finally getting the remake treatment</a>.

            <p>Two voice actors working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-tier-list-best-characters">Zenless Zone Zero</a> have been suddenly recast due to the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike over AI abuse, and discovered the change alongside the publication of the game's patch notes.</p>
<p>Emeri Chase, who played Soldier 11, announced they were replaced as they were "unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protections".</p>
<p>Meanwhile Nicholas Thurkettle, who played Lycaon, has also been recast despite not being a member of the union. Both actors only found out about the recasting at the same time as players, when details of <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/37341958">Zenless Zone Zero's latest patch</a> went live.</p>

<p>Chase posted a thread on social media to explain the situation.</p>
<p>"I'd like to clarify that there's a difference between being 'struck' and not being on an Interim Agreement," they said. "Union projects that began work prior to the strike and non-union projects are not 'struck'. But they also do not offer the Union-enforced AI rights we are fighting for.</p>
<p>"Many actors are choosing to voluntarily withhold work on these categories of projects because we feel it is the best way to support the Union's fight for the protections that are critical to our continued ability to create the art we love.</p>
<p>"I knew that by withholding work it was possible I'd be replaced, though of course I hoped they would choose to leave her silent until I was able to return. I found out the role was recast today alongside all of you."</p>

I was replaced as Soldier 11 because I am unwilling to perform work not covered by a SAG Interim Agreement during a strike for AI protection, the outcome of which will determine the future of our industry.

Any other theories that pop up are incorrect.

<p>Today, Eurogamer reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">strike from US actors' union SAG-AFTRA remains ongoing</a> as it warns of "alarming loopholes" for "AI abuse" in the latest proposal.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike began back in July last year</a>, with the main sticking point being the need to protect actors from AI abuse.</p>
<p>While some actors are still working despite the strike, Chase and Thurkettle's situation is a clear example of the risk actors are taking to protect their livelihoods as the dispute continues.</p>
<p>Today the union urged performers to "seriously consider the consequences" of working with game producers at this time, not only in undermining the strike but opening performers to AI misuse.</p>
<p>In related news, HoYoverse announced actor Showtaro Morikubo will no longer voice Ifa in the Japanese version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Genshin_7/status/1899664144800080249">social media announcement</a>, the company stated "due to various circumstances" the actors has "been forced to withdraw from the project".</p>

The book likens the Chinese government's treatment of the Uyghur to the suppression and genocide of Jewish people by the Nazi party.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Netflix's first gaming boss has left the company, following a shift in role and various changes behind the scenes last year.
</p>
<p>
Mike Verdu launched and led Netflix's gaming efforts in 2021, but was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflixs-mike-verdu-reveals-new-role-as-vp-of-genai-for-games">moved to a new role - VP of Generative AI for games at Netflix</a> - in November last year. At the time, Verdu said peers should "pay no mind to uninformed speculation in the media about changes at Netflix Games", as the changes were a "planned transition".
</p>
<p>
Now, Verdu has departed the company entirely, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-mike-verdu-exit-gdc">Game File</a> has reported.
</p>
<p>
The move follows a number of shifts behind the scenes last year, including the hiring of gaming industry veteran Alain Tascan to serve as Verdu's replacement as gaming boss.
</p>
<p>
In October 2024, Netflix closed a major internal game studio led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten, and scrapped its big-budget project before it was ever announced.
</p>
<p>
By January, <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">Netflix had reportedly dropped at least six other game projects</a> it was planning to publish - including cosy Hobbit sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, which will now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-yet-again">launch at a later date without the streaming company's involvement</a>.
</p>
<p>
And in February this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-culls-staff-at-oxenfree-developer-night-school-studio">Netflix cut staff at Oxenfree developer Night School Studio</a>. No announcement was made on how many jobs were lost, or what the studio was working on next.
</p>
<p>
As Netflix reorganises its plans, it remains unclear how its gaming focus will look going forward - other than Verdu will not be part of it.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix celebrated its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a> by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-celebrates-its-biggest-quarter-yet-by-putting-uk-prices-up-again">increasing its prices yet again</a>, including here in the UK.

"Management did not inform public about these steps either," Krúpa claimed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in October, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-04/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-consider-buyout-of-ubisoft?srnd=undefined" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg reported</a> that Ubisoft's founding Guillemot family and shareholder Tencent were in discussions to take the company private following a number of high-profile flops, game cancellations, and the collapse of the company's share price. At the time, the talks were merely exploratory, and Ubisoft told IGN it would "inform the market if and when appropriate."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For several years now, Ubisoft has seemed to be in a strange, slow downward spiral, with a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed">high-profile flops</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices">layoffs</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">studio closures</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once">game cancellations, and delay after delay after delay</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, rumors continue to spin about what exact proposals the board is considering, with some media outlets floating the idea that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-brothers-ubisoft-buyout-reportedly-held-up-by-dispute-over-control" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tencent is increasingly reluctant to embrace Ubisoft</a> due to the Guillemot family's insistance on retaining a significant amount of control. Sans Tencent, there are few other companies big enough and rich enough to spend the cash needed to save the albatross Ubisoft has grown into.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Management postponed its current game (which should save the company and its financials) Assassin’s Creed first time on 18th of July 2024," Krúpa's statement said. "On that date, Ubisoft confirmed full-year guidance for the year and release of AC Shadows on November 15. 2024. Just [a] couple months later, in September 2024, Ubisoft delayed the game again and revised its guidance, which in our view, was [a] move that could have [been] predicted by Ubisoft management. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After [the] third delay, the game will finally be published on March 20, 2025. These delays and revised guidances caused severe stock declines, which harmed mostly retail investors that have limited resources to manage their positions accordingly. This action benefited mainly corporate and institutional investors who were on the buy side for distressed prices such as Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs clients, Morgan Stanley, and others."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Believing management did not communicate with shareholders "appropriately," AJ Investments is calling on all investors "who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft's stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team" to join its protest in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are aware that Ubisoft’s management and CEO have initiated a financial review of potential strategic options, advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. We expect this review to yield results in the coming months,” said Juraj Krúpa, founder of AJ Investments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why we are organizing this demonstration in May — to ensure they have time to reach a conclusion that genuinely increases shareholder value. If their conclusion effectively enhances shareholder value, we will call off the demonstration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All shareholders/investors of Ubisoft deserve a company that maximizes value and operates with transparency and accountability,” Krúpa added. “Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AJ Investors said that it is prepared to "sue the company for misleading investors."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time this investor has called for the company to go private amid a shares slump following the disappointing release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-outlaws"><u>Star Wars Outlaws</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disgruntled-ubisoft-investor-calls-on-assassins-creed-maker-to-go-private-as-shares-slump"><u>AJ Investments issued a strongly worded open letter to Ubisoft’s board of directors</u></a>, including its CEO Yves Guillemot, as well as fellow investor Tencent, to express their dissatisfaction with the performance of the company and its current share price and urging the firm to change its leadership and consider a sale.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Lego is working to build up its in-house game development, the company's boss has revealed. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf">The Financial Times</a>, Lego boss Niels Christiansen said the company was increasing its focus on video game experiences created by its own teams, following years of partnerships with outside companies. 
</p>
<p>
"We can definitely say, as long as we're under the Lego brand, we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical," Christiansen said. "[In-house game development] is something we're building up. We have made quite a few investments in the future – I'd almost rather overinvest. That's the benefit of being family-owned and long term."
</p>
<p>
For over a decade, Lego games were mostly made by British studio TT Games, with a popular tie-in to a big movie franchise released every year.
</p>
<p>
For 15 years, TT Games pumped out dozens of annual Lego games with a familiar formula, based on Star Wars, Harry Potter, Marvel and DC characters. It also mounted the ambitious toys-to-life effort <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But that era of Lego gaming is largely over, with only one entry - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a> - in the past six years. TT Games is reportedly still working on a further title, but it is not expected in 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since then, Lego has licensed its brand to a wider set of developers - most notably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, and the recent launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Lego Horizon Adventures</a>, co-developed by Guerilla Games and published by Sony. Fortnite now has a deep integration with Lego, with minifigure versions of most of its digital skins, two large Lego game modes, and countless mini-games made by Lego itself and fans.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, now rebranded to Lego Fortnite Odyssey, is a Minecraft-y offering regularly played by around 50,000 people concurrently within the main Fortnite client. Last December, the company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-brick-life-is-a-major-new-social-game-mode-that-sounds-a-bit-like-the-sims">launched Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, a gentle life sim and house decoration game, to a smaller audience.
</p>
<p>
For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-lego-horror-cheerful-games-and-others-we-just-cant-get-into">The Lego Group has a small team of designers building and launching game concepts within Fortnite</a>, which now has an impressive replication of Lego bricks and physics baked into Epic's Unreal Engine. It'll be interesting to see what's next, as the wait for TT Games' next old-school Lego game continues.
</p>
<p>"I hope it will never be done," head of Lego gaming at The Lego Group Remi Marcelli told Eurogamer last year, of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-future-of-lego-fortnite-i-hope-it-will-never-be-done">the company's big Fortnite mode, which continues to expand</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>With just about two weeks before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/rebellions-atomfall-single-player-survival-action-game-is-out-on-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atomfall</a>, UK developer Rebellion has shared the minimum system requirements needed to play the game's PC version. They're not too different from what we see nowadays, though the good news is that the game (powered as usual by Rebellion's proprietary Asura engine) won't occupy too much space on your drive.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 or later</li>
<li><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;Intel CPU Core i5-9400f or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>Memory:</strong>&nbsp;16 GB RAM</li>
<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;Nvidia 2060 6GB or equivalent</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong>&nbsp;Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Storage:</strong>&nbsp;60 GB available space</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a fresh features trailer out today, too, and you can watch it below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Features Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5k1QT6gM5wY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Atomfall is being labeled as Rebellion's take on Fallout, although it is more of a survival action game than a roleplaying game. It is set in a post-apocalyptic British countryside landscape heavily inspired by the real-life Windscale Fire disaster of the 1950s in England, unfolding in a quarantined environment where players must uncover the mysteries of a nuclear disaster while surviving in a militarized zone. The setting includes inspirations from the likes of Doctor Who and even folk horror.</p>
<p>According to the developers, Atomfall will let players explore a non-linear world filled with complex characters and ambiguous moral dilemmas. The story will also change depending on the player's decisions. This design was crafted to encourage multiple playthroughs, with players experiencing different facets of the game based on their choices.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself won't be about running and gunning. Players will have to scavenge for supplies, craft weapons and items, and fight desperately to make it out of the quarantined zone. Weapons and ammunition are in short supply, so each frenetic battle will see them forced to mix ranged with hand-to-hand combat. In a nod to Rebellion's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sniper-elite-resistance-sniping-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sniper Elite series</a>, players will have to manage their character's heart rate to maintain a steady aim.</p>
<p>Atomfall will launch on March 27 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, though the Deluxe Edition provides three days of early access as well as a few in-game items and access to an upcoming expansion. The game will be available on release day for all Game Pass subscribers.</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, Hazelight Studios <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3ljztto3sws2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that their latest game, Split Fiction, has already sold over a million copies in just two days since its debut on the market. The immense popularity of the studio's previous release, the award-winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a> (which sold 23 million copies, over twice as much as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Way Out</a>'s 11 million units), certainly contributed to the great hype surrounding the latest co-op adventure crafted by Josef Fares and his team.</p>
<p>This is reflected in the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/developer/Hazelight+Studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam figures</a>. While A Way Out peaked at just 8.5K concurrent users and It Takes Two reached 71K concurrent users, Split Fiction registered 259K concurrent users three days ago, with the potential to set a new record this coming weekend.</p>
<p>The game also got a warm reception from critics overall, as evidenced by the 91 average Metacritic score. Our Nathan Birch was slightly less enthusiastic about it, though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving it an 8 out of 10 score</a>.</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Are you enjoying Hazelight's new game so far?</p>
<p>In other news, Josef Fares recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared his opinion</a> on the damage that the microtransaction business model deals to developer creativity.</p>

            <p>
Three top Ubisoft employees have appeared in a French court, accused of harassing employees before their departure from the company almost five years ago.
</p>
<p>
The trio includes Serge Hascoet, Ubisoft's previous chief creative officer and right-hand man to company boss Yves Guillemot, plus the former VP of editorial and creative services Tommy Francois, and Guillaume Patrux, a game designer and director.
</p>
<p>
All three deny sexually and psychologically harassing and humiliating employees during their tenures at the company, up until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">they resigned or were dismissed in 2020</a>.
</p>
<p>
Details discussed during the court appearance this week (thanks, <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250310-former-ubisoft-bosses-on-trial-in-france-over-alleged-harassment-1">France24</a>) include accusations of racist comments and behaviour by Hascoet, who allegedly asked a Muslim employee if she agreed with the Islamic State terrorist group in the wake of the 2015 Paris terrorist attack. It's alleged that the same staff member had their computer desktop wallpaper changed to that of bacon, and had food placed on their desk during the fasting month of Ramadan.
</p>
<p>
A string of allegations concerning Francois includes him having regularly watched porn in the company's open-plan office, kissing colleagues, and remarking on their appearance by calling them "ugly" or a "slut". Francois specifically is accused of sexual assault for allegedly forcing himself on a young employee during a Christmas party. He also allegedly forced a young employee to perform a headstand while wearing a skirt.
</p>
<p>
Patrux, meanwhile, stands accused of psychological harassment.
</p>
<p>
The trial has now been adjourned until 2nd June after lawyers complained they had not been given long enough with the case's documentation.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Ubisoft for comment.

			<p>During a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzAtYaSYZms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wicked Inside</a>, Moon Studios revealed major news about its in-development action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-update-revamps-crucible-improves-combat-and-adds-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">No Rest for the Wicked</a>. Arguably the most important tidbit is that the Austrian developer has secured the game's publishing rights back from Private Division, after several months of legal negotiations. This will allow the studio to be fully independent when making decisions about the title. To celebrate the occurrence, there's a 30% discount valid for another 32 hours or so.</p>
<p>Moon Studios then moved on to share details about the next big update, The Breach, out on April 30. This update will expand the campaign and introduce new areas, armors, factions, enemies, and weapons, roughly doubling the world size. The new areas include the Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, while players will encounter new foes known as the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</p>
<p>The Breach will add new weapon archetypes (gauntlets &amp; wands) to No Rest for the Wicked and an updated loot system for more build variety. Furthermore, the game world is getting more dynamic thanks to the 'Alive' system, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape it. The Plague system will also unleashe powerful new plague enemies and bosses. Plague outbreaks now occur throughout Sacra, and players can cleanse these regions to gain powerful new plague resources.</p>
<p>Several quality-of-life improvements are also included, such as the ability to teleport directly to your home, improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, timer improvements, and a redesigned storage system. Additionally, there's now a Hardcore mode, and visual and performance have been enhanced and optimized with improved lighting and NVIDIA DLSS implementation.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - Official Game Overview of The Breach | Wicked Inside Showcase 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzAtYaSYZms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After The Breach, the following big update will introduce multiplayer for up to four players. A preview of that is coming soon. The developer is also planning further expansions to the city, housing, farming, and progression systems, as well as further refinements to combat. Lastly, the celebrated composer of the Ori series, Gareth Coker, has rejoined Moon Studios and will contribute new music to No Rest for the Wicked.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Francesco De Meo's early access hands-on preview</a>, the game has a lot of potential, although the developers clearly still need some time to realize it. The full game has no release date yet.</p>

            <p>“While GTA lets players experience a fictional underworld of lawless enterprise, the entities behind PlayerAuctions own and operate a real one".

<p>(I have no choice but to respect the hustle of trying to make GTA's "fictional underworld of lawless enterprise" sound as cool as possible during a lawsuit. "While GTA lets players do cool and fun <strong>fake</strong> crimes...")</p>
<p>"The website PlayerAuctions.com offers a vast online marketplace containing thousands of listings for unauthorized, infringing GTA V content – including heavily modified player accounts, in-game assets, and virtual currency – all gained by using hacking software, cheats, and technical exploits,” continues the complaint.</p>

<p>As Polygon note, selling a GTA Online account to another player is not strictly illegal, though it's against terms of service. It's this alleged infringement, alongside copyright and trademark infringement claims, that comprise the complaint.</p>
<p>By offering account boosting, modded accounts, and currency drops, Take Two claim that PlayAuctions offers "an otherwise impossible experience: new players can begin GTA V with billions in VC and with a massive arsenal of in-game content—such as vehicles, clothing, and weapons—configurations only possible by hacking and modifying the GTA V game in breach of the Rockstar TOS."</p>
<p>"In some cases, these listings advertise 'unlock all' accounts preloaded with maxed-out character levels and virtually all in-game assets available to acquire in GTA Online," they continue. "Moreover, users buying Account Boosting Services give control of their GTA V account temporarily to an unknown third party – in violation of the Rockstar TOS – and disclose their GTA V account information, including passwords". PlayerAuctions take "at least 12.99% in fees," write Polygon, and the lawsuit claims that this amounts to "many tens of millions or even upwards of 100 million dollars."</p>
<p>“At the scale of its website," say Take-Two, "PlayerAuctions risks upending the GTA V player experience and interferes with the balance and fairness of the game. PlayerAuctions’ business also actively promotes behavior that risks creating a ‘race for the bottom’ where innocent GTA V players feel pressured to buy unauthorized digital goods and service, or else resort to using hacks or cheating themselves, to ‘keep up’ with PlayerAuctions’ customers."</p>
<p>A cynic might offer a translation to the above along the lines of "won't somebody please think of the innocent Shark Cards". Not me though. I look at GTA V's <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/96595/grand-theft-auto-franchise-revenues-break-8-9-billion-since-gta-vs-launch/index.html">reported £6.9 billion revenue since release</a> and think, now that's just some good honest videogame sales.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/520139/roblox-lawsuit-playerauctions-trading">Roblox sued PlayerAuctions for similar claims</a> last month, report Polygon. Take-Two's latest gift to innocent GTA V players is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-5s-free-enhanced-update-spoiled-by-missing-in-game-text-chat-but-it-may-only-be-temporary">reportedly somewhat borked</a> GTA V Enhanced Edition.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Today in "news that will get you banished from society if you try to explain it to anyone who doesn't live on the internet," the owner of an erotic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> subreddit has had their moderator status revoked from the main subreddit after a brief civil war surrounding AI generated art culminated with developer LocalThunk intervening. Cheers to <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/">Garbage Day</a> for the spot.</p>
<p>Many threads lie dead and buried in the bloody wake of all this, but the brief rundown is that moderator DrTankHead - who also runs r/balatromance - waded into the following thread:</p>

<p>"Is it too much to ask to have a fun subreddit about a fun game that isn't being held hostage by a horny pro-AI weirdo?...that is too much to ask, isn't it," wrote user cherrycokeicee in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7l3e8/this_subreddit_is_doomed/">now locked thread</a>. Much banana flinging ensued, until Localthunk eventually had to get involved themselves.</p>
<p>"A mod recently changed the flair in this subreddit for AI generated art making it seem like Playstack condones AI art. This was not due to a direct order from Playstack (A Playstack representative told me this) but from a interpretation of a message about enforcing the rules of the subreddit," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1j7ocoa/regarding_ai_art"> they wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"Neither Playstack nor I condone AI 'art'. I don't use it in my game, I think it does real harm to artists of all kinds," Localthunk continued. "The actions of this mod do not reflect how Playstack feels or how I feel on the topic. We have removed this moderator from the moderation team. We will not be allowing AI generated images on this subreddit from now on. We will make sure our rules and FAQ reflect this soon."</p>
<p>The sub's rules do indeed now say "No AI generated art or content" underneath the "No low-effort posts/No spam" section.</p>
<p>After having their mod status removed, DrTankHead <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatromance/comments/1j82g1w/addressing_the_main_subs_ai_art_ban/">posted in r/balatroromance</a>, which he hopes will now offer a similar haven for AI art as it historically has for horny posting. "Please just get off Reddit for a week or two," replied one user.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-5-enhanced-is-now-the-worst-rated-grand-theft-auto-title-on-steam.1132005/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-enhanced-worst-rated-steam-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been a few days since Rockstar Games released GTA 5 Enhanced on PC, bringing a slew of changes and upgrades to the title and allowing players to migrate from the ‘standard’ version of Grand Theft Auto 5. However, things haven’t gone swimmingly, with the game’s overall review score on Steam bombing to an all-time low.</p>



<p>It’s now the worst-rated GTA title on the platform, with almost 10,000 reviews bearing a negative sentiment. It has garnered mixed feedback that’s <strong>mostly </strong>positive, but only just, with 53% of reviews saying something good about the release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-what-we-wanted">Not What We Wanted</h2>



<p>The biggest gripe players have with GTA 5 Enhanced on Steam is that the account migration feature is hit and miss. Many have reported in their reviews that they’ve been unsuccessful in migrating their accounts, which some have poured thousands of hours (and dollars) into over the years.</p>



<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One review in particular</a> shines at echoing this sentiment:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The GTA Online profile associated with this Rockstar Games account is not eligible for migration at this time.” If you think i’m throwing away nearly 700 hours of gameplay on one character so that you can make a few more bucks off me, then you can lick my anal orifice clean. – MrMorganfarts</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Eloquently put.</p>



<p>Another user explained that Rockstar has removed online chat, which has made lobbies and missions feel <strong>dead</strong>, while many more have said that GTA 5 Enhanced should have been an update applied to the base game and not an entirely new version.</p>



<p>The positive reviews, which were still in the close majority at the time of writing, say nice things about the upgraded visuals, the quality-of-life improvements, and the reduction in stuttering and frame rate issues.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped GTA 5 from being the worst-rated Grand Theft Auto title on Steam, though. It’s not close, either – it’s leading in that position by a good 10%. </p>



<p>Have you ‘upgraded’ to GTA 5 Enhanced and experienced issues? Let me know what you’re struggling with in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>A Popular Fortnite leaker has stated that the game could receive a new emote inspired by Kendrick Lamar’s song.</p>



<p>Fortnite leaker HYPEX’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1899497216546410966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> talks about the upcoming Fortnite x Kendrick Lamar collaboration. The partnership will seemingly introduce a “Sit Down, Be Humble” bundle with an emote and song. The song will most likely be “Humble,” the Grammy-winning song by the American Rapper, which was released in 2017. The tweet also states that the “Emote might be from the girl in “Not Like Us. “&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many players will be excited to see Kendrick Lamar-inspired emotes arriving in the game. Some have also started speculating that the hip-hop artist could be a part of the next Fortnite Festival season. Others also wonder why Fortnite is going with a 2017 song when Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Not Like Us’ blew out of the stratosphere after his Super Bowl performance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, previous leaks have already provided an idea about who Fortnite Festival’s next headliner will be, and it doesn’t seem like it is Kendrick Lamar. According to the leaks that arrived in January this year, the next artist could be none other than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-sabrina-carpenter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sabrina Carpenter</a>. The ‘Espresso’ singer is speculated to be the next Fortnite Festival Icon, which will bring new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Fortnite is expected to introduce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-a-new-lara-croft-skin-this-update-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Lara Croft skin</a> in this update. Also, cheaters with lifetime bans will receive a ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-cheaters-with-lifetime-bans-will-receive-a-second-chance-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second chance</a>’ soon. What are your thoughts on Fortnite getting a Kendrick Lamar emote?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Take-Two, the parent company behind Rockstar Games, has sued PlayerAuctions, a side that allegedly facilitates the sale of hacked and boosted GTA Online accounts and illegitimate in-game currency. The recent lawsuit was filed in California, with Take-Two claiming that the Chinese-owned PlayerAuctions platform was ‘reaping millions in revenue’ based on these sales.</p>



<p>The filing from the U.S. Central District Court of California insists that PlayerAuctions is being run with the ‘full knowledge that its sellers are engaged in rampant infringement and other unauthorised conduct.’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-first">Not The First</h2>



<p>It was revealed in February 2025 that the Roblox Corporation was also suing PlayerAuctions for a similar streak of allegations. As these cases ramp up, more developers and publishers may enter the fight, as PlayerAuctions supports the sale of digital goods and services from a staggering assortment of titles.</p>



<p>Everything from RuneScape and Fortnite to World of Warcraft and Call of Duty is featured on PlayerAuctions.</p>



<p>The Take-Two case, which was originally spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/536315/take-two-gta-5-online-black-market-lawsuit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, offers an in-depth perspective on how PlayerAuctions operates and how it’s walking a fine legal line when it comes to digital goods in GTA Online.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836607989/Take-Two-PlayerAuctions-lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">California court filing</a> reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PlayerAuctions goes to great lengths to lull its users into buying illegitimate GTA V content from its sellers, including by offering ‘after-sale protection’ – i.e. refunds – if the hacked accounts they purchase are detected and banned by Take-Two’s anti-cheat systems.</p>



<p>PlayerAuctions offers this ‘protection’ because it knows the hacked player account listings on its marketplace are infringing and unauthorised under Take-Two’s terms of service.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was stressed in the filing that Take-Two has sent several notices to PlayerAuctions along with evidence of these claims, but the platform’s operators have refused to relent. Per the statutory claims of the case, Take-Two would be entitled to $150,000 for each copyright infringed, but PlayerAuctions’ sales figures haven’t yet been made public.</p>



<p>It could be a monster case in terms of damages if Take-Two is successful.</p>
