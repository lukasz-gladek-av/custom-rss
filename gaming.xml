<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51654ce4ad6d6/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We knew that the Switch 2 had gotten off to a pretty strong start, but according to recent numbers from Circana's Mat Piscatella, Nintendo's new console is doing <em>remarkably</em> well in the US.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26">Bluesky</a>, Piscatella confirmed that Switch 2 sales have now surpassed 2 million in the US. Not only that, but the console is currently outpacing the original Switch by 75%. <em>75%</em>! That's wild. According to Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">most recent financial release</a>, the console surpassed a total of 6 million sales worldwide in the seven weeks following its launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>

<p>Of course, a strong start is all well and good, but whether or not Nintendo can maintain its early success will be crucial in the long run. Ironically, the recent news that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-switch-console-and-accessory-prices-are-going-up-in-the-us">original Switch consoles would actually increase in price in the US</a> means that the Switch 2 is now a much more enticing prospect.</p>
<p>Why pay $400 for an OLED when you can save up an extra $50 for the successor, right?</p>
<p>Still, regardless of price, Nintendo will need to ensure that it's providing a steady stream of top-quality games. So far, so good, and with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> all scheduled to launch later this year, we reckon Nintendo will have no trouble shifting more Switch 2 units.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The next batch of PlayStation Plus freebies is arriving next week and it’s a darn good haul of games, including the beloved indie blockbuster <em>Stardew Valley.</em></p> <p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">On August 27</a>, as is usual around the end of the month, Sony announced what next month’s free PS Plus games will be. These games are available to all tiers of PS Plus subscribers and will be available to grab and download starting September 2.&nbsp; All of these games can be played on PS5 or PS4.&nbsp; Here’s the full list:</p> <ul> <li><em>Psychonauts 2</em> – PS4</li> <li><em>Stardew Valley</em> – PS4</li> <li><em>Viewfinder</em> – PS4, PS5</li> </ul> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-present-and-future-of-stardew-valley-1766238624">The star of the show is likely to be <em>Stardew Valley</em>,</a> which appears to have never been given away as a PlayStation Plus game before. That seems wild to me! But hey, if you have not yet played this wildly popular cozy pixel-art life sim that features RPG combat, farming, and more, now is the perfect time to give it a shot. Personally, I’m more excited that more people will get a chance to play <a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536"><em>Psychonauts 2</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/psychonauts-2-the-kotaku-review-1847533536">, a fantastic 3D platformer</a> from Double Fine that I enjoyed a lot back in 2021. I highly recommend you set some time aside to play it. Finally, there’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/viewfinder-puzzle-game-pc-ps5-impressions-sad-owl-1850649178"><em>Viewfinder</em></a>, a neat first-person puzzle game with an interesting mechanic involving taking pictures and stepping into them. If you like <em>Portal</em> or other similar puzzle games, check this one out, too!</p> <p>Oh, and don’t wait around too much longer to grab last month’s collection of PlayStation Plus free games. <em>Lies of P, Day Z, </em>and <em>My Hero One’s Justice 2</em> won’t be free after September 1, so add them to your game library before then if you want to play any of them in the future. Also, keep in mind that you can only play these PS Plus games if you have an active PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium membership.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We may see more Clair Obscur games in the future in the future, according to the game’s director. In a recent YouTube interview, Sandfall Interactive’s Guillaume Broche, talked about the RPG’s massive success. However, it seems he hints at there being more in store for the Clair Obscur series outside of Expedition 33.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Sandfall Interactive’s first-ever title, took the world by storm earlier this year. With incredible turn-based combat, stunning visuals, and intense storytelling, it was a hit with fans and critics alike. In fact, many have already called it the best game of 2025. So, it’s not too surprising to hear that the team wants to return to it, though not in the same way.</p>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-will-continue-after-expedition-33-says-guillaume-broche">Clair Obscur Will Continue After Expedition 33, Says Guillaume Broche</h2>

<iframe title="The SECRETS Behind Expedition 33 &amp; What’s Next for Sandfall... | Guillaume Broche Opens Up" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZEP5kjw-w4?start=321&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The interview in question comes from YouTuber MrMattyPlays. Due to the success of Clair Obscur, Expedition 33, director Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZEP5kjw-w4&amp;t=321s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sat down with the YouTuber</a> to chat about it. During the talk, the question came up about there being more of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In response, Guillaume Broche said the following:</p>



<p>“Clair Obscur is the franchise name. Expedition 33 is one of the stories that we want to tell in this franchise,” states Broche. “Exactly what it will look like and what the concept will be is still too soon to announce, but what is sure is that this is not the end of the Clair Obscur franchise.”</p>



<p>Also during the interview, Broche mentions sequels, so we could return to Expedition 33, alongside new stories. As he does mention, what those new games will look like, narrative-wise, is too soon to say. The ending of Expedition 33 does leave room for more, so it’s only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developers-thinking-of-plans-for-next-game/">a matter of time</a> before we see what that may be.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A “Deluxe Edition” will also be available for $44.99, which includes the following content:</p><p>Netmarble also released a <a href="https://slvariseoverdrive.netmarble.com/en/news/1/3" target="_blank">Developer Note</a> detailing the core gameplay features and philosophy behind the game, emphasizing that the game is a premium title separate from the mobile game&nbsp;<em><a title="Games > Solo Leveling: ARISE" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/solo-leveling-arise">Solo Leveling: ARISE</a></em>, in which Hunters, weapons for Sung Jinwoo and other Hunters, and growth systems are unlocked through gameplay. It also elaborates on creating a distinct experience for consoles and PC, with standalone systems, narrative depth, and controls.</p><div><p><strong>■ Greetings, Hunters!</strong></p><p>I am Kim Gwang Hoon, the development producer of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p>We are thrilled to greet you for the first time as the development team behind <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p>With <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> already receiving so much love, developing a new game for PC and console players has brought us not only great excitement and anticipation but also a fair share of fear and serious contemplation about venturing into the unknown.</p><p>Still, the desire to reinterpret the epic journey of <em>Solo Leveling</em> in a new dimension, and to present new experiences and deeper gameplay aimed at PC and console that couldn’t be explored in <em>ARISE</em>, has driven our strong spirit of challenge. <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is our bold new venture.</p><p>We understand that many of you may have questions about our new game.</p><p>To the current players of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>, we deeply empathize with your feelings that the arrival of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> might mean we’re turning our attention away from <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>. And to those of you waiting for <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>, we also recognize the concern that it might end up as nothing more than a simple port of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em>.</p><p>But please rest assured, <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is an entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> will continue to evolve on its own path, aiming to provide the best possible gameplay experience. At the same time, <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is being developed as a distinct PC/console title with its own unique identity. We are doing our utmost to ensure that both projects live up to your expectations.</p><p>Now, allow us to share more about how <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is being developed.</p><p><strong>■ <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is a New Game <a title="Companies > Experience [212 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong></p><p>What we would like to emphasize first and foremost is that <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is a full-package game. Rather than relying on randomness when recruiting Hunters or crafting weapons, we’ve designed the game to reward effort and strategy, allowing you to feel a true sense of achievement. All the Hunters, Sung Jinwoo and their weapons, and the joy of progression can be earned and enjoyed entirely through in-game play.</p><p><strong>Hunter Recruitment</strong></p><p>By Sung Jinwoo’s side stands not only his shadows, but also many skilled Hunters who fight alongside him. In <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>, you can offer each Hunter a payment worthy of their abilities and recruit them to join you in battle.</p><p><strong>Weapon <a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a></strong></p><p>As a player, you can directly choose and craft your own weapons. Defeat powerful bosses and use the materials you obtain to forge formidable weapons for Sung Jinwoo and the Hunters. By combining various weapons and skill trees, you’ll be able to create a unique combat style that’s entirely your own.</p><p><strong>■ What Sets <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> Apart</strong></p><p>The passion of <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE</em> now burns anew on PC and console with <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>.</p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> is built upon two core values.</p><p>First, <strong>deeper and more refined <a title="Genres > Action [2,987 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a></strong>.</p><p>We’ve designed the controls to suit PC and console platforms, maximizing the thrill of weighty and precise combat.</p><p>Second, <strong>overwhelming immersion</strong>.</p><p>A world brought to life with next-level PC and console graphics that will fully draw fans into the game’s story, delivering a truly immersive experience.</p><p><strong>■ Visuals That Deepen Immersion</strong></p><p>We’ve pushed the visual quality of the game to its highest level, so that you can become fully immersed in the world of <em>Solo Leveling</em>.</p><p><strong>Background Level Up</strong></p><p>Now, You Are There. To bring the iconic moments from the webtoon to life more vividly, we’ve significantly enhanced the detail and quality of the game’s environments. Though the game is based on the original webtoon, the backgrounds are portrayed in a style that bridges the gap between comic and realism, allowing you to not only feel as if you’ve stepped into the webtoon itself, but to experience a whole new level of immersion.</p><p><strong>Character Level Up</strong></p><p>A brand-new customization system has been added, just for you.</p><p><strong>Sung Jinwoo: Styled, Chosen, Completed by You</strong></p><p>You can personalize Sung Jinwoo by selecting his hairstyle and hair color, and equipping various facial accessories to create a version of him that’s truly one of a kind.</p><p><strong>Highlight Your <a title="Genres > Party [104 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">Party</a>‘s <a title="Series > Persona [90 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lity</strong></p><p>You can also freely change the hair color of your fellow Hunters, letting their individuality shine even more. Mix and match hairstyles and colors across multiple Hunters to create a party that reflects your unique style.</p><p><strong>■ Combat with Strategic Depth</strong></p><p>We’ve built a combat system that goes beyond simple <a title="Genres > Hack-and-Slash [60 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/hack-and-slash">hack-and-slash</a>, maximizing the thrill of strategic decision-making and precise control.</p><p><strong>Sung Jinwoo Skill Tree</strong></p><p>Sung Jinwoo’s growth is entirely in your hands. Choose and develop various skill trees, even the same Jinwoo can have a completely different combat style depending on your decisions. Grow him your way, with your own strategy.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 1: The Monarch System</strong></p><p>It’s Time to Turn the Tide of Battle. We’ve implemented a Monarch Transformation system, a powerful feature that lets Sung Jinwoo awaken as the Monarch of Shadows. In this form, Jinwoo unleashes devastating skills that overwhelm enemies and dominate the battlefield. Based on your feedback, we’re actively enhancing the impact and speed of combat to deliver an even more intense and overwhelming battle experience. Get ready for a fight that feels truly powerful.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 2: Parry System</strong></p><p>Take command of the battlefield. The parry system lets you precisely block enemy attacks, offering the thrill of skillful control and heightening the tension of each encounter. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [102 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully parry an attack to trigger a QTE, allowing you to exploit enemy openings and land a devastating counterstrike.</p><p><strong>Depth of Combat, Part 3: <a title="Companies > Enhance [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d Hit Impact and Damage Feedback</strong></p><p>Feel every moment of battle as if you were truly there. From the impact of striking enemies to the intensity of taking hits, every sensation has been amplified to deliver unmatched immersion, making it feel like you’ve thrown yourself right into the fight. Every blow and every hit will set your heart <a title="Genres > Racing [272 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a>.</p><p><strong>Enjoy Battle Even More 1: Overdrive System</strong></p><p>The Overdrive System is being developed to maximize Sung Jinwoo’s skill tree and each Hunter’s unique traits, delivering overwhelming fun in combat.</p><p>With his skill tree—based Overdrive System, Sung Jinwoo dominates the battlefield. For example, when using the “Duel” skill tree, a special gauge will appear on the battle HUD. Once this gauge is filled to 100%, you can unleash a powerful skill specialized for that tree.</p><p>Hunters can showcase their individuality in combat through their own unique Overdrive Systems. For example, the Hunter Choi Jong-In can unleash meteors around him after applying Burn to enemies a certain number of times, shaking the battlefield with abilities that highlight his distinctive traits.</p><p><strong>Enjoy Battle Even More 2: Chain Smash System</strong></p><p>The Chain Smash System is a core mechanic that maximizes the synergy between skills. Triggered through additional input right after using a skill, Chain Smash grows stronger the more you chain it together.</p><p>By strategically deciding when to activate Chain Smash during your combos, you’ll experience an entirely new level of combat excitement.</p><p><strong>■ <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em>‘s Variety of Content</strong></p><p><strong>Cute Companion, Yaruru</strong></p><p>Adorable shadows have flown in from another world to assist Hunters. Yaruru diligently picks up items, gathers resources, and always supports you faithfully by your side. Though small, Yaruru is a reliable companion.</p><p>Meet your very own companion by fulfilling special acquisition conditions.</p><p><strong>A Vast World Map and an Immersive Main Story</strong></p><p><em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> invites you into a world map and main story that faithfully capture the heart of the original work. Beyond the single chapter you experienced in the Demo version, the official release will feature Chapters 1 through 10 of the story. Each chapter will bring you new challenges and moving experiences to look forward to.</p><p><strong>Four-Player <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [583 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">Multiplayer</a> with Friends</strong></p><p>Leveling up alone can be fun, but sometimes the true excitement comes from playing with friends. <em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> supports a multiplayer system for up to four players.</p><p>You can freely compose a party with any combination of Sung Jinwoo and Hunter parties. Whether it’s a full four-player Sung Jinwoo party, or a team of three Hunters and one Sung Jinwoo, you can strategize and enjoy <a title="Genres > Co-Op [321 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play. Conquer challenging dungeons together, defeat bosses, and experience the thrill of teamwork!</p><p><strong>■ Closing Remarks</strong></p><p>Dear Hunters, that’s all for today’s update.</p><p>Now it’s time for us to focus on developing the features we’ve introduced to you. As development progresses, if there are any new updates or things we’d like to share with you, we will greet you again through the Developer Notes.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>—<em>Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE</em> Team</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive-launches-november-17-for-pc-in-2026-for-ps5-and-xbox-series]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-more-layoffs-unionized-ign-workers-are-done-picking-up-the-slack.1282197/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a tough couple years for IGN. Despite parent company Ziff Davis recently <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lvrh33twb223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting strong financials</a>, management decided to engage in some bad old-fashioned ritual bloodletting across multiple properties–including IGN, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-ziff-davis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lost eight staff, or 12 percent of its union</a>. This follows buyouts last year that saw talented senior staff <a href="https://aftermath.site/ziff-davis-ign-gamesindustrybiz-humble-buyouts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head for the door</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ign-management-lays-off-three-union-members-in-massive-breach-of-trust-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another round of layoffs</a> before that. But the work those ex-employees were responsible for didn’t just go away; it got offloaded onto the increasingly beleaguered few who remain. Unionized IGN workers have had enough.</p><p>This week, the IGN Creators Guild resolved that, until February 13, 2026, workers will do their jobs – “no more, no less.” It’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-to-rule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a time-honored union tactic</a>, one that has produced results in other sectors.</p><p>“Many of us now work longer hours than we used to,” reads a graphic <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ignunion.bsky.social/post/3lxawsdbtws2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted to Bluesky by the IGN union</a>. “A lot of us rarely take lunch breaks. Some of us do not take adequate time off due to there being no one to pick up the slack. Others of us are stuck doing work we were never hired to do in the first place.”</p><p>Going forward, workers won’t do any of that. They’ll work their exact hours, and then they’ll clock out. The goal: to convince management to hire back some of those they decided to treat as disposable.</p><p>"Every time [layoffs] happen, [management] says we're going to do less,” Tyler Robertson, IGN social media coordinator and union secretary, told Aftermath. “That never actually happens. We always do the same amount of work, just with less people. If we stop that from happening this time and really say we are not picking up the slack that you have created, hopefully that convinces them that, yeah, we did actually need those people, and we do need those jobs."</p><p>IGN’s union has negotiated a six-month recall list, which stipulates that if IGN wants to fill any eliminated roles within the next six months, it must rehire those it laid off. In an ideal world, those who want to return to the forcibly opened arms of the Imagine Games Network will be able to do so, and in cases where they’ve moved on, roles will be backfilled. Either way, employees would get to work normal hours and do their actual jobs not just for the next six months, but indefinitely.</p><p>"We feel greatly understaffed and undervalued," said Robertson. "We don't get a ton of communication specifically from Ziff. It's more IGN Entertainment and down that we get our communication from. And even then, it's very surface level [where layoffs are concerned]. Just 'Sad day, take the time if you need it.' But then the next day it's back to work."</p><p>Robertson noted that his team, social, lost two key members, leaving them with just one video person.</p><p>"The social team,” he said, “even before the [union] action, was like 'Well, we're just not going to be able to physically put out as many videos, because we've had literally 50 percent of that work ability [cut].’"</p><p>IGN’s editorial team has been left in an even more precarious position as a result of management’s ill-advised hacking and slashing.</p><p>"On the editorial side, it's a lot of specific coverage–a lot of people who had contacts that are cut off from IGN now,” Robertson said. “They had these personal relationships with PR and production companies–because a lot of it was on the entertainment side–so we've just kind of lost these connections. ... So that work is either going out of unit to the director level, or down and spread through the team as we try to pick up what was left by [those who were laid off]."</p><p>Despite the suboptimal state of affairs, Robertson and others within the union are optimistic that they can get management to see the light. Previous union efforts resulted in “double” severance for the three employees laid off in 2024, which carried over to the most recent round of layoffs as well. Robertson believes that IGN’s audience, especially, lends weight to the union’s words.</p><p>"I think it's all about being transparent, because we know that IGN does have a fan base of people who care about the writers and the journalists and the video people in a way that's not always common, but is kind of common in the gaming space,” he said. “We try to leverage that and say, 'Hey guys, we know you care about us, and we care about you, and this will really help us out, if you just give it a retweet.' I think visibility has been our biggest ally in this whole thing."</p><p>It also helps that, going into its most involved action yet, the IGN union is more, well, unified than ever.</p><p>"A lot of our actions have not been as collective as this one is,” Robertson said. “This is the first time where we as a union have had to really come together, do a thing, and hold each other accountable. Someone could say, 'Oh yeah, I can pick that [work] up.' And we have to be self-observational, making sure that [we say], 'No, no, don't. We have to leave it.'”</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/ign-creators-guild-union-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Formed just last year</a>, the IGN union is still in the process of bargaining a contract. Previously, IGN workers were able to copy-paste basics from the contract already won by the Ziff Davis Creators Guild, IGN’s sister union, but now the negotiations rollercoaster is about to hit the series of jagged ups and downs that is “pay and stuff like that.” Even in that sense, though, Robertson believes this moment represents something of a blessing in disguise.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've kind of mobilized because of this action, because of the layoffs, and it sucks that that's what it takes, but that was the motivating thing that started this all,” said Robertson. “We feel energized right now, and I think that is going to help us. ... We feel energized, and we're about to get to the tougher stuff [in bargaining] at the same time. If we do need to escalate, if we do need to find some sort of additive action to what we're already doing, I think we'll be really ready and able to do that.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-suffering-chatgpt"><h3>AI Can’t Suffer, But It Should Suffer For This</h3></a><p>It's the sentience of AI's creators that really matters</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grimwild-backerkit-ttrpg-rpg-designer-missing"><h3>RPG Designer Goes Missing After Crowdfunding Award-Winning Game</h3></a><p>'Fulfilment of the project appears to be on hold indefinitely until Maxwell can be located'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/overwatch-2-interview-pvp"><h3>Overwatch 2 Developers Say They’re Leaning Into What Works</h3></a><p>'We are trying to take bigger swings, bigger risks, and bring more change to the game faster than we did in the past.'</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ign-layoffs-union-action-ziff-davis]]></content:encoded>

<p>Shared by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26">Mat Piscatella on Bluesky</a>, DK's latest adventure was the third best-selling game of the month, beaten only by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/ea_sports_college_football_26">EA Sports College Football 26</a> and <strong>EA Sports MVP Bundle</strong>. It's sandwiched between the two sports releases and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>What makes this more impressive is that, as always with US sales data, Nintendo's figures only include physical sales. Now, given that EA Sports College Football is <em>huge</em> in North America, it's unlikely DK could've surpassed it, but who knows!</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4wogvxy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We do know a <em>couple</em> of other things, though. For one, Donkey Kong Bananza is, unsurprisingly, the best-selling Switch 2 game of the month. Right behind it, however, is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, which got a boost thanks to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> upgrade.</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> round out the top five. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has slipped from first to sixth, but don't forget, most people probably bought the game via the Switch 2 bundle, and those sales aren't included here.</p>

<p>One last big break for DK — just on July's sales alone, the leader of the bunch has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/japanese-charts-mario-kart-world-gets-back-to-demolishing-the-competition">broken into the top 20 best-selling games of 2025</a>. That's quite a feat on just physical sales alone.</p>
<p>Whether Bananza will stay in the top 20 remains to be seen — we have a <em>busy</em> few months coming up, after all. Nintendo hasn't released overall sales figures for the game just yet, and the next financial results aren't due until November. But we do know it's selling pretty well in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/uk-charts-nintendos-first-party-switch-2-games-continue-to-dominate">the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/japanese-charts-mario-kart-world-gets-back-to-demolishing-the-competition">Japan</a>, so let's hope for good news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">announced</a> the three games that PS Plus Essential and all PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to add to their libraries for September 2025, with historic developer Double Fine's Psychonauts 2 headlining after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-august-2025-lies-of-p-dayz-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">Lies of P</a> was the headliner for August 2025. </p>



<p>Alongside Psychonauts 2, beginning on September 2, players will be able to add puzzle game Viewfinder to their libraries, and the classic, and perhaps most iconic, cozy farming game ever, Stardew Valley. If you've still not added the August 2025 games to your library, September 1, 2025 will be your last chance to do so.</p>

<p>Psychonauts 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2005 platforming brain-hopping adventure from Double Fine, and despite not being the most recent release of these three games, is arguably the most significant.</p>



<p>That's not to discredit Stardew Valley, only to say that Stardew has been around for so long, been on sale so often, and has been available in so many ways that its inclusion here feels more like a 'nice to have' than a must-grab for PlayStation fans. That said, if you've somehow never played Stardew Valley, then this is a chance you should not miss. It's one of the most successful indie games ever, and for good reason.</p>



<p>When Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/psychonauts-2-mindblowing/">reviewed Psychonauts 2 at launch back in 2021</a>, we called it "<em>absolutely mindblowing,</em>" and said that it "<em>delivers on everything it madly promises</em>." </p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a> developers Lovely Hellplace and their sinister backers at DreadXP have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/entropy">Entropy</a> - a turn-based party RPG inspired by classic Japanese RPGs, which retains Dread Delusion’s fungal pixel aesthetics. 
</p>
<p>
Like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>, it starts with a theatre show. You play a rank thespian initially equipped with a simple prop sword. But then horrible creatures crash the stage, and it’s time to armour up your troupe and quest forth to snuff out a demon incursion. What’s the best Shakespeare line to invoke here, hmm. Ah yes: “target their elemental weaknesses!” Hamlet said that before he shanked Polonius through the curtain. No, don’t google to check, dear reader – I am in haste. Quickly, watch the below trailer.

<p>

“In this dying age, only pockets of humanity remain,” expounds the press release. “There was no grand apocalyptic event to speak of; only the cruel march of time and the inexplicable infertility of the world led us here. Accursed creatures stalk the barren lands between settlements, which are themselves terrible places; squalid, medieval, and mostly ruled by tyrants.” Ah, you'd almost suspect that Lovely Hellspace founder James Wragg lives in England. 
</p><p>
Having escaped the backwater-sounding burg of Draenog, you're left to make sense of an “expansive” world map. I’m interested to know if Entropy will continue with the pocket-sized and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">Morrowind-flavoured</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/open-worlds-can-afford-to-be-small-as-long-as-they-feel-vast">open world-ish format</a> of Dread Delusion. You’ll gather a party of up to six characters, with the option of hiring mercs if any comrades get slain. There is levelling, needless to say, encompassing stat boosts and unlockable perks.
</p>
<p>
I’m not wildly convinced by the snippets of battle from the trailer, which seem a bit by-the-numbers, but it’s nice to be engulfed by another dreadful delusion. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3940340/Entropy/">coming to Steam</a> in 2026.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">just over a year</a> since Microsoft fractured its very good, very straightforward Game Pass subscription into a bunch of differently priced tiers that seemed designed to be as confusing as possible. The company is now throwing players who are subscribed to the cheapest Game Pass tiers a bone: increased access to PC and cloud gaming perks.</p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/27/xbox-insiders-can-stream-and-play-in-new-ways-with-xbox-game-pass-starting-today/">The company is experimenting with</a> giving Game Pass Core ($10 a month) and Game Pass Standard ($15 a month) members limited access to certain games via the cloud and PC. Xbox Insiders can begin testing this initiative today, with a version of it seemingly planned to roll out to everyone in the not too distant future. The new benefit essentially adds cloud gaming support to all games in the Core (around 50 games) and Standard (over 400 games) libraries. It’ll also let players use cloud gaming for games they own that support the feature, something that was previously a benefit exclusive to Game Pass Ultimate.</p> <p>Microsoft says it will also make PC versions of some Core and Standard games as well. So if you’re already playing a game on console like <em>Grounded</em>, you can switch to playing the PC version without needing to buy it. This is also neat, though a bit less impressive. Many of the Game Pass Core and Game Pass Standard game are already Play Anywhere titles, meaning buying them on console gets you the PC version and vice-versa, so there’s an argument to be made that the Game Pass versions should have worked the same way. Plus all of this is a raw deal when you consider Game Pass PC, which gives people who didn’t buy an Xbox Series X/S access to way more games, including day-one releases, at a much cheaper price than their console-playing peers.</p> <p>Still, the latest Insider pilot program is the first step toward beginning to fill in many of these gaps as Microsoft tries to re-unify the gaming experience across different platforms. The Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld arrives in October with an Xbox-like OS layer, and the company’s next generation of hardware is expected to more closely resemble the openness of PC gaming. Of course, the biggest test of that vision lies in whether or not the company will be finally willing to do away with its requirement that console players pay to access multiplayer, a big component of why Game Pass is so expensive to begin with and one that doesn’t exist on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>College Basketball video games are coming back, but fans shouldn’t expect to see something in the too near future.</p>



<p>While the series’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-announces-return-of-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return was already confirmed</a> earlier this summer—after <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1869824116339159465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first being reported</a> that talks were taking place back in December—EA Sports’ vice president of business development Sean O’Brien spoke to USA Today about where things sit, and the exact stage the game’s return is at.</p>



<p>O’Brien <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2025/08/26/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game/85645694007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet that EA</a> is <strong>“up for the challenge”</strong> of bringing college basketball back to video games for the first time since 2009.</p>



<p><strong>“[We’re] in the process of trying to figure out how that could come together,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>O’Brien then confirmed that EA’s plan is to have all Division I men’s and women’s college basketball programs in the game. It’s something he called a “daunting task”, but one that the company is up to after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the successful return</a> of College Football last year. O’Brien said that EA “captured lightning in a bottle” with College Football, and that they <strong>“would love to try to do the same for college basketball.”</strong></p>



<p>This isn’t the first time an EA executive has publicly commented on a return for College Basketball. Back in July, EA CEO Andrew Wilson spoke on the game during the company’s earnings report. </p>



<p>At the time, he said that he couldn’t “say too much yet” about the game, but that EA wants to <strong>“[capture] the action on the field or the court, representing the energy, pageantry, the traditions, and celebrating the unique sights and sounds and stories of every school and rivalry.</strong>“</p>



<p>EA Sports College Basketball isn’t expected to launch until the 2028-29 season per Extra Points’ Matt Brown and Insider Gaming’s own sources. </p>



<h2 id="h-it-s-not-just-ea-sports-after-college-basketball">It’s Not Just EA Sports After College Basketball</h2>



<p>While EA Sports is at the front of the college gaming world at the moment, competitor 2K sports has also been teasing its involving with College Basketball.</p>



<p>Just after EA’s announcement, 2K teased it’s own, saying “the campus has been quiet for too long”. Not long after that reports surfaced that 2K originally wanted <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">college modes and teams as paid DLC</a> for the NBA 2K franchise before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-2k-sports-plans-college-basketball-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sports Business Journal reported</a> that they then shifted to pitching a stand alone game. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out multiple times over the weeks for clarification on 2K’s stance regarding college basketball, and how it would work. Each time, the company has declined to provide an official statement.</p>

                <p>Last year, video game director and designer Hideaki Itsuno ended his three-decade run with Capcom after guiding numerous franchises, including Devil May Cry. Now, Itsuno has revealed that one of the reasons he left his former company is that he didn't want to get bogged down making the same titles he did before.</p><p>Itsuno told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-director-hideaki-itsuno-explains-why-he-left-capcom-and-whats-next/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that Lightspeed's offer to let him create a new AAA game was too good to pass up, and he felt that it was his "last chance" to challenge himself.</p><p>"For Capcom, creating Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma sequels is the top priority, and keeping in mind that making a game takes four or five years, this might be my last big opportunity ... Before you [realize it], you are working on making Devil May Cry 6 or 7. It's not like I don't want to make them, I do. But it's hard to balance the time it takes with the personal satisfaction of making them. And with Devil May Cry 5 and Dragon's Dogma 2, I already did what I wanted to make."</p><p>Itsuno didn't share many details about his new project for Lightspeed, however, several former Capcom devs from Devil May Cry and Street Fighter are slated to join the company's second studio in Osaka, Japan. Some of the notable additions include the artist known as Bengus, Devil May Cry writer Toshihiro Nakagawa, and character designer Daigo Ikeno.</p><p>"It's good to be able to work with people whom I trust, like Mr. Nakagawa," said Itsuno. "I have been working with him for decades, since Devil May Cry 2, and he's one of those core members who understands me very well. He worked as a freelance scenario writer, and he came when I called him. If we mix my taste and his taste, I believe we can make a great game together."</p><p>For now, it's unclear when or if a Devil May Cry sequel will arrive, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-anime-renewed-for-season-2-on-netflix/1100-6530769/" data-ref-id="1100-6530769">the Devil May Cry anime series on Netflix</a> will return for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-season-2-trailer-teases-the-fated-dante-and-vergil-showdown/1100-6534160/" data-ref-id="1100-6534160">Season 2 in 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/">MobileGamer.biz</a> reported on how <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass 9,000+ layoffs</a> across the company impacted King, the mobile division acquired alongside Activision Blizzard and the home of Candy Crush, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">developers being replaced by the AI tools they were forced to build.</a> Now, MobileGamer.biz has followed up with a <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use/">new report</a> that digs further into the chaos caused by the 200 developers being cut from King, with toxic leadership making decisions that don't align with the reasons given for them, and how Microsoft has been making daily AI use for King staff mandatory.</p>



<p>To say that things are not great within King seems to be an understatement. Layoffs are never good for morale, and layoffs that try to replace human workers with AI tools they were building seem to have the potential to hit new lows. </p>



<p>The mandated AI use from Microsoft certainly hasn't helped morale, but one source didn't lay the blame entirely at daily AI use and Microsoft's feet. The fault, as is usually the case, lies with poor leaders, in their eyes. "<em>Microsoft and AI is one cause [of the low morale] but the toxicity is endemic of the leadership team at King.</em>"</p>



<p>That's exasperated when leadership has been making decisions that employees cannot make heads or tails of, for the simple fact that they don't line up compared to the reasoning leadership is trying to pass off to employees.</p>



<p>"<em>It didn’t matter that it was people who worked there for ten or more years or who contributed to the success and earned promotions</em>. <em>Performance didn’t matter</em>," said one source. King has a rubric for its employee performance reviews, but according to a senior manager, nothing about the regular protocols for letting staff go seemed to factor in.</p>



<p>"<em>The logic for who has been chosen to be laid off has been hard to figure honestly…the rationale outlined was our heavy management layer and inefficient product development, but looking at the people let go, it doesn’t align</em>," they said. The reasoning behind the cuts seems even more skewed when other sources claimed several of those cut staff were rehired shortly after.</p>



<p>What's also troubling is the speculation the sources provide as to some of the actual reasons behind the cuts to help fit Microsoft's narrative of a "<em>heavy management layer</em>" and inefficiencies. One source speculates that certain staff were recently promoted to middle-management roles specifically so they could be cut in July. Another speculates that the cuts looked like executives "<em>listed every employee, sorted by salary and then fired them top down, only skipping over people they trust."</em></p>



<p>More on the allegations of a toxic environment and toxic management, one source claims that a key reason for those issues stems from the fact that employees can no longer deliver anonymous feedback. </p>



<p>"<em>Every question or piece of feedback was always connected to a name, which scared a lot of people, rightfully so. As a manager I was always trying to deliver that feedback to the leadership team anonymously, but I was pressed on names</em>," said one source.</p>



<p>Another source was more direct with their thoughts about the current state of the human resources department at King and how internal issues have been left to fester. "<em>HR is indeed a shitshow of incompetent people protecting the status quo of incompetent leaders</em>. <em>Often, they have protected toxic leaders that have been reported to several degrees of accountable people, HR and above.</em>"</p>



<p>Another source added, "<em>HR has often protected toxic leaders and put pressure on the ‘difficult’ employees for reporting the issue</em>. <em>Employees that were vocal and known for being vocal have been targeted by HR on several occasions.</em>"</p>



<p>On top of all this, mandated daily AI use hangs over every employee's head. "<em>AI was being introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago</em>," said a source. "<em>The goal for last year, if I recall correctly, was having a 70 or 80% daily usage of AI on general tasks. And the goal for this year was to get up to 100%, so that every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it on a daily basis.</em>"</p>



<p>Another source said they believe there are more cuts to come beyond the 200 from last month. </p>



<p>What's happening at King, and what's happening across Microsoft and the rest of the videogame industry with what has felt like a constant onslaught of mass layoffs for the last few years, will have drastic repercussions on the industry that will be felt for years to come. To say it's unfortunate is an understatement, and to say that it's tragic only beings to address the scope of the issue.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skate-is-return-to-form-but-will-audience-be-there-to-support-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-is-a-return-to-form-but-will-the-audience-be-there-to-support-it.1282128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest entry in the <em>Skate </em>franchise is releasing in Early Access on September 16. Fans have been fighting to have a new <em>Skate </em>title recognized for the better part of a decade, but with a deeper lean into community, live service activities, and seasonal content, is <em>Skate </em>asking too much of its fans?</p>

<p>For the past week, I've had access to a pre-alpha edition of the game and with it the chance to skate around San Vansterdam (San Van), explore the various neighborhoods, and compete in a variety of challenges.</p>

<h2>Drop Into <em>Skate.</em></h2>

<p>Before you get a chance to hop into free roam, there's a lengthy tutorial that takes you carefully through just about everything you'll need to know to get your feet on the ground (board). Led by Vee, your sassy AI companion, you'll get to ollie, grind, perform grab and flip tricks, and get introduced to the city and its various activities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-backflip.jpg?itok=yiniN6oQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-backflip.jpg?itok=M8CZ1RYY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While the tutorial did feel like it dragged a bit for a new player, it's going to be more than worth it to set them up for success as they drop into a world inhabited by other skaters.</p>

<p>Past the Tutorial, there is a story to <em>Skate </em>in the lightest sense. Your challenge completions earn you acclaim, ranking up your standing in the different regions of the world. You'll meet City Councilmembers — who are also skaters — who give you access to more challenges and locations. All of the communication is done over the phone, so expect to hear a lot of voices and not much in terms of world interactivity.</p>

<h2>Skating In San Van</h2>

<p>The core of the game, skating, is just as good as you'd hope it to be for a franchise that hasn't seen the light of day in 15 years.</p>

<p>After learning the basics, you'll be unleashed upon the open world. A nice mix of realistic environments and skatable locations makes San Van feel like a mostly functional city, but one that is filled with fun lines to put your skills to the test.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-tutorial.jpg?itok=RATm_uOw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-tutorial.jpg?itok=X8yd34gV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you'd expect for <em>Skate</em>, you steer with your left thumbstick, and how you move your right stick will decide what your feet, and ultimately your board, are up to. Holding down on the right stick will position your skater to jump, and flicking it directly up will cause you to pop an Ollie.</p>

<p>The <em>Skate </em>formula, balancing between sim and arcade, is a delicate line and while there's certainly an art and skill to performing the trick you're after, there's plenty of open space for a beginner to just wildly toggle and still pull off something entertaining.</p>

<p>To get the perfect line, you can use tools to set a mark and return to it quickly, allowing you to perfect your line without having to worry about setup time. When the game, and some of the challenges in it, require you to perform a pretty specific set of activities, the incredibly low time to reset is a godsend for letting you just have fun and not worry about not getting it the first, second… or twentieth time…</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-san-van.jpg?itok=62DVleNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-san-van.jpg?itok=VfwGXX1n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you're someone who loves <em>Skate 3</em> for its skateboarding mechanics, this sequel really is "all that and more" in terms of allowing you to create your favorite lines, show off with friends, and even cut together footage. I expect once this releases, I'll start seeing clips of crazy moments or simple and perfectly executed kickflips all over my social feeds.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of settings to make the <em>Skate </em>sim experience a bit easier, or at least more familiar to those who might only have arcade skateboarding game experience. Things like holding forward to push, or easier pumping, let you keep your speed up more consistently, so you can nail those tricks a bit easier.</p>

<p>There's a good level of tweaking in the setting that lets you take baby steps, or leap, when you want to push the game further into the sim style of play.</p>

<h2>Off-Board Exploration</h2>

<p>An interesting addition to <em>Skate </em>is the freedom to explore the world off your board. While you can get off the board and perform simple actions like running and jumping, there's a climbing system in <em>Skate </em>that will allow you to reach new heights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-climbing.jpg?itok=P-mHVCac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-climbing.jpg?itok=63_n-R8w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Look for ways to climb up buildings, and you might find a new place to drop in from, or just a place to test out your diving abilities.</p>

<p>This also means in a quite vertically stacked city like San Van, with building plazas at different heights, you can climb a wall from the street level to find a new skating spot, complete with a variety of grindable art installations.</p>

<h2>Customize Your Skater</h2>

<p>As you complete challenges, you'll begin to earn reputation (Rip Score) for the neighborhood you completed the challenge in, as well as currency that can be spent at any shop. Each shop has a variety of 'boxes' for you to purchase that could contain different outfit pieces or customizable options for your board, like deck patterns, decals, and more.</p>

<p>These boxes are interesting because while what you get from them is random, there's a small pool that you pull from, and after pulling an item, that is then removed from the pool. This means if at first a box has 12 potential items, after pulling 5 items, if you still don't have the piece you're after, there are only 7 potential items left to pick.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-customization.jpg?itok=Cpz2JM7i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-customization.jpg?itok=ARqArxJq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While it would be nice to just be able to purchase the piece you're specifically after, it feels like a balance was struck here to allow players to have a better chance to pull what they wanted, but also still prompt the players to complete more challenges to earn enough to get what they want. There have been countless games I've played where currency just ceases to be important after I pick up the four or five outfit pieces I want.</p>

<h2>Live Service All Around You</h2>

<p>Something that is extremely clear from playing <em>Skate </em>for even an hour is just how heavily it leans into the live service experience.</p>

<p>Each neighborhood in the world is filled with a few static challenges, but is primarily populated with rotating challenges. Complete all of the challenges, and in a few hours, they'll all be swapped out with new ones to experience. Each neighborhood offers higher rewards and more difficulty, but the cycle is very transparent.</p>

<p>On top of that, each challenge offers just a little bit more reputation and loot if you're playing in a party, promoting getting together and skating with friends.</p>

<p>Something that I was a little bit surprised to see was that there are also daily and weekly challenges for you to complete. Do you want to earn a bit more cash? Make sure you log in and perform 5 Laser Flips today.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-challenges.jpg?itok=L6vGcQNn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-challenges.jpg?itok=HkYP8cNK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These rotating challenges and daily/weekly checklists promise to the player that no matter when they log in, there will be something for them to do. Unfortunately, quantity doesn't always equate to quality. Knowing that each challenge is so replaceable and that there's no 'completion' to be had allows you to progress in the sense of seeing your reputation get higher, but there isn't really a sense of progression in the world.</p>

<h2><em>Skate </em>is back</h2>

<p>From my time playing, the skating was smooth, the music was great to jam to, and the casual atmosphere of pulling off a simple and clean line was intact. For fans of <em>Skate 3</em>, you'll be able to hop in and enjoy a variety of familiar and enhanced features.</p>

<p>If you're just here for a chill skate or to play with friends, then you'll have a great time.</p>

<p>If you're looking for real progression or a story that really shows you rising in the ranks, then the heavy lean into live service robs a lot of that from the experience in exchange for a never-ending wave of challenges.</p>

<p>As we get closer to the free-to-play launch, there's a lot riding on the audience to participate and stick around to make the world feel full and entertaining; otherwise, you'll just be skating around an empty city on a hamster wheel.</p>

            <p>
Amid the madness of Gamescom, we somehow skipped the most important game of the year. Cheese Rolling is a multiplayer ragdoll game inspired by the ancient Gloucestershire, England pastime of racing a hunk of dairy down a hill. 
</p>
<p>
The hill in question is Cooper's Hill at Brockworth, and the ceremony apparently dates back to at least 1826 - providing you trust the account of that year's Gloucester town crier - which makes the sport of cheese rolling at least 47 years older than Rock Paper Shotgun. The cheese in question is usually Double Gloucester - scandalously, they resorted to a foam replica in 2013 - and is given a strict one-second headstart.

I hadn't heard of Cheese Racing before, but I do have relatives down Gloucestershire way, and now I fear for them. I'm not just saying that because I'm vegan, though yes, I'm tempted to go sabotage the festivities by stealing into what I assume is a closely-guarded tent at night, and replacing the wheel with a large ball of tempeh. But mostly I am concerned for their physical safety and moral wellbeing.</p><p>Apparently, four kilograms of cheese can do a royal fuckload of damage when it achieves maximum velocity. 16 people were injured during the 1993 event, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_Hill_Cheese-Rolling_and_Wake">Wikipedia</a>, "four of them seriously". What. Also, Wikipedia claims that <em>nobody has ever caught the cheese</em>, at least in recorded history. The winner is whoever crosses the finishing line second. So this is just a regular old race, in practice, with a wholly unnecessary and patently unsafe fermented milk modifier.</p>
<p>The official title for the event is "Cheese-Rolling and Wake", and while local historians insist they don't mean "wake" as in "funeral", you do have to wonder if this is the distorted folk memory of a terrible accident at a hilltop dairy. Kind of like how "London's burning, London's burning" is now a charming nursery rhyme.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to contact the organisers and suggest they play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809440/Cheese_Rolling/">the Steam version of Cheese Racing</a> instead. Created by mercurial developer The Interviewed - their very name a brainlocking allusion to a history of media relations that does not, seemingly, exist - it's more dangerous than traditional Gloucestershire cheese-rolling in that it features an active volcano, but less dangerous in that it is not real. No bones will be broken hounding this cheese, unless you try to play it while driving a bus. Also, it supports eight player sessions and proximity voice chat. There's some paid DLC in the shape of a suit of armour costing £1.48 - as far as I can deduce, this isn't some kind of scam, but tread cautiously, ye who fell foul of the evil <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">Banana</a>.
</p>
<p>
The real selling point, though, is that you can actually catch the renegade curd in this one. My friends in Gloucestershire: thanks to the miracle of modern technology, you need no longer harm and humiliate yourselves in your hunger for dairy. Here is a computer. Behold, there is cheese in the computer! Now all you have to do is roll the cheese down the hill - no wait, not the ACTUAL COMPUTER

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> custom campaign mod has emerged onto the Nexus like Gale's mitt through that portal, and it's one you'll likely want to check out if you fancy getting nostalgic for one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s classic siblings. Return to Candlekeep, as you might have gleaned from the title, aims to recreate the prologue of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, by taking you to a certain library fortress.</p>
<p>It's not surprising someone's given this a go. After all, daunting tasks as such things might be, a good number of the BG3 custom campaigns being put together with the Moonglasses toolkit have opted to try their hand at taking players to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">revamped versions of locations from the previous two games</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter catchily-named modder 786r786, who released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18315">Return to Candlekeep</a> this weekend just gone. Re-creating the opening area from the first game, it'll let you wander around everywhere from Candlekeep library, to the inn, and the pool/altar combo that makes up the Temple of Oghma.</p>
<p>You get a good look around these, plus a gander at the custom main menu, character creation screen and camp the modder's included, in the over 20 minute-long tour video below. They don't do much talking to NPCs in that, likely on account of the mod not having any voice acting at the moment, but write in the description that they've pulled across all of the quests and dialogue lines you'd expect from such a recreation. There should be enough to keep you occupied for "about an hour thirty at most", which is why 786r786 has dubbed this a mini-campaign.</p>

<p>There are some teething issues it's worth being aware of, not that such a thing's that surprising given the testing ground advanced BG3 campaign mods still are at this point. Parts of buildings can appear unloaded, leaving roofs awkwardly floating with no supports, while NPC helmets can "disconnect from their head at a distance". On the plus side, cases of long-term helmet hair affliction are likely lower among the residents of Candlekeep than those of the base game.</p>
<p>786r786 says there's nothing they can do about these issues at the moment, and as for whether they'll flesh out the mod more going forwards, they've a one word answer: "potentially".</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they keep at it, this is a cool thing for them to have done, given Larian themselves considered working a return to Candlekeep into Baldur's Gate 3 while they were weaving their development magic. The devs even got as far as coming up with ideas for a zany seer chilling in the basement, as our Edwin, former RPSer/BG3 lead writer Adam Smith, and keen journo/Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-baldurs-gate-3-might-have-brought-back-candlekeep-the-library-fortress-where-baldurs-gate-began">chatted about last year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, it was revealed that upcoming open-world RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em></a> would launch in October with two of its important, playable vampire clans locked behind $22 day-one DLC. This didn’t go over well with folks online. Now, the devs behind the sequel are planning to make some changes.</p> <p>On August 19, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> developers The Chinese Room and publisher Paradox announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> that the long-awaited RPG sequel was finally launching on PC and consoles on October 21. This followed a lengthy and rocky development cycle, so for many fans, it was just nice to know<em> Bloodlines 2</em> was actually going to come out. However, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-day-1-dlc-clans-2000618832">people soon discovered that two of the RPG’s six playable vampire clans would be locked behind a paywall</a>, which led to a backlash from fans. Now, likely in an attempt to calm everyone down before a scheduled upcoming stream, the studio is promising changes.</p> <p>On August 27, the official <em>World of Darkness T</em>witter account posted a link to a <em>Bloodlines 2</em> livestream happening today and <a href="https://x.com/worldofdarkness/status/1960639863432085868">shared this message</a> about the DLC controversy as a reply:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We are listening to you about <em>Bloodlines 2</em> &amp; the Lasombra &amp; Toreador clan access, &amp; we’re making adjustments to reflect this. We will share more information about this as soon as possible. Until then, join us TODAY on Twitch at 5PM CEST, where we’ll be showing off the game!</p></blockquote> <p>This is similar to a message that was posted by a community manager in the official Discord server for Va<em>mpire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-developer-is-adjusting-its-plans-for-paid-clan-dlc/1100-6534304/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em> and ResetEra users</a>.</p> <p>Fans were so upset about the clans being locked behind day-one DLC because in<em> Bloodlines 2</em>, vampire clans are a very big part of the RPG. They help determine your playstyle, affect the game’s story, and offer unique powers and abilities. And sure, you can <em>technically</em> get any clan’s powers by leveling up and spending enough resources, but it’s much harder to get abilities that aren’t offered by your selected clan. So locking two of them behind a paywall that requires you to buy an extra DLC or the most expensive version of<em> Bloodlines 2</em> was a frustrating choice.</p> <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">Last week, the devs told <em>RPS</em></a> that the reason for locking some content behind DLC was that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> had expanded beyond what was planned, and extra work had gone into making more and more content for the RPG. I also imagine Paradox wanted extra dollars after years and years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">rocky development and delays</a>. While I get that making games ain’t cheap, locking clans behind a paywall was never going to go over well.</p>

<p>EA Sports has announced the first title update for Madden 26, bringing along with it a number of fixes and changes to various of the game.</p>



<p>The biggest updates come in the form of fixes to a zone defense, including Cover 2 and Cover 3 concerns where players were falling back too deep, leaving areas of the field open. Also added to the game are three new international stadiums in Germany, Spain, and Ireland. </p>



<p>You can check out the full list of changes coming in the August Madden 26 Title Update below courtesy of <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025?utm_campaign=mad26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_m26-title-update-x&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=85681&amp;ts=1756310856340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Sports</a>.

<h2 id="h-august-madden-26-title-update-details">August Madden 26 Title Update Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cover 2 Tampa – The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3×1 formations.</li>



<li>Cover 2 Hard Flats – Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</li>



<li>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</li>



<li>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms – Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns. We adjusted the CBs alignment so they will no longer attempt to press the WR.</li>



<li>Zone coverage defenders now drop back quicker when shading coverage ‘overtop’.</li>



<li>Fixed a post play animation defect where a defender would do “read steps” when standing in place after the whistle.</li>



<li>Addressed a visual issue around the previous play graphic obscuring the offensive play call formation.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-playbook">Playbook</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a completely customized playbook in partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KurtBenkert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurt Benkert</a>&nbsp;called <strong>“Benkert’s Dimes”</strong> – you can find it in Play Now when selecting your playbook. </li>
</ul>



<h3>Presentation</h3>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Resolved an issue allowing commissioners to send multiple league invites simultaneously.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue that prevented Edge Players from adding Pass Rushing Traits</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Class Import Process incorrectly modifying Player Body Types, specifically Offensive Linemen.</em></li>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available to Xbox Insiders with Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard. The mode, which lets players stream and play their Xbox Game Pass games anywhere, has opened its doors for all Xbox Insiders. In addition, select PC titles can now be played.</p>



<p>Previously, only those subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate could make use of Xbox Cloud Gaming. While the movement is only for Xbox Insiders, it does look promising that it may go into effect in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-cloud-gaming-and-select-pc-games-now-available-for-xbox-insiders-with-game-pass">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Select PC Games Now Available for Xbox Insiders with Game Pass</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/27/xbox-insiders-can-stream-and-play-in-new-ways-with-xbox-game-pass-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post on Xbox Wire</a>, the Xbox Insider Team posted about the new addition to Xbox Cloud Streaming. The service allows players to access Xbox Game Pass wherever they want, like from their PC, browser, or even TV. In addition, you can stream games, letting you not have to download the game and get right into playing. All you have to do is sign in to Xbox.com or to Xbox Cloud Gaming on whatever device you use and play away.</p>



<p>Alongside the Xbox Cloud Streaming, select PC titles will now be available for Xbox Insiders to play, regardless of their Xbox Game Pass tier. In order to make sure you can play, you’ll have to download the Xbox PC app and sign into Xbox. From there, you’ll have a few titles to choose from. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that this is only for Xbox Insiders and has not been released to the public yet. To become an Xbox Insider, you’ll need to download the app on Xbox and/or PC and sign up. You’ll then get access to surveys, previews, and such and help test out new features and updates, like Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Xbox Cloud Gaming come to all of Xbox Game Pass? Have you tried it before? How do you like it? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">It's been 15 years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-55235">Skate 3</a>, and a lot has happened in the skateboarding game genre since. The Tony Hawk series entered an experimental phase with mixed results, including a physical board controller and the ill-fated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5/" data-ref-id="5000-425445">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5</a>, until jumping into the modern remake trend throughout the past five years. Meanwhile, multiple independent studios took a stab at the genre while catering to different audiences--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/session-skate-sim/" data-ref-id="5000-483355">Session: Skate Sim</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skater-xl/" data-ref-id="5000-490201">Skater XL</a> experimented with independent foot control schemes with an emphasis on physics to emulate realism, for example, while the OlliOlli series took a more arcade approach via a 2D perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">But amidst all of this, the absence of the EA series was felt. A decade after Skate 3, developer Full Circle, a team that includes series veterans such as Deran Chung and Chris "Cuz" Parry, announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/">Skate</a>. Not Skate 4, but Skate--a free-to-play, live-service take on the game that's launching in early access on September 16. After a virtual press briefing, I got access to a preview build that served as an introduction to not just what will be available at the start of early access, but the new vision for the series. It's a vision that's placing a big bet on fostering a community made of newcomers and veterans, while also intersecting with the industry trends that have overtaken online games in Skate's 15-year absence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556079-skate2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556079" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556079-skate2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556079"></a><figcaption>Some tricks in Skate defy logic, but they look incredible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556079-skate2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Skate takes place in San Vansterdam, a fictional and sprawling city composed of four districts. Your story begins at an odd time to be shredding in those streets--once a haven for fellow skaters, the nicknamed locale San Van has been taken over by the corporate conglomerate M-Corp, and the people are trying to reclaim the city for themselves. In a similar fashion to past entries, the story doesn't have a big presence and is mostly there to introduce the world and give your skater a narrative framework for why you're taking on the so-called tours, which are a series of challenges and short missions meant to teach you tricks and new mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The city's introduction and the characters you meet set the tone of Skate, which, at this point in time, sorely lacks a strong identity. The fellow skaters you speak to are the embodiment of Steve Buscemi's "How do you do, fellow kids?," without the purposeful irony or comedy that was hinted at in some promo videos, such as 2024's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU676XF0jsc">trailer</a> featuring comedian Tim Robinson of I Think You Should Leave fame, which doesn't seem to be present in game. Outside of missions, there's a bot named Veep that often shares history snippets about the city, suggests activities, and comments on your actions, but without a strong personality encouraging you to pay much attention. The presence of technology serves as a comment on M-Corp's influence over the city, which is presented as a gentrified and homogenized setting, clashing against your own expression as a skater native to the region.</p><p dir="ltr">At the moment, there's little sense of resistance or a strong storyline that dives into these dueling forces. It's a far cry from, say, Watch Dogs 2, despite Skate wanting to riff on a similar storyline and tone with the colorful aesthetic for its menus and pushing for the player to express themselves via character customization (the latter falling short on account of the range of options only featuring a fairly simple set of body and hair options).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556080-skate4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556080" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556080-skate4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556080"></a><figcaption>The game will support up to 150 players in each hub.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556080-skate4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But again, the story is far from the focus of Skate and is mostly there to give you a mission structure and a path to follow to unlock challenges across the districts. The core of the experience is in the skating itself, and for the most part, it feels good. The Flick-It system is back, in which you "draw" gestures on the right analog stick to perform tricks. There are new additions to it, including more late tricks--such as laserflips--and different ways to approach certain maneuvers. For example, you can do a flip and hold the trick, which will repeat it indefinitely while you're in the air, while also controlling the speed of some tricks to perform them slower or faster. The trick repertoire is decent enough, including the usual suspects such as Christ Air, but during the briefing, Full Circle said that it plans to bring back more tricks present in previous Skate entries through updates in the future, as well as introduce new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">The most noticeable difference in feel and flow in Skate comes from its ragdoll effects. This has always been a factor in the series, but past entries also had a distinct weight to your actions, scratching that realism itch by forcing you to calculate speed, height, and distance for every trick you make. This is largely replicated in Skate, but locomotion is a bit floaty, which is frustrating when tackling difficult tricks. During Line challenges, where you must collect bearings along a set path without getting off your board, I'd often skate very slowly after pulling off the tricks I needed in order to finish the line without colliding into a bench or a curb, which could often cause a bigger impact than it normally would and cause my skater to fall.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Flick-It system remains present and there's a vast opportunity for mastering its more technical aspects, Skate's introduction of parkour and air tricks adds a more arcade-style element that is often in conflict with its more traditional foundations. Tricks like Spread Eagle aren't new to the series, nor is gaining enough speed before a ramp or structure incline to perform airborne stunts. But there's a bigger emphasis on challenges that don't involve much skating, and instead task you to, say, jump off the top of a skyscraper and hit different environmental objects or land inside an empty bin. The parkour is serviceable enough, and adds a sense of verticality, as there are climbable spots on pretty much any tall structure. But these components make for a different Skate experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556081-skate3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556081" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556081-skate3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556081"></a><figcaption>The narrative framing for Skate isn't all that strong.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556081-skate3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the very least, there's a push for challenge variety, which is definitely needed for the game's progression, since missions are locked behind challenges. At least in the preview build, one of Act 3's missions required 375 challenge points to access it. For the most part, challenges can reward up to three to five challenge points each, depending on the difficulty tier. Most missions require you to tackle challenges, so you'll be obtaining them in tandem as you progress through the story. Until you inevitably hit a wall, that is, and you'll have to backtrack to clean up challenges across districts. There's just enough variety for them not to get too stale, mostly due to the fact that there are quite a few challenges related to parkour and air maneuvers rather than skating (some mix the two). Yet, they can feel repetitive when done in quick succession.</p><p dir="ltr">It's important to note that almost all of my time playing Skate was on my own. The live-service approach means that San Vans is supposed to act as a shared space for other people via multiplayer. It was hard to get a feel for how this premise will come together, as lobbies have a 150-player capacity. The size of San Vansterdam is spacious enough as is, and it seems designed in a way that it could strike a good middle ground once there are over 100 players together, giving you the chance to bump into other people often.</p><p dir="ltr">In the preview build, I encountered fewer than 10 players scattered throughout multiple sessions. At least one series of quests revolved around social activities, which, while not that common, could hint at some progression blockers depending on server activity. It's a shame, since the brief experiences I had with other players were more snappy, with the two of us contributing to the goals together. I can see how the challenge grind becomes more amicable with company, but there are also drawbacks. If either of you fails a line while the other person aces it on a first try, they have to wait for the other person to run the course again until they manage to complete it. This largely depends on the challenge type, and normally, you don't need to tackle every single objective to complete it, and can just exit it whenever and cash in the points you've gotten up to that point instead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556082-skate5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556082" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556082-skate5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556082"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to parkour all over the city.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556082-skate5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are players who will be content with skating around with other people. If you're interested in the fashion and expression aspect of Skate, which has always been part of the series and skating culture in general, challenges are one of the two ways of getting fresh clothes and accessories. The other is, well, by paying with real-life cash. Completing missions and challenges within a district rewards you with experience, as well as the occasional clothing item. When hitting certain level milestones, you get access to in-game rewards like fast-travel points, but also new tiers of Product Boxes, which are essentially loot boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">Product Boxes aren't up for sale--paid clothing options will be available to purchase either as single items on a time-limited rotation, or as bundles--but still function on a chance-based system. For example, I wanted to get a skeleton onesie that is split into multiple parts, and that required me to not only get fairly high levels across multiple districts to gain access to each one of them, but once I got there, I'd then have to spend points on Product Boxes until I finally got each part, rather than being able to select them from an NPC vendor. It doesn't help that most missions rewarded me with frankly boring clothing options. Getting a "rare white tight tee" didn't feel like much of an achievement.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of style and expression, the soundtrack is also in an odd spot. Full Circle said that the track list will evolve over time, with the team introducing new songs in upcoming seasons. At the moment, there's a decent selection of licensed tracks from artists like Turnstile, MF Doom, and Sunny Day Real Estate, to name a few. But the vast majority of the soundtrack is made up of royalty-free songs. This dissonance is even more pronounced with the Grabbster feature, which allows you to get close to a speaker and "grab" a song to add it to your playlist, since there's always a chance of you getting an unlicensed track instead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4556078-skate1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4556078-skate1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556078"></a><figcaption>Skate will launch in early access.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4556078-skate1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Full Circle expects Skate to be in early access for about a year, although its roadmap isn't set in stone. The first season is coming a couple of weeks after the early access launch, which will also introduce a season pass. As it stands, Skate feels more in line with games like Fortnite, presenting an aesthetic and sense of style that is meant to be shaped by seasonal content rather than introducing a strong sense of identity from the get-go. Full Circle was vague about concrete plans, but the team isn't ruling out collaborations with more brands and other IPs.</p><p dir="ltr">In just a few weeks, Skate will begin navigating a myriad of expectations, and it's unclear which ones the development team will pay closer attention to during the early access period. From my time with it, Full Circle's intentions seem to want to open the doors to newcomers as well as welcome back the people who've been waiting for a new Skate game for the past 15 years. As it stands, this foundation looks and feels different--it's a rather brand-safe take on skating, and some of the new mechanics can feel disruptive. Whether it'll succeed in striking the balance and stay on course remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Skate will be available free-to-play on September 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a mobile version for Android and iOS to follow at a later date.</p>

<p>It's a mouthful</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Kirby's big 3D adventure is getting the ol' Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment tomorrow as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a> arrives on the newer console.</p>
<p>Our verdict is already in — and we think this is now, definitively, Kirby's very best outing — but besides the expanded content and new levels, this upgrade also delivers a 60fps performance boost to the base game.</p>
<p>So, how does it compare to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">the Switch 1 release</a>? The indomitable Felix Sanchez has done the maths and put the Switch 1 version up against the Switch 2. From just watching, things should become crystal clear.</p>
<p>Load times, performances, and draw distance are all greatly improved here, with better grass and water textures throughout. We've got a variety of footage for you, from cutscenes to gliding levels, so why not check out the video up-top.</p>
<p>Don't forget, if you want to get the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll either need to buy the upgrade pack for $20 or, if you don't own the game at all on Switch 1, you can buy the full version physically when it launches tomorrow, 28th August 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the original&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>&nbsp;being one of my best friend's favorite games and as&nbsp;an RPG lover myself, I jumped at the chance to get my hands on the sequel through the preview. It was exactly what I thought I would experience, with whacky dialogue options, time-distorting technology, and brain damage. Here's what we learned in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The</em><em>&nbsp;Outer Worlds 2</em></a>&nbsp;preview.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Taste of the World |&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Preview</h2>

<p>The preview lasted about an hour and covered character creation and the first mission line. Overall, the story takes you to a colony not patrolled by the Earth&nbsp;Directorate, but under authoritarian control. There's still the silly humor present in the title, but taking out dictatorships remains the goal. You're able to play your way, NPCs recall previous dialogue choices, and actions you take directly impact how the mission plays out. I find this type of gameplay absolutely exhilarating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It also has a few inclusivity areas, mainly the ability to create characters with prosthetic limbs. This was great, the limbs are gorgeous, and I loved seeing disabled bodies represented in a popular title. Character Creation is the first important decision-making area of the game.</p>

<p>The focus here is on your skills and traits, which dictate how you interact with your crew and the colony of Arcadia. I played through the preview twice, picking different traits, choosing to get a negative trait, and selecting different skills to see how this impacts the game. My second time around was much smoother than the first with the inclusion of Lockpicking, a skill I find necessary to fully explore Arcadia.&nbsp;</p>

There are multiple choices you can make that determine whether you duke it out with enemies or go a stealthier route. The first time, I went with the combat-heavy choice, which resulted in me dying multiple times as I forgot to heal myself repeatedly. The second I became one with the shadows, a far better fit for my playstyle in this instance. Stealth kills are extremely satisfying, especially in a room full of enemies that previously gave me a hard time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, combat is straightforward, you have your main weapon, either ranged or melee, and support items like distraction devices or grenades. You can heal during combat, but it takes a moment and you can die while trying to get your health up. When it comes to stealth, there are multiple bars showing how exposed to enemies you are, really allowing you to take risks while avoiding detection. If you're creative enough, you can turn Arcadia's own defense turrets on the guards or have the mechs turn on their owners.&nbsp;</p>

Secret item stashes are littered throughout, making the Observant option highly prized if you want to find everything. Otherwise, exploring the colony comes with the regular items for healing, ammo, additional weapons, and support items. Since the preview is centered around a single well-designed location in Arcadia, it's hard to say when the different areas of the colony will feel like and how well their theme is executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without spoiling the ending of the first mission, it's safe to say it's a cliffhanger that exits with a bang, literally. There are multiple explosions during the brief time I experienced Arcadia, but they really left an impression. I absolutely need to know what happens after the preview content ended.&nbsp;</p>

The story is well thought out with background information feeding into the main quests seamlessly. Depending on your choices, dialogue with the NPCs changes, giving you a unique experience based on your actions, skills, and traits.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>preview really lived up to my expectations in all ways except the length of the available content.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Left Us Wanting More</h2>

<p>While I was able to play through character creation and the first mission line multiple times, I was left wanting more content. The preview was relatively short. Some gameplay items were left out, like having a Pet or working with a Companion. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I will 100% be playing when The Outer Worlds 2 releases at the end of October. I need to know what happens in Arcadia, why a massive explosion was required, and how I can save the world.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bossa Studios and publisher Humble Games have announced when you can expect the 1.0 release of skybound survival game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be arriving on September 17th, having launched in Early Access earlier this year. That feels to me like a surprisingly short amount of time for a game to stay in Early Access these days.</p>

<p>Bossa says that&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is essentially an attempt to create a spiritual successor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-surgeon-simulator-release-new-mmo-worlds-adrift-may-17" rel="nofollow">2017's&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>, which, as the studio notes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">"ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release"</a>. Still, Bossa says&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>"rebuild[s] upon the strong groundwork" left behind in the former's wake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=NI6XSdAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=LpssuubO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it's looking to "elevate the elements players loved from&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em>" in&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and there doesn't appear to be any kind of intentional pun in there, which feels like a missed opportunity to me.</p>

<p>In any case, if you played&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>and want to know what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, Bossa says that elements like "exploring hundreds of floating islands" and building unique skyships from rare materials and parts are very much part of the experience.</p>

<p>You can also expect to confront "some huge sky filling bosses", according to Bossa's Luke Williams. He says the studio has spent the last three years of development working closely alongside the community to ensure&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is everything it could be.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is like, then you can check out the official 1.0 release date trailer, courtesy of Humble Games, right here.</p>




<p><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on September 17th, but if you want to play it before then, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

<p>The PlayStation Plus free games for September 2025 have been announced, with the list including Stardew Valley and Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>A trio of titles are included in the September offerings, all of which are playable from September 2, which also means there’s limited time remaining to add August’s titles to your library.</p>



<h2 id="h-free-playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-revealed">Free PlayStation Plus Monthly Games For September Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Jump in. Image via ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, three titles are available to download for free throughout September, which we’ve detailed here.</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<p>The beloved indie title lands on PlayStation Plus for September, with an adventure full of farming, mining, fishing, and even romance in the offing.</p>



<p>Still one of the most popular games on platforms like Steam, Stardew Valley continues to go from strength to strength, while developers are working hard on the next title, The Haunted Chocolatier. </p>



<p>Plucked straight into work after inheriting your grandfather’s farm, you start with basic tools and a few coins. From there, the world is truly your oyster.</p>



<h3 id="h-psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</h3>



<p>For those looking for a new platform-adventure game to keep you occupied in the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong, look no further than Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>With a variety of missions, a cinematic style, and customizable psychic powers, Psychonauts 2 puts players in control of Raz “on a journey through the minds of friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.”</p>



<h3 id="h-viewfinder">Viewfinder</h3>



<p>Any player wanting to test themselves with challenging puzzles can do exactly that with Viewfinder, where you use an instant camera’s viewfinder to bring photos, paintings, and sketches to life.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available from September 2, meaning there’s just a few days left to download August’s titles; Lies of P, Day Z, and My Hero One’s Justice 2.</p>



<p>Which of these titles are you planning to pick up and play next month? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

A lot of its design decisions were quite divisive, and in his first media interview since leaving Capcom following the release of the sequel, game director Hideaki Itsuno explained that he made it that way very purposefully.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-reflects-on-dragons-dogma-2-i-didnt-make-a-nintendo-game-designed-to-be-liked-by-everyone/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, Itsuno explained that he ultimately wasn't that surprised that the game wasn't universally beloved, because he designed it to not be. "I made the game not like a Nintendo one to be liked by all the people, but for a certain type of audience, so it's normal if some people outside that target audience don't like the game," Itsuno said. "However, people who enjoyed the game really loved it, appreciated the details and work. I'm very proud of it."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Itsuno also touched on why he decided to leave Capcom--his exit came only six months after Dragon's Dogma 2 came out--explaining that it was quite simply down to wanting to make an original AAA game as opposed to sequels for Devil May Cry and Dragon's Dogma. The game developer is now at the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Japan Studio, where he's working on a new action game.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on that move, Itsuno also said that for him, based on his age, this is his "last chance." He continued, "The gaming industry has decreased the number of AAA releases, and I was asked to create a new AAA [by LightSpeed]. I'm not young anymore, so more than 'now it's the right moment,' it's more like, 'this is my last chance' to challenge myself."</p><p dir="ltr">He also shared that he almost left during the development of Dragon's Dogma 2, but ultimately decided to stay until after the game was completely finished before moving on to LightSpeed.</p><p dir="ltr">For an insight into whether that divisiveness makes the game worth playing, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragons-dogma-2-review-pawn-stars/1900-6418199/">Dragon's Dogma 2 review</a>.</p>
