            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>map in the form of Nell's Diner, and the long-awaited Grafton Farmhouse rework now has a release date too.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Nell's Diner will be arriving later this year. Described by the developer as a "run-down, retro restaurant", the new map will be roughly equivalent in size to&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s houses. You'll be able to explore "a classic diner counter, comfy booths, and a kitchen" as you hunt whatever specter happens to be haunting the place.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Nell's Diner yet, but when it arrives, creative director Daniel Knight says the new map will be "one of the most unique" he and his team have created for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework-interior.jpg?itok=L8E5ahb2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-nells-diner-grafton-farmhouse-rework-interior.jpg?itok=NBGJJxB8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nell's Diner may be small, but there's plenty of opportunity to get spooked here.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as revealing Nell's Diner, Kinetic Games has also announced when you can expect to play&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>'s reworked Grafton Farmhouse map, and it won't be too long before you can get your hands on the revamped stage.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 12th, the rework will apparently bring a "totally overhauled" Grafton Farmhouse in which you can expect to find "faulty electrics, caved-in ceilings and layers of dust" as well as an "eerie attic" and a "harrowing seamstress room". Sounds about right for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia</em>.</p>

<p>Along with Nell's Diner, Knight says the new version of Grafton Farmhouse is "central to [the studio's] efforts in amplifying the horror in <em>Phasmophobia</em>", so if you're looking to experience the best the ghost-hunting horror game has to offer, it sounds like these new maps will be right up your street.</p>

Back in April, Kinetic announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">sell three million copies on consoles alone</a>&nbsp;after launching on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S last October.</p>

<p>Not only that, but there's also a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the game</a> in the works at horror production studio Blumhouse, although details on that project are somewhat scarce at the moment.</p>

<p>We'll likely learn more in the coming months, but until then, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/phasmophobia/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/phasmophobia-game-preview/9N6D60SBZN05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Grafton Farmhouse rework launches on August 12th, and Nell's Diner arrives later this year.</p>

                <p>Following hot off the heels of last week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, the gaming giant has announced an Indie World Showcase that's set to take place on August 7, later this week. According to the <a href="https://x.com/IndieWorldNA/status/1952716474440724634" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement post</a>, there'll be "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates on indie games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." The showcase is set to premiere at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and you'll be able to check it out on any of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Nintendo YouTube channels</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This marks the first Indie World Showcase following the launch of the Switch 2 in June, but it's not exactly clear what might show up. Just don't go expecting Hollow Knight: Silksong--that game, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-again-missing-from-nintendo-direct/1100-6533604/">absent from last week's Partner Showcase</a>, could appear in a traditional Nintendo Direct rather than the more low-key Indie events, as it's widely anticipated. The first Switch 2 Direct even featured it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-releasing-this-year-according-to-nintendo-switch-2-direct/1100-6530562/">as part of a sizzle reel back in April</a>.</p>

            <p>
Silksong fans, prepare to ride the rollercoaster of delirious anticipation and potential crushing disappointment once more: Nintendo has announced another indie-focused showcase is happening this week, so could this finally be the day for that release date news?
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Nintendo's Indie World showcase - as these things are officially known - airs this Thursday, 7th August, at 2pm in the UK. If you're over in yonder US, it's a considerably earlier start, with things kicking off at 6am PT or 9am ET.
</p>
<p>
As to what we can expect this time around, Nintendo's being as coy as always. However, it <em>is</em> promising "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie titles for both Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. And if that appeals, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mTv0HmKoUqw">watch the whole thing on YouTube</a>.
</p>

<p>
A release date for Silksong - developer Team Cherry's massively anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> sequel - is, of course, the great hope this time around, especially given the excitement generated by its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">reappearance in Nintendo's Switch 2 showcase back in April</a>.
</p>
<p>
Anticipation for the title - and frustration over the continuing lack of a release date - has now reached such a fever pitch other developers are savvily starting to get in on the action. Earlier this month, indie developer Pere Albacar promised social media followers a free Steam code for his upcoming release Sands of Hope if Silksong made <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">last week's third-party focused Nintendo showcase</a>. In the end it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-silksong-social-media-joke-could-be-game-changing-for-this-indie-developer-despite-direct-no-show">didn't show up</a>, but there's always next time - which just happens to be this Thursday.
</p>
<p>If you're curious about what else is coming to Nintendo Switch consoles, you may also like to know that there'll be a separate Showcase in Japan, where the Indie presentation will be an extra five minutes long - these bonus minutes are usually home to some pretty cool stuff, so we will make sure to watch this, too, and bring you any extra information you need. </p><figure>

			<p>THQ Nordic <a href="https://x.com/TitanQuestGame/status/1952717544046915624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titan Quest II</a> has already sold more than 300K units in less than three days since its early access debut on PC, where the game is available via Steam or the Epic Games Store. So far, user reviews submitted on Steam are positive, with 84% of the nearly 6K reviews entered so far giving the game a thumbs up. </p>



<p>According to Grimlore Games, this version of Titan Quest II includes around 15 hours of content. The full version is expected to be available in around a year; however, once the game gets to version 1.0, the price will be raised to $49.99 / €49.99. Those who wish to join the early access can do so at a discounted price of $29.99 / €29.99, and from now through August 8, there is another 20% discount to bring the price down to $23.99 / €23.99.</p>



<p>Grimlore plans to add new masteries, new content, and new world segments, stories, and quests, as well as new features to enhance the game’s longevity, such as crafting. These new features and content will be released through early access as soon as they are ready. Smaller updates, such as bug fixes, balancing, and minor polish updates, are expected to go live monthly, though they can be skipped if nothing major is needed. Major updates, adding significant new features, mechanics, and/or content, will be released roughly every three months. The studio will also introduce translations to the game during the early access period, as currently, there's only English.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As usual with early access games, Titan Quest II will only launch on consoles like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X once that phase is over and version 1.0 is ready to deploy on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that a new Nintendo Direct Indie World show will be airing later this week, bringing new information about indie games heading to both of the Japanese gaming giant's currently-active platforms.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1952716473656385840" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the Indie World showcase will air on Thursday at 6am Pacific (that's 9am Eastern and around 2pm BST). It's set to bring "roughly 15 minutes of new announcements and updates" regarding indie games coming to Switch 2 and Switch.</p>

<p>The Indie World Direct follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">last week's Partner Showcase</a>, during which new projects from the likes of Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and Capcom were announced for Switch 2 and Switch (as well as other platforms).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VK437OZy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-stories-3-nintendo-direct-indie-world.jpg?itok=VRGuSIfM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3&nbsp;</em>was just one of many games announced during last week's Partner Showcase.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what kind of games can we expect to see at this week's Indie World show? Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest, as is customary for the company, so we don't know exactly what we're going to get.</p>

<p>Of course, I'd be remiss if I didn't bring up the elephant (or perhaps that should be the bug) in the room. Could this show finally, blessedly deliver us from our wait when it comes to a&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>release date?</p>

<p>There's still reason to hope, even if&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has been absent from many a show in recent months. The game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo" rel="nofollow">getting a demo at this year's Gamescom</a> (albeit at Xbox's booth), so a release date could well be just around the corner.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since Team Cherry does seem to have hitched its wagon to Xbox's procession, it's equally possible that we'll be left bereft once again. Still, hopefully, there will be plenty of other great indies to tide us over.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-indie-world-showcase.jpg?itok=5xb7lgoB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-indie-world-showcase.jpg?itok=9Zw-DU7A 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm getting tired of asking, Nintendo. Come on. Please.</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever the case may be, Nintendo's Indie World show will air this Thursday at 6am Pacific/9am Eastern/2pm BST. We'll bring you all the news and announcements from that show as they happen, so check back in with us then for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-knows-what-a-soulslike-is-%E2%80%94-silent-hill-f-sparks-heated-debate-within-the-fandom.1262349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> fans pore over the slew of previews that went live recently (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-we-played-it-for-5-hours"><u>you can read ours right here</u></a>), two questions are consistently popping up on social media and fan communities: is the latest mainline Silent Hill <em>really</em> a 'Soulslike' game? And if it is, what does the term 'Soulslike' even mean anyway?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we described in IGN's Silent Hill f hands-on preview, combat itself has a similar feel to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a>’s close-range combat. You can dodge enemy attacks with the DualSense’s circle button and activate a light and heavy attack with R1 and R2, respectively. Your limited reach and lengthy attack motions give a realistic, weighty feel to combat. Heavy attacks, especially, feel slow and need to be timed well, "contributing to the feeling that Hinako is just a teenager with limited strength."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, however, Silent Hill f’s combat also features timed dodges and counterattacks, with the latter particularly important in combat sequences. Enemies briefly show a sign when a counterattack can be utilized, but we suggested that "unless you have trained your reflex skills by playing games like of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice"><u>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</u></a>, you will likely have a hard time reacting." That’s where the Focus mode comes in, which can be triggered by holding L2. It allows counterattacks to last longer, while also charging up a power attack that staggers an enemy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While series producer Motoi Okamoto hasn't specifically mentioned the Soulslike genre, and by our estimation, Silent Hill f is "by no means a Soulslike," talk of parries and counterattacks come as quite the surprise to Silent Hill fans. The franchise has never been famous for its clunky combat — story and atmosphere have almost always come first — but Okatomo's suggestion that f's combat sequences had been ratcheted up because "<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-is-combat-heavy-because-challenging-action-games-are-gaining-popularity-among-younger-players-nowadays"><u>challenging action games are gaining popularity among younger players nowadays</u></a>" has pretty much split the fandom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The legacy of FromSoftware’s Souls series isn’t just defined by the amazing games in its back-catalog, but also the subgenre that’s been given life thanks to its very existence: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games">The Soulslike</a>. While defining one is kinda tricky, there are core elements that tend to apply to Souls games, such as punishing consequences for death, Souls — or a similar currency — gained by defeating enemies that is integral to character progression and can be lost upon death, methodical combat, typically tied to a stamina meter, and checkpoints that reset the world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, however, Soulslike can simply mean tough melee combat that involves learning to predict an enemy's attack pattern.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a thread entitled, "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/silent_hill_f_is_not_soulslike_and_no_one_here/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Silent Hill f is not 'souls-like' and no one here seems to know what that means</u></a>," a Redditor said: "Genuinely baffling. This is link [sic] second graders being told to name an object and call a toaster a blender. Like, I don't think you even know what a Soulslike is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Having a dodge roll and hard bosses applies to like 90% of third-person games that exist lol. Like you people cannot be serious. Souls games have heavy and light attack, tight-nit dodge intensive combat. You have frame-perfect dodges [...] huge emphasis on stamina management, with shields, break meters, and focus on killing enemies to get c[urrency].</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Silent hill f has like 1.5 of those. This blatant lie needs to stop. Anyone with eyes who isn't full of sh*t can see this is nothing like a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the broader confusion between what and what is not indicative of a "Soulslike" game that's frustrating players, though. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be fair, nobody knows what a Soulslike is," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6zgeh4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>admitted</u></a> a respondent. "This is clearly demonstrated on the Soulslike sub by daily arguments about whether or not a game is a Soulslike."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I've sunk hundreds of hours into FromSoftware's games and Soulslikes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nioh"><u>Nioh</u></a>," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n6z9t9x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a> someone else. "Nothing about Silent Hill f looks like a Soulslike other than there's a target lock-on system and a stamina meter. Which is in, you know: a million other games that are not goddamn Soulslikes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confusingly, others who have also played Souls-inspired games don't concur, however, leading to considerable disagreement to what does, and does not, make a Soulslike game. Is it the melee combat? The need to parry? Or does any game that requires players to learn an enemy's attack pattern count? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I’m still excited for the game, but the comparisons to Souls combat are really clear guys, like come on…" posited <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mhvpsr/comment/n70id3x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one</u></a>. "Invincible dodge, lock on system, light and heavy attacks, multiple attempt boss fights testing your combat prowess… Even the combat UI is clearly inspired by action games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"People complain about the combat becoming melee-focused like they don't remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/09/23/silent-hill-4-the-room"><u>Silent Hill 4</u></a>. Breakable weapons are essential without the firearms if we still want the game to stay a survival horror," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1mi55z5/am_i_the_only_one_that_doesnt_see_anything_wrong/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>explained</u></a> another fan. "This whole situation feels like Silent Hill 2 Remake all over again with almost the same talking points."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-combat-has-a-heavier-focus-on-melee-and-is-more-action-oriented-than-silent-hill-2-remakes-producer-says"><u>Okamoto said that tougher combat</u></a>, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Quite how players react to all that when Silent Hill f finally releases next month, of course, remains to be seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>. It's out for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series on September 25.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're wondering, no, Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>, so you can play it even if you've never jumped into a Silent Hill game before. Instead, it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, set in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> contains another card design that looks similar to unofficial artwork, just days after the game was forced to scrub the illustrations from several cards within its new expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-suddenly-pulls-card-design-embroiled-in-plagiarism-controversy-as-company-admits-production-issue-and-launches-wider-investigation">The Pokémon Company confessed it had used fan art as a close reference for Pokémon TCG Pocket's new Ho-Oh EX card</a>, found in the hit smartphone game's new Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion. The matter came to light after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-claims-pokmon-tcg-pocket-features-a-design-traced-from-fan-art-creators-point-out-that-pokmons-legal-terms-likely-allow-the-company-to-monetise-any-fan-made-content-it-wants">fans alleged that the Ho-Oh card's design had been traced from unofficial artwork</a> previously published online. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, fans have pointed to yet another card that may have been closely inspired by fan art: Buzzwole EX's Immersive Rare card, which sees the insectoid Ultra Beast flying through space with one arm raised aloft, in a Superman-esque pose. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While not an identical copy, the concept, framing and pose is very similar in appearance to a piece of fan art published online back in 2017, some fans have now said. But others aren't so sure, and pointed out that Buzzwole holding its arm up, flexing its swole muscles, is at least something the creature is often seen doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I was scrolling through my old camera roll when I thought I saw the immersive Buzzwole but then upon further inspection, it was fanart I saved of him from 2017," Ricky_chimmerton wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTGCP/comments/1metn1y/found_very_old_buzzwole_fanart_from_2017_that" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I know it ain’t an exact copy but this image was definitely referenced for the card we have."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar pose, but not the same. It could have been an inspiration, but it was clearly not traced," countered fellow fan Aestrasz. "The issue is not them taking inspiration from a fan art, and doing a similar pose. The problem was tracing the fan art."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar is an understatement but yeah at least in this case you can see it wasn’t just a complete copy," wrote Plane_pea5434.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, The Pokémon Company said it would now begin an audit of all Pokémon TCG Pocket cards to ensure it had not provided fan artwork as a reference for any other previous cards. By highlighting the similar design of Buzzwole now, fans hope that The Pokémon Company will take note sooner — and either replace the artwork or credit the original creator.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards," The Pokémon Company wrote in a statement. "As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, the game's immersive Ho-Oh EX card and its sister Lugia EX card (which also features the Ho-Oh design in its animation) simply feature no artwork, and instead include awkward-looking "New Art Coming Soon" placeholder text. It will be interesting to see if Buzzwole EX ends up getting similar treatment, or if The Pokémon Company decides its design can be considered different enough. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Subsequently, The Pokémon Company doubled down on its explanation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-pokmon-company-calls-on-fans-to-stop-attacking-or-slandering-illustrator-embroiled-in-tcg-pocket-plagiarism-scandal">its own processes had been fault, rather than the named illustrator on the card</a>, who had been simply following the reference material provided. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the company stated. "The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pokémon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop.1262325/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-hit-co-op-climber-peak-sells-another-million-as-studio-outlines-future-update-plans">indie hit Peak</a> would rather its community pirate its own game, than play a  "microtransaction-riddled" ripoff that has appeared on Roblox.</p>
<p>The Roblox ripoff in question is Cliff, a release that describes itself as a "challenging climbing game where even the smallest mistake can be your downfall". So far, so Peak.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>According to the blurb, Cliff players will find themselves "trapped on a mysterious island", and the only way to escape from said island is to reach the top of the "towering" cliff. "Do you have the skill and courage to make it to the summit?" Cliff asks. The creator - PewStudio - does credit Peak as Cliff's inspiration, but this seems to be veering much closer towards imitation territory.</p>
<p>Not only does Roblox's Cliff sound pretty much identical to Peak, but its artwork is also alarmingly similar. You can check out the artwork for Cliff below.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>PewStudio/Roblox</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now compare that with the artwork for Peak, and you can see how this homage is not an homage, but basically a copy and paste effort.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Team PEAK</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Then, we get to the gameplay itself. I've just watched some Cliff videos on YouTube, and again we are well into blatant copying. Both games have an airport as its lobby area (see images below), both games have first person views for climbing, both games have a stamina bar that works in the exact same way…</p>
<p>To quote our own video whizz Alix Attenborough, who I have been chatting with as I write this story up: "If you showed someone this [Cliff] and Peak, they would think they are the same game."</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group"><figure>

</figure>
</figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Peak team isn't flattered by the arrival of Cliff, and has asked its players not to even entertain the Roblox "ripoff", branding it "microtransaction-riddled… slop". Writing on <a href="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083">social media platform X</a>, the Peak team said it would frankly rather people "pirate our game" than even touch Cliff.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, there are many titles which have appeared on Roblox over the years that have been inspired by others that came before. The platform holds a plethora of horror games, which clearly take a lot of their ideas from the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> or similar. However, in the case of Cliff, it really does seem like the creator has lifted everything from Peak, and ported it onto the platform, adding none of its own ideas or originality.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked the developers behind Peak for further comment on Cliff, and reaction to its presence on Roblox.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Elsewhere in Peak news, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/being-able-to-cook-and-eat-your-friends-thats-peak-gameplay">last month the developers added cannibalism as a feature</a>. Yes, cannibalism. You can now eat your friends…</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Many of us have probably been in the situation where you have forgotten where you parked your car, which leads to pacing up and down the rows in the general vicinity of where you think you parked, while wracking your brain for what level and area you pulled up in. It is a situation that can be panic inducing as thoughts go through your mind, like maybe the car was stolen? Then that panic subsides when you see your car and life goes on. A Dream About Parking Lots takes that situation and turns it into a half hour therapy session.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Dream About Parking Lots — Out Now on Consoles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sP2EGhbyqwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Dream About Parking Lots is a dreamy maze-like experience in which all you have to do is find the right car. You are armed with a key fob which you can keep pressing in the hope of hearing the car’s horn, which sounds simple enough. However, you must navigate mazes of other cars to find the right one, all the while talking to a therapist. The dialogue has multiple choices that steer the conversation based on your decisions. For the majority of the game, it does genuinely feel like you are having a therapy session, trying to figure out why you are dreaming about parking lots and what it signifies in your own life.</p>


<p>Across the 30 minutes of game time, A Dream About Parking Lots will transport you to different parking lot locations, each with cars parked in a generally neat formation, though there are obstacles that will make you look for the correct path. As you move through the dreams each area gets a bit more off putting. Most scenes still look normal, but they can also be a little disconcerting with things that are not quite right, just like dreams. It’s lent a further surreal element by the retro aesthetic, with blocky, simplistic environments .</p>


<p>The conversation between you and the therapist is the main strength of A Dream About Parking Lots. There is no voice dialogue so you have to read and take in what is being said. There are some poignant life lessons peppered through the dialogue with the responses dependant on the dialogue choices. Like I mentioned earlier, this does feel like a therapy session, even if it does not delve as deep as a real one would.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		A Dream About Parking Lots is an interesting little experience that uses a real life situation many of us would have found ourselves in, and uses it to create a therapy session. It is a short and succinct experience that has quite a lot of depth to it, though it isn’t the best looking title.	</p></div>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is being added this Thursday to the game The First Descendant. Nexon's free-to-play third-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-geforce-game-ready-driver-optimizes-the-first-descendant-nvidia-dlss-3-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, Ray Reconstruction, DLAA, Reflex, and ray tracing</a>, but with the official launch of Season 3 on August 7, GeForce RTX 50 Series will get even better performance thanks to Multi Frame Generation. On average, DLSS 4 runs the game 4.9x faster than native rendering. The flagship GPU, the RTX 5090, averages 226 frames per second with ray tracing enabled and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance Mode (with the transformer model). The RTX 5080 registers 192 FPS under the same conditions.</p>



<p>Season 3 'Breakthrough' also sees the addition of Nell, a new playable character who wields arc-like telekinetic abilities, launching energy spheres that inflict debuffs and pull nearby enemies into her attacks. She is ideal for fast-paced, aggressive, run-and-gun players because she can convert all gunfire into weak point hits. Breakthrough will also expand the game world by adding a big new field area called "Axion" and a formidable Colossus boss battle. Lastly, Players can also look forward to a mountable vehicle, which will allow them to travel faster across the regions of The First Descendant.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation is also available (alongside DLSS Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex) in the single player survival horror puzzle Death Relives. Developed by small and independent Turkish developer Nyctophile Studios, Death Relives takes inspiration from Aztec mythology and real historical events from the 16th century. Players find themselves in a nightmarish world where they must survive against long-forgotten gods, such as Xipe Totec—the Aztec god of death, life, rebirth, agriculture, vegetation, and deadly warfare. </p>



<p>Throughout the game, they will visit historical locations, such as the ship Hernán Cortés traveled on to reach the land of the Aztecs. The dark and eerie atmosphere of Death Relives hides other entities lurking in the shadows that are revealed through the storyline as the protagonist, Adrian, progresses through the game. Death Relives launched around ten days ago <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1987400/Death_Relives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> and so far, most user reviews (83%) are positive.</p>

                <p>Fleshy architecture has been a popular choice for developers looking to create uncomfortably squishy levels, but the original team behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2</a>--Looking Glass--might have taken things a little <em>too </em>far back in the '90s. According to System Shock 2 artist Nate Wells, the structures inhabited by the hostile aliens known as The Many had a surprising origin, as the art assets included photos of another developer's colonoscopy.</p><p>"When we were working on The Many, if you remember, it has this very biological vibe to it," Wells said to Nightdive's Locke Vincent in the studio's Deep Dive podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/system-shock-2s-alien-sphincter-doors-were-made-with-photos-from-a-devs-colonoscopy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). It's this fleshy mass that has taken over the Rickenbacker. We did these things called 'sphincter doors,' this sphincter that opens up. I was making the doors and doing the concept. I think I was searching through some gross biological [images], like endoscopy sort of stuff. [Looking Glass producer] Josh Randall approached me and said he had a video of his colonoscopy."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egEqjOg9zfE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/egEqjOg9zfE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wells said that Randall gave him images from his colonoscopy video, and he used a frozen frame "from somewhere in his large intestine" to create a base texture for the sphincter doors in the game. "If you look at those doors, you're seeing Josh Randall's colon⁠--audio genius Josh Randall's colon," Wells said.</p><p>The rest was history, as System Shock 2 garnered plenty of high praise when it was released in 1999, with most people none the wiser about having explored the inner workings of the human body while fighting a killer worms-like species--years before the Planet Express crew did so in <a href="https://youtu.be/CYKJYOJZUk0" rel="nofollow ">an episode of Futurama</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/">System Shock 2</a>'s 25th-anniversary remaster recently launched for PC, and after a slight delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-remaster-is-finally-out-on-consoles-next-week/1100-6532869/">it landed on consoles in July</a>. The project proved to be a labor of love for Nightdive Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-announced-and-in-d/1100-6469015/">after it was first announced in 2019</a>, as the studio didn't have access to the game's complete source code and it had to piece everything back together with some "extensive" reverse-engineering.</p>

<p>"When you look for excellence in our legacy, [Bad Company 2] is where you find it," Chubb said. "That game particularly delivered on a level of fidelity and a sort of intimate destructive experience. Blasting out a single wall, bringing down a partial building, or entire buildings. It was comprehensive, and it felt like the identity of that game more than anything else."</p><p>Chubb acknowledged this identity was "kind of missing" from Battlefield 2042. "We really wanted to go back to that" with Battlefield 6, the developer said.</p><p>Before this, the designer of Bad Company 2, David Goldfarb, said leaked footage from the Battlefield 6 alpha test was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">giving off "Bad Company 2 vibes."</a> Beyond Bad Company 2, the Battlefield 6 developers have also said they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">inspired by Battlefield 3 and 4.</a></p><p>2021's Battlefield 2042 missed the mark for many fans of the series, and the teams at EA said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-reflect-on-battlefield-2042s-poor-launch-and-how-it-shaped-new-game/1100-6533676/" data-ref-id="1100-6533676">they learned a lot from the game's struggles</a>. The sentiment around Battlefield 6 following the big multiplayer reveal recently has been mostly positive, but only time will tell if the game becomes a success. Beyond Battlefield 6's multiplayer and campaign, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">new battle royale experience is in the works as well.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> begins August 7 for a limited group of people before expanding more widely later in August. The full game, meanwhile, launches October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The plan was for these games to be published by unnamed external partners, spreading out the risks of triple-A development while preserving the team sizes needed for big budget games. The company would be a "stable home" for game developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That plan has been put to the test over the last 9 years—and the company still hasn't released any games. It shut down two projects </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/developer-probablymonsters-lays-off-battle-barge-staff-after-project-cancellation">in 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-probablymonsters-conducting-more-layoffs-after-pledging-to-build-stable-home-for-developers-">2025</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> despite raising</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/multi-studio-game-company-probablymonsters-nets-200-million-to-continue-expansion">&nbsp;hundreds millions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in funding over the years.

Ryan spoke to Game Developer on the eve of the company revealing its first projects to hit the market: a co-op side-scrolling roguelike called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Storm Lancers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2—though it will be available there via backwards compatibility) and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a first-person psychological horror game for Steam and the Epic Game Store. Both games will retail at the decidedly not-very-triple-A price of $19.99.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Are 'unreasonable investor expectations' the cause of poor video game market conditions?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan seemed passionate about that price point, drawing a line to how it connects to ProbablyMonsters' new vision for triple-A projects. But passion doesn't account for the fact that to get to this point, he and the leadership team laid off at least 50 workers along the way.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most CEOs we ask about layoffs shy away from the topic, quickly falling back on PR talking points. Ryan took the unusual step of raising the layoffs unprompted early in our conversation. He did so in part </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/op-ed-the-upsides-downsides-and-future-of-aaa-game-development">to lay out what's changed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since he shared his vision for triple-A development in a 2020 blog—and why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-">the economic havoc</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftereffects (which were warming up as he wrote that post) upended how he thought the next few years would play out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He argued ProbablyMonsters is on the path to sustainability—but a different kind than what he envisioned five years ago.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="ProbablyMonsters was founded in an age of robust third-party publishing">ProbablyMonsters was founded in an age of robust third-party publishing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially Ryan attributed the 2024 and 2025 layoffs to the fact that the video game market "moved on and evolved." That phrase echoes what we've heard from other industry leaders describing changing player tastes, competition from user generated content (UGC) platforms, and post-lockdown personal finances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On follow-up, Ryan clarified he was referring more to the state of games funding. "For many of the games, the primary biggest issue was they were built at a scale where they needed a level of funding to finish the game to take it from vertical slice...the way our teams were set up, it was designed to be funded by a publisher. The business model shift in the industry has been pretty drastic across the board as well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The CEO was careful to avoid specifying if any publishing deals were canceled, reneged, or ended for other means. "I would say that the viability of the offers from publishers didn't support...going in that same direction," he said. He added later that finding new publishers has been difficult because there are fewer and fewer of them. "Two of what were the top seven publishers in the world aren't independent publishers anymore. Microsoft bought Zenimax and Activision Blizzard."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whether the games could be reworked to ship without a publisher—he said that wasn't possible. "We couldn't responsibly bring [those games] to market without a triple-A publisher."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But couldn't they? They raised millions in capital after all. "A lot of games, as you launch them, you need to be able to service them and the scale of the market it's shipping into. You need to continue to ensure the delight of your fanbase," said Ryan. "You need to make sure that not only can you get the game built and launch it, but you can also support it."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan did not indicate if these games were live service titles or if he was referring to post-launch maintenance of single-player games, only that the plan had been for an external publisher to offer resources and fund such an initiative.</span></p><p>Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That raises the question: what about the people who set up the teams in that format? What accountability did ProbablyMonsters leader face for laying off workers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan spoke carefully in response to that question. "I do feel like there has been accountability. As CEO, I bear the brunt of the accountability across the board. It's not easy to have gone through that cycle when you're looking at a game and it's just not fundable...as they were in a place where they needed a publisher to be a viable game in the marketplace."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said management "did try" to press on with the canceled games, implying there was research into whether they could take some of the planned live service titles and ship them as standalone retail products.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for whatever consequences management faced—he first prefaced by saying that ProbablyMonsters leadership is "directly engaged." (He said no one on the leadership team is relaxing on a beach, waiting for the checks to come in.) Then he declined to state if anyone had been laid off with the affected workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I never want to make public statements about if anyone's ever held accountable to the point where they're released for that reason. I think it hurts their opportunity to learn from it and find another role," he said, noting that for some individuals, the responsibility went all the way back up to the unnamed publishers who stopped funding the games.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does sustainability look like for ProbablyMonsters?">What does sustainability look like for ProbablyMonsters?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ryan explained that while plenty has changed since his public 2020 declaration on the state of triple-A games, he still feels it's a foundation for sustainability. What's changed since then (besides the market) are the realities of implementing sustainability.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One major lesson from the funding frustrations was the decision to ensure ProbablyMonsters's still-in-development games are prepared to make the kind of pivot that the canceled titles couldn't. "A bunch of the games in development today ares ones where we looked at the existing teams and said 'hey, if we could pivot you to a new game and get a game out in the next 18 months, what would you do?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the production structure that's come into focus for ProbablyMonsters includes "short-term games, midterm games, and long-term games," with the goal of releasing multiple games a year at different shapes and sizes. Long-term games are ones with extensive research &amp; development cycles, and are meant to be made with "future technology."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Midterm games are ones made with a "deeper bet" on their narrative or "tool chain," but with less R&amp;D than the previous titles. Finally, short-term games are ones where ProbablyMonsters developers looks at the next holiday season and asks "Where do we think there's consumer appetite? Where do we think there's an idea that we have that we're really excited to build with today's tools and technology?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stormlancers </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are examples of "short-term games," though he said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ire: Prologue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is meant to be a standalone game that builds excitement for a future game in the same universe. The "next chapter" of that series has already been greenlit, Ryan said. Other ProbablyMonsters developers are working in other genres—one is working on a co-op "soulslike" (for the unfamiliar, a nascent phrase referring to games inspired by the Dark Souls series), an open-world role-playing game, and an "extraction base-builder."&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via ProbablyMonsters.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The goal here is to set the teams up in a way that they're sustainably building and launching on a regular basis." That strategy does mirror the "culture of shipping" philosophy we heard about when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">speaking to developers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about the high costs of making games in the United States in 2024.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Ryan, ProbablyMonsters no longer believes that triple-A publishers are a "one-size fits all" approach for the company, and it's now racing to ensure it has positive revenue. When asked if ProbablyMonsters' investors were focused on finding a profitable exit, he said that the company's backers are "100 percent aligned" with his goal of building a sustainable studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The biggest pressure I take on as the CEO is the livelihoods of the employees in the company." ProbablyMonsters' end goal is to "delight the consumer," but he said the means to do that is to make a "predictable, successful, and respectful place for game developers to work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The real hard part for everyone in the industry today is the business model. The environment has evolved so much, and the business model has changed so much that it's been hard to maintain the same structure. In those structural changes, there's the hope that everyone can find a meaningful, engaging, respectful job they enjoy and love—that should be the driving impetus for everyone that's a CEO at a company anywhere."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
