              <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/woodkid-hideo-kojima-death-stranding-soundtrack-1235357959/"><span>a June interview with </span><i><span>Rolling Stone</span></i></a><span>, the musician Woodkid spoke about working with Hideo Kojima to create the soundtrack for this year’s </span><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i><span>. Asked what he’s learned from his time with the veteran game director, Woodkid shares an illuminating anecdote about a time when Kojima approached him with a concern. According to the singer-songwriter, Kojima said, “I’m going to be very honest, we have been testing the game with players and the results are too good. They like it too much. That means something is wrong; we have to change something…If everyone likes it, it means it’s mainstream. It means it’s conventional. It means it’s already pre-digested for people to like it.”</span></p> <p><span>I’ve been thinking about this quote now for months. As a player, as a reader, as a movie lover, I value work that has some integrity to it. I don’t like it when I’m playing a game and I can </span><i><span>feel </span></i><span>the designers straining to make it all as convenient and frictionless and pleasant as possible. That doesn’t mean that I like having my time wasted either, or that I don’t value good design. I just don’t like it when things feel focus-tested, sanded down, made all glossy for the masses. Sometimes I will think a popular, mainstream work is very good, but it won’t be </span><i><span>because </span></i><span>of the ways in which I sense it calibrating itself for mass appeal. It will be in spite of them.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This year, I played a number of games I thought were fine, and a few I didn’t like very much. I didn’t play many that I found really special or exciting, so this list is a top five, not a top ten. That’s not a commentary on the overall quality of the year’s games. It’s just a reflection of the fact that I played fewer games overall this year than I sometimes do–I’m trying to make more time for books, movies, and so on than I have in the past, and to spend more time with people I care about, too–and that, of the games I happened to play in my limited time, not all of them were winners. But I did still play some very good games this year. Let’s get on with it, shall we?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <hr> <h2><b>Honorable Mention: </b><b><i>Death Stranding 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Man, what a frustrating game for me to grapple with. The original </span><i><span>Death Stranding </span></i><span>is an all-time favorite of mine, a bold, bracing experience that was truly unlike anything I had played and that has only become more strangely resonant in the years since its release. This sequel, despite that secondhand Kojima quote I shared above about him apparently not wanting it to be too “mainstream,” felt to me very safe, leaning into conventional combat and away from the kinds of environmental friction that made forming connections in the first game so rewarding. It also, as Maddy Myers so effectively noted in </span><a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-women-of-death-stranding-2-are-stuck-in-a-sad-cycle"><span>a piece for </span><i><span>The A.V. Club</span></i></a><span>, exemplifies Kojima’s tiresome tendency toward gender essentialism.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But amidst the typical AAA gunfights and deeply disappointing narrative decisions, there were still some cool discoveries and memorable moments. I loved it when I hopped in a hot spring only to find that taking a bath in one can transport you to another; this felt to me not like another “quality of life”-oriented fast-travel option, something non-diegetic you select in a menu, but a feature of the world, the way Warp Zones used to be. And as I wrote about in our piece on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>the year’s best moments</span></a><span>, the game’s big reveal near the end is goofy, exuberant, and audacious, a reminder of what Kojima can do when he’s truly willing to take risks.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Honorable Mention: </b><b><i>Avowed</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Obsidian’s first-person fantasy RPG was refreshingly distinctive, with a world recalling that of </span><i><span>Morrowind </span></i><span>in its originality rather than more traditional swords-and-sorcery settings. I enjoyed wandering around and seeing who and what I would find more than I have in a game like this in a long time. It also tells a tale in which, depending on your actions, some pretty major events </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-steel-garrote-cave-fior-mes-iverno-burns-1851767974"><span>can happen or not happen</span></a><span>, and I appreciated that it found ways to confront some pretty big themes and incorporate some impactful choices while working within some clear limitations of budget and scope. </span><i><span>Avowed </span></i><span>punches above its weight and proves that big mid-budget adventures still deserve a place in today’s gaming landscape.</span></p>

 <h2><b>#5: </b><b><i>Absolum&nbsp;</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656282">©DotEmu</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2020’s </span><i><span>Streets of Rage 4 </span></i><span>was the best damn beat ‘em up I’d played in a long time. With it, co-developer Guard Crush demonstrated a real knack for the fundamentals of the genre, delivering clobbering action that was accessible, nuanced, and so, </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> satisfying. This year’s </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>sees them take all that savoir-faire and apply it to fantasy beat ‘em up action with roguelike elements, and it works as well as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I really dig a good fantasy beat ‘em up (Capcom’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>games of the ‘90s are particular favorites), and </span><i><span>Absolum </span></i><span>makes great use of its setting, peppering in just enough lore to tell us what we need to know about its central conflict and to understand the personalities of its four terrific playable characters. It also benefits from a striking art style that had me feeling like I was playing a lush fantasy cartoon from the 1970s. Random events and hidden secrets keep the world feeling lively, and going toe-to-toe with its terrific bosses is as enjoyable on your 20th run as it is on your first.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>#4: </b><b><i>Despelote&nbsp;</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656283">©Panic</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you have a passion for something, especially when you’re young, it stays with you everywhere. It’s with you when you’re wandering the halls of your school, when you’re hanging out with your friends, when you’re lying in bed at night. Some passions separate you from others; my high school obsession with Peter Gabriel wasn’t something I could really share with my friends who were into Nirvana and Pearl Jam, for instance. But sometimes, a passion binds you with others. Sometimes, it binds a whole nation together.</span></p> <p><i><span>Despelote </span></i><span>is a slice-of-life game about an Ecuadorian boy named Julián and the weeks surrounding the country’s qualifying run for the 2002 World Cup. Julián loves soccer. At home, his parents make dinner and talk about the changing state of the world and the latest challenges in their careers, but Julián just wants to play the soccer game on his console and hog the family TV. During recess at school, he and his classmates immediately seize the opportunity to kick the ball around. Everywhere you go in </span><i><span>Despelote</span></i><span>, soccer is woven seamlessly into life. People are still going on dates and exercising and walking their dogs, but soccer is in the air, inescapable. The game doesn’t need to didactically explain to you what qualifying for the World Cup would mean to the country, to these people. Thanks to </span><i><span>Despelote</span></i><span>’s brilliant blend of realism and surrealism, you’re there, in that space, living it. You can feel it yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s a common misconception about “relatability” which says that the more generic a work is, the more relatable it is because it means that we’ll all be more readily able to project ourselves onto its characters and connect to its situations. I find it’s almost always the opposite that is true. The more specific something is, the more precisely it captures an experience that is not my own, the better I’m able to feel connected to it as well, to appreciate both how it differs from my own experience and how it reflects the things that bind us all together. I’m not a soccer fan, and I’m sorry to say that I know woefully little about the history of Ecuador. But when I reached the game’s incredible climactic moment, which I wrote about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-video-game-moments-scenes-2025-clair-obscur-ending-2000655769"><span>here</span></a><span>, I practically stood up and cheered. I get it now. Sometimes, soccer really is life.</span></p> <h2><b>#3: </b><b><i>Terminator 2D: No Fate</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000653424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653424"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653424">© Bitmap Bureau</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Finally, we have the game that James Cameron’s seminal sci-fi flick has always deserved, a game that truly captures the movie’s pulse-pounding action and distinctive visual sensibilities. More than just a good licensed game (which is rare enough in itself), </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>immediately establishes itself as one of the best arcade-style run-and-gun action games of all time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve heard a few people criticize the game for its brevity. It certainly is short, but I wouldn’t want it to be longer. A full playthrough of </span><i><span>Contra III: The Alien Wars</span></i><span>, one of the other greats in the genre, takes maybe 30 minutes, but it’s so jam-packed with showstopping setpieces and memorable moments that half an hour feels like a perfect length to me; after that, I’m ready to try for a higher score or tackle a tougher difficulty. The same principle applies here; a runthrough of </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>might take 45 minutes or so (there are three possible routes through the game and some are longer than others), and when it’s over, I’m ready to catch my breath and then give it another shot. </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>makes repeated attempts rewarding with a scoring system that sees you keep building up a multiplier as long as you don’t take damage; I’ve already seen some </span><a href="https://barbarian.men/macaw45/2645969570#24130"><span>amazing efforts to get high scores</span></a><span> that show off some really skilled, high-level play. </span><i><span>No Fate </span></i><span>also makes harder difficulty options worthwhile, changing enemy placement and behavior to make the game tougher in an interesting way rather than just going the route of giving enemies more health.</span></p> <p><span>But ultimately it’s the stage design, pixel art, and wonderfully precise controls that make this game a masterpiece. It constantly keeps you on your toes, tossing you from future war run-and-gun scenarios to breathless vehicle chases to stealthy prison escapes, all animated beautifully and moving along at an exhilarating pace. A number of fairly high-profile games this year tried to recapture and build on the excitement offered by some of the best 2D sidescrollers of the ‘80s and ‘90s, but for my money, this is the only one that really knocked it out of the park. It’s a total banger.</span></p> <h2><span>&nbsp;</span><b>#2: </b><b><i>Blippo+</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656284"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656284">©Panic</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I watched some crap on TV when I was young of course, </span><i><span>He-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Knight Rider </span></i><span>and whatnot, but TV also often felt like a way to broaden my horizons. In the ‘90s, I think channel surfing and stumbling on cool, random shit was a pretty common experience for people, and it was certainly one I had time and again. I liked venturing into the world of TV without consulting a </span><i><span>Guide</span></i><span> and just seeing what I’d find. Maybe </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKl6B2CX2tY"><span>Huell Howser</span></a><span> would show me some aspect of California history I was unfamiliar with, or I might catch the end of an R-rated movie, all the swears </span><a href="https://youtu.be/H-y1PAUtv3k?si=lHDS0sJOocQwJqpq"><span>hilariously dubbed over</span></a><span> for broadcast TV, that blew my mind. TV was a gateway to learning about nature, </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr3JfDYpjt0?si=gNvo77FQdI-PseKL"><span>being exposed to art</span></a><span>, and sometimes just seeing human beings doing weird and interesting things.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Blippo+ </span></i><span>recaptures that feeling of just flipping through the channels and stumbling on good stuff. Its varied assortment of programs–ostensibly signals from an alien planet much like our own–includes game shows, talk shows, cooking shows, science shows, news programs, and more, each with its own distinct vibe, yet united by a cohesive aesthetic that gives the whole thing the fuzzy warmth and genuine humanity of, say, old Bob Ross episodes or other PBS programming funded by viewers like you. But </span><i><span>Blippo+ </span></i><span>is more than just a collection of TV shows, it’s also a fascinating narrative experience that immerses us in a culture on the brink of potentially radical change. A better world is possible, and the revolution just might be televised.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>#1: </b><b><i>Shadow Labyrinth</i></b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656287">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Okay, I need you to understand something. I was very young when Pac-Man became the world’s first video game superstar, but I do remember it. And look, Pac-Man was everywhere; in cartoons, on t-shirts and magazine covers, in hit pop songs. But here’s the thing: there was no one singular image of Pac-Man. On arcade cabinets, he looked like an armless yellow blob. In </span><a href="https://www.gamesdatabase.org/media/atari-5200/artwork-box/pac-man"><span>the box art for the Atari 5200 version</span></a><span>, he looked like a sleek floating sphere. In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/9blzq0/my_coworker_worked_at_atari_in_the_80s_heres_her/"><span>this stunning envisioning</span></a><span> by Japanese artist Hiro Kimura, apparently rejected by Atari due to its terrifying rendition of the ghosts, Pac-Man is a little metallic robot man gobbling wafers and wearing track shorts and a Pac-Man t-shirt.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656285"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656285">©Atari</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nowadays, established video game characters often have their appearance totally standardized, and every incarnation of them has to be “on-model.” Earlier this year, for instance, when Donkey Kong started </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-new-design-1851742086"><span>sporting a slightly altered look</span></a><span>, we all took notice, and knew that this decision had been made and approved by Nintendo on high. But when I was young, video game characters were in flux. I was free to imagine Pac-Man in any number of ways, none of them “canonically” accurate but all of them feeling like they reflected, in some way, the strange, abstract experience of playing </span><i><span>Pac-Man</span></i><span>. I miss the feeling that game characters exist as much in the realm of the imagination as they do on the screen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now I need you to understand something else. When I was young, the world was just trying to figure out what video games </span><i><span>meant</span></i><span>, how they might function as part of our society and our artistic landscape. </span><i><span>TRON</span></i><span>, a formative viewing experience for me, imagined worlds within our computers in which these games actually played out, while </span><i><span>The Last Starfighter </span></i><span>suggested that an arcade cabinet could be an intergalactic test of skill, a way to find the fighter pilot who could accomplish in real life what the game asked them to do onscreen. And I was a kid with a very overactive imagination. My home life was, shall we say, not great, and at school I mostly felt like a weirdo who didn’t really understand how to interact with the world around me. But in games, I could be capable, heroic even. And so, at six or seven, I would sometimes imagine that, as in </span><i><span>TRON</span></i><span>, whatever I was seeing on my screen was actually happening in some other realm somewhere, and that maybe my actions were making a difference.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A link to the past</b></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656277">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When you first fire up </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i><span>, the start menu screen shows a figure in a city on a rainy night, sitting on a bench and playing a gaming handheld. As soon as you launch the game, the figure disappears, their device abandoned on the ground. The game’s intro, a cavalcade of over-the-top anime nonsense, shows a human soul being summoned from beyond into the body that will serve as the game’s player character. To me, the implication seemed clear: the game is suggesting that we and the player character are literally one, that we have been summoned into the world of the game to help right whatever might be wrong in this strange world. And though I no longer give myself over to my imagination the way I did when I was six, I enjoyed the imaginative playfulness of this choice, the way it seemed to ask me to remember that part of myself that once believed that video games were one part technology, one part magic. Games don’t always activate that part of me anymore. It’s a nice surprise when they do.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From that point on, </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>continued to surprise me. I went in expecting a modest game, one that might take me 12 hours or so and offer some standard Metroidvania enjoyment. Instead, its world kept expanding beyond my expectations, surprising me both with its scale and its strangeness. Not since my first time playing </span><i><span>Symphony of the Night </span></i><span>has a game’s world impressed and bewildered me so much.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And now I want to go back to that Kojima quote I kicked things off with. At no point, in any way, did </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>ever feel “pre-digested” for my enjoyment. Its moment-to-moment gameplay felt fine, but it didn’t have that luscious quality that so many games strive for. And I </span><i><span>like</span></i><span> this about it. If you transport me to some other world, I’m not gonna be some badass ninja. It felt like some situation I had stumbled into and was making the best of; what I never felt was the concern of the developers, obsessing over some need to make the game feel the way games like </span><i><span>Hades </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>do. It felt as if the controls simply…were.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656286" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656286"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656286">©Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Similarly, </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>never seemed concerned with me understanding exactly what I needed to do next, or with me being able to conveniently find a save spot, or with me understanding its strange story. It all felt, top to bottom, like a true journey of </span><i><span>discovery</span></i><span>, in ways that games, in my experience, so rarely do these days. I loved simply stumbling upon references to Bandai Namco properties other than Pac-Man. (The first time I found myself in an area with the enemies from </span><i><span>Dig Dug</span></i><span>, I gasped in delight.) I loved needing to remember for myself where I might find some type of enemy I needed to fight to acquire some item. I loved figuring out for myself how to hunt down and defeat a boss who looked like a physical manifestation of </span><i><span>Pac Man</span></i><span>’s famous killscreen glitch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m very well aware that </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth </span></i><span>was made by developers. But I admire this game so much more because they worked so hard to make it feel as if it </span><i><span>wasn’t</span></i><span>, as if this really is just a strange, hostile world that we’ve been thrust into. I never once felt them looking over my shoulder, worrying about whether I was getting frustrated or finding it all “well-designed” enough. The part of my imagination that this game reawakened likes to think that perhaps this game is the “true story,” the real place where games like </span><i><span>Pac Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Galaga </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dig Dug </span></i><span>all come from, and those arcade games were little echoes of this world, little dreamlike manifestations of it, brought into our world by the Namco game designers of the 1980’s.</span></p> <p><span>With </span><i><span>Shadow Labyrinth</span></i><span>, Bandai Namco eschewed the tendency toward safety and standardization that sometimes limits games themselves and how we allow ourselves to imagine them. I never once felt the developers looking over my shoulder, worrying about whether I was getting frustrated or finding it all “well-designed” enough. This is a game in which the rules that say a character needs to be a certain thing or look a certain way don’t apply at all, an expression of that wild range of possibility that surrounds games when we set them free from specific ideas of appearance or genre and let them coalesce into something strange, risky, and new. </span></p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/31/why-im-excited-for-capcoms-weird-and-charming-buddy-action-game-pragmata</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Pragmata captured my attention way back in *checks notes* 2020 (wow). I finally played Pragmata earlier this year at Gamescom and walked away both thoroughly impressed and annoyed with Capcom for making my demo only 20 minutes long. Following a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025, which showed off new gameplay in New York City, an engaging reprieve from the lunar station that’s been heavily showcased so far, Capcom released a demo for the game; it’s basically what I played earlier this year and I can’t recommend it enough. It quickly highlights how unique Pragmata’s gameplay is, which mixes third-person gunplay with real-time hacking minigames.</p><p>“From the start, the core vision was a buddy-action experience where you would control two distinct characters with a single controller,” Pragmata director Yongchee Cho tells me. The team explored giving protagonist Hugh a small drone that aids him in combat, but once the developers landed on the android Diana as a second protagonist, this idea evolved into the hacking system. This created various layers of gameplay that all happen at once, and when coupled with the mysterious narrative and various locales warped and twisted by Luna Filament, the name Pragmata makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The word comes from Greek, meaning things, actions, or facts, and in philosophy, it connects to pragmatism,” Cho tells me. “A single word carrying so many layers of meaning felt like the perfect fit for the story and world of this game.”&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of that Luna Filament, it's the stuff that's causing New York City's Times Square to look so different in the latest Pragmata trailer, and that's not the only location that will be transformed by this mysterious substance. Cho says it's key to the sci-fi world Capcom is creating in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>"We want players to enjoy diving into the unique sci-fi world that defines Pragmata, and not just the protagonists and their interactions," he says. "You'll come across areas warped by Luna Filament, where strange reactions and irregular structures create an atmosphere that feels both alien and intriguing. The game is full of moments and locales that spark curiosity, whether you're into sci-fi or not, and those surprises run throughout the game.</p><p>"Personally, I can't wait to see the incredible, super-plays players pull off once they get their hands on it."&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZkP_YZxuP1s" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Those super-plays will be performed throughout Pragmata by the two unlikely protagonists, Hugh and Diana. Cho says Hugh tends to be laid-back and reluctant, but has a strong sense of responsibility. It's no surprise, then, that he teams up with Diana.&nbsp;</p><p>"At first glance, he might seem distant, yet deep down, he's a kind person," Cho adds. "Diana might have felt like a burden early on, but through their explorations of the space station, he gradually starts to see her as someone he truly wants to help. We worked hard to express that side of Hugh's character, not only in dialogue, but also during combat throughout the game."&nbsp;</p><p>On the flip side, Cho describes Diana as an android girl with vast AI knowledge but little real-world experience, making her a perfect fit for Hugh. "She's full of curiosity about a world she knows almost nothing about," Cho says. "She originally intended to stay on the Moon, but meeting Hugh gives her a new purpose, and she chooses to travel with him. As they journey together, learning from Hugh's experience, Diana becomes increasingly fascinated by Earth and eager to discover more."&nbsp;</p><p>The Moon, Earth, and other settings we'll visit in Pragmata are inspired by all manner of media, Cho tells me. "The character-driven story takes cues from human drama; the visual world borrows ideas from animation and Hollywood films; and the mechanical design and presentation are influenced by Japanese animation," he says. "Of course, it's not just about inspiration. We've blended these influences while preserving the unique atmosphere that makes Pragmata stand apart."&nbsp;</p><p>Pragmata launches in April, so we don't have to wait long to see whether it really stands out from its inspirations. If what we've played so far is any indication – and don't forget, you can check out a Pragmata demo right now – Cho and team are on the right track.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/31/why-im-excited-for-capcoms-weird-and-charming-buddy-action-game-pragmata]]></content:encoded>

Legacy of Atlantis is a reimagining of the original game, in all of its adventuring and 3D platforming glory, with a massive visual upgrade to go along with it.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/">reveal at The Game Awards</a> showed off a small clip of gameplay, which showed that while you'll definitely spend a fair amount of time shooting raptors while duel-wielding pistols, you'll also be jumping to avoid traps and clear obstacles like you would have back in the 90s. Obviously, at this point, we don't know how much of the gameplay will focus on platforming, but it doesn't seem to be tossed to the side. There's definitely more than a small chance that it is one of the more engaging platformers in 2026, and hopefully it lives up to that expectation.</p>



<h2 id="h-bloodstained-the-scarlet-engagement-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s">Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Bloodstained-The-Scarlet-Engagement.png"></a><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement. Image credit: 505 Games</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>All of the Bloodstained games are 2D platformers, but within them are two different art styles. The Curse of the Moon games are both pixel art, more classic-era Castlevania-looking games, while the Ritual of the Night and one of our picks, the Scarlet Engagement, have a more modern, 2D/3D style with more detailed character models.</p>



<p>Hundreds of games have tried to capture the magic of the original Castlevania games, but Bloodstained has been consistently successful at presenting Castlevania nostalgia while still maintaining its own flavour. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-the-night-is-still-young/">Ritual of the Night is arguably one of the better</a> of the three currently available Bloodstained games, and by the time The Scarlet Engagement arrives, it'll have been seven years since it came out on PC and last-gen consoles. </p>



<p>Hopefully, The Scarlet Engagement can pick up where Ritual of the Night left off and deliver a platforming experience that can stand amongst the best of its contemporaries.</p>



<h2 id="h-yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-spring-2026-nintendo-switch-2">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book (Spring 2026 - Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Yoshi-and-the-Mysterious-Book-Announced.png"></a><figcaption><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. Image credit: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Platforming fans everywhere are still waiting for their <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-cost-70-wont-get-another-delay-ex-rockstar-animator-says/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> reveal (a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-fans-stay-tuned-future-nintendo-directs-hints-miyamoto-mobile-focus-done/">new 3D Mario platformer</a>), but Yoshi's Island fans are in good shape because we have Yoshi and the Mysterious Book to look forward to.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book-nintendo-switch-2-spring-2026/">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> is the first new Yoshi game since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yoshis-crafted-world-crafty-business/">Yoshi's Crafted World in 2019</a>, making this the second game on this list that'll have a seven-year gap between its most recent series entry. We haven't seen too much of the game, but its likeness to Yoshi's Island is undeniable. If that inspiration follows through to its gameplay, then we'll have one of the better 2D platformers Nintendo has put out in a while on our hands.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-may-29-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight (May 29, 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/LEGO-Batman-Legacy-of-the-Dark-Knight-Release-Date-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight. Image credit: Warner Bros.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The LEGO games have always been a mix of puzzle-platforming with some light combat and adventuring, and even though LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight looks like it'll be the most expansive, most open-world-like game in the modern era of LEGO games yet, there's no reason to believe it won't include plenty of 3D platforming.</p>



<p>It seems like it'll have a bit more of an Arkham-style focus on combat and open-world mechanics, but it's still a LEGO game. There's a good chance some of the combat focus the Arkham games have will be swept away for more platforming, and TT Games has more than proven capable of creating some excellent platforming adventures. It's good to have a Batman game we can actually look forward to, instead of one where no one is all that convinced it'll be worth checking out, only to be proven right (looking at you, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/gotham-knights-batfamilys-competent-but-no-batman/">Gotham Knights</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">Suicide Squad</a>).</p>



<h2 id="h-darwin-s-paradox-tbc-2026-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-nintendo-switch-2">Darwin's Paradox (TBC 2026 - PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Darwins-Paradox.png"></a><figcaption><em>Darwin's Paradox. Image credit: Konami</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Our last but in no way least pick of our most anticipated games, Darwin's Paradox, is a real fish-out-of-water scenario as you take on the role of a blue octopus that is quite literally out of his natural habitat. Getting back to the ocean and getting back home is the ultimate goal, and along the way you'll be put into what looks like more than a few tricky platforming situations.</p>



<p>Darwin's Paradox looks like it'll be a strong spectacle when it comes to its visual presentation and a few core set-pieces throughout the game's story, and hopefully, it's able to lean on the squiggly and sticky nature of the octopus to create some inventive platforming scenes.</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>



<p>As is the case with every category, not everything we're looking forward to in 2026 can make our main list. The following are our honourable mentions for our most anticipated platformers for 2026.</p>



<p>But before that, a huge asterisk on our main list. Our top honourable mention is an Unannounced Mario 3D platformer, because when it launches, it'll likely be the most significant game for the genre since Super Mario Odyssey. But without any actual announcement, it didn't feel right having it take the place of another game that we actually know will arrive this year. </p>



<p>It was already a shock that the Nintendo Switch 2 didn't launch with a new Mario platformer, so we can't exactly bet on it happening in 2026. So if you felt its absence from the main list, that's why. With that out of the way, here are our honourable mentions.</p>



<ul>
<li>Unannounced Mario 3D Platformer</li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-release-date-tarsier-studios/">Reanimal</a></li>



<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/high-on-life-2-release-date-gameplay-gamescom-2025/">High on Life 2</a></li>

            <p>Sony has unveiled its PS Plus monthly game offerings for January.</p>
<p>The three games below will be available to all PlayStation Plus members regardless of tier subscription from Tuesday 6th January to Monday 2nd February.</p>
<ul>
<li>Need for Speed Unbound | PS5</li>
<li>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Core Keeper | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>

<p>We didn't review Core Keeper, I'm afraid, but Matt thought the Epic Mickey remaster was "transformative", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-rebrushed-a-flawed-fascinating-curio-transformed">writing</a>: "In its original guise Epic Mickey was a bit of a disappointment, its clever design, admirable ambition, and a bold approach to its source material undone by just a little too much mechanical awkwardness."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Purple Lamp/THQ Nordic/Disney</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Former editor-in-chief Martin similarly had a good time with Need for Speed Unbound, stating in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/need-for-speed-unbound-review-the-best-need-for-speed-in-a-generation">2022 'Recommended' review</a> that "Criterion takes the reins once more for an arcade racer that's capable of going toe-to-toe with the all-conquering <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Criterion Games</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Don't forget that when we welcome in new games, we must also wave goodbye to others. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> (PS5). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3 (PS5), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outlast-trials">The Outlast Trials</a> (PS4/5), Synduality Echo of Ada (PS5), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/neon-white">Neon White</a> (PS4/5) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-december">are all on the way out</a>, so you only have until 6th January to add those to your library.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-game-of-the-year-2025/</link>
            <guid>1395064</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Awards for individual genres are amazing, and recognition for one game conquering a whole field of gameplay. However, this is the big one. There have been so many elite contenders for the 2025 Game of the Year accolades, and Insider Gaming has selected the one deemed the best.</p>



<p>12 months of video game releases have led to this big moment. Top-level developers have worked hard, and publishers have put their faith in games in the hope of being acknowledged as the best. 2025 has emptied wallets and consumed hours with amazing Roguelikes, RPGs, Action-Adventure games, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has crowned a winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a testament to numerous games that a few releases could be in this spot. If you can overlook the dastardly difficulty of Hollow Knight: Silksong and ignore the elitist conversation of a AAA game needing to be GOTY, then Silksong is a worthy winner, and the Insider Gaming team has spoken!</p>



<p>This year has seen Silksong go from being barely a figure in the shadows to receiving a launch date soon after it reemerged at Gamescom 2025 in August. It’s rare for an indie game to have the levels of hype it did, but that’s exactly what happened. It single-handedly took the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-xbox-eshop-offline-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam, Xbox, and eShop stores offline once downloads went live</a>, due to demand, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-beat-hollow-knight-all-time-peak-player-count-in-15-minutes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decimated the original’s all-time peak player count in minutes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s one of the highest-rated games of 2025, and it’s a breathtaking adventure from start to finish. You’ll struggle to find indie games this beautiful and carefully manicured—there are no ugly edges to be found. The gameplay and depth of quests and things to do have been greatly expanded, and every locale feels unique. Combat is a steep learning curve, but there’s nothing wrong with that, and owners will receive the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-sea-of-sorrow-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sea of Sorrow DLC</a> for free.</p>



<p>Silksong suddenly ended up being one of the year’s most anticipated games, and in Insider Gaming’s opinion, the best, without question.</p>



<h2 id="h-insider-gaming-game-of-the-year-2025-runner-up-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Insider Gaming Game of the Year 2025 Runner-Up—Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another accolade. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>So many turn-based RPGs successfully execute one or more aspects of a game: Gameplay, Story, Performances, Music, and Art. Very few dare to tackle them all head-on and nail it! Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 wasn’t as hyped as Silksong was, but it emerged as one of the most must-play RPGs of the modern era.</p>



<p>Yes, Sandfall Interactive’s first game was created by world-class developers with years of AAA experience. It didn’t mean Clair Obscur would work by any means. The odd design choice here and there could maybe have used some more work, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI controversy</a> does leave the slightest of sour tastes in the mouth.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is an easy runner-up. With other games like Hades 2, Blue Prince, and Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 all delivering their own serving of excellence, respect needs to be put on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s name.</p>



<p>This is one of the best games in years.</p>



<p>It’s likely many of you would swap our winner and runner-up around—or omit Hollow Knight: Silksong altogether! If you have thoughts or your own winner, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to discuss them.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-ps-plus-essential-january-2026/">Shortly after the headlining game for January's PS Plus Essential titles leaked</a>, PlayStation has come out and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">announced the full PS Plus Essential lineup</a> for the first month of 2026. Not only does it include Need for Speed Unbound, but all PS Plus subscribers will be able to enjoy Epic Mickey Rebrushed and Core Keeper.</p>



<p>It's back to the three-game norm, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-five-games-december-2025-lego-horizon-adventures-neon-white/">December 2025's lineup of Essential titles</a> included five games total. While Need for Speed is the headliner, it's arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/disneys-epic-mickey-rebrushed-what-could-have-been/">Epic Mickey Rebrushed</a> that's the most exciting title of the bunch. Core Keeper isn't a slouch either, as the 1-8 player co-op game is a good option to cozy up with as we get into the cold of January.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available for players to redeem as of January 6, 2026, which means that you'll have until January 5, 2026, to redeem the five games that were made available to players in December 2025.</p>

<figcaption><em>GTA V</em>, and thus presumably <em>GTA Online</em>, has made it onto Steam's Best of 2025 list.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a real live-service jamboree in the top sellers list; other titles include <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which also managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit a pretty impressive sales milestone</a> in its first couple of weeks, as well as <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>The first non-multiplayer title on the list after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II </em>is the drug-dealing simulator <em>Schedule I</em>, followed by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which is arguably on the borderline given its cycle of frequent updates (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">certainly is a big seller</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, the most-played games of the year skew much more towards time sink-style single-player adventures, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="79f14bf8-3a01-4742-90f0-f879fca71b70" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and <em>Hollow Knight </em>(although two of those do indeed support multiplayer).</p><p>The list even tracks the games most often played with a controller, and it won't shock you to learn that the likes of <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and, yes, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>figure heavily on that particular list.</p><figure role="group">

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> was Steam's biggest-selling game over the holiday period.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4777282/view/502844844914248084">SteamDB</a>, which revealed that the biggest-selling games by revenue on the digital platform from 23rd-30th December were Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>Interestingly, if you look at all <em>products</em> sold on Steam, not just games, Steam Deck takes the runner-up spot, but given this chart organises top-selling games by revenue, not unit sales, that shouldn't be a complete surprise.</p>

<p>Here's the full top 10, as compiled by SteamDB:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arc Raiders</li>
<li>Steam Deck</li>
<li>Battlefield 6</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>

<li>Cyberpunk 2077</li>
<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5 Enhanced.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given this is a list of premium games, this doesn't include free-to-play offerings. If it did, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> would rocket straight to pole position, and Where Winds Meet would take fifth place. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, too, just dipped into the top ten at ninth position.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-is-offloading-14%e2%80%b3-laptop-bundle-to-its-lowest-price-now-cheaper-than-an-entry-level-ipad-2000654516</link>
            <guid>1395025</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to spend thousands on a new laptop, especially if you’re just after an everyday machine for casual work and home use. If you’re shopping for one today, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Amazon, very generously, has dropped the price of the 14-inch HP computer in Silver to just $300, after taking a massive 35% off its usual price.</a> Your purchase will come with a free 8-in-1 hub, as well as a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365; both of which add even more value to the current offer. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this model drop to, but as you’d expect, the discount ends soon. Be sure to snap it up fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Decent Performance for Regular Tasks</h2>
<p>We won’t sugarcoat it; this laptop is not a powerhouse. It’s appropriate for home use like simple browsing, streaming, video calling, and some basic work tasks. We won’t exactly recommend it to work professionals, but it’s a good pick for seniors who want their own device or kids who are just getting started. You’re getting a modest 14-inch HD display that delivers decent visuals for all your needs. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the picture quality consistent across all lighting conditions. You can view the screen comfortably in daylight (while soaking up some sun), as well as in dim settings after the shadows fall.</p>
<p>The 4GB DDR4 RAM isn’t made for heavy-duty multitasking, but it does a good job of keeping everything running smoothly, as long as you’re not trying to push some creative boundaries. There’s 128GB flash storage, which is nicely paired with a 128GB Micro SD to give you a total of 256GB space to save all your files, content, and programs. It’s more than enough to house hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, a few movies to stay entertained on the go, all your favorite songs downloaded, and more. Power comes from the 4-core Intel N150 processor, which hits up to 3.6 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity comes from Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, while ports like USB Type-C (10Gbps), two USB Type-A, HDMI 1.4b, and an SD card reader make it easy to connect other peripherals without feeling limited. Windows 11 S also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to go right out of the box. The highlight here, however, is the one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Office. This gives you access to premium apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Teams, and more. You can use these to create documents, be creative with presentations, work on large spreadsheets, and communicate with teams around the world remotely. The subscription typically costs around $100 a year, but you’re getting it here for absolutely free!</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to grab a new everyday laptop for regular use, this Amazon deal lets you pick one for basically nothing. Again, it’s not made for heavy-duty work, creative projects, or gaming. It’s designed for basic use, and it does that job quite well. Getting your orders in now will help ensure they reach you before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to surprise a loved one with a new laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Additionally, shipping is free, so $300 is all you’ve got to pay today.</a></p>

This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628405" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628405"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Core Keeper.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg"></figure><p>Core Keeper is kind of a blend of cozy and survival games that allows players to explore a vast cavern that has hidden treasures and "untold secrets."

            <p>Nier producer Yosuke Saito has teased that there's "just a little something" on the way for fans in 2026.</p>
<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20251219044/">4Gamer</a>, and translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/japanese-game-creators-discuss-2026-ambitions">Gematsu, </a>Saito hinted that both Nier: Automata and Dragon Quest fans can expect a little treat as both series celebrate their ninth and fortieth anniversaries, respectively, in 2026.</p>
<p>However, he did temper the tease by adding "please don't get too excited with anticipation!"</p>

<p>“Next year marks the 40th anniversary of Dragon Quest! I’d be extremely happy if everyone could join in on a grand celebration," Saito said.</p>
<p>"And for Nier: Automata's ninth anniversary, we're also preparing 'just a little something…' so please don't get too excited with anticipation! With that, I wish you all a happy New Year."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Nier: Automata producer Saito and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/yoko-taro">Yoko Taro</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nier-automata-creators-deny-characters-were-problematic-overseas-and-blame-mistranslated-subtitle-for-censorship-rumours">denied any of their character designs were restricted for Western audiences</a>.  After the developers were reportedly mistranslated in Japanese-to-English subtitling, Taro said: "I've never heard of such a thing happening".</p>

            <guid>1394989</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima has delivered his Happy New Year message to the world, as it's already 2026 in his home of Japan. Along with well-wishes for the new year, he's provided an update on what 2026 will mean for Kojima Productions, and according to Kojima, it means he's getting his head down and rooting himself in his home and his work.</p>



<p>Now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has been out the door for months, the studio can look ahead at its next major projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">OD and Physint</a>. According to Kojima, this is part of Kojima Productions moving forward with the "<em>Second Phase that leads into Kojima Productions 'Third Phase.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Happy New Year,</em>" Kojima began in his post on his <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?s=20">X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>In 2026, we will move forward with the 'Second Phase' that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ 'Third Phase'.”</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unlike last year, I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development on the horror game 'OD' and move forward with preparations for the espionage action title 'PHYSINT.' This includes casting actors, scanning, and performance capture shoots.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy New Year.<br>In 2026, we will move forward with the “Second Phase” that leads into KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS’ “Third Phase.”<br>Unlike last year, like I was traveling all over the world, this year will be about staying grounded and laying solid foundations. We will continue development… <a href="https://t.co/yje0zAY1md">pic.twitter.com/yje0zAY1md</a></p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2006387335114670562?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>It sounds like Kojima sees the year ahead as a time to really dig into Physint and OD, and while Death Stranding 2 being out of the way means he and the rest of the studio can focus on both games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-productions-10th-anniversary-future-projects/">both titles are seemingly still early in development.</a> In other words, barring some incredible surprise, we won't be seeing a new game from Kojima Productions in 2026.</p>



<p>Beyond the studio's upcoming game projects, Hideo Kojima also <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-death-stranding-animated-movie-is-in-the-works-with-raised-by-wolves-creator-aaron-guzikowski-writing-the-script/">shared an update on the multiple adaptations in the works based on Death Stranding</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Also, be pushing forward with the live-action film of DEATH STRANDING, as well as its animation projects, both the movie and series. In addition, we’re preparing several 'events' this year. Once things are finalized, I’ll be able to share more.</em>"</p>



<p>So while 2026 likely won't be marked by a new game under Kojima's and the studios' belt, it will still be a significant one for Hideo Kojima as he enters the year of his 40th anniversary in game development. "This year also marks my 40th anniversary in the game industry, from 1986, and began my journey in game creation.<em> Thank you, as always, for your continued support and supporting Kojima Productions. I look forward to another great year</em>."</p>

The Jwar Isles are no different, and with these changes, come new opportunities, new allies, and consequences. In this article, we take a look at the new Consequences Cycle Deck for the <em>Bushido</em> skirmish wargame, along with 4 new fighters from among the Wave 25 releases.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Ride The Wave</h2><p>You might be wondering what we mean by Wave 25. It's simply a way to refer to a combination of products that release together. In this case, Wave 25 for <em>Bushido</em> was a huge release, with 13 new miniatures and the Consequences Cycle Deck. Here we're only taking a look at 4 of the new miniatures, but also available were:</p><ul><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - Kongu, Kuren, and Masaru</li><li>Prfecture of Ryu - Takashi Horaki</li><li>Cult of Yurei - Lotus Kaidan</li><li>Minimoto Clan - Aida and the Kami of Enduring Embers</li><li>Ronin - Yu</li><li>Silvermoon Syndicate - Minori</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - Tomoaki</li></ul><picture>

  </picture><h2>Consequences Cycle Deck</h2><p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. When constructing your warband, you can only use cards from 1 Cycle pack (Risen Sun, Weeping Sky, or Consequences). The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-weeping-sky-cycle-deck-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Weeping Sky Cycle Deck</a> before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p><ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li><li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li><li>Enhancements, that are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li><li>Themes, offering new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li></ul><p>We recently previewed several cards from the Consequences Cycle Deck, which you can see <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The Consequences Cycle Deck contains cards for all factions, except the Awoken and Imperial March, the 2 newest factions that will receive cards in future Cycle decks. The faction breakdown for the deck is:</p><ul><li>Cult of Yurei - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Ito Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Jung Pirates - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Minimoto Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancement, 1 event, 1 terrain)</li><li>Prefecture of Ryu - 4 cards (4 enhancement equipment)</li><li>Savage Wave - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shadow Wind Clan - 3 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shiho Clan - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 2 events)</li><li>Silvermoon Trade Syndicate - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - 4 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment)</li><li>The Descension - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Ronin - 7 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 3 events)</li></ul><p>Apart from those we previewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously</a> (I'm a huge fan of Consequences of Kiyohara and New Eagle Army), my favorite card from the set is the Shadow Wind Clan's Opposition Preparation, which stops enemy fighters from using a whole host of abilities when targeted by North Star fighters for the first time. I love the thematic pre-battle reconnaissance that the ninjas would have done to preempt and disrupt enemy abilities before even going into combat with them.</p><p>As with previous cycle decks, the more factions you play, the more you will get out of this deck, but even players with a single faction (as long as it's not Awoken or Imperial March) will get their faction's cards and the Ronin cards to use. It will also give you an idea of what your opponent might be taking (as you can see the cards in the app for list building purposes, but not the details), and who knows when you'll pick up a new faction in the future. I've been strictly Shadow Wind and Shiho Clan for a while, but with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-wretched-review-living-nightmare" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wretched</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Passing the Night</a> themed warband releases (both of which are incredible), I've found myself suddenly playing 2 new factions this year.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Somabo the Blue Crane</h2><p>Somabo is a Ronin fighter that can only be recruited into The Descension warbands, or those that include Hiroto (either the Ronin Drunken Master or Shiho Black Eagle versions). &nbsp;Somabo is fast, with movement 5 (with +1 move if running and doesn't suffer melee penalties for running), 4 dice in attack, and armed with a +1 damage katana or claws (depending on whether you want the katana's critical attack/sidestep defence or claws' pierce, bleed, or combo attack).</p><p>Somabo's Squall Strike ki feat lets them move 1 inch after an attack if they make a damage roll, along with up to 2 other friendly Tengu models within 4 inches. Finally, their Umbrella Block ki feat gives them parry until the end of the melee exchange.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Vekye</h2><p>Vekye is a Cult of Yurei fighter with a move of 5 and 2 types of attacks. Vekye can either go for standard damage, with +1 damage claws with pierce, bleed, and combo attack, or the +0 damage tainted hands with grapple attack. If Veyke manages to hold their opponent with grapple, at the end of the round, the held model (as long as it's not soulless) takes an additional 2 wounds and gains a spirit block marker that stops them from generating ki tokens next round.</p><p>Veyke has a Mutation ki feat that gives them either +1 melee weapon strength, regenerate 2, or armor 1 for the turn, depending on what they need, and a Fight or Flight ki feat, which grants them Banzai, allowing them to charge as a simple action, or Clowdwalk, which lets them ignore terrain and zones of control for movement. They also have Indomitable 1, which means they ignore the first enemy penalty for assisting in combat, along with coordinated attack Tengu, to benefit them when they gang up on an opponent.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Yoshiko</h2><p>Yoshiko is the latest Rose for the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate. I picked up Yoshiko to add to my plan to make an entirely Rose warband because despite being part of the Silvermoon, their theme is very ninja-ish in their disguises, concealed weapons, and seduction techniques. Yoshiko is no different in that respect, but is a little more overt in her combat prowess. Yoshiko has move 5, as is standard with the Roses (except the veteran rose Misao), and jump up, evasive and lightfooted to keep them mobile, and disguise 5 to keep them protected. In attack, they roll 3 dice with their +0 damage Tachi that has push and stun attack, and sidestep defence.</p><p>For ki feats, Yoshiko has the powerful Contingency Plan, which can actually stop them from being removed and instead are placed out of the enemy's line of sight with all wounds healed by using the ki feat and passing an opposed ki test. She can also put scheme markers on nearby enemies at the end of her activations, and then remove them with the scheme ki feat that lets her recruit a permitted event card with a cost equal to the number of scheme tokens removed.</p><p>Yoshiko also has a 0-cost, once per turn, The Crowds Part ki feat that lets them move 2 inches. Enemies in base-to-base contact can spend 2 ki to stop it, but even that is very handy, either getting Yoshiko out of combat or burning 2 enemy ki. Finally, Yoshiko also lets you change the scenario target of a friendly VIM (Very Important Model) from the one selected to any with disguise. The model loses disguise, but it gives you control over the scenario target.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Shiho Kizo</h2><p>Kizo is my favorite release of this wave, a Ronin who plays into both my beloved Shiho Clan and Shadow Wind Clan. Kizo is not only a ninja, but also a samurai. Kizo's sculpt is covered in baby Karapan, and he comes with a 10-inch Karapling ranged attack with lightweight, so he doesn't suffer any modifications for moving and attacking with it. The attack doesn't need line of sight and ignores cover, can only be used once per turn, and instead of damage, gives a Bleed 2 marker to the target.</p><p>At the start of Kizo's activation, he can either heal 2 wounds on an animal in base-to-base contact or gain sixth sense until the end phase. When Kizo is recruited, it means that Shiho warbands can also recruit Karapan, and Shadow Wind warbands can recruit Ronin birds, both of which normally wouldn't be able to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Bushido Wave 25 Releases?</h2><p>There's a lot to love in Wave 25 of <em>Bushido</em> releases, and we've only covered 4 of the 13 miniatures that were released as part of it. The Temple of Ro-Kan did well with 3 releases in the wave, but there's a lot for most factions (with the Savage Wave and Awoken getting releases in the next wave, which is available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a>). I'm a fan of the Consequences Cycle Deck, mainly because it gave me a new theme for the Shiho clan, but there are some great cards for all factions here, and it will be interesting to see how the meta reacts in the next few months with this cycle deck and recent releases, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-bai-qian-themed-warband-review-for-emperor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Imperials</a> and aggressive <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-ring-of-fire-review-to-battle" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Savage Wave</a>.</p><hr><p>The copies of&nbsp;<strong>Bushido Products from Wave 25</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review were provided by GCT Studios and bought by the Author.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

Consider making Zephyr Town your new home!</p><p>Our delightful location offers invigorating year-round winds and boasts a world-famous market…which admittedly has fallen on hard times. We’re looking for a motivated individual to help us bring brighter days back to our breezy burg! We’ll even provide you with a farm to help bring local goods to wanting customers and show the world that Zephyr Town’s bazaar can still fly high.</p><p>Please contact Mayor Felix to make an appointment to visit today!

Raise animals, harvest crops, craft rare delicacies, then sell your wares at your very own stall in the bazaar. As the bazaar business grows, new goods and services will arrive, which you can use to improve your farm. Help return prosperity to the bazaar, and Zephyr Town will thrive once again!</p><p>Inspired by the classic handheld title, the new <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> builds up and improves on the original in every conceivable way. The world is bigger and more alive than ever thanks to incredible new visuals, new characters, expanded story, and full character voice work in story events—a series first. Take advantage of Zephyr Town’s unique weather, using the wind to make travel and farm tasks a breeze! The winds of change are coming to deliver your new life in <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em>.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cozy Living <a title="Games > Reach [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/reach">Reach</a>es New Heights</strong> – The magnificent beauty of Zephyr Town shines with gorgeous graphics while a richly voiced story carries the player on a rewarding journey of farming, friendship, and renewal.</li><li><strong>Ring the Bell and Sell, Sell, Sell</strong> – Your farm’s produce and goods take on additional importance as the heart of your business at the lively weekly bazaar. Customize your stall and take charge of your sales to build up buzz and power up profits.</li><li><strong>Take the Leap</strong> – Harness the power of the wind! Use windmills to create new products to sell, and effortlessly travel across the town on your glider. Use new jumping skills on your farm, or when exploring the town. You never know what you’ll find!</li><li><strong>A Beautifully Cozy Life</strong> – Enjoy a rich life amongst a colorful community of characters, from friendly townsfolk to magical Nature Sprites. Build yourself a home, grow relationships, and even find love and start a family.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-rated-for-ps5-xbox-series-in-taiwan]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps we can even expect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-yuri-lowenthal" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d0a3961-f7b9-4d4a-8bfd-9b72ce8d096a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Yuri Lowenthal to leak this one as well</a>!

<p>The one thing I wouldn't hold your breath for when it comes to this website is an announcement for <em>Persona 6</em>. Atlus is busy with the aforementioned <em>Persona 4 </em>remake, and the studio is also still celebrating <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e36e5f7f-aa76-4099-89f0-cc0de577a8fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the success</a> of its latest RPG <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>(although that, admittedly, is made by the newly-formed Studio Zero).</p><p>With that said, Atlus has said that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-director-no-plans-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eb30c86-5461-470b-923e-8c96fcd0675c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doesn't currently have plans</a> to expand <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>into a series, so it's possible that the focus has shifted towards <em>Persona</em> for now. If <em>Persona 6 </em>was to be announced, then the 30th anniversary celebrations for the franchise as a whole would seem an ideal time to do so.</p><p>In the meantime, while you wait for a <em>Persona 6 </em>announcement (or whatever Atlus has in store for the anniversary), you can celebrate the franchise's music thanks to the <em>Persona </em>concert tour <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-concert-us-january-date-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d8554b0-8365-410f-a8ba-d0bee07489a8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">making its way to the US in January</a>.</p><p>Back in September, the franchise also received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-music-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee0e73a-8716-4317-9058-a4d024355fa1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its first official music video</a> in the form of a clip for "It's Going Down Now", the iconic battle theme from 2024's <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Atlus plans to reveal as part of the <em>Persona </em>30th anniversary celebrations. Make sure to keep an eye on the website if you want to be the first to see it!</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Things to Expect From Pokémon in 2026]]></title>

<p>Pokémon mania continues to spread around the world, and 2026 is set to be a huge year for the franchise, which celebrates 30 years since the release of the first games in Japan.</p>



<p>In the three decades since, Pokémon has introduced over 1,000 creatures to catch and collect in video games, alongside thousands of anime episodes, full-length films, an extremely successful TCG, and countless spin-off titles.</p>



<p>With next year being such a landmark occasion for the Pokémon franchise, Insider Gaming has taken a look at what to expect from the company in 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-pokemon-in-2026">What to Expect From Pokémon in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New World Order. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-launches-a-new-series-of-games">Pokopia Launches a New Series of Games</h3>



<p>Due to launch on March 5, Pokopia is set to be the first Pokémon title to release in 2026, and the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive for the franchise—although there is a way to play on the original Switch.</p>



<p>The concept of a Pokémon version of an Animal Crossing-like game seems like a perfect match and if the title is as successful as it looks likely to be, it will likely spark the start of a new series of games.</p>



<p>Pokopia may feature Pokémon from a variety of generations, but it appears to be set in Kanto, with a post-apocalyptic theme leaked, which leaves the door open to adventures across even more regions in the future.</p>



<h3 id="h-30th-anniversary-tcg-set">30th Anniversary TCG Set</h3>



<p>A 30th anniversary TCG set for Pokémon is a surefire guarantee, with trademarks already registered in Japan. It doesn’t take a genius to predict them, as previous anniversaries saw the Celebrations set release in 2021, and Generations in 2016.</p>



<p>Exactly what Pokémon has up their sleeve remains to be seen, though they could opt to reprint classic cards once again. There are countless possibilities, however, and plenty of debate around what would be the best move for Pokémon<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>Either way, it’s a guaranteed money-spinner for the Pokémon franchise, particularly given the craziness in the market currently, which, sadly, doesn’t look likely to stop for a while.</p>



<h3 id="h-gen-10-releases-on-nintendo-switch-2">Gen 10 Releases on Nintendo Switch 2</h3>



<p>2026 will mark four years since the release of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, making it the longest gap between generation releases since Black and White were released in 2010, and the next generation of Pokémon<strong> </strong>is almost certain to arrive next year.</p>



<p>Pokémon Day 2026 would be the perfect time for the first reveal, and it seems likely to be when the first teaser will be shown, with a full release coming at the back-end of 2026 in a similar spot to where Legends: Z-A released this year.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for original Switch players, Gen 10 is likely to be the first main title released as a Switch 2 exclusive, setting a precedent for future releases to follow.</p>



<figure><figcaption>New generation. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-black-amp-white-remakes">Pokémon Black &amp; White Remakes</h3>



<p>Black and White are the next games in line for a remake, and were widely expected to be released this year, but Pokémon went quiet and, following on from the rather disappointing Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl in 2021, it could be that the entire approach has shifted.</p>



<p>Remakes of Gen 5 are inevitable at some point, however, and they’d be the perfect signing-off game for the Switch era, releasing on both the original console and Switch 2. </p>



<p>Black and White remakes in 2026 are far from a guarantee, however, as the aforementioned Gen 4 remake titles seem to have left a lasting impact, and not in a good way. That’s all for the best, though, as it’s better for time to be taken to hit the remakes in the way that Heart Gold and Soul Silver did, for example.</p>



<h3 id="h-more-pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansions">More Pokémon TCG Pocket Expansions</h3>



<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has achieved vast success in its first year since its initial release, and it’s only going to get bigger from here, which makes more expansions in the game in 2026 one of the easiest predictions to make.</p>



<p>TCG Pocket has moved into the Mega Evolution scene with the start of the ‘B’ sets, a trend likely to remain for the foreseeable future, but it’s already exciting to consider what could be on the horizon, considering the game has almost 30 years of TCG history to reflect back on for inspiration.</p>



<p>A 30th anniversary set in TCG Pocket seems to be a solid bet for sure, and there are plenty of options when Gen 10 comes around, too. </p>



<h3 id="h-another-pokemon-mobile-title">Another Pokémon Mobile Title</h3>



<p>A flurry of Pokémon titles have been released on mobile devices in recent years, including big hits like Pokémon Go, TCG Pocket, Cafe Remix, and more, so it isn’t hard to see another Pokémon title launch onto mobile in 2026.</p>



<p>It’s already been confirmed that Pokémon Champions will be released on mobile, but an entirely new game is possible. There are endless possibilities, with the ability to tie into existing games or offer something different entirely.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-lego-sets-make-a-wave">Pokémon LEGO Sets Make a Wave</h3>



<p>After an eternity of waiting, Pokémon and LEGO have finally partnered together, and the first sets from the huge collab will be released in 2026, but expect there to be a fight to secure them.</p>



<p>LEGO and Pokémon are both extremely popular hobbies, with both fanbases often having a fight to get the products they want, so don’t be surprised if you struggle to find any LEGO Pokémon products in your local store.</p>



<p>The good news is, LEGO is a lot better at making sure products are available long-term and in greater quantity than Pokémon’s TCG side, so it shouldn’t lead to a scalper frenzy.</p>

<figure data-uuid="499ad7b9a5819"><a title="Pokemon McDonald's" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/499ad7b9a5819/pokemon-mcdonalds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The 30th anniversary of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/pokemon_red_and_blue">Pokémon</a></strong> is fast approaching on 27th February 2026, and it seems McDonald's will be putting Pokémon cards in its Happy Meals in a new promo similar to past events.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-promotion-coming-to-the-u-s-for-franchises-30th-anniversary">a report from PokéBeach</a>, it will run from February into March, with exact dates depending on the country, but that's all the details known right now.</p>
<p>Past events — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/scalpers_and_collectors_buy_up_mcdonalds_pokemon_happy_meals">for the 25th anniversary, for example</a> — have seen scalpers rocking up to stores and buying <em>dozens</em> of Happy Meals to get the cards. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/04/mcdonalds_uk_plans_to_restrict_pokemon_happy_meal_toy_purchases">McDonald's in the UK</a> put a restriction on buying more than one extra card with your meal following the frenzy in the US, but that feels like trying to stop a geyser with a bathplug.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fvjqwmy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The Pokémon Company and Ronald have persevered, though - there was a Dragon-type collab <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-cards-soar-back-into-mcdonalds-uk-happy-meals">earlier in 2025</a>. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mcdonalds-japan-pulls-happy-meal-pokemon-cards-early-and-fans-blame-scalpers">back in August</a>, a three-day Pikachu event in Japan was stopped after 24 hours when demand for the card exceeded supply, with boxes of unopened cards turning up for sale online. <em>Shifty.</em> That one was particularly sought after, though, as the card featured exclusive artwork.</p>
<p>It's a shame that Pokémon cards just seem to attract a manic mix of the FOMO crowd (ask the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/van-gogh-museum-fires-four-employees-following-pokemon-collaboration">Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum</a>) and straight-up scalpers, bringing out the worst in people who <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/pokemon-scalpers-are-ignoring-tornado-warnings-just-to-nab-latest-card-collection">ignore tornado warnings</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/random-try-not-to-cringe-watching-this-video-of-a-pokemon-tcg-scalper">behave atrociously</a> to get their hands on fresh packs.</p>
<p>We'll see in February if TPC and McDonald's have any clever plans to combat the problem.</p>
