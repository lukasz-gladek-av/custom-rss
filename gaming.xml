            <p>Grand yet furtive robot action-adventure Steel Seed will launch on April 10th, developers <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/storm-in-teacup">Storm in a Teacup</a> and publishers ESDigital Games have announced. Not heard of Steel Seed before? You would've if I'd ever written up that demo build I played at last year's Game Developer Conference. I don't know why it's taken me this long to mention the game, given that it contains one of my favourite things in fiction: a machine the size of a world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Steel Seed you play Zoe, a nimble and upgradeable robot, and her flying drone acquaintance Koby. You're exploring a vast cybernetic undercity created by overclocked WALL-Es to preserve the last human survivors of a global apocalypse.</p>
<p>The overarching story is about "exploring the fine line between human and machine, trust and control, resilience and despair", but in the moment, Steel Seed is more about exploring the fine line between crouch-walk back-stabbing and open combat with electroswords and Koby's ranged attacks. Needless to say, you'll also be doing a lot of platforming: leaping to handholds, wall-running, sliding down ramps, all the classics.</p>

<p>I wasn't mesmerised by the jumpy-sneaky-slashy elements of the GDC 2024 build I played. It felt like a sturdy but essentially makeshift cobbling-together of parts from other action-adventures. I can't knock the environments, however, which consist of layer upon layer of unsleeping industrial machinery - gushing cyclopean smelters, sunset-sized reactor cores and turbiney wotsits made up of individually rotating and grippable sections.</p>
<p>The extra frisson of architectural intrigue is that Steel Seed takes a lot of inspiration from Tsutomu Nihei's Blame!, among other megacity mangas. I haven't read Blame!, so my nearest parallels are other video games - last year's superbly unaccommodating spelunking sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a>, and Ninja Theory's ageing Serkis 'em up <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west">Enslaved: Odyssey To The West</a>.</p>
<p>If you like the sounds of all this, but you're umming and erring over my indifference to the combat and stealth, the good news is that Steel Seed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/458430/Steel_Seed/">has a demo on Steam</a>. It includes the game's intro and gives you a taste of the robot-bashing and/or bamboozling ahead.

</p><p>Storm in a Teacup have form for moody sci-fi - their previous games include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/close-to-the-sun">Close To The Sun</a>, which Alice Bee (RPS in peace) found a little too Bioshlock in places but was otherwise quite pleased with. "Close To The Sun exists in a potential sweet spot for me, a mix of horror and leisurely exploration, and I enjoyed a lot of it," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/close-to-the-sun-review">wrote in our review</a>. "It excels at toying with you, particularly in the first half of the game, and paces itself so that you're constantly tense even when you have nothing to fear."</p>

He also credited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-update-will-add-a-lot-in-april/1100-6529750/" data-ref-id="1100-6529750">cross-play</a> with drawing many people to the game and getting them to stick around.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_wNFT4j6qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and sold 8 million copies during its first three days on the market.

"The story does provide some context to each hunt and monster but doesn't otherwise add anything meaningful," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpot's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> states. "Though Monster Hunter has never suffered for its barebones stories, Wilds' narrative focus draws arguably too much attention to a weak tale when a less-is-more approach would suffice."</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

<p>Katamari Damacy Mobile 2 (2012), Tap My Katamari (2016), and Amazing Katamari Damacy (2017) were all released on iOS. They were followed by the remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy Reroll</a> on Switch and PC in 2018 (later released on PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia in 2020) as well as its sequel We Love Katamari Reroll+ Royal Reverie in 2023 across PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The first game in the series, Katamari Damacy, was released in 2004 for the PS2 and was a surprise hit for its quirky gameplay where players roll a ball to collect elements from the world and gradually grow larger.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ai-powered-ugc-gaming-startup-liminal-experiences-raises-5-8m-in-seed-funding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Liminal Experiences, Inc is a brand-new UGC gaming startup that is dedicated to harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to help boost human-centered creativity. It's announced that it has raised $5.8 million to date in seed funding. Some of those who have backed the company are very large names in the games industry, including BITKRAFT Ventures, Riot Games, and OTK Media Group. The investors also include Marc Merrill, Founder of Riot Games.</p>
<p>Liminal is still currently in development and has a planned release for an Alpha in 2026, where it will transform creation into a game, where it will then make it possible for players to create their own RPG-style adventures from ideas, with AI handling all of the difficult parts. The AI tools will allow people to craft their own worlds as they see fit, as well as create their own characters, and even collaborate with friends to make a bigger adventure overall.</p>
<p>"AI in gaming is a sensitive topic, as many developers worry about <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-simpsons-voice-actor-believes-ai-will-replace-his-work/">being replaced</a>, and players grapple with its ethical issues," says Liminal Experiences Founder and CEO, Brendan Mulligan. "Wading into the debate is fraught, so most gaming companies avoid discussing AI while quietly exploring options internally. This leaves the public conversation to startups founded by tourists to the industry to pitch their vision of the future. There's a real need for studios willing to stand for a positive vision of an AI-enabled future, which should come from developers focused on unleashing, not replacing, human creativity."</p>
<p>Liminal will come with some key features to help it stand out from the sea of ongoing AI development tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation through play of 3D episodic adventure stories, no coding needed</li>
<li>Full building, decorating, and character editing systems</li>
<li>Easy quest creation and advanced gameplay editing</li>
<li>AI-powered storytelling assistance and game creation concierge</li>
<li>Seamless creation and sharing of adventures with 1-4 players</li>
</ul>
<p>While the website doesn't have much to offer thus far, there will be the option to sign up to be a <a href="https://liminal.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">play tester</a> of the new tool once it releases in Alpha in 2026.</p>
<p>With Liminal, Mulligan believes that this tool will ensure that the future of gaming is kept alive and fresh as players young and old will be able to discover their own creativity and put their stories into something playable for an audience, where creation becomes possible for anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>"A positive vision of the future should recognize the power of AI to ignite the imaginations of players of all ages, letting everyone realize the fantasy of making their own game experiences."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-studio-za-um-reveals-genre-defining-rpg-project-c4.1131114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZA/UM, the studio responsible for 2019's cult classic RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>(although it's fair to say there's a little more to it than that), has revealed its new game&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em>.</p>

<p>The studio describes the game as "a mind-warping story of espionage and team-building" which takes place in an "original yet achingly familiar setting", which might suggest the setting will bear some similarities to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s Revachol.</p>

<p><em>Project C4</em>'s debut trailer is characteristically vague and oblique, with a voiceover intoning vague lines like "my mind is eating itself" and "obliteration wears a rented suit" with a withering English twang. In fairness, this is a teaser trailer (and one made by ZA/UM, no less), so we probably shouldn't expect straightforward.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zaum-project-c4-conspiracies.jpg?itok=fFORnnmQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zaum-project-c4-conspiracies.jpg?itok=rjaik5SH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project C4&nbsp;</em>looks like a characteristically weird RPG from ZA/UM.</figcaption></figure><p>The opening words of the trailer confidently read "WE ARE ZA/UM" and "WE BROUGHT YOU&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>", but that's arguably only true up to a certain point.</p>

<p>Back in 2022,&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>lead designer Robert Kurvitz, along with art director Aleksander Rostov and writer Helen Hindpere, <a href="https://x.com/artofrostov/status/1576539500012240897" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that they were no longer a part of ZA/UM after it was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/report-i-disco-elysium-i-co-founders-ousted-from-developer-za-um" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the three had been quietly removed from the studio.</p>

<p>What followed is a lengthy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">winding story</a> of legal disputes and bitter recriminations, so ZA/UM saying that it's the studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>feels just a little bit audacious given that many of that game's key creative personnel are no longer there.</p>

<p>Additionally, in early 2024, ZA/UM was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-developer-zaum-confirms-game-cancellation-and-layoffs" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>, with the studio also canceling one of its in-development game projects (which was reportedly a standalone&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>expansion).</p>




<p>Since then, a number of ex-<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developers have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">founded their own studios</a> and announced their own games, many of which bear at least superficial similarities to the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>formula.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether&nbsp;<em>Project C4&nbsp;</em>will itself be similar to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, but since ZA/UM reminds us of that game's existence in the first few seconds of the trailer (and describes&nbsp;<em>C4&nbsp;</em>as "the next genre-defining RPG" from the studio), it's a safe bet it will.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what's in store for us when it comes to <i>Project C4</i>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-repo-down-server-status-explained/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-repo-down-on-steam-pc-server-status-explained.1131102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-repo-down-server-status-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>REPO is an online-only game, meaning the age-old issue of server issues comes up. Servers are a constant factor and it doesn’t matter if it’s a AAA title or a low-budget indie hit. If you’re experiencing connection issues with REPO’s server status, let’s see if there’s a reason why.</p>



<p>It’s incredible how a title can become a hit so quickly. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-players-can-play-repo-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> launched in February 2025 and amassed a healthy following of a few thousand players. This is a feat many indie developers would kill for. REPO cleared 100,000 concurrent players within two weeks, and its peak reached nearly 150K very quickly.</p>



<p>This is great news for developer semiwork, but it also places a lot of strain on the servers. If you’re being impeded by said servers, let’s try to clear up why it’s happening.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-repo-servers-down-right-now">Are REPO Servers Down Right Now?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing suspicious here. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>REPO is currently operational for many players right now.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, I’ve been on various Twitch channels, and streamers are broadcasting live gameplay from REPO. However, if you are having trouble, it might be connected to the <strong>North American servers</strong>.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://discord.com/channels/303947656789622787/303947656789622787/1348850542553595965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pinny on the REPO Discord server</a> had this to say about the server issues: “If you are getting large connection issues, <strong>please check for Steam client updates which should hopefully update Steam</strong> and help make playing with friends possible again make sure both you and your friends have done this!”</p>



<p>They continue to say you should “Try taking turns hosting between you and your group” as “<strong>NA servers are especially affected at the moment</strong> so if you have friends living elsewhere, try having them host!”</p>



<p>It’s not necessarily the overall servers then, but individual aspects of the connection. My advice would be to try Pinny’s recommendations and see if this alleviates any issues for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-repo-server-status">How to Check REPO Server Status</h2>



<p><strong>Joining the official REPO Discord server and checking socials and the website are the best ways to keep up with the latest server status developments.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll find EA and Activision have dedicated websites showing live server reports. This isn’t as feasible for lesser-known companies, so I recommend safe sources related to the developer.</p>



<p>You can find each method below with accessible links:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://discord.com/channels/303947656789622787/303947656789622787/1348850542553595965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">REPO Discord Server</a></li>



<li><a href="https://x.com/semiworkstudios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">REPO X page</a></li>



<li><a href="https://semiwork.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Semiwork website</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you need a break from REPO and want to see what else is in the pipeline, make sure to read about the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-horror-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest horror games coming in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>REPO has the potential to outdo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lethal-company-coming-fortnite-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company</a> and many of its contemporaries. If you’ve played it, why do you think it’s taking off? Can it go one better and achieve Among Us levels of fame and fortune?</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Chrono Trigger is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, March 11, 2025. Below, we explore how its innovative New Game Plus feature set it apart as an all-time classic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">I spent almost an entire summer vacation repeatedly replaying Chrono Trigger. At the peak of the dog days, when I was content to stay indoors with the air conditioning (and my parents were content to let me), I was completing a full playthrough every few days. This was a welcome proposition thanks to New Game Plus, which still stands as a major part of Chrono Trigger's legacy and a critical, irremovable piece of its brilliant design.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger was not the first game to feature an optional way to continue playing after beating the game. Other games, like The Legend of Zelda, featured second quests or post-credits challenges. But Chrono Trigger did coin the term New Game Plus, and it popularized the idea as it's currently understood. As opposed to an extra challenge for those who had mastered the game, Chrono Trigger's NG+ allowed you to start the game again with all of your experience, skills, and any items or equipment that wasn't critical to the plot. Rather than challenge you to complete a second quest with your newfound mastery, it rewarded you by making the game easier and faster--a breezy romp through a story you already knew and probably loved.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457654" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457654"></a><figcaption>New Game Plus in Chrono Trigger | Image credit: Thonky.com</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to understand this innovation in its context. Before we were awash in too many games to count or those indefinitely expanding with new content, most of us were replaying relatively short single-player games regularly. RPGs were a heavier lift, because they demanded so much of your time. Replaying an RPG wasn't unheard of, but it was a commitment. Squaresoft cleverly found a simple way to remove the high time and commitment barrier and allow players to play RPGs over again easily.</p><p dir="ltr">Put simply, Square recognized that persistent progression is a major component in our enjoyment of RPGs. Unlike a game like Super Mario World, which is primarily about playing and testing platforming skills, RPG players form close connections with their parties and builds, from their chosen skills to equipment to decisions and relationships. Shaking the Etch-a-Sketch clean just feels different for an RPG, and while it can certainly be enjoyable to start an RPG over with a completely fresh slate, it can be even more satisfying to keep your powerful characters intact and breeze through encounters that previously gave you some trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger was an especially great testing ground for this novel concept. The time-traveling RPG famously sported <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Chrono_Trigger_endings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple endings</a>. These were based primarily on your decision of when and how to confront Lavos, an ancient evil that laid in wait, infesting the world for millions of years before ushering in doomsday in the distant future. To even attempt to take on Lavos early would require a party advanced well past the point that would be realistic for players to have early in the game. Jumping throughout time and experimenting with engaging Lavos at different points was both a plot payoff and only functionally possible through New Game Plus.</p><p>The multiple endings were a major draw meant to support multiple playthroughs, as many of them gave you a better understanding of the world and its events, the unfortunate consequences of action or inaction, and the many ultimate destinies of its cast. Some characters' fates were immutable no matter what you did. Others could be changed in small ways that impacted their lives. Still others could have major ramifications on the world. Seeing all of these timelines intertwined and in communication with each other makes the whole experience richer and more textured. The New Game Plus feature was an important tool, making it hassle-free to keep experimenting and discovering new possibilities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsflIgDpvhQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsflIgDpvhQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>On a metatextual level, the time-traveling conceit implied, even if it did not overtly recognize, the idea of cyclical patterns. Perhaps the new Crono whose mom woke him up to meet his friend at the Millennial Fair really had lived a thousand lives before and become a powerful warrior ready to defeat a world-ending alien. It makes a certain degree of intuitive sense even if the story doesn't directly call attention to it.</p><p dir="ltr">And like the best platforming games, the flexibility of the system allowed players to invent their own fun. The heady summer I spent replaying Chrono Trigger, I set the goal to keep replaying until I had a full array of Prism armor for every character--an extremely powerful and limited item that can only be obtained once per playthrough. Achieving that goal may not have been necessary, but it felt uniquely satisfying in a way that was only made possible by New Game Plus.</p><p dir="ltr">While Chrono Trigger deserves plaudits as the game to coin and popularize New Game Plus as a mechanic, it has also retained its title as one of the best examples of it, even decades later. Many games have been content to offer the option to replay with your gear intact, but Chrono Trigger had the vision to weave it into the narrative and make it an integral part of the experience. Playing it two or more times isn't an optional nice-to-have; it's core to the designers' intent.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger is an impeccably designed RPG in many ways, from the lovable characters and beautiful art design to its stirring score. It certainly deserves to be remembered for all of those reasons and more. But perhaps the reason it stands out in the collective memories of so many RPG fans of my generation is because it was the first game of its kind to invite us to experience all of those elements over and over again, strengthening our memories and creating new ones every time.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Some hardcore PC game genres have had a renaissance in recent years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> reinvigorated love for the CPRG, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> tapped into a communal love for hardcore first-person RPGs that hadn't been satiated in a while. Not all classic PC gaming genres have been so lucky. We've yet to see a new stealth-tactics game like Commandos or a dungeon management game like Dungeon Keeper become a breakout hit. That's not for lack of trying, as games like Desperados 3 and Evil Genius 2: World Domination have kept the legacy of these genres going, albeit in a way that has stayed niche. Kuuasema's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cthulhu-keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-663255">Cthulhu Keeper</a> aims to resurrect these struggling genres and become that surprise success.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper is a real-time tactics game split into two parts: One half sees players building up their home base of operations and defending it from intruders, while the other sees the player command cultists and Lovecraftian monsters with special abilities to complete stealth missions. I had the chance to go hands-on with Cthulhu Keeper exclusively following its reveal last month, and I found it to be an entertaining hybrid of those classic PC game genres.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuZ7OQEMCk8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LuZ7OQEMCk8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The version of Cthulhu Keeper I played didn't have much narrative content, although the eldritch theming still emanated from everything I played. There's no shortage of Lovecraftian video games out there, but the distinct perspective of Cthulhu Keeper helps it stand out. As I hear my subjects say, "Yes, master" after I give them commands during stealth missions and slowly amass power by building my cult's compound, I feel like a puppet master in the way Cthulhu and other horrors often are in Lovecraftian tales.</p><p dir="ltr">That vibe remains strong when I'm commanding minions within my cult compound, digging out areas so I can build altars, libraries, and other structures to increase my power and defend against potential intruders. Then, when intruders arrived--they ranged from genuine snoopers to a lovey-dovey couple who ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time--I could see everything I built work in harmony to keep those invaders at bay.</p><p dir="ltr">Management games like Two Point Museum are good fun, but I appreciate how Cthulhu Keeper is more in tune with the gameplay loop that made Dungeon Keeper such a classic. This cult compound gameplay is the backbone of Cthulhu Keeper, but building defenses or earning upgrades does require resources. To earn those resources, I had to venture out and complete stealth missions around the world. This part of Cthulhu Keeper is what plays more like Commandos, or contemporary examples like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/desperados-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-486056">Desperados 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sumerian-six/" data-ref-id="5000-631984">Sumerian Six</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457636" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457636"></a><figcaption>Cthulhu Keeper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stealth missions took two different forms. There are story missions that serve as the set piece levels, while expeditions were mini-roguelite runs where I had to strategically get my units through a series of smaller encounters as unscathed as possible. I love stealth-tactics games because they reward my smart planning but also require me to think on my toes based on how enemies react to my actions.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper does not reinvent this style of gameplay; I still have to delicately choose where to place my units to navigate around enemy vision cones and smartly utilize each unit's abilities to kill enemies or open up opportunities to move past a unit without getting spotted. Player units are fragile, so I wasn't successful in Cthulhu Keeper whenever I tried to run and gun through a scenario.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lovecraftian twists Cthulhu Keeper applies to this tried-and-true formula do provide a unique flair within the stealth-tactics space. When I started missions, I only had one unit to command: Lilith West, a corrupted neurobiologist. Lilith could stealthily kill an enemy just fine, but she doesn't have much in the way of offensive abilities. Instead, her skills focused on increasing the number of units at my disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">After killing an enemy, I could harvest their corpse to get an eyeball or choose to reanimate them. The former would allow me to see an enemy's vision cone and surroundings even if they were out of my sightline, while the latter would create a whole new unit I could use to attack enemies or damage the sanity of civilians scattered throughout each level. Once I terrified a civilian, I could have Lilith use her Enlighten ability to turn them into a unit under my command.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457637" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457637"></a><figcaption>Cthulhu Keeper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These units couldn't kill enemies but were useful for scouting areas or temporarily stunning enemies so I could get past them. Occasionally, I would encounter a pylon in a level and destroy it to summon eldritch monsters. These monsters were the units that could tear through enemy forces, but even then, I had to carefully manage their health to ensure they did not die. That was particularly tough in the lengthy story mission, as I could no longer rely on quickly running to an encounter's exit to move on.</p><p dir="ltr">Even from this light smattering of encounters, I'm already enjoying the stealth-tactics part of Cthulhu Keeper as much as I enjoy games like Desperados 3. When a game juggles two different genres of gameplay, it risks becoming a jack of all trades but a master of none. I did not get that feeling while playing Cthulhu Keeper, as I found it to provide equally polished and engaging takes on stealth-tactics and dungeon-defending gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also a solid entry point to both of these hardcore genres. The menus and currencies required to build out the cult compound aren't overly complex. Meanwhile, the bite-sized encounters of expeditions should make learning the intricacies of stealth tactics less overwhelming and reliant on save-scumming. Cthulhu Keeper could reanimate PC gaming genres that have struggled to have a breakout hit in recent years, Lovecraftian-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper is in development for PC. A public playtest for the game will begin on March 17.</p>

They're ex-triple A, bootstrapping their dream game, getting lots of verbal praise from potential funding partners but no hard cash. The team decided to turn to Kickstarter before their 2024 studio debut, but after the announcement went wide (and they scored a cool 200,000 wishlists on Steam in the process), they realized Kickstarter might not just be a last-ditch effort to find funding—it could be the best way possible to bring </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to life.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-indie-nearstudios-founded-by-ex-bethesda-bioware-and-naughty-dog-devs" target="_self" data-discover="true">New indie, NEARstudios founded by ex Bethesda, Bioware and Naughty Dog devs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hawthorn"><span>Hawthorn</span> hits with players, but not with funders</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cerlan and Richardson had different paths to the game that became </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Richardson's been stewing on the idea of a "cozy" co-op game for some time. In his days at Funcom he'd search for games that he could play with his wife, his kids, and his friends, but nothing hit all three groups. Iron Gate Studios' survival crafting game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valheim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was a close match, but it wasn't quite what he was looking for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Richardson's spent years in the world of multiplayer game design, and began noodling on a woodland creature co-op game that would fit his family. Elsewhere, Cerlan was dreaming about striking out on her own with a new game studio making games that bring people together, and as she and Richardson compared notes, they realized they were on the same wavelength.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players create characters based on several woodland animals, each with different affinities and weaknesses (owls can easily fly, otters take to the water, mice to the fields, etc). The diversified roles let people with different playstyles play together, and the woodland-themed vibe (inspired by the likes of Redwall, Watership Down, Beatrix Potter, etc.) is meant to stand out from the rest of the survival genre, which tends to tack toward </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite-</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">adjacent cartoon characters, pixel art aesthetics, or hardcore grittiness inspired by the likes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rust</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p>Image via NEARstudios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NEARstudios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair spoke about how "nostalgia" was a key theme for the team, but it definitely seems to be nostalgia with an edge. To a woodland creature, corn stalks are as tall as trees, rivers can be as big as lakes, and predators the size of titanic beasts—building a home in the forest can feel like carving a safe haven against the pounding rain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a vibrant pitch—one that hits with players (Cerlan described pitching her game to prospective fans at TwitchCon and MAGFest, and feeling relieved when their faces lit up at the premise—but never that quite clicked with investors. The gap in enthusiasm was confusing, to say the least. Maybe it's because their team of ex-triple A workers is assembled from rank-and-file devs, not studio or creative leads?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe, said Cerlan. "We were the people on the ground floor, the cogs in the wheel," she said. "I don't know how much that played a factor in us trying to get funding, but on the flip side that was really, really good because we had a team of folks that could get in the editor and do the work."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because they could all "do the work," Richardson said they kicked open the door with a more robust gameplay preview than he's seen from other venture-backed studios. "I've heard stories from other startups that had money, or had vision, or had executives, but just didn't have gameplay," he said. Those studios struggled to find the "soul" of their game—but as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s debut showed, NEARstudios seems to have found something that clicks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The nitty gritty of pivoting to Kickstarter">The nitty gritty of pivoting to Kickstarter</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't just take the 200k wishlist stat as a sign of life for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Cerlan recalled the day the video went wide, waiting for the embargo to break—and a feeling of anxiety as few outlets picked the story up (sorry guys, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/new-indie-nearstudios-founded-by-ex-bethesda-bioware-and-naughty-dog-devs">we needed a few hours</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). But stories did drop throughout the day, and shortly after, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@madmorph/video/7424205573320625440">videos from content creators followed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Scan the comments of videos about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and you'll find frothing enthusiasm for the game's similarities to Brian Jacques' Redwall book series (and yet not a "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Eulalia">Eulalia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">!" in sight...). Here, Cerlan had to fess up: she hasn't read Redwall, though it's an inspiration for other NEARstudios employees like Richardson and community manager Daniel Warren.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But hard work always comes after days of heady player praise, and for NEARStudios, that work came in the form of expanding what will go into their Kickstarter. First, they had to field surprise interest from publishers. Now that they'd landed wishlists and a few thousand views across TikTok, YouTube, and beyond, maybe they were a more appealing catch than before?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Possibly—but the pitches they received didn't reflect it. Richardson and Cerlan expressed frustration that the publishers who'd reached out offered what seemed to be very unfavorable terms. Certainly nothing that offered more stability than Kickstarter would.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expanding a Kickstarter's scope isn't just about updating pitch documents and stretch goals. Marketing plans need ironing out, budget tiers have to be set, and maybe most importantly, the cost of backer awards needs to be assessed. Several Kickstarter creators have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/kickstarter-physical-backer-rewards-can-add-complications">pointed out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the amount of revenue you pull in from a campaign isn't just slashed by taxes and the platform cut, it's neutered by how much you spend on backer rewards.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Cerlan said the studio's still working on those challenges, but they came armed with key advantages. First, they've spent the entirety of development not just building content but assessing what kind of game they can produce at different budgets. As experts like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-finji-ceo-bekah-saltsman-would-update-about-her-gdc-talk-on-indie-pitching">Finji CEO Rebekah Saltsman</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have explained, it's best for devs seeking funding to plan out what they can accomplish at different budget tiers. "We have a $6 million budget, we have a $3 million budget, and we have a $1.5 million budget," Cerlan explained. It's a jumping off point for establishing what the team can accomplish if it hits the campaign's base goal—and then what's physically possible with the ascending stretch goals.</span></p><p>Image via NEARstudios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Image via NEARstudios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the topic of backer rewards—the pair admitted they needed expert help here. One NEARstudios employee is a former senior finance manager at Zenimax (the Microsoft-owned parent company of Bethesda Softworks, where Cerlan and Richardson were both previously employed). "That's our biggest concern, being able to deliver what we say we're going to be able to deliver," said Cerlan. "You're really putting almost your entire roadmap out for the public to see, and that's terrifying because development is hard."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And then there's one final twist with going to Kickstarter. The upside of Kickstarter is that your players can fund development directly in exchange for pre-ordering the game (and maybe picking up a few goodies for an extra purchase). For a multiplayer game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it also helps to have an excited batch of players ready to leap in and build a landing pad for newcomers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem is when your game launches, you already have their money, and not many will plan to double dip—so your launch sales have to attract a healthy amount of new players, or you've essentially cashed in your chips early. "Our hope is that this game is broadly appealing enough that like, Kickstarter is just going to be like a drop in the bucket," said Cerlan.

They set out to make their dream game right when investment funding dried up. They pitched, and pitched, and pitched, but got nothing or worse than nothing back from partners. And now with time running out, they're looking at funding opportunities that let them speak directly to players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a hell of a gamble—but sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Dkc0RZ8Ym1Y?si=SnqeXdMxPrPf_uMy">you have to roll the hard six</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NEARstudios' journey also invites the industry to think about what it means that Kickstarter and other platforms help developers raise funding that "they wouldn't get from publishers or investors." In 2012, that statement was a question of logistics as much as it was company strategy or taste. In 2025 it has a more glaring meaning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">]It makes me think of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/blockchain-tech-not-the-metaverse-was-the-talk-of-this-year-s-dice">an exchange I witnessed</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> between an investor and an indie game dev at a DICE Mixer in 2022. "I'm looking for funding," the indie dev explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Are you making any blockchain games?" the investor replied. I wouldn't even say he was being cynical—he was soliciting a sincere pitch. Yet for all his cheerfulness, a dour mood fell on the group.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this year's DICE conference I happened to pass that same investor taking a meeting at the Aria Starbucks. The developer he'd spoken with three years prior was also at the event, still searching for funding. Would that conversation look different now? Was this investor's portfolio more diversified, with a number of small-to-medium sized investments sitting alongside the AI slush?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maybe—or maybe not, if all the conversations I had with a number of talented devs were anything to go by. So many had stories like NEARstudios'. Pitch after pitch after pitch, only to receive mild praise or underbaked offers in return. There's sturm and drang about needing to make "safe bets" but it's funny how "safe bets" still look like millions of dollars poured into the same kinds of companies they spent the last half-decade swinging and missing with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Richardson and Cerlan aren't former Zenimax executives or fabled creative directors. They're people who make games. And they and others like them are turning to Kickstarter not just out of a sense they can speak directly to players, but because they've been turned away by those with the keys to the cash vaults. If the Kickstarter boom pays off—if they, Frogwares, Playable Worlds, and other studios find success on the platform—it should be seen as a mark of shame on the financing world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Are games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hawthorn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> really such a huge risk? A few million dollars to deliver a woodland creature fantasy that's been the backbone of literature for centuries? Does our industry really believe great games can only come from people who held senior roles at financially successful juggernauts? When I check in with teams like NEARstudios, I worry they're fighting to survive in an industry isn't just bored of creativity, but downright hostile to it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "soul" of Hawthorn, as Richardson put it, is that it's a game about small creatures with different specialties banding together to not just take down beasts, but to support one another and build a thriving community in a hostile world. May we all root for the mice, the otters, the owls, and the snakes trying to survive and thrive in these stormy times.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s next crossover is with Crocs, the ugly clog brand whose socks-and-sandals sense of fashion can now be seen on every high street.
</p>
<p>
Starting tonight, at Fortnite's next shop refresh, you'll be able to snap up a set of classic Crocs for 1000 V-Bucks (£7). These digital shoes can then be worn by most in-game skins, customising their look.
</p>
<p>
Several different pairs of Crocs will be available, and they come with the option to disable their "Jibbitz" - the accessories you can buy and snap into the Crocs' holes.

<p>
Fortnite first began flogging virtual shoes last year, and has so far offered a few dozen Nike and Adidas trainer varieties, as well as a smattering of original designs. (I bought the Meowscles slippers, and know I'm part of the problem.)
</p>
<p>
Would it be funny to see Peely the Banana dressed in Crocs? Possibly. Should you spend £7 of your money on this? I leave that judgement call up to you.
</p>
<p>
In other Fortnite news, today's big update sees Black Market backrooms open up with access to Exotic items. The game has also briefly resurrected <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/getaway">The Getaway</a>, its pretty fun heist-themed Limited Time Mode from a few years back that you can play in Duos or Squads in Zero Build or with building enabled.
</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sued-for-deceptive-practices-employed-on-a-massive-scale">Epic Games responded to a newly-proposed class-action lawsuit that alleged it operated Fortnite's in-game store using "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO"</a> in regards to its store items. "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates," Epic Games said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/control-update-will-add-hdr-and-ps4-exclusive-mission-for-all-platforms.1131069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/control-update-will-add-hdr-and-ps4-exclusive-mission-for-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a big update for Remedy Entertainment’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control">Control</a>, available now on PC and coming soon to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, that is bringing graphical improvements like HDR support, and making a previously PlayStation exclusive mission available for all platforms.</p>
<p>Available now on Steam and Epic, and with the GOG version to follow later, PC gamers are now able to take advantage of HDR support, 10-bit SDR support, support for up to 48:9 monitors – a ridiculously wide ratio – and a new Ultra ray tracing preset that increases the number of rays per pixel and gives higher temporal stability.</p>


<p>That last point goes hand in hand with, not only much better GPUs than were available in 2019, but also greater DLSS support. This has been updated to DLSS 3.7, includes DLAA support for more anti-aliasing and other tweaks and fixes. While it is possible to mod games with DLSS support to use AMD’s most recent FSR 4 instead, it would be good to see native support for FSR 4 down the line.</p>
<p>Additionally, all players will now have access to the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, which features voiceover by Hideo Kojima. Previously exclusive to the PS4 Digital Deluxe version of Control, anyone can now play it by picking up the first Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in&nbsp; the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector.</p>
<p>A subset of all this will be coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of Control Ultimate Edition. HDR and improved SDR colour range will be the baseline improvement, but we could also see more bespoke PS5 Pro support with ray tracing enhancements. That would be pretty neat.</p>

<p>Remedy note that it’s a small team working on supporting this game, os they’re taking things slowly to avoid introducing bugs and problems as much as possible.</p>
<h3>OUTFITS</h3>
<p>The following outfits are now available to all players. The outfits can be accessed and equipped from the Control Point in the Central Executive Sector area.</p>
<p>Astral Dive Suit (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
Tactical Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)<br>
Urban Response Gear (formerly a pre-order exclusive)</p>
<h3>MISSIONS</h3>
<p>All players will receive the mission Dr. Yoshimi Tokui’s Guided Imagery Experience, featuring voiceover by Hideo Kojima. The mission is playable when you pick up the Dr Tokui Tapes collectible in the Extrasensory Lab of the Research Sector. (This mission was previously exclusive to the PlayStation 4 Digital Deluxe version of Control.)</p>
<h3>GRAPHICS</h3>
<p>Added HDR support<br>
Added new Ultra ray tracing preset, which gets you more rays per pixel and higher temporal stability<br>
Added ultrawide monitor support for up to 48:9 monitors<br>
Added an FOV scaling setting for the gameplay camera<br>
Updated SDR to 10bit (from 8bit), which reduces visible color banding<br>
Improved graphics adapter detection at startup, with automatic selection between DX11 and DX12<br>
Implemented screen aspect ratio fixes for ultrawide monitors<br>
Your current monitor resolution can now reliably be selected from the screen resolution and rendering resolution menus<br>
Added rendering resolution support beyond 4K<br>
Implemented texture streaming fixes<br>
Ray tracing bug fixes</p>
<h3>DLSS SUPPORT</h3>
<p>Added DLSS support for arbitrary resolutions<br>
Added DLAA support<br>
Updated DLSS to DLSS 3.7, with higher temporal stability<br>
Film grain added back to DLSS SR<br>
Fixed shadow resolution when DLSS is enabled<br>
Added resolution dependent mip map bias for DLSS. This enhances texture quality, for example when applying the DLSS Performance setting.</p>
<h3>GENERAL</h3>
<p>Updated the audio on cinematics and end credits to remove unintended channel mixing. You will no longer hear anything that isn’t intended to be heard. (It wasn’t the Hiss, it was us. Sorry.)<br>
Several bug and crash fixes</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wargaming-announces-steel-hunters-early-access-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steel-hunters-is-wargamings-new-mech-themed-hero-shooter/">Wargaming</a> has announced that the original IP Steel Hunters, an upcoming free-to-play mech hero shooter, will be releasing in Early Access on April 2, 2025. This title is set to blend Battle Royale elements with Extraction mechanics and features a player-first philosophy. This Early Access phase will be beneficial to the development of Steel Hunters and will allow the community to get involved and have a say in the development of the game through their feedback. To ensure the community is kept in the loop, the developers will release information and insights as the game nears the Early Access period. To celebrate the Early Access date announcement, a brand-new trailer on the Steel Hunters YouTube channel gives you a tiny glimpse into the heart-pounding action.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wargaming is the award-winning mind behind World of Tanks and World of Warships and is now trying something a bit out of its usual style of game to bring a new mech hero shooter named Steel Hunters. However, there is no saying how well this game will perform as of yet, especially in an oversaturated market of Battle Royales and hero shooters, such as Overwatch 2, Marvel Rivals, and Fortnite, to name a few key competitors.</p>
<p>However, Steel Hunters is set to stand out from the crowd by being a thrilling mech power fantasy where you get to control mechanical giants named Hunters, and take part in non-stop action-packed battles, where there will be a variety of objectives and tasks for you to complete on the battlefield to ensure that you level up and can acquire new gear to improve your mech.</p>
<p>Each Hunter available in the game has its own unique playstyle, ability kits, and progression systems that will provide you with the opportunity to create strategies and tactics that allow you to eliminate the opponent as you all race towards the extraction point.</p>
<p>The roster will consist of characters such as Razorside, Heartbreaker, Fenris, Ursus, Trenchwalker, Prophet and Weaver, all of which have their own unique abilities that can turn them into a powerhouse on the battlefield, where you'll be able to fight it out for glory on battlegrounds such as Crimson Ridge, Maryland Heights and Stonecutter Keep. You'll be battling it out against five other duo teams, and only one will be able to extract from the Hunting Grounds.</p>
<p>Those interested in playing Steel Hunters will be able to do so on April 2, 2025, on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://wargaming.net/en/wgc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wargaming Game Center</a>, depending on your preference.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>World of Warships&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;World of Tanks&nbsp;</i>developer Wargaming has announced the Early Access release date for its upcoming PvPvE mech shooter&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 2nd "after three years of relentless development". The game will include "the core gameplay mechanics, maps, Hunters, and progression systems" necessary for "a strong starting point", according to Wargaming.</p>

<p>The developer is promising that the game will evolve with the input of its community; in an accompanying Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1691340/view/516329641817933073" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Wargaming says it intends to "refine and expand the game together" with the player base, "ensuring every shot fired and every Hunter unleashed is finely tuned".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date-mechs.jpg?itok=0agCnVZQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steel-hunters-early-access-release-date-mechs.jpg?itok=-Ej4FXhD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Steel Hunters</em>' Early Access release is set for April.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather uniquely, Wargaming also says it doesn't want&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>to be stuck in Early Access for a protracted period of time. The studio says the Early Access period "won't be a drawn-out process" and that the goal is to "move quickly to a full release" once feedback has helped to "polish the core experience".</p>

<p>Wargaming says it will share more information about how&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>' Early Access period will unfold in the future, but for now, the game is set for an April release. It'll be free-to-play as well.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters</em>, it's a mech shooter that takes place after a "cataclysmic event" leads mankind to create robots called Hunters to protect caches of Starfall, a new resource "crucial to human survival".</p>

<p>Of course, things don't quite work out, and before long, Hunters led by different factions are doing battle with one another in order to secure the precious Starfall bounty they need to ensure their prosperity.</p>




<p>The game will feature multiple different Hunter playstyles with different "destructive weapons, gear, mods, and abilities" to discover, and as well as quick reflexes, you'll also have to exhibit "sound tactics" to win.</p>

<p>If you checked out the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">hugely popular demo for mech shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mecha-break-demo-player-count-300k" rel="nofollow">Mecha Break</a>&nbsp;</em>back in February and enjoyed it, then this one may well be right up your alley too.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Steel Hunters&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 2nd.</p>

They confirmed that the studio has been working on the new project for about three years now and said one of the main things that will differentiate it from other RPGs is making failure “a joy in itself” rather than something players want to save-scum their way out of. The duo also cited John le Carré and his thriller<em> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em> as one of the inspirations for the game, but didn’t share many specifics on what the game’s actually about or how it will play. </p><p>Most notably, the pair did not take questions and only vaguely referenced the ongoing issues facing ZA/UM, which is a very different studio than it was five years ago after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-robert-kurvitz-suing-za-um-rpg-amazon-1849693328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-robert-kurvitz-suing-za-um-rpg-amazon-1849693328">layoffs, firings, and departures</a></span> of some of the core team that made <em>Disco Elysium</em>, including creator Robert Kurvitz, art director Aleksander Rostov, and writer Helen Hindpere.

Failing forward seems to be one of those things we here at ZA/UM excel at,” Ashilevi said during the <em>[C4]</em> presentation. The game, whatever it turns out to be, seems to thematically echo many of the studio’s troubles. “Betrayal is only possible in the presence of love,” Sinamäe said of the project’s spycraft storytelling. The team is planning to present more information about the upcoming game at GDC later this week. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Asus has announced its new lineup of monitors with a special ability to purify surrounding air. The lineup of new VU Air Ionizer monitors features three models: the 23.8-inch IPS panel Asus VU249HFI-W, the 27-inch IPS Asus VU279HFI-W, and the 34-inch VA Asus VU34WCIP-W.</p>



<p>These monitors feature a no-filter VU Air Ionizer that Asus says can “remove up to 90% of airborne dust in three hours” to remove various allergens and improve general indoor air quality. </p>

<p>“The ionizer has an effective coverage area of 1m³,&nbsp;purifying&nbsp;air throughout&nbsp;a&nbsp;workspace for comfortable productivity,” <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-vu-air-ionizer-monitors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Asus said</a>. “With no filters&nbsp;required, ASUS VU Air Ionizer series&nbsp;monitors&nbsp;seamlessly combine air purification and&nbsp;cutting-edge&nbsp;display technologies in one streamlined design.”</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Monitor</th><th>Size and Ratio</th><th>Resolution</th><th>Refresh Rate</th><th>Panel Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Asus VU249HFI-W</td><td>23.8-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU279HFI-W</td><td>27-inch/16:9</td><td>1920×1080</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>IPS</td></tr><tr><td>Asus VU34WCIP-W</td><td>34-inch/21:9</td><td>3440×1440</td><td>100Hz VRR</td><td>Vertical Alignment</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>As far as specs are concerned, each monitor—no matter the size—has a 100Hz refresh rate with a 1ms response time. Both the 23.8- and 27-inch displays have an IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel with 178° viewing angles. The 34-inch monitor is a 21:9 ultrawide VA (Vertical Alignment) panel with the same 178° viewing angles. The two 16:9 displays have a brightness of 250 nits while the 21:9 Ultrawide has a brightness of 300 nits. </p>



<p>For pricing, the 23.8-inch starts at $129.99 while the 27-inch display will cost $159.99. If you decide you want the Ultrawide air purifier, it will cost $359.99.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In less than two weeks, a new cooperative horror game called REPO on Steam has gone from 7,000 concurrent players to hitting over 145,000 users on Valve's platform (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3241660/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>). To call the online-multiplayer experience a surprise hit is probably an understatement. This is only the second title from developer Semiwork, which previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304680/Voidigo/" rel="nofollow ">Voidigo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">REPO</a>re stands for retrieve, extract, and profit operation. As such, up to six people work together in the online cooperative game to attain valuable items as quietly as possible. That's easier than it sounds in the physics-based horror game, especially in a group setting with a "grabbing tool." But there are monsters listening and waiting to make everything even more chaotic.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OQ-kPtObmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="176">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1OQ-kPtObmQ?start=176" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Semiwork has called the burst in popularity for REPO "quite the experience," as it's the first time the studio has utilized the Unity engine as well as made an online multiplayer game. The developer is busy with new features, enemies, and levels for the horror game--as well as addressing bugs. Additionally, Semiwork is trying to figure out the best way to address hackers without implementing anti-cheat systems, since that could negatively affect players using mods.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, a couple of fun codes were dished out by Semiwork about REPO. For example, typing "/cinematic" in the text chat will remove the UI. Additionaly, the developer says you can put "/greenscreen" into the chat for that feature to pop up in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">REPO is $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" rel="nofollow ">Steam Early Access</a>. The online cooperative horror game launched February 26.</p>

                <p>According to the CEO of The Lego Group, the company may begin developing some video games internally. Niels Christiansen, who has been Lego's CEO since 2017, said in an interview that the company is ramping up to make some games in-house.</p><p>"We can definitely say as long as we're under the Lego brand we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical. [Games development in-house] is something we're building up," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FT</a>.</p><p>Many of the existing Lego games are made by external studios via a licensing arrangement. For example, Lego works with the UK studio <a href="https://www.ttgames.com/games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> on the popular Lego games based on brands like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>Lego is also in business with Epic Games for the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expands-with-new-social-sim-brick-life/1100-6528297/" data-ref-id="1100-6528297"> Lego Fortnite game inside the Fortnite platform.</a> Additionally, Lego partnered with 2K for a racing game, 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-2k-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-585043">Lego 2K Drive</a>. According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lego-is-starting-to-bring-its-game-development-in-house-key-exec-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, this was the first in a series of sports games to come from this deal.</p><p>Reporter Jason Schreier said TT Games is now<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4?t=2997s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> developing a new Lego game</a> that could potentially release later in 2025 or in 2026. VGC reported that an upcoming Lego Harry Potter game may be in the works and could follow a similar format to Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga and cover the entire Harry Potter series. 2024's Lego Harry Potter Collection already did this, with the bundle comprising Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4 and Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7. Warner Bros. Games is making major changes going forward and will focus only on a few core franchises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wbs-gaming-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6529747/" data-ref-id="1100-6529747">Harry Potter being one of them. </a></p><p>Another new release in the Lego game series was 2024's Lego Horizon Adventures, which adapted the events of Sony's Horizon series. Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo developed this title.</p><p>There is basically nothing to go on beyond Christiansen's single-sentence quote about potentially making games in-house, so it's not clear why the company might make this change, when it could happen, or if anything will change with Lego's ongoing business partnerships with outside studios.</p>

		<p>Wargaming’s new multiplayer mech game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is heading into Steam Early Access on 2nd April.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters - Early Access Date Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/wargaming-reveal-giant-mech-battler-steel-hunters-10-day-playtest-now-on/">Steel Hunters was announced at the end of last year</a>, a sci-fi break away from Wargaming’s bread and butter historical warfare games with World of Tanks, World of Warships and more. This free-to-play mech hero shooter blends together battle royale and extraction shooter ideas, and Wargaming are hoping that early access will help them to quickly refine that blend, with the expectation that they will quickly get to a full release after gathering community feedback. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/20/steel-hunters-open-beta-brings-stompy-off-on-steam/">This will build on what they learnt from closed beta</a> periods held over the last few months.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a PvPvE game in which six teams of two Hunters drop down to the planet at the start of a match, stomping around in their imposing mechs, doing battle with the drones that patrol the contaminated world, looking to collect enough Starfall resources, and then get out while battling other human players.</p>
<p>There’s seven Hunters to choose from, including the all-rounder Razorside, quadruped&nbsp;Ursus and Fenris, sniper Heartbreaker, combat medic Trenchwalker, and drone-summoning Prophet.</p>

<p>Catch <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/steel-hunters-combines-mech-warfare-and-extraction-in-wargamings-latest/">our preview from December here</a>, or just jump into the game when it launches in April… or both!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/two-point-museum-two-point-at-its-best/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Two Point Museum</h5><p><span>4 March, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S</span>
						</p></div><div>
							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Two Point Studios</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/">sandbox games</a> that allowed you to manage large areas or populations. Whether it was Theme Hospital or SimCity 2000, a lot of time was spent playing those games. As someone who loves going to museums, big or small, I knew immediately that I had to play this game, and I'm so glad I did. Truly, you can't go wrong with any of the Two Point games, but Two Point Museum excels in areas that other sandbox titles do not. Between their first game and this new title, they have learned what makes a perfectly challenging, comedic, and relaxing experience all in one.</p>
<p>It's always a little bit daunting jumping into a new sandbox game, regardless of whether you've played the previous iterations in the franchise. There's a lot of information to take on board, as well as trying to remember all the different controls and mechanics that you will need to manage throughout. However, compared to previous Two Point games, Two Point Museum definitely feels the most user-friendly, and I didn't find it nearly as anxiety-inducing to actually get stuck in and start playing. The tutorials were thorough and helped explain every mechanic you'd need to manage, with the campaign taking you through everything you needed to know at a reasonable pace without things getting too chaotic from the outset.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_9e6cbc42294ab41d4ebd29f89ec8796220f92293.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While other sandbox games have tutorials and help you work around the basics, the campaign is a thorough tutorial experience that is relatively stress-free. It helps you learn the controls and basics of the game but also provides information on some of the metrics you'll need to keep an eye on. Compared to Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new game feels incredibly accessible to those who are new to the sandbox or simulation genre and helps ease the player in gently rather than being plunged into the deep end. On top of that, even when you get into the deep end of the game, at no point did I feel like I was drowning or wouldn't be able to get myself out of trouble. Compared to games like Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster, which can be devastatingly punishing, Two Point holds your hand just enough to ensure you don't sink completely under.</p>
<p>I initially started my Two Point Museum experience on PC but found that I also enjoyed playing it on the Steam Deck after initially being daunted by the idea of using a controller for this style of game. However, the controller inputs are smoother and feel easier to work with compared to a mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>After playing Two Point Hospital, I didn't know how it would be possible to make the franchise even better. Still, Two Point Museum takes my love for museums and doubles it by adding the ability to create an aquarium with funky-looking fish and go on expeditions. To obtain artifacts, you have to send your Experts on expeditions, where they may get injured along the way. It makes every discovery exciting, as you never know whether you'll get a duplicate or something completely new from the map. However, duplicates don't go to waste, as you can deconstruct them to learn more about the exhibit, making it higher quality and adding perks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_18e9d7278ffdea6575ef296b3eb1e2ee0eed3b28.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Of course, like any Two Point game, you have funny announcements over the intercom, which also helps to bring your attention to when the chopper returns to the helipad. It also notifies you of things that may slip past your attention, such as exhibits needing to be restored or staff members wanting a raise. From seeing Tails and Sonic walking around your museum as staff members to the dry humor that comes through over the intercom, it's a perfectly packaged game. It's incredibly well-polished, and much love and passion went into making this experience.</p>
<p>The expeditions system is a lot of fun to try and complete, especially when it comes to needing certain perks to ensure that you can even go on the expedition. It starts off relatively safe, with minimal risk, but ramps up soon enough, and you have to really put thought into who you want to send out. If they get injured, there is a very high risk that they will ask for a significant raise, or they will just up and leave. This can be a little bit stressful, especially since at this point, the Expert will be decently leveled up. Luckily, it feels that although it can have consequences, they are fixable consequences, and it doesn't feel like a damning punishment if you make a mistake.</p>
<p>The only issue I had with Two Point Museum was the explanation given for placing staff-only doors and other types of doors on partition walls. Partition walls are in the build section and are small ropes or glass half walls to keep members of the public out of areas. It's explained that you can put a door on these for whatever function you need it for. However, the doors aren't actually compatible with the partition walls, and the game actually means that you need to use the Museum Wall to add doors.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ss_fc3903f36c1c6cc278db1222a6a9f337edcb3ccc.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>I loved the colors and styling of Two Point Museum, as it had a degree of vibrancy that the previous games didn't quite have. While the museums are tones of brown and beige, adding in pops of color through info boards and decorations helps to make the museum shine.</p>
<p>Although I now have multiple museums on the go, I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer, and I can't wait to see what other weird and wacky exhibits I unearth on my expeditions.</p>
<p>I have yet to play Two Point Museum's sandbox mode, but considering how user-friendly the rest of the game has been, I expect that, if the campaign is any indication, it will be a good experience with building difficulty.</p>
<p>Overall, my experience with Two Point Museum has been a dream. It is exactly everything I wanted from a brand-new Two Point game. I can't wait to see <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what comes next</a> for this game and the franchise in general.</p>

				<p>I loved every moment of this game, and didn't have a single issue throughout. There were no frame issues, the game was incredibly accessible and easy to dive into, and didn't have that overwhelming factor that a lot of new sandbox games do. It brings in moments of comedy to break up tense moments, and the campaign helps ease you in to the mechanics little by little.</p>

            <p>
With several <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors in the works from former staff, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-lawsuit-woes-continue-as-fired-devs-double-down-on-claims-of-fraud-at-studio-zaum">controversy regarding the exits of key team members</a> behind the beloved RPG, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">an in-development expansion cancelled</a>, you might have been wondering what <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/zaum">Studio ZA/UM</a> will do next. Well, that answer is here. In a recent presentation held for the press, ZA/UM revealed a first look at their next game. It's called C4 and it's about espionage.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The presentation was led by Jim Ashilevi, the lead voice over director on Disco Elysium, and Siim "Kosmos" Sinamäe, a producer and writer for the RPG, who are both serving as writers on this new game. Right off the bat, Sinamäe made one thing quite clear: "This is not Disco Elysium 2, this is C4." The writer went on to explain that ZA/UM has "spent the last three years developing this brand new, gripping, completely original world, exploring a theme that each and every member of the ZA/UM collective is inherently obsessed with: espionage."
</p>
<figure>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz9apwrMKi8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
While the presentation didn't offer a look at anything in-game, a short teaser trailer for C4 was shown which mostly consisted of a woman with a London accent talking in a very Disco Elysium-y kind of way, set to some very cool looking art. Story details were pretty slim too, but Ashilevi did explain that "C4 is all about spy games, allegiances, and betrayals. It is not 007, with his hero complex, the Bond girls, the gadgets. It is more like Slow Horses, doing the work you love even if it does not get you any fame or parades. No heroes, only the stench of failure." Failing forward will also apparently be a big part of what sets the game apart, with Ashilevi saying the team is making "failure a joy in itself".
</p>
<p>
This presentation is just part one of two, as ZA/UM is also apparently making an appearance at GDC later this month, where it will presumably talk more about the game.
</p>
<p>
C4 is obviously the first project following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-developer-alleges-creative-leads-were-fired-on-false-premises">the departure</a> of Disco Elysium designer Robert Kurvitz, writer Helen Hindpere and artist Aleksander Rostov in 2021. What followed has been a series of messy legal battles, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGIGA8taN-M&amp;ab_channel=PeopleMakeGames">documentary</a> that alleged toxicity from Kurvitz and more, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">several</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">different</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/first-look-at-disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-hopetown-shows-a-painterly-gorgeous-and-utterly-unconvincing-rpg">games</a> claiming to be spiritual successors. I'm looking forward to finding out if the OG ZA/UM can cut through all of that noise.
