            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Kickstarter campaign for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dont-starve-board-game-coming-from-glass-cannon-unplugged" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em></a> has gone live. Glass Cannon Unplugged's tabletop adaptation of Klei Interactive's acclaimed survival game has been a blockbuster success, reaching its initial funding goal in five minutes and continuing to climb.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/dont-starve-the-board-game/description" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> for Don't Starve: The Board Game describes the game as a cooperative roguelike experience. Much like its video game source material, 1-4 players are dropped into a land of magic, mad science, and overwhelmingly filled with cruel elements and monsters. Players will need to work together and do all they can to survive.</p>

Exploring the wilderness for food, resources, biomes, and secrets. Crafting those resources into weapons, tools, structures, and devices to help you withstand the weather, the dark, and the locals. Finally, the survival element, where you have to manage your hunger, sanity, and health as you traverse the dark world.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has several early bird incentives. If you back the game within its first 72 hours, you'll get the Wolfgang expansion, which introduces the playable Wolfgang character, at no additional cost. The expansion will include an unpainted Wolfgang miniature, a holographic character card, and two ability cards.</p>

<p>In addition, each playable character in the board game has a Fortune digital skin, which can be unlocked in the video game spin-off, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-starve-together-sharing-unlocks-across-platforms-in-future-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Don't Starve Together</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>For those interested in board game add-ons, the campaign includes playmats, dice towers, cardboard terrain packs, and acrylic monster standee packs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;pledge tiers for <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Standard Pledge for $79:</strong> The regular edition of the game with acrylic monster standees, any and all unlocked stretch goals, and Don't Starve Together digital character skins</li>
	<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $129:</strong> Everything in the standard pledge but with unpainted miniatures for monsters and characters</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, <em>Don't Starve: The Board Game</em> has raised&nbsp;<span><span>$746,128, completely decimating its initial funding goal of $50,000. The campaign ends October 23.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cod-next-blops-7-wall-bounce-maps-tac-movement-2000630271</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-shows-off-everything-coming-to-multiplayer-at-launch.1312795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ahead of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s November 14 release date and the early access beta running from October 2 to 5<em>, Call of Duty </em>Next showed off some live footage from the latest entry in the long-running of the military shooter series. The game looks like a solid, speedy, competitive shooter that’s utilizing its futuristic setting for some war-themed sci-fi fantasy. So let’s jump into what stood out during CODNext.</p>  <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> multiplayer looks tactile and fast</h2> <p>I don’t blame those who think all of these games look the same, but if you like a fast shooter with some interesting opportunities for gravity-defying tactics, you might want to check out footage from today’s event–especially if you’re a fan of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2</em>, to which <em>7</em> is intended as a spiritual successor.</p>

 <p>Set in the near future,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> has some fancy tech that builds off the advanced movement techniques in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Wall-jumping, sliding, tactical stance, it all combines very seamlessly in both the scripted sizzle reels and the actual gameplay shown off today.</p>

 <p>The wall-bouncing, which looks like it’ll owe&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>a royalty check, is particularly exciting as various streamers showed off how these techniques can be used for some vertically lethal plays and opportunities to get new, unexpected sight lines.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> will ship with 18 maps, mostly focusing on 6v6</h2> <p>In what’s shaping up to be a healthy roster of maps,&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>will feature 16 6v6 maps, with 13 of those being brand new designs joined by three remakes of&nbsp;<em>BLOPS6 </em>maps. The remaining two maps are for 20v20 battles.</p> <p>During the beta, folks can jam on six of these maps, all of which are of the smaller, 6v6 variety. Map design in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>is particularly focused on standard, three-lane construction. That tried-and-true design, however, might be just what allows the game’s advanced movement techniques to really let players mix things up.</p>

 <h2>Overclocking equipment</h2> <p><em>BLOPS7</em> will contain many of the usual loadout options we’ve long come to expect from&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>, but you’ll be able to further customize your class by “overclocking” lethal, tactical, field upgrades, and score streaks. Once unlocked, these let you equip two modifications in addition to the ordinary functions of the equipment. One such example shown off today was the Stim Shot, which lets you either cancel out enemy-induced debuffs&nbsp;or gain a speed boost when using it.</p>

 <h2>Weapon build sharing</h2> <p>In what stood out to me as one of the coolest features in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>, folks will be able to quickly share weapon builds with each other by way of a simple code the game generates when you finish a specific setup. This should make it pretty easy to just grab an effective meta build and jump into a match.</p>

 <h2>Season one aims to be the ‘biggest’ in <em>BLOPS</em> history</h2> <p>Though&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em> has a pretty sizeable stock of maps to choose from at launch, Treyarch announced today that seven additional multiplayer maps will join the game over the course of its first season, with six of them for the 6v6 mode. Ranked play will arrive in season two.</p> <h2>Nuketown returns</h2> <p>Looking like it came straight out of Bethesda’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> games, the end of the multiplayer reveal showed off a couple of shots of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> map Nuketown. Check it out:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000630311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630311">© Screenshot: Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nuketown is expected to arrive “soon” after&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>‘s launch.</p> <hr> <p>All in all, the big takeaway from CODNext is that if fast-paced, competitive shooters are your thing, <em>BLOPS7</em> is looking pretty solid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA has released a content roadmap for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> that outlines all the new goodies and free DLC players can expect during the online shooter’s first season.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s next installment in the popular military sim series, is nearly here. The FPS arrives on October 10 on console and PC. But in 2025, games like <em>Battlefield</em> can’t just launch and be done. No, they need roadmaps! Promises of more content coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And that’s just what’s been revealed,</a> with <em>BF6</em>‘s season one roadmap confirming two new maps are arriving in <em>BF6</em> before the end of the year, as well as new modes, guns, and more.</p> <p>As seen in the new roadmap shared on September 29, season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> doesn’t start at launch. Instead, it begins on October 28, a few weeks later. The first season is being split into “phases” that will bring in new content every month for the rest of 2025.</p> <figure><figcaption>© EA</figcaption></figure> <h2>Phase One of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>The first Phase is Rogue Ops, and it adds a brand new map: Blackwell Fields. This is a big map set in the California badlands, and it will support all modes as well as land and air vehicles. The first phase also adds Strikepoint, a new 4v4 mode all about “intense, small team tactical” combat. Squads fight over an objective across multiple rounds, but only have one life each round. Sounds tense. Not sure it’s something I’ll play, but different strokes, etc.</p>

 <p>Also being added in the first phase are an APC vehicle, a compact carbine rifle, a new sidearm, and some extra attachments for weapons.</p> <h2>Phase Two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Phase two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season kicks off on November 18 and adds a new map, Eastwood, which seems to be a bit smaller than Blackwell Fields. This new battlefield is also set in the United States and is located in a “sleepy, affluent suburb” next to a golf course. All modes supported, but it seems no jets will be available on this one, just helis. A new mode called Sabotage is being added in this phase, too. The new mode is another smaller one focused on 8v8 combat as teams try to destroy as many objectives as possible before time runs out. One team defends, the other attacks. Once again, not sure if this is what I want from <em>Battlefield</em>, but cool for folks who like it.</p>

 <p>Also being added in phase two: Battle Pickups. This is a returning feature from some past<em> Battlefield</em> games. Players will be able to find powerful and advanced weapons that can be picked up and used until they run out of ammo or you die and drop them. I’m excited to see how this might change up some maps.&nbsp; A new double-barreled pump shotgun, revolver, and attachment is also being added during this phase.</p>

 <h2>Phase three of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Finally, on December 9, phase three of the season arrives. EA says this is the last phase of the season. This phase doesn’t add a new map, but instead changes up an existing map. <em>BF6</em>‘s Empire State map, set in NYC, will temporarily be covered in snow during this phase of the season. According to the roadmap, this won’t simply be a fun cosmetic change, but will actually affect gameplay. There will be a new “Freeze” mechanic introduced on the snow-covered map that EA describes as a “gameplay modifier.” No other details yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the third and final phase will add an ice-climbing axe as a new melee weapon option, and a new limited-time “Ice Lock” even that will happen exclusively on the snowy Empire State map.</p> <hr> <p>Phew! That’s a lot of content and all of it is, assuming nothing gets delayed, arriving in the game’s first few months. I’ll be curious to see how much content future seasons include. Can we expect two maps and multiple guns in every season? That seems like a lot. But if the devs can pull it off, <em>Battlefield 6</em> might end up being one of the best entries in the series. And that might help distract people from the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s prince and Jared Kushner’s investment firm</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-disney-plus-cost">Disney+ getting price increases</a> on October 21, I'd recommend getting a lay of the land you’re paying for. In October, the streamer will be getting a standard spread of series from across its channels, as well as the third season of Star Wars: Visions and a new Disney villain-themed anime. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, we also expect some spooky season celebrations.

Scroll through picks on a scale from “A Little Fear” to “Completely Terrified." We'll likely see more announcements over the course of the month, with my bets on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-fantastic-four-first-steps-streaming">streaming release for Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> and some surprise Halloween specials.

                <p>EA is preparing to go private, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">as the veteran video game company will be sold</a> for an eye-watering sum of $55 billion to an investor consortium made up of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. While this deal will require regulator approval and a sign-off by stockholders, EA is expecting the deal to be completed in Q1 FY27.</p><p>A privately owned EA could be a very different company when compared to its public incarnation, and it will also have to work off $20 billion of new debt that is being used to finance the buyout. So what does $55 billion buy you these days? Quite a <em>lot</em>, as EA's potential new owners will be acquiring studios, brands, and much more. Here's a broad overview of all things EA</p><h2>EA's various entertainment studios</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4577817"></a><figcaption>EA has established a rich library of games over the years.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4577817-ea-games-2.jpg"></figure><p>EA has built up a sizable collection of studios under its portfolio, and several of these have become responsible for EA's biggest hits. Criterion Games has developed several Need for Speed titles, DICE is best known for its work on the Battlefield series, and Maxis made a name for itself with The Sims.</p><p>Then there's Motive Studio--a developer that has alternated between being a support studio and working on big projects like Star Wars: Squadrons and the Dead Space remake--PopCap Games has developed several popular mobile titles, and Respawn Entertainment has been responsible for several of EA's best single-player games in the modern era.</p><p>BioWare has a storied history, but after mass layoffs at the Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio, it's not certain what state the famed studio is in. Work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-team-should-scapegoat-dragon-age-to-get-more-resources-former-bioware-dev-says/1100-6533885/" data-ref-id="1100-6533885">new Mass Effect game</a> has been going on for several years now, but the high-profile flop of Anthem and underwhelming sales for Dragon Age: The Veilguard have left people wondering what its future looks like under a privately owned EA.</p><p>The studios listed above are just the tip of the EA iceberg, as the company also has Skate developer Full Circle, EA Gothenburg, Codemasters, and even more subsidiaries.</p><h2>EA Entertainment</h2><ul><li>BioWare (Includes BioWare Austin)</li><li>Criterion Games (Includes Criterion Cheshire)</li><li>DICE (Includes Frostbite Labs)</li><li>EA Baton Rouge</li><li>EA Galway in Galway, Ireland.</li><li>EA Gothenburg</li><li>EA Korea Studio</li><li>EA Capital Games</li><li>EA Redwood Studios</li><li>Firemonkeys Studios</li><li>Glu Mobile</li><li>Playdemic</li><li>Slingshot Games</li><li>Tracktwenty Studios</li><li>Full Circle</li><li>Maxis (Includes Maxis Texas and Maxis Europe)</li><li>Motive Studio (Includes Motive Studio Vancouver)</li><li>Pogo Studios</li><li>PopCap Games (Includes PopCap Shanghai and PopCap Hyderabad)</li><li>Respawn Entertainment (Includes Respawn Vancouver and Respawn Wisconsin)</li><li>Ripple Effect Studios</li></ul><h2>EA Sports</h2><p>The other jewel in the EA crown is its EA Sports division.

                <p>As part of Call of Duty: Next today, Activision and Treyarch hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>'s post-launch support, which begins with Season 1. It will be the "biggest in franchise history" as it relates to a Season 1 for a new Call of Duty game, the developer said.</p><p>Specifically, there will be <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1973074806607405487" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">seven more 6v6 maps</a> added to Black Ops 7 multiplayer in Season 1, along with two new Zombies Survival maps, and one new round-based Zombies map. There could also be new Call of Duty: Warzone content as well.</p><p>Activision historically releases Call of Duty's seasonal content over time and not all at once, often divided between content available at launch and then down the road in a Reloaded update.</p><p>Fans don't have to wait until Season 1 for a new map, though, as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-brings-back-iconic-nuketown-map-and-heres-when/1100-6535119/" data-ref-id="1100-6535119"> latest iteration of Nuketown will arrive prior to Season 1.</a> Black Ops 7 will launch with 18 maps, including 16 6v6 maps and two maps for the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><h2><strong>When does Season 1 start?</strong></h2><p>Activision did not say when Season 1 will begin. For comparison, last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/" data-ref-id="1100-6527587">Black Ops 6 had its own Season 1 begin on November 14, 2024.</a> The game released on October 25, 2024, so Season 1 debuted 20 days after the game launched. If a similar timeframe follows for Black Ops 7, then Season 1 could start around early December, but nothing is confirmed at this stage.</p><p>All of the post-launch maps are free, but it's expected that Black Ops 7 will have its own in-game store filled with things people can buy with real money. We may not see as many outrageous and wacky skins, however, as Activision has said it might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">shifting focus away from those kinds of skins.</a> Black Ops 6's skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">won't carry forward to Black Ops 7, either. </a></p><p>Fans will get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">try Black Ops 7's multiplayer during a beta</a>, which begins on October 2 and continues through October 8.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hades 2 officially launched in early access this past September 25, 2025, and over the weekend, Supergiant Games' latest title and its first-ever sequel reached a new milestone: the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/">concurrent player count on Steam reached 112,947 players</a>, which is more than double the max concurrent player count that its predecessor, Hades, ever reached.</p>



<p>Hades only ever reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145360/charts/">max concurrent player count of 54,240 players</a>, a number that Hades 2 had already dwarfed when it shadow-dropped in early access last year, but as of its v1.0 launch, it has now more than doubled.</p>



<p>It's an incredibly strong start for the game, which had already reportedly sold more than 2 million copies in its early access period, and is set to be even bigger than Hades, which was already the biggest game Supergiant Games had ever released.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hades II has already sold 2M+ in early access (<a href="https://twitter.com/alineaanalytics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alineaanalytics</a>  estimates). </p><p>Since its early-access launch in May 2024, it's made almost $55M. But the floodgates will open when it hits 1.0 TOMORROW. </p><p>I've finished Silksong (Groal the Great🖕) so can't wait to sink my teeth in. <a href="https://t.co/RlY8nKblI2">pic.twitter.com/RlY8nKblI2</a></p></div>— Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1970880327263633704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hades 2 has also surpassed other stellar 2025 titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Hollow Knight: Silksong to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">highest-rated new release in 2025 on Metacritic with a 94</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">In Wccftech's review of Hades 2</a> (which contributed to its high Metacritic score as we gave it a 10/10), we called it "<em>a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further</em>."  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Is there a word that describes the feeling of “I want something to be just a <em>bit</em> better because it’s already <em>so good</em> it only needs one last kick in the pants”?</p><p>Because that’s how I feel about the $60 Lego Nintendo Game Boy. It’s better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">the fan-made Lego Game Boy</a> that I asked Nintendo to make. It’s even better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display">I hoped when Lego officially revealed the set</a>. This isn’t just a statue that looks like my original 1989 Game Boy; it’s a joy to build and feels fantastic in the hands. You can press every button, spin every dial, roll the D-pad, and throw a satisfyingly snappy power switch.</p><p>Though it doesn’t light up one bit, its lenticular moving images were enough to momentarily surprise friends and family into asking: “Does it actually play games?” The set even has a few hidden Easter eggs.</p><p>And yet, I can’t help wanting more.</p><p>Let’s do something different for this review: Let’s make it a show and tell. If you’re a video person, start by tapping on my Instagram embed above, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nv-t6m4uNlk">or TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nv-t6m4uNlk">or YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/videos/lego-game-boy-vs-real-game-boy/1249944793488210/">or Facebook</a>, or perhaps <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanhollister.bsky.social/post/3lzr5x2okyc2q">my Bluesky</a>. If you prefer photos and words, scroll down and I’ll tell you all about it!</p><p>Here it is, the photograph I’ve wanted to stage for months: the Lego Nintendo Game Boy next to the pristine 1989 original you might have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/21/18508022/game-boy-nintendo-games-accessories-anniversary-photo-essay">in many a <em>Verge </em>photo before</a>. It was my wife’s childhood Game Boy, though I had one just like it — and Lego designer Carl Merriam absolutely nails the size, shape, and look. It does overcompensate slightly with the Off-On switch and headphone jack labels that are gray instead of molded, three of the four corners of the gray screen bezel are square instead of slightly rounded, and the A and B buttons seem almost pink rather than purple.</p><p>It’s also clearly made of a mosaic of Lego tiles rather than a single smooth surface, but that’s part of the charm: it’s a wonder to realize the Game Boy can be re-created 1:1 out of Lego bricks!</p><p>Here, I have both displaying the exact same cutscene from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>. If you’ve never played the original, you may not realize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwjewLrq8GM&amp;list=RDvwjewLrq8GM&amp;start_radio=1">just how specific a moment this is</a> — a bittersweet, heartstring-tugging scene you can only watch once per playthrough, so I had to save my game before a certain quest to get this photo.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Lenticular tech is still rad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Lego Game Boy comes with three of these little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing">lenticular panels</a> to make it look like the screen’s turned on and give it a sense of motion. If you tilt the handheld up and down, you can watch Mario jump, see the Nintendo logo fall, or watch the waves and seagulls fly above the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> beach.</p><p>But the one thing I don’t understand is printing on a <em>gray</em> background rather than a <em>green </em>one, so the Lego Game Boy’s screen doesn’t look green like the original’s. It feels like a bizarre miss to me.</p><p>A closer look at gray versus green:</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I threw in an Easter egg of my own.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It’s not the only nit I could pick with the Lego Game Boy’s screen, which is recessed quite a bit more than the original, which in turn makes it even harder to light up than the original (and, like the original, you need an external light source to do that since it didn’t have a light of its own!).</p><p>But I don’t blame Lego for that — it’s because Lego’s using a regular Lego window frame and windowpane for the screen instead of creating new custom parts, which make it feel more authentically Lego. I just wish Lego would start protecting its big windowpanes better so they don’t come scratched right out of the box.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You need a lot of light to see the “screen” well.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Comparing the Lego Game Boy to the original from every angle, you can see lots of places where there are slight gaps between the tiles, sure. But you can also see that almost every complex curve and label is represented, and while it weighs a few ounces less than the original, it’s almost the exact same size.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Image slider: volume and contrast wheels, external connector port (though there’s no port underneath Lego’s cover) and the AC adapter jack. No AC adapter label on the Lego version.</em></figcaption></p></div><div id=":R1abcmab96:"><p><figcaption><em>That power switch may seem placed too high, but it’s worth it for the satisfying snap of its Technic peg action.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>You shouldn’t take that for granted, because it’s not easy even for skilled Lego creators to build a dense real-life object to scale with moving parts. As an example, see how much thicker and blockier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters"><em>Lego Masters Australia</em> finalist Nick Lever’s creation</a> is below?</p><div id=":R1ebcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>From left to right: Lego’s Game Boy, Nintendo’s Game Boy, and my attempt at Nick Lever’s fan creation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>I still love the Mario hat buttons, though.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>BTW, both of the Lego Game Boys can technically squeeze in a real cart, but it stretches the build uncomfortably.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23991049/lego-ideas-polaroid-onestep-behind-the-scenes-price">as the Lego Group showed and told me in 2023</a>, the thing that truly separates a great official Lego set from a fan creation is the incredible amount of thought that goes into making the set playable and fun to <em>build</em>, not just fun once you’re through.</p><p>You can get a better sense in my video, but after a certain point the whole set is built out of modular parts. You create a set of springy face buttons that slide into place, a D-pad that drops in, a screen that needs attaching. It contributes to the illusion you’re building electronics instead of just piling bricks together.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> developers Avalanche Studios are cutting staff and closing their Liverpool, UK-based studio following Microsoft's cancellation of co-op smuggling game Contraband.
</p>
<p>Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">announced Contraband back in June 2021</a> in the form of a trailer replete with lockboxes, scribbly heist maps and Steely Dan music. There followed several years of almost complete silence, broken by news that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">over 500 Swedish staff had formed a union</a> in April 2024 - part of a wave of games industry labour activism in the face of widespread, "post-Covid" job-chopping.
</p>
<p>The positivity was not to last. In June 2024, Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-creators-avalanche-lay-off-50-people-and-close-their-montreal-and-new-york-studios">laid off 50 people and closed their New York and Montreal studios</a> to ensure "a stable and sustainable future for the company". Then, in August this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband">called time on Contraband</a>, shortly after laying off a bunch of Xbox developers and cancelling such games as Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">reboot of Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, Avalanche commented that "active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future". There's been some disagreement between Microsoft and reporters over whether the game is fully dead, or merely "on hold". I imagine it'll be on hold for a while, if they aren't any developers to work on it.
</p><p>Avalanche's <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement</a> about this week's reductions alludes to "current challenges to our business and the industry", but doesn't mention Contraband. The company propose to close their Liverpool studio, with a collective consultation process as required by UK law. "The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmő and Stockholm," the statement continues, "where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <p>Insert joke about London calling here, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have just released the first of the mod's planned three DLC packs. This one's called Rabbit and Pork and brings with it 30 new quests, plus a laundry list of that includes a bunch of NPCs, extra gear, and stability fixes.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">covered the other day</a>, to dive into the DLC and have the least chance of running into any bugs that could be lurking, you'll want to start a fresh run through post-apoclayptic Blighty.</p>

<p>"This major update doesn't just add new content, it reshapes parts of the game based on your feedback and fixes thousands of issues identified since launch," Team FOLON wrote in the DLC's Discord announcement. "We've poured a huge amount of effort into making this the most polished and complete experience possible."</p><p>Rabbit and Pork brings 30 new quests and minigames to the mod, along with 80 new characters for which 8000+ lines of chat have been recorded, I assume at least a third of those being in Cockney accents. Taking a quick gander at the release trailer, among the things which've stuck out to me are a mission involving a plane named after Fallout: London's protagonist, the wayfarer, and a visit to the Jack the Ripper museum.</p>
<p>As you explore, 30 new weapons and armours can be found, along with a new animal follower and a home to move into. 70 fresh random encounters and "new content for early faction introductions" round out the additions, while Team FOLON say the number of bug fixes and stability improvements number in the thousands.</p>
<p>"We’re also unveiling a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">brand-new custom launcher</a> designed alongside the Overwolf team to simplify the installation process for those who wish to use it," they add. "This one-click solution will alleviate the hassle of traditional mod installations and get players into the game faster and more reliably than ever akin to the GOG one-click installer."</p>
<p>In addition, the modders have rolled a number of key <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mods that help make the game a bit less likely to crash into this release, so the High FPS Fix, X-Cell and Buffout 4 no longer have to be grabbed seperately. Team FOLON recommend you uninstall them if you've already downloaded and installed them individually, to avoid duplication.</p><p>To round out the news, the modders have also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teamfolon/team-folon-collectors-edition">launched a Kickstarter</a> for a Collector's Edition of Fallout: London. Something to consider backing if you fancy it in between mouthfuls of rabbit and pork. If you bounced off of Fallout: London the first time around due to its launch bugs, here's the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">review I wrote of it</a> for my old home.</p>

<p>Nuketown was first introduced in 2010's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops/" data-ref-id="5000-43355">Black Ops</a>. Iconic for its incredibly tight shooting lanes and those two opposing two-story houses, it's one of those maps that speeds up what can already be a really fast game. It appeared in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> but hadn't been seen until it was remastered in Black Ops 6.

It arrives on Switch in just a few weeks on <strong>9th October</strong>, but before we get to see the finished product for ourselves, the studios have made a surprise reveal about the original fantasy IP: an animated series is in the works.</p>
<p>The series is set to be developed by animation studio Supamonks, and will set out to "build upon Absolum's lore and narrative, expanding its universe beyond the game," the press release reads.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ljpunv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Details for the series' release are pretty slim at the moment (to be fair, the game's not even out yet), but we do know that Supamonks has been involved in Absolum's development right from the start and, with Dotemu collaborating, we're sure it'll provide a fitting expansion of the game's world. At the very least, it's bound to look pretty.</p>
<p>Every Absolum trailer we've seen so far has shown promise, with a neat art style, fun-looking gameplay loop, and plenty of combat variety. We'll have to wait and see what the full release brings, but this could be one to watch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has <a href="https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1972959300436865280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a major hotfix patch for Dying Light: The Beast, updating the game to version 1.2.3. The update improves a performance issue related to stuttering when NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (or Multi Frame Generation), which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-shows-an-aging-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in my technical analysis of the game</a> as very annoying during gameplay. </p>



<p>The other highlight is that the Polish studio has recognized the absolutely overpowered grabbing ability of zombie Biters and balanced it so that it is less frustrating. That's also something I noticed right away when playing and indeed, the PC community <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-five-pc-mods-to-improve-your-dying-light-the-beast-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already provided fixes through mods</a>. Even though this is now fixed in the base Dying Light: The Beast, other mods are still worth downloading.</p>



<p>Here's the full changelog for Dying Light: The Beast 1.2.3:</p>



<p><strong><em>Stability &amp; Performance</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed various crashes to improve overall game stability.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where sharpening was not applied correctly while using DLSS.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed occasional stuttering when playing with Frame Generation enabled.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed graphical glitches when using HDR on PlayStation 5.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Gameplay Improvements</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Grabbing Biters is now less frustrating and feels more fair.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where patrolling routes of Screamers in Dark Zones were broken.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Quests &amp; Progression</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tutorial:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a critical issue where, if a player received a modded weapon from someone who had already completed the tutorial, the game attempted to apply the mod a second time, thus blocking the progress.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>The Mine (Co-op):</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where destructible doors could remain indestructible for one player, blocking quest progression.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Safe Spots:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a bug where breakable doors and windows respawned after reloading, trapping players inside.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Mental Asylum Safe Spot: Fixed an issue where reloading the save could leave the entrance blocked by an unintended obstacle, preventing players from entering.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where music could loop infinitely after reloading certain quests.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>UI &amp; Consoles</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed the missing “Join the Community” button on consoles.</em></li>
</ul>

              <p>In a few days, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> beta launches on console and PC. This will be the first time players get a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming FPS. It will also be the first chance hackers and cheaters get to possibly screw up the game. And Activision not only expects that to happen, but <em>wants</em> it to happen.</p> <p>On September 29<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">,</a> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">Activision and the team behind <em>Call of Duty’</em>s anti-cheat tech posted a lengthy blog</a> about what they are doing to stop cheaters from ruining the game. As previously announced, this time around, <em>Call of Duty</em> players on PC will have to have Secure Boot activated on their rig to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops7/beta">play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the upcoming beta</a>. For most players, this shouldn’t be much of an issue as newer PCs running Windows 11 are likely to already have Secure Boot activated. But for other players planning to run the game on older PCs or rigs that don’t support Secure Boot, this could be a problem.</p>

 <p>We saw similar issues with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/battlefield-6-requires-secure-boot-to-run-and-its-coming-to-more-games-soon-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-it-is-why-linux-gamers-are-mad-about-it-and-how-to-enable-it/"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and its open beta</a>, which also required Secure Boot. The idea is that this extra level of security can help stop some PC cheat tools, but some players have complained that it can be a pain to turn on Secure Boot if you aren’t experienced with messing around with your PC’s BIOS settings. Others claim it doesn’t do much to stop hackers and cheaters, and point to the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta reportedly had cheaters in it almost immediately.</a>&nbsp; Regardless, Secure Boot is needed to play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the beta.&nbsp; And if cheaters do try to play the <em>BLOPS7</em> beta despite Secure Boot, Activision and its anti-cheat team, Team Ricochet, are waiting for them and ready to ban them forever.</p>

 <p>“Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear,” explained the team in the previously mentioned blog post. “Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all<em> Call of Duty </em>titles, from<em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> to future releases.”</p>

 <p>The studio further explained that all of its anti-cheat tech, which includes machine learning tools and more, will also help make Activision’s free-to-play battle royale <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em> safer from cheaters, adding: “Everything we’re building for <em>Black Ops 7</em> will also protect <em>Call of Duty: Warzone.”</em></p>

 <p>I still expect cheaters will break through Activision’s defenses and cause problems in <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s beta and the full game, which launches in November on consoles and PC. But it sounds like the folks building the game’s anti-cheat tools are not just ready for a fight, but actively encouraging it.</p> <p>The <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> beta launches on all platforms on October 2 via early access. It then opens up to everyone on October 5 and ends on October 8.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The UK branch of Just Cause developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avalanche-studios/">Avalanche Studios</a> is to close just a few weeks after the news that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/avalanche-studios-contraband-is-no-longer-in-development-for-microsoft/">&nbsp;Contraband,</a> a game they were creating as an Xbox exclusive for Microsoft, is no longer in active development.</p>
<p>“In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success,” reads a statement posted on the <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Studios website.</a></p>


<p>“This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs.”</p>
<p>“Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.”</p>
<p>Avalanche Liverpool was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/03/avalanche-studios-liverpool-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up in 2020 </a>and had around 50 staff. Liverpool is the latest Avalanche studio to close, their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/04/avalanche-lay-off-fifty-staff-close-two-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York and Montreal studios were shut down in June 2024</a> with the loss of another fifty staff.</p>

<p>Avalanche has not had much luck with Microsoft, having previously worked on dinosaur shooter Second Extinction. That was revealed in 2020 and did make it into early access on both PC and Xbox, but was eventually cancelled in 2023. Avalanche’s website lists Contraband as the sole upcoming title, it’s not been officially cancelled but the listing does still link back to a Microsoft page that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Avalanche have another unannounced big project waiting in the wings.&nbsp; It had six projects in development in 2018 but those have either been released, such as Just Cause 4, or cancelled.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1b41258f2a384"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b41258f2a384/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Who doesn’t love a job or class system in an RPG? From endlessly levelling jobs and sub-classing skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fantasy_v">Final Fantasy V</a> to building the perfect teams and pairings in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, classes bring a level of customisation and character that feels pretty unique to the genre.</p>
<p>But while most games allow for a God-like amount of tinkering and levelling, there’s something to be said for the more restrictive class systems. Those that set your characters in a base class and allow them to change according to a class tree, branching down different paths that change the style and impact of that character.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63eoivurx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>It’s for this reason that I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/seiken_densetsu_3">Seiken Densetsu 3</a>’s class system. It’s deceptively simple, relying more on team composition, adaptability, and filling in gaps rather than chopping and changing as you go. Once you choose a character’s Light or Dark job path, that’s it; you have to commit. And, even 30 years after it debuted, it's still absolutely delightful.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b7c7b8a2f6270"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7c7b8a2f6270/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a big shift from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/final_fantasy_adventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>, two relatively simple action RPGs that borrowed from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>, which then evolved into a party-based multiplayer RPG. Secret of Mana will always be one of the most influential games in my life, but its sequel – now known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_of_mana">Trials of Mana</a> – is <em>so</em> much better because of just how replayable it is. The first time I beat it, I immediately started playing it again, because I really wanted to build a perfect, all-destroying team.</p>
<p>And, honestly, you can’t go wrong with most combinations. A lot of the magic comes from being able to choose your whole party at the start of the game – who you choose as your lead character will determine certain story scenes and end-game dungeons, but other than that, it’s completely down to you.</p>
<p>So I went totally on vibes: Riesz was a must and my first lead, armed with a spear for decent damage; next was Kevin, a monk-like character and the best beast boy; rounding out the trio was Hawkeye, a roguish thief with charm for days. On paper, maybe not the most balanced group, as there’s no dedicated spell caster or healer (initially), but by the end it’s an absolutely monstrous trio with huge amounts of damage.</p>

<p>What makes Trials of Mana’s class system work so well is that it gives you an adequate amount of time with every stage. For the first 18 levels, you’ll spend a lot of time getting used to each character’s base moveset, which for me was mostly attack, attack, <em>attack</em>. None of my characters had any spells, buffs, or debuffs, so I just had to rely on perfectly-charged special attacks or careful use of healing items.</p>
<p>It’s a lesson in learning the strengths and weaknesses of each character early on, without the bells and whistles their class upgrades bring. Or, in my case, I guess I learned that all three characters could hit hard – especially Kevin. I’m comfortable with Secret of Mana’s systems (even the awful spell-queueing system which I exploited to level up magic), so it was an adjustment period to get used to the improved timing.</p>
<p>Level 18 is where the fun <em>really</em> starts, so examining a mana stone, I could finally pick whether I would send my characters down a Light or a Dark class path. Whichever one I picked, it would lock me out of <em>half</em> of that character’s classes. Plus, both sides for each character bring about different changes to their classes, narrowing down on niches that make all six playable characters unique.</p>

<p>Riesz, when she starts travelling down her job path, <em>isn’t</em> just a damage dealer. Her Light side gives her access to party buffs, while her Dark path focuses on debuffs. Class up again at 38, and her stat-buffs/debuffs either get stronger <em>or</em> are able to target multiple allies or enemies.</p>
<p>Choosing to go down the Light path with Valkyrie, the cogs are turning in my head. With Riesz as the buffer, the damage needs to come from the boys. I stuck with the Light path for Kevin, giving him a heal and a strength buff that worked during the day. Naturally, then, Kevin had to go Dark, but not <em>full</em> dark, allowing him to multicast ninjutsu spells.</p>
<p>That trio filled all of the gaps I had. Starlancer (Riesz’s Light-Dark Class) allows her to buff the entire team but also gives her a highly damaging summon, for a much-needed clinch moment during encounters, in that it wipes every single enemy off the screen. Kevin became <em>the</em> damage-dealer, tanky and able to keep the pressure on up close. Hawkeye, meanwhile, used spells to exploit elemental weaknesses (useful for those eight Benevodon bosses) while also adding to the damage Kevin dealt.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4f83d8f10e9f4"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f83d8f10e9f4/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was a surefire combo that turned out to be extremely fun to play with; what could’ve ended up as a disaster completely worked in my favour, giving me the variety I needed to win. I honestly just picked those three characters because they had the best designs. So, what if I went with a completely different theme?</p>
<p>My second playthrough started mere days after my first, and I went all-girls: Charlotte, Angela, and Riesz. No main physical attackers, simply a straight trio of supporters and magicians. I loved my first playthrough, but this Mana Girls party and their mix of classes cemented the game as one of my all-time favourite SNES RPGs.</p>
<p>The conundrum here was, how the heck am I going to deal a lot of damage? I had magic and healing covered, and I knew I’d be able to buff with Riesz, who I went Light Light with for Vanadis for single-target buffs and her extremely powerful single-target tech instead. But by this point, I’d become obsessed with researching classes online, from looking at the beautiful character designs and artwork and deciding which ones looked best to completing the perfect party and making the pieces fit together.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5689559125421"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5689559125421/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Charlotte didn’t need a damage buff for the most part, since I already knew Angela would be where the big numbers would come from. Instead, Charlotte would go from the adorable little kid to a Necromancer with the ability to debuff an enemy (read: a boss). Then Angela’s pure-Light class, Grand Diviner, was all damage all day, with Double Spell and whatever the most effective element for that particular fight.</p>
<p>I beat the final boss in under a minute. Trials of Mana isn’t exactly a hard game, but don’t take that moment away from me; I knew how to craft the perfect party and exploit all of their strengths and sharpen them. No real physical damage except for a charged attack that takes a while to build up? No worries, let me spam spells and buffs over and over again.</p>

<p>These are the best kind of conundrums to solve in any job/class-based RPG – what works with what? What doesn’t? When <em>should</em> you use this skill, this class? It doesn’t matter how simple or complex it is; you simply need to think or experiment. In Trials of Mana’s case, well, you have to stick with it – your decisions are final, and in a way, that’s also part of the fun.</p>
<p>There’s no way to change easily like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_tactics_the_ivalice_chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>. You have to live with your choices and plough your way through regardless. Did you forget to employ elemental weaknesses between Duran, Hawkeye, and Riesz? Well, just keep the pressure on. No healing? Better build up money and stock up on healing items. If you happen to put together a crappy team, the challenge and the joy come from how to make it work.</p>

<p>It’s not a complicated game, and it never needed to be. There are optimal and less optimal compositions, sure, but is the ability to create a weird mix of jobs and classes not a huge part of the attraction? Why do you think <a href="https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/">Final Fantasy V’s Four Job Fiesta</a> has prevailed for so long? Sure, that game is amazing <em>because</em> of how good and flexible its class system is, but restrictions and challenges make it even better.</p>
<p>So, while Trials of Mana might not be as deep as other class-based RPGs, for its time, it’s exceptionally moreish and beautifully simple, allowing you to dip your toes into party composition and planning. It’s like a real D&amp;D game – a Bard, a Warlock, and a Thief might not sound like the <em>ideal</em> party, but it’s probably a real good time. Just like running a bunch of mages.</p>

			<p>Today, Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive) announced that Battlefield 6 Season 1 will begin on October 28 and feature free new content for all players.</p>



<p>The first season kicks off with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map called Blackwell Fields, a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint, and new weapons. The second phase, California Resistance, begins on November 18 and includes a map located in Southern California called Eastwood, as well as a Sabotage mode designed for 8v8 combat. The final phase of Season 1, Winter Offensive, begins on December 9 and includes a seasonal map update to Empire State and a themed event.</p>



<p>Blackwell Fields' map includes support for all combat sizes, land, and air vehicles. The backstory is that, right after the end of the single player campaign of Battlefield 6, double agents from the antagonist faction Pax Armata launch a series of attacks on NATO targets, starting at a recently recommissioned American air base in the California badlands. The new Strikepoint mode is an intense, small-team tactical mode in which a squad fights another squad over multiple rounds to capture a key objective. Each round, players have only one life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase one's additions also include:</p>



<ul>
<li>APC Traverser Mark 2 - A land vehicle that suits four players: one driver, one roof gunner, and two side gunners. </li>



<li>SOR-300C - A low rate of fire carbine rifle chambered in the higher damage .300 Blackout ammunition compared to the platform’s 5.56 version.</li>



<li>Mini Fix - A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle</li>



<li>GGH-22 - A high-capacity and fire rate sidearm</li>



<li>Rail Cover &amp; LPVO - Attachments for rifles and LMGs</li>
</ul>



<p>The Eastwood map will support all Battlefield 6 combat sizes, land vehicles, and helicopters. The setting is described as a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course. In Sabotage mode, players must destroy as many sites as possible before time runs out. Each team has one offensive and one defensive round; ultimately, the team that successfully detonates the most sites wins the match.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase 2 will introduce the Battle Pickups feature to the game. These are high-tech, powerful weapons that are limited in ammo and availability throughout a given map. Players will have to scour the maps to find where they're located if they want to exploit the advantage they bring. Other additions include:</p>



<ul>
<li>DB-12 - A dual-barrel pump-action shotgun</li>



<li>M327 Trait - High-damage (but low rate of fire) sidearm with eight rounds. This revolver is powerful in close quarters but has a significant damage drop-off compared to its .44 Magnum comrade.</li>



<li>Troy Angled - This grip attachment offers an alternative for underbarrel choices</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, in the final phase of Battlefield 6 Season 1, Winter Offensive, players will see a seasonal visual update to the Empire State map, where temperatures are now freezing. To go with that theme, there's also a limited-time Ice Lock event centered around a mechanic called Freeze (though this will only be active in specific experiences). Finally, a new melee tool, the Ice Climbing Axe, will be introduced to the shooter game.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/world-of-warcraft-midnight-on-vosu-revele-la-date-de-sortie-et-le-contenu-de-ledition-collector-60600">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> reveals that the upcoming World of Warcraft: Midnight expansion will launch on February 26, 2026. The report also claims that the collector's edition for the expansion is set to cost €139.99, and will include extras like three days of early access to the expansion, 30 days of game time, and more.</p>



<p>This report comes just ahead of a live stream presentation the World of Warcraft team at Blizzard is set to give tomorrow, October 1, 2025, at 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm BT on YouTube and Twitch, detailing new information about World of Warcraft: Midnight. Following that, the alpha test for WoW: Midnigh is set to begin the next day on October 2.</p>



<p>It's possible that Billbil-kun has beat Blizzard to the punch, and announced the release date ahead of tomorrow's presentation, where it will be officially announced, along with the collector's edition and other details about WoW: Midnight.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight was first revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">last month during Gamescom 2025</a>, where <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">Wccftech was able to catch up with Paul Kubit, associate game director at Blizzard and Jade Martin, lead combat systems designer,</a> about what players can look forward to with World of Warcraft: Midnight.</p>



<p>You can check out that interview above to learn more while you wait for tomorrow's live stream, where we're sure to see even more about what's to come in Midnight when it arrives next year.</p>
