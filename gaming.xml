Nintendo was asked about that last one in its latest earnings call, and while the company’s president remained cagey, he also said Nintendo will continue to take its reputation for affordability into account when determining the final price, which some experts predict will be $400. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194141,193706" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The original Switch launched at $300 back in 2017. Since then, however, inflation has driven up the cost of various components, and console makers this generation have declined their usual hardware price cuts, even raising prices in some regions instead. And while it remains to be seen just how good the specs of the Switch 2 might be, this time around the device will also be partially competing with higher-end PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. </p><p> “We are aware that inflation is currently rising and that the exchange rate environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017,” Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told investors</a></span> in the company’s third-quarter earnings call this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-considering-various-factors-for-switch-2-price-switch-1-cost-staying-the-same/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-considering-various-factors-for-switch-2-price-switch-1-cost-staying-the-same/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a translation by <em>Nintendo Everything</em></a></span>. “We also need to consider the affordable prices that customers expect from Nintendo products. When considering the price of our products, we believe that it is necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles. At this time, we cannot announce the specific price of the Nintendo Switch 2, but we are considering it taking into account various points.”</p><p>There will certainly be pressure to price the Switch 2 higher than its predecessor, especially because Nintendo traditionally tries to make profit off of its hardware rather than selling it under market value as a loss-leader for selling software. At the same time, Furukawa’s remarks suggest that, despite the wild popularity of the original Switch, Nintendo knows it risks pricing itself into irrelevance if it aims too high.</p><h2 id="h354355"><a id=""></a>What might the Switch 2 cost?</h2><p>So what will the Switch 2 actually cost? Last month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-cost-analysts-weigh-in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN </em>interviewed several industry analysts</a></span> for their expert opinions. While some think Nintendo could charge as much as $500 for the new device, many are banking on it costing $400. This was the “sweet spot” for Rhys Elliot of MIDiA, and Ampere Analysis’ Piers Harding-Rolls told <em>IGN</em> he was currently basing his sales projections on the same number. At the same time, diehard fans upgrading in the first year would probably be willing to pay more. “Early adopters won’t be price sensitive, and prices can always be lowered,” Circana’s Mat Piscatella said. “Of course, people will want it to be lower than whatever it is it will be announced at.”</p><p>And what does history tell us Nintendo will do?<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/509976/nintendo-switch-2-cost-how-much-price&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/509976/nintendo-switch-2-cost-how-much-price" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Polygon</em> assembled a chart</a></span> of inflation-adjusted prices of all of the company’s consoles. Starting with the launch of the Nintendo 64, the price has mostly hung around $350 to $400. That seems like the minimum price this time around considering the Switch OLED itself is still $350, and while the Switch 2 is rumored to have a cheaper LCD screen, its other features, including the Joy-Con with mouse-like functionality, are a lot beefier this time around. </p><p>  <strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">21 Games We’d Love To See On The Nintendo Switch 2</a></span></p><p>Polygon also notes that Nintendo has a history of trying to undercut its competition when it comes to price. This is the tradition of “affordability” Furukawa was referencing in this week’s call. But that will be harder to do late into a console generation where the disc-less PS5 is $450 (<em>up</em> from its 2020 launch price of $400). The current cheapest Steam Deck is also $400, though you can also get refurbished ones for under $300 when they’re available. </p><p>My own gut tells me that making the Switch 2 cost $400 is the logical play here, with $450 the absolute max the company can charge, unless it debuts something truly stunning during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">its April Switch 2 Direct</a></span> that will get people excited to upgrade. I showed my kids the original Switch 2 reveal and they haven’t asked about it again at all, content to keep toiling away in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> and <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>. </p><p>Families without a parent that writes about video games for a living might feel similarly unmoved about upgrading early if the price is too high. But all of that will depend on everything Nintendo still hasn’t told us about it’s next console. We’ll have to wait a couple more months for that info too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It’s been a great launch for Warhorse Studios’ Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 as the studio has announced that the game has sold one million copies in a little over a day on the market.</p>



<p>“Over a million of you have stepped into our world,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1887155255130866099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on social media</a>. “We’re beyond grateful for your support – thank you for making [Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2] a triumph!</p>



<p>In Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, our Grant Taylor-Hill called the game a “masterpiece”. </p>



<p>“Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is beautiful in every aspect,” the review reads. “It’s deeply authentic and riddled with emotion and catharsis, and the way the story comes together is just perfection.”</p>

<p>He also said: “This monumental medieval adventure will have you living a double life – but in this one, you’re a brave adventurer exploring the most faithful recreation of a real place I’ve ever seen. From ethereal sequences packed with tearjerker scenes to a phenomenal weather engine, and from genuinely interesting side activities to a neat little photo mode, I cannot find one major fault with this game.”</p>

The Traveler intervened at the 11th hour, but the damage was done and a new dark age began. During this time, Guardians rose to become the protectors of our species, and centuries later, a new order was established.</p><p>That's where newcomers start in Destiny 2, as you'll be cast as a freshly resurrected Guardian tasked with keeping humanity safe. That's easier said than done, as with numerous hostile alien species wandering the solar system, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can choose to grab a three-item bundle for just $5, six items for $10, and the full bundle for $20.</p><p>The game is an MMO-style online firt-person-shooter that can be played solo or cooperatively, with optional PvP content as well, where the best elements take the form of complex co-op content that involves puzzle-laden dungeons and raids.</p><h3>Pay $5 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $10 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li></ul><h3>Pay $20 or more</h3><ul><li>Destiny 2: Forsaken Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: Shadowkeep expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Beyond Light expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</li><li>Destiny 2: The Witch Queen expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: Lightfall expansion</li><li>Destiny 2: The Final Shape and Annual Pass expansion</li></ul><p>There are some things to note with this collection. 2018's Forsaken campaign is no longer accessible in Destiny 2--although you can play a few highlight missions--and the pack for it gives you access to a selection of powerful Exotic weapons and armor that you can earn in the game. The campaign for every expansion since Shadowkeep is still accessible, and while these can be hit-or-miss in their design, they're generally fun to play in a binge gaming session.</p><p>You will need Destiny 2, but the good news is that the game is free to download. The real gem here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a>, Destiny 2's best expansion thanks to its killer storyline, exciting Prismatic powers, and coolest weapons.

                <p>Electronic Arts has said that it might move around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s release window depending on which other games get released around the same time, presumably referring to GTA 6.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent investors call</a>, CEO Andrew Wilson said, "I do believe that this year might be a nuance to year relative to competition. There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing." While he didn't explicitly name any games that could impact Battlefield 6's release date, it's obvious that GTA 6 is one of them. GTA 6 is currently set to release in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Fall 2025</a>, but it's always possible that it could be delayed.</p>

      </div>
<p>Yesterday, EA revealed that Battlefield 6 is due out during its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">2026 fiscal year</a>, meaning that it'll release sometime between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. Battlefield games traditionally launch during fall, with the current rumor being an October 2025 release. However, if GTA 6 launches close to that time, EA is certainly willing to pivot.</p><p>Wilson said, "But if we got close to that timeframe and believe that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player-acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be."</p><p>Players can get a chance to test out the new Battlefield early through EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs community program soon</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/galaxy-s25-ultra-vs-iphone-16-pro-max-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Samsung announced its highly anticipated Galaxy S25 lineup last month, which comes with more or less the same design, but the internals have been improved a lot. The raw computational and graphical performance is far superior to the company's Galaxy S24 lineup, and it will make a lot of difference if you are into mobile gaming. A new comparison test was conducted between the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and the gaming performance reflects which device is better at running Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<h2>iPhone 16 Pro Max roasts the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact with a solid 95 FPS average compared to the latter's 60 FPS</h2>
<p>The App Store and Play Store offer a wide range of high-end games that make the right use of the chips in the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A new comparison test conducted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DameTech">Dame Tech on YouTube</a> highlights the performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra against the iPhone 16 Pro Max in Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves. The test will detail the FPS of both games, along with performance throttling and power usage on the flagship smartphones and how they compare against each other.</p>
<p>One important aspect to note at this point is that the iPhone has been the top-performing gaming device. Dame Tech mentions that despite the Galaxy S25 Ultra's exclusive high-resolution settings for games, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a better in-game resolution. We also have to take note that the Snapdragon 8 Elite's <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-chip-for-galaxy-s25-is-faster/">exclusive chip</a> has better performance on paper, and it is reflected in the overall performance of both Genshin Impact and Wuthering Waves.</p>
<p>As can be seen in the comparison video below, the game settings were set to maximum, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra maintains a solid 59.2 FPS across Wuthering Waves with minor ups and downs. Additionally, the game plays smoothly with no stutter whatsoever, which goes on to show that Snapdragon's exclusive chip for the Galaxy S25 Ultra is pushing performance on par with the latest iPhone 16 Pro Max, which scored 59 FPS.</p>
<p>However, we have to consider the higher power draw for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, taking in as much as 7.2 Watts against 5.4 Watts on the iPhone. Additionally, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was played at a higher 1705 x 786 resolution compared to the Galaxy. Moreover, the test also revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro Max maintained almost the same level of frame rates while running more than 10 degrees cooler than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It clearly shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/snapdragon-8-elite-performance-cores-overclocked-can-beat-a18-pro-in-single-score-benchmark/">A18 Pro chip</a> is handling the high-end game quite easily compared to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the iPhone 16 Pro Max crushes the Galaxy S25 Ultra in Genshin Impact on the highest settings, maintaining 95.2 FPS on average and reaching as high as 120 FPS on several occasions at a higher resolution. The Galaxy S25 Ultra seems to be running at a steady 60 FPS, likely due to a frame rate cap implemented by the game developers. The iPhone 16 Pro Max also ran a few degrees cooler.</p>

<p>While the iPhone 16 Pro Max performed better, Samsung has finally introduced a device that can compete against the iPhone. In addition, it is possibly the best gaming smartphone when it comes to competition from Android. We will share more details on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and its performance, so do stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny, culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As we settle in for the long, excruciating wait for more tangible news on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has thrown us a little extra nugget of information. While we knew the company was planning to share more about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24236766/nintendo-switch-2-games-direct-date-time">on April 2nd</a>, now we have a time: 9 AM ET / 6 AM PT / 10 PM JST. If you were taking bets on this time, you would have won handily as this is generally the usual time Nintendo holds its big events. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fsuccessor%2Fen-us%2Fnintendo-direct%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored">The announcement on Nintendo’s website</a> didn’t contain any extra detail about the duration of the event or the exact breakdown of topics that’ll be covered, other than to say it “will share a closer look” at the new device.</p><p>Last month, the company finally confirmed the existence of its new console dubbed, helpfully, the Switch 2. The reveal itself was sparse on detail, only confirming that the console would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24345191/nintendo-switch-2-bigger-screen">be larger than its predecessor</a> and that its Joy-Con controllers appear to attach <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343722/switch-2-joy-cons-details-magnets-drift-nintendo">via some kind of magnetic action</a>. Because of the reveal’s relative lack of concrete information, we’re left with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24344718/nintendo-switch-2-specs-date-price-launch-games-mario-kart">so many questions about the new console</a>. Nevertheless, there was still lots of speculation about what the Switch 2 could possibly do. Theories were put forth that the new Joy-Cons contained some kind of mouse functionality and that the extra button on the right Joy-Con was related to some kind of party chat feature. Hopefully, Nintendo will let us know those if theories were correct during the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, April 2nd bright and early at 9 AM.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo has added a small but important detail about the Switch 2 Direct on April 2: It will begin at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. The streaming event will be focused on the recently revealed system and promises "a closer look at <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1887139391266558216" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Nintendo revealed the specific starting time for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct in April</a>. The event was previously unveiled when the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">officially pulled back the curtain on Switch 2</a> last month with a reveal trailer. So far, Nintendo has confirmed the name for the system and what it looks like, but a lot of information is still missing. For instance, there is no release date, price, or launch lineup for Switch 2--particulars that should be addressed at the Direct in April.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 will be backwards compatible with Switch games--with some caveats</a>. Super Mario Bros. Wonder was showcased as a game that will work on both consoles. We know that the Joy-Cons are bigger and attach via a magnetic system, instead of sliding onto the tablet with rails. We also know that Nintendo is strongly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">teasing a new Mario Kart game for the system</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, EA CEO Andrew Wilson hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/">the Madden NFL and EA Sports FC franchises could appear on Switch 2</a>. They join a long list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">rumored games for Switch 2</a>, such as Assassin's Creed Shadows, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and Halo: The Master Chief Collection. It's also unclear if first-party games previously announced for the original Switch, such as Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, could make an appearance on the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the Nintendo Direct, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Nintendo is also holding Switch 2 experience events</a> in cities across the world. They begin in early April in places like New York City and Paris, continuing into May in Amsterdam and Seoul.</p>

console and that Nintendo could always lower the price in the future.</p><p>MIDiA's Rhys Elliot did note that if the Switch 2 is in short supply at launch--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-making-preparations-to-discourage-potential-switch-2-scalpers/1100-6529220/">something Nintendo is aiming to avoid</a>--the price could start at $500. Manufacturing costs could also play a role in the Switch 2 having a high launch price, as Nintendo's business currently relies heavily on generating profit from Switch console sales. Overall, Elliot does expect $400 to be the sweet spot for the Switch 2 when it eventually arrives.</p><p>At $400, the Switch 2 launch price will be considerably higher than the current Switch console's $300 price tag, while the OLED model retails for $350. At the same time, this does make it more affordable than most handheld gaming PCs, as depending on the model and its configuration, they typically start from around $500 and can be as expensive as $800.</p><p>The Switch 2 could also be good value for money <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">thanks to backwards compatibility</a>, and with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-4-is-still-coming-out-in-2025/1100-6529216/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Pokemon Legends Z-A sharing the same 2025 launch window</a>, analysts are predicting that it'll be a big seller for Nintendo this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/605588/rift-of-the-necrodancer-review-music-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>, a new music game from the creators of the music roguelike <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em>, solves the problem of exploring a big library of tracks with a simple idea: a story mode.</p><p>In <em>Rift</em>, you have to press buttons in time with notes that appear on lanes in front of you, similar to games like <em>Guitar Hero</em>. You only have three lanes to worry about, but the tracks get complex because the “notes” are actually enemies with different movement patterns. A green slime just takes one hit to defeat, for example, but a gold bat takes three beats to eliminate, and with each hit, it hops to another lane.</p><p>If you want, you can immediately jump into the game’s library, which features more than 30 tracks. (Though you’ll need to accrue “diamonds” to unlock some of them.) The songs are killer — I happily tapped my foot to just about every one I played. But because the songs are originals, there aren’t familiar licensed tunes to jump into like with <em>Guitar Hero,</em> so it can be daunting to know where to start.</p><p>That’s why I played <em>Rift</em>’s story mode. The plot doesn’t really matter — you play as Cadence, the main character from <em>Crypt</em>, as you try and solve the mystery of the rifts that spawn the monsters in the songs — but it provides a logical way to work through the music, especially as the songs ramp up in difficulty. It’s kind of like an album: <em>Rift</em>’s songs have clearly been put in a certain order with intention, and playing through that order through the story mode is a great way to experience them, at least at first. There are fun <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11157462/rhythm-heaven-megamix-nintendo-3ds"><em>Rhythm Heaven</em>-like minigames</a>, epic boss battles, and charming cartoon art to accompany the story beats, too. (If you’ve played <em>Crypt</em>, you’ll recognize some familiar faces.)</p><p>Even on medium difficulty, <em>Rift</em> can get <em>tough</em>. In some of the later tracks, the tempo is fast, and the monsters fly down the lanes at a rapid rate and in tricky combinations. Fortunately, the game has a great practice mode that lets you repeat specific portions of songs at a significantly reduced speed so that you can get your timing down. You can also ease down to a lower difficulty whenever you want. And one time, I failed a song enough times that the game told me I could move on without finishing it. While I appreciated the gesture, it made me more determined to beat it. Which I did!</p><p>It took me about five hours to play through <em>Rift</em>’s story. When I was done, I was surprised to find myself immediately jumping into the game’s full tracklist to play some songs again. If I hadn’t played through the story mode, I might not have discovered some of the game’s best music.</p><p>Rift of the NecroDancer<em> launches today on PC.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We knew it was coming, but Nintendo has now confirmed an exact time for its dedicated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> Direct.</p>
<p>The company will host a Nintendo Direct focused on its upcoming Switch successor on 2nd April, at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>For those of you sitting across the pond, that's 6am PST.</p>

</figure>
<p>But while Nintendo has now shared an actual time for its Direct with us all, it is still keeping further specifics under wraps for now. The upcoming showcase will simply offer "a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2", is all the company has said for the time being.</p>
<p>Even so, from the earlier Switch 2 reveal, we can presume we will hear more about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Joy-Con's apparent mouse functionality</a>, and maybe even discover what exactly that mysterious button on the right-hand Joy-Con does.</p>
<p>We should also hear more about what games will be heading to Switch 2. Last month's announcement teaser did give us a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">glimpse of a new Mario Kart title</a>, complete with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">fresh looking Donkey Kong</a>. Maybe we will find out if a theory currently making the rounds, which suggests the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">addition of fuel tanks in Mario Kart may shake up gameplay</a>, will prove accurate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it has been a hot minute since we last heard anything on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-in-development Metroid Prime 4</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, but perhaps this will change on 2nd April.</p>
<p>Nintendo will hopefully give us a release date too. For now, the console still just has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">vague 2025 window tied to it</a>. What do you think (or hope) we will see?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo-related news, EA has become one of the first publishers to discuss - in broad terms - its plans for Switch 2. In fact, the company has implied it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-eyeing-nintendo-switch-2-for-several-key-franchises">has its eye on Nintendo's console for several of its key franchises</a>, including EA Sports FC and Madden.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Exclusives Are Essential to Its Success, Says CEO]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-exclusives-are-essential-to-its-success-says-ceo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be fully backward compatible with Switch titles. However, fans have been wondering for how long Nintendo would continue to release games for the original Switch.</p>
<p>Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa touched on the subject in the company's usual post-quarterly earnings <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q&amp;A with investors</a>. The executive said that more original Switch games will be made, but at the same time, he highlighted the importance of Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p><em>We have already announced Pokémon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4 Beyond for Nintendo Switch in 2025. We will continue developing Nintendo Switch titles, but launching exclusive games for Nintendo Switch 2 is essential for its success. However, we aim to ensure a smooth transition between the two platforms.</em></p>
<p>This tells us that it may not be long before we get the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, as Nintendo has a vested interest in getting users to transition from one generation to another. Besides, the original Switch is clearly on a downward trajectory for its sales, as evidenced even in the last quarter during which 'only' 4.82 million units were sold. Still, it was enough to allow the hybrid console to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">break the big 150 million sales milestone</a>.</p>
<p>Third-party may leave behind the original Nintendo Switch even quicker. Since they already largely switched from PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X as the default targets for new games, it won't make much sense for them to spend time trying to make more complex titles fit the aging Switch hardware when there's a new platform with support for technologies like NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS).</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Nintendo Switch 2 is slated to launch later this year. Between April and June, hands-on events will take place worldwide; before that, on April 2, Nintendo will unveil many more details about the new console. So far, analysts have <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-hit-all-the-right-notes-according-to-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">responded positively</a> to the brief teaser trailer shared in January.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flopped-because-of-no-shared-world-elements-ea-says.1100790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new financial earnings call for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and in the call, CEO Andrew Wilson expresses what appears to be a theory as to why&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped.</p>

<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>and flagship sports game&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>had both "underperformed", and in the new <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">call</a>, Wilson seems to draw a link between&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s failure and its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>He says EA's games need to "directly connect" to players, who he says "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement". That's likely a reference to&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s nature as a single-player-only title, rather than a game with multiplayer elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=2SNx5ha0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-flop-live-service-ea-archery.jpg?itok=Hahr8U2D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA seems to think&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped because it had no "shared world elements".</figcaption></figure><p>At one stage, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-past-and-present-of-dragon-age-4-1833913351" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>&nbsp;that a version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>(which didn't have its name yet at this point) which would incorporate live service elements was in development.</p>

<p>However, this version was subsequently scrapped (assuming the reports of its existence are correct), leading to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s single-player focus. It seems that EA's management now regrets getting rid of those live service elements.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have performed any better if it did have the "shared world" elements EA seems so wistful about. After all,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a live service title, and it, too, underperformed.</p>

<p>Wilson, however, puts this down to people sticking with previous&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>titles and not buying the new one, as well as "lower-than-expected engagement" due to "specific issues with balance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=aO4FZa9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=T3jxwU9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance had nothing to do with live service, but&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s apparently did. Hmm.</figcaption></figure><p>I can't imagine that many of the people who felt dissatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have been happier if the game had featured the "shared world elements" EA regrets not putting in, honestly.</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine that direction would have prevented the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare layoffs that followed</a>, nor the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departure</a> of <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>director Corinne Busche from the studio.</p>

<p>In any case, EA is probably looking very carefully at the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game now. I'd be very surprised indeed if the publisher didn't try to ensure that some sort of "shared world elements" are present in that game, so we'll have to see how&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>(name obviously not final) performs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the call, EA confirms that the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will be launching in 2026 and reaffirms that you can sign up to get a chance to test it right now via the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>.</p>

<p>The company also commits to a new $1 billion share buyback scheme, which feels like exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from a studio that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">paid its CEO $25 million in 2023</a> despite hundreds of layoffs. Stay tuned for more.</p>

And...yeah! It’s looking good. It’s looking like if the director of <em>Monsters</em> made a <em>Jurassic World</em> movie. For good reason.</p><p>Set five years after 2022's abysmal&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>, this seventh movie in the franchise appears to be a new attempt at a fresh start, with an entirely new cast and director Gareth Edwards helming the project. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey as a team of action-paleontologists, sent to what <em>might</em> be Isla Sorna (it’s referred to in the trailer as the research island for the original park) to recover DNA from the three largest dinos living on the island. Why? For a miracle drug to help humanity.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196046" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond In Stars And Time" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="61" data-playlist="196046,196181,197298" data-current="196046"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond In Stars And Time</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196046/196046_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196046/196046_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196046/196046_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196046/196046_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21571.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While there, the team encounters the all-important family of holidayers, whose boat was overturned by naughty aquatic beasties, ensuring we have the essential mix of scientists and civilians the franchise requires.</p><p>This attempt to step away from the oh-so cynical nature of the recent trilogy seems a very smart move, and the complete absence of Chris Pratt whistling and pointing at raptors is a great pleasure. <em>Rebirth</em> feels very much like a move to get back to Spielberg’s original vision for the franchise: a few humans trapped on an island with a squillion giant reptiles that want to eat them.</p><p>Director Gareth Edwards is probably best known for 2014's <em>Godzilla</em> and 2016's <em>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story</em>, but is at his best when working with a far smaller budget on an original idea. 2010's <em>Monsters</em>, his first movie, remains by <em>far </em>his best (seriously, if you’ve not watched this, grab it with both hands), while 2023 saw him return to his roots with the lower-key sci-fi oddity, <em>The Creator</em>. It’ll be interesting to see if his long absence from enormo-budget filmmaking will have allowed a better focus of his more personal, tell-don’t-show attitude toward threats, when applied to a crowd-pleaser like <em>Jurassic Park</em>/<em>World</em>. The trailer seems positive, to me. Sure, there are loads of dinosaurs, because of course there are, but it all feels more cramped, more claustrophobic, than the bland photography of the three previous films.</p><p>We’ll find out if it all comes together on July 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/overactive-media-cdl-major-in-madrid-results/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OverActive Media, the parent company behind the Call of Duty League’s Toronto Ultra, has published a statement following the recent Major tournament held in Madrid, Spain. In a press release, it was confirmed that Major I, the first sizeable tournament of the CDL 2025 season, was ‘the most successful Major (they) have ever hosted’.</p>



<p>It was revealed that 80% of attendees at the venue in the Spanish city were from <strong>outside </strong>the country and that 12,000 people in total flocked to the Caja Mágica arena.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-defining-moment">‘A Defining Moment’</h2>



<p>OverActive Media’s CEO, Adam Adamou, explained in the press release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>By bringing together top-tier talent, innovative strategies, and fresh ideas, we are strengthening our connections with fans while unlocking new revenue streams and growth opportunities. </p>



<p>The energy in&nbsp;Madrid&nbsp;and the success of our acquisitions reaffirm our commitment to building a global esports company that entertains millions while creating sustainable growth.</p>



<p>Call of Duty League Major I was the most successful Major we have ever hosted. We sold more than 12,000 tickets, with more than 80% traveling from outside&nbsp;Spain, driving tourism and significant economic impact for the local community. </p>



<p>The energy in the arena, the intense competition, and the global engagement made this event a defining moment for the Call of Duty League and a clear statement on the sustainable growth of our esports presence in&nbsp;Europe.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I had the pleasure of attending the CDL Major in Madrid and caught up with many of the best Call of Duty players in the world. I was able to sit down with Atlanta FaZe, the team that won the tournament after a gruelling Grand Final against the LA Thieves.</p>



<p>The CDL Major I event was a boon to kickstart the latest competitive season. More than 233,000 consecutive viewers tuned in from around the world, and the showcase proved that Europe can be one of the most lucrative regions to host further Call of Duty events. This was the first CDL Major to take place in Europe in the history of the tournament.</p>



<p>Next, the Call of Duty League will head back to the United States, with Major II taking place in Texas in March 2025.</p>



<p>Later this year, in the summer, Toronto Ultra will host another CDL event – the Call of Duty League Championship tournament in Canada.</p>

After skipping the entire Switch generation, EA CEO Andrew Wilson has hinted that the Madden NFL series could return to Nintendo for the upcoming console. The last time an entry in the sports franchise released on a Nintendo platform was Madden NFL 13 on Wii and Wii U in 2012.</p><p dir="ltr">Wilson was found name-dropping the Madden and EA Sports FC franchises for Switch 2 <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">during an earnings call</a> earlier this week. "... Any time a new console comes into the marketplace, that's of a benefit to us," said Wilson. "It gives us the ability to access and acquire new players. Typically, we've had franchises perform very well on Nintendo platforms. Certainly, our expectation is that products like [EA Sports] FC and Madden and others might find real energy on the platform as they have done in the past."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2066592013"

The latest release was EA Sports FC 25 this past September. However, the soccer games released on Switch have been heavily criticized. Meanwhile, Madden has been a complete no-show. Overall, EA has been selective with support for Switch, with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-might-finally-get-a-sims-game-but-maybe-not-the-one-you-expect/1100-6526093/">My Sims: Cozy Bundle</a>, It Takes Two, and Apex Legends coming to the console over the years. Looking ahead, EA just teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/">the next entry in the Battlefield series</a> while also introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/">the community-testing program Battlefield Labs</a>. There's been no mention of a Switch 2 release for it, though.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/">Nintendo finally unveiled Switch 2</a> last month, showing off magnetic Joy-Cons and an apparently new Mario Kart game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/onimusha-2-remaster-capcom-fighting-collection-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that a remaster of PS2 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and we now also have a release date for the upcoming retro pack&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

<p>During a livestream, Capcom revealed the&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster, which will come to last-gen consoles, Switch, and PC sometime this year. Strangely enough, it doesn't seem to be getting a native PS5 or Xbox Series X|S version, although you will likely be able to play it on those machines.</p>

<p>We don't know exactly what features the remaster will boast, but it's likely to sport revamped visuals and improved gameplay, so if you found the original&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>a bit too clunky in its PS2-era iteration, you'll probably want to check this out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-remaster-gogandantess.jpg?itok=rw6mI1W2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-remaster-gogandantess.jpg?itok=WwFQvPtU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The demon swordsman Gogandantess returns this year in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>It's likely Capcom is reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>in order to drum up interest in the series ahead of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, the next major entry in the series, which is due to land sometime next year. It'll serve that purpose alongside the&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">anime</a>, which aired on Netflix in 2023.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why the studio hasn't chosen to remaster the first game, that's probably because a remastered version is already available across PC and last-gen machines.</p>

<p>As well as the<em>&nbsp;Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster, Capcom also revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2&nbsp;</em>during the aforementioned livestream. The game will hit PC, Switch, and last-gen consoles on May 16th, and pre-orders are open now if that's your thing.</p>




<p><em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2&nbsp;</em>will feature eight retro Capcom fighting gems, and there's only one&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>game in the collection as well, which arguably shows a pretty significant degree of restraint. Here's the full list!</p>

<ul><li><em>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</em></li>
	<li><em>Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001</em></li>
	<li><em>Capcom Fighting Evolution</em></li>
	<li><em>Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER</em></li>
	<li><em>Project Justice</em></li>
	<li><em>Power Stone</em></li>
	<li><em>Power Stone 2</em></li>
	<li><i>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</i></li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect from a modern fighting game, all of these games will support online play, and they'll boast rollback netcode as well.</p>

<p>Due to recent feedback, Pokemon TCG Pocket announced that players will receive 1,000 Trade Tokens as a Gift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading feature has received a lot of criticism since its release, primarily due to the features’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restrictions</a> and the cost of trades (tokens). Many players have complained about the price being too high to perform a sufficient number of trades, and there aren’t many ways to earn them either. Due to this feedback, TCG Pocket has <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1887035219351368102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">decided</a> to gift players 1,000 free Trade Tokens while they investigate ways to improve the feature.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-free-1-000-trade-tokens-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-nbsp">How to Claim Free 1,000 Trade Tokens in Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers have made it simple for players to claim these free Trade Tokens. All they need to do is visit the Gifts menu, which players can access by clicking the icon on the top right corner of the home screen. Here, they will find a gift from the development team, which includes 1,000 Trade Tokens. Click on the ‘Claim’ button to add the tokens to your inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-space-time-smackdown-emblem-event">Space-Time Smackdown Emblem Event </h2>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket has recently released its Space-Time Smackdown expansion, which introduces over 140 cards from the Sinnoh region, along with legendary Pokemon like Dialga and Palkia. The developers currently host an <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1886942825222168827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emblem event</a> where players can earn emblems depending on their wins against other players. One win will provide a participation emblem, five wins will get you a bronze emblem, 25 wins will get you a silver emblem, and 45 wins will let you earn a Gold Emblem. Players can also complete other missions to gain items like Shinedust and more.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Spider-Man 2 had a bit of a rough landing on PC last week, the game getting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/01/spider-man-2-pc-port-gets-a-rough-reception-over-performance-and-graphical-issues/">a resoundingly ‘mixed’ reception</a> in the community-led Steam reviews, but is it really as bad as that made it sound?</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/second-spider-man-2-pc-hotfix-targets-crashes-frame-rate-blockers-and-missing-achievements/">two hotfix updates</a> on either side of the weekend, the most significant game crashing bugs should have been stamped out already, and awareness over the need to install the latest GPU drivers (even the sneaky optional ones) has also spread. That should leave performance as the main bugbear to address,</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 - Launch Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzlOQoG8TE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We’ve tested the game across two configurations. For one it’s a Ryzen 5900X paired with a Radeon RX 6800, and in the other a Ryzen 5800X with a GeForce RTX 3070, both combinations that’s are step ahead of the base PS5 and one dose of PSSR behind the PS5 Pro for the RX 6800. From the system requirements table, it’s good for 1440p at high graphics settings, without ray tracing, but from a couple hours of experimentation, it’s far more capable and flexible than that.</p>
<p>The first hurdle before getting into the game, though, was needing to update the graphics drivers. The most recent standard drivers from AMD are from December 2024, but Spider-Man 2 support comes in the “optional” 25.1.1 update that isn’t offered up by default in the Radeon software. Without that you get a mean looking warning screen when trying to launch the game!</p>

<p>But once in the game and with the default 1440p and high preset, the game runs at a nice and pretty much locked 60fps, thanks in no small part to the excellent dynamic resolution scaling used to hit a frame rate target, using any of FSR, DLSS, XeSS or Insomniac’s own IGTI to upscale. Disable dynamic resolutions and upscaling and the RX 6800 still does a solid job of staying above 60, only really dipping to the mid-high 50s during the most stressful moments.</p>

<p>Adding ray tracing into the mix – there’s settings for ray-traced reflections, interiors, shadows and ambient occlusion, as well as object range, and Nvidia’s ray reconstruction &nbsp;– and that naturally pushes things harder. Without upscaling, performance on the RX 6800 with ‘High’ ray tracing at 1440p dropped the lower parts of the curve to the 40s, while ‘Very High’ is better thought of as a 30fps mode here – it often clings to the upper 20s.</p>
<p>It is worth it, if you have a beefy enough GPU. The ‘High’ preset is amusingly named as the minimum bar for ray tracing effects, adding RT reflections and RT interiors for the game’s cunning building interior trick. The problem is that it’s a rather fuzzy looking effect that shimmers a lot on window edges and affects even the shiny chrome on cars, regardless of resolution or upscaling technique. Once you switch to ‘Very High’ the reflection quality is improved dramatically, but you also get RT shadows and RT ambient occlusion, which much better place objects in the world. Still, bumping up just RT reflections to Very High is the most impactful improvement.</p>

<p>If performance is on the cusp, you can step the resolution down to 1080p and get a bit of a frame rate bump, or just let the dynamic resolution take over with a target of 60fps, maintaining the 1440p highs for whenever the engine can handle it, and making up the difference with upscaling.</p>
<p>It’s a similar story with the RTX 3070, where 60fps is readily achievable on the ‘High’ preset without ray tracing, though the introduction of ‘High’ ray tracing seems to come at a greater cost than that seen with the RX 6800, dropping into the 30s when the on-screen action is at its most hectic – we’d suspect that the 8GB of VRAM on this card is having an impact here, in tandem with DirectStorage using the GPU to decompress textures from the SSD.</p>
<p>Either way there’s still greater headroom and more incremental control in Spider-Man 2 on PC to outperform the base PS5 version, and the PS5 Pro update, if your rig is capable of it. That’s similar to that found in the PC port of the original Spider-Man, but it’s fair to say that the baseline has been raised.</p>
<p>One of the great things about Spider-Man 2 is being able to quickly toggle between all manner of graphical settings with a rendered scene shown in the background of the menu. It is near instantaneous when toggling on PS5 Pro, but on PC and with so many hardware variables, it triggers a shader recompilation step with any significant changes – if you don’t let these process, there can also be shader compilation hitches during gameplay, and it will take a while for RT effects to actually start rendering.</p>

<p>While it comes with a performance cost, I would definitely recommend at least turning on ray traced reflections. There’s fewer fallback cube map reflections in Spider-Man 2, since playing without RT is not an option on PS5. Cars do have a minimal skybox reflection, but there’s basically no reflections on building windows and sky scrapers, making them look very flat and lifeless when the mirror-like buildings are so much a part of New York’s identity.</p>
<p>In general, we haven’t found anywhere near the kinds of issues that have seen the game receive a wash of negative reviews on Steam. Some of those were due to game crashes that a hotfix was released to address by the weekend, while others complained about performance. Of course, we’ve been talking and playing with 60fps in mind throughout here, purely from the age and specs of our GPUs, but anyone with an RTX 4080, RTX 4090, or Radeon 7900 XT is going to be expecting frame rates pushing toward triple figures, and that colours the perspective.</p>
<p>In our experience, you’re not relying too heavily on dynamic resolutions and upscaling to high the graphics presets provided by Sony, but there’s plenty of scope to tweak settings and apply some upscaling to get core ray tracing features and a solid 60fps performance that matches or betters the game on PS5. All in all, Spider-Man 2 on PC has proven to be a reliable performer in both of our use cases.</p>

			<p>Ninja Gaiden 2 has been long considered among the finest character action games ever released, but a complete newcomer to the series will hardly feel the same when playing any of the game's iterations, including the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a>. The game developed by Team NINJA is unlike action games from other studios like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, as it is a game that pushes players to play as optimally as possible, not just to hit high scores as in the Bayonetta series but to actually survive combat encounters, which can get hectic fast.</p>
<p>As such, the best way to understand the brilliance of the Ninja Gaiden 2 Black experience is to learn and master the game, starting with some essential techniques that will help you during your first playthrough and teach you how to handle the game's many challenges to take on higher difficulty settings.</p>
<h2>Stand Your Ground</h2>

<p>Unlike other action games, blocking in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is an extremely powerful defensive technique that is way more effective than dodging in the vast majority of combat scenarios. As such, don't hesitate to keep the block button pushed down as enemies come at you, as you will be able to negate all damage safely. Sometimes, your guard may be broken, but you can easily avoid damage by pushing the left stick in the direction you want to dodge. Blocking will also become available as soon as the dodging animation is complete, allowing you to continue negating damage.</p>
<p>By just defending, however, you aren't going to defeat your enemies, so you should use blocking to learn enemy patterns and unleash combos and special techniques when it is safe to do so. Think of offense and defense in Ninja Gaiden 2 as in a fighting game, where some moves are safe on block and some aren't.</p>
<h2>Master Flying Swallow and Izuna Drop</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135242_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While each weapon has tons of combos and special techniques, which are further expanded with upgrades, there are some techniques that are absolutely essential to master. The first one is the Flying Swallow, a special aerial attack that can be used by jumping and pressing heavy attack and a direction to safely attack enemies and quickly reposition if needed. The second one is the iconic Izuna Drop, which is unleashed with select weapons by launching an enemy in the air and hitting them with three light attacks and one heavy attack. What makes this technique so useful is the fact that it instantly kills enemies.</p>
<p>The best thing about these two techniques is that they are available for use right from the very beginning of the game, as it is possible to perform them with Ryu's starting weapon, the Dragon Sword. They can be used with other weapons as well, so experiment with them to find which works best for you.</p>
<h2>Take Advantage of Ninpo Spells' Invincibility</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135610_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninpo Spells are another important part of Ryu Hayabusa's arsenal in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, as they can be used to unleash some rather powerful attacks. What makes them more useful than they may look at a glance is the invincibility some of them grant before the spell goes off. Use this invincibility window to get some heat off of you.</p>
<h2>Learn When to Use Ultimate Techniques Properly</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250205135327_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimate Techniques are among the least used combat techniques in Ninja Gaiden 2 Black by beginners, as they can be difficult to use properly with little knowledge of enemies' patterns and abilities as they require charging. However, you really should learn how to use them properly if you want to truly master the game, as they are extremely powerful and they can clear enemy groups in very little time.</p>
<p>The best way to use Ultimate Techniques properly is to start charging them when there's Essence floating around, which speeds up the charging process considerably once absorbed. As such, you will want to not absorb the resource right after an enemy is defeated, and there are two ways to do this: you either keep yourself away from it as much as possible, or you keep blocking. Position yourself properly by jumping and then blocking as soon as you land, start charging your Ultimate Attack, and watch your enemies explode in a glorious, gory mess.</p>
<h2>Watch and Adapt</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250129191059_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Despite the general high speed of the experience, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black wants players to really look at enemies and not just to learn their attack patterns. After dealing some damage, Ryu may cut limbs from enemies, which not only limits their abilities, although they get access to desperate and damaging new attacks,&nbsp; but makes them susceptible to dismemberment, which can be accomplished by hitting them with a heavy attack. Given how important it is to reduce enemy numbers as quickly as possible, always keep an eye on the enemy's current state, and unleash insta-kill attacks as soon as possible!</p>

Not only do we have the launch of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-says-its-taking-all-possible-measures-to-beat-switch-2-scalpers">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its exclusive games to contend with, but we’ve got a long list of big hitters set for later in 2025, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>. And then there’s the inevitable new Call of Duty from Activision, no doubt set for October or November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the big one is Rockstar’s guaranteed behemoth <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which is still down for release in fall 2025 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Will it be delayed? Parent company Take-Two is so far sticking to the fall 2025 release window, but it’s that uncertainty coupled with all the other huge shooters coming out that means EA’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-new-battlefield-gameplay-as-ea-reveals-battlefield-labs">Battlefield</a> may face a tricky job carving out some space for itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA has the next Battlefield down for its 2026 fiscal year, which means before April 2026. That’s prime GTA 6 territory right there, and maybe even prime Call of Duty and Borderlands 4 territory. So, how much does EA have to consider release dates from competing games when it comes to working out when to launch Battlefield?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fair bit, EA CEO Andrew Wilson admitted in a recent financial call — and it may even be willing to delay Battlefield if it has to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Certainly we exist in a competitive marketplace,” Wilson said in response to a question from an analyst on this exact topic. “I've had the great fortune to be in this company for 25 years and we have done a great job of competing with all of our great franchises over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That being said, we've invested more in this Battlefield than any Battlefield before. We have four studios. We've had a meaningful amount of time. We're looking for this to be the biggest Battlefield we've ever made. And we of course want to make sure that we launch that into a window where we can deliver on the fullness of the promise of what Battlefield can be and grow the community to a level that is commensurate with the size of the game that we're making.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do believe that this year might be a nuanced year relative to competition. There may be some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing. We have an FY 26 launch window that the team is targeting. We believe the game will be great and ready at that time, but if we got close to that timeframe and believed that this wasn't going to be a great window for us, then we would take a look at what an alternate window might be that would give us the appropriate time, energy, and player acquisition opportunity for this Battlefield to be all that it needed to be.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, the new Battlefield will be out before April 2026. Let’s say November 2025 (Battlefield 2042 came out November 2021 and Battlefield 5 came out November 2018). What if GTA 6 launches in or around then? Perhaps EA will, in response, push Battlefield back to the first quarter of 2026, still making its fiscal year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what if it intends to release Battlefield Q1 2026 already, and then Rockstar announces a GTA 6 delay to Q1 2026? Could EA bring Battlefield forward? Or maybe it would, in that case, push Battlefield out of the fiscal year and into the next. That would be a big decision, but based on Wilson's comments, something EA is prepared for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see why EA, and, we’ve heard, many other third-party publishers are holding their breath as they wait for Rockstar to announce the news the entire industry is hanging on: the GTA 6 release date. Once that’s out in the open, whether it’s for this fall as planned or a delay into 2026, all the other pieces will fall no doubt into place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The developer was last week called "hilariously toxic," "predatory," and "downright greedy" after finally introducing trading to the trading card game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the standard Pokémon TCG Pocket mechanic that restricts players from opening packs or Wonder Picking or, now, trading too much without spending real world money, the feature was also introduced with these Trade Tokens as an extra restriction. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">Players criticized the high cost of obtaining these</a>, as they essentially had to delete from their collections five cards before trading one of the same rarity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Space Time Smackdown</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's now been eight days since Creatures Inc. released trading to the incredible backlash, but it did have a heads up that fans weren't impressed when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-trading-unveiled-but-is-so-poorly-received-the-developers-had-to-respond">it outlined the feature almost three weeks ago</a>. "Your concerns are seen," it said at the time. "Once this feature becomes available, I'd like to invite everyone to try it and provide feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This made many players believe things would be better than expected, but this wasn't certainly the case. Creatures Inc. eventually responded by admitting "some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy" trading.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also promised to alleviate complaints by introducing required items as rewards in upcoming events but has already failed to do so as the Cresselia ex Drop Event released February 3, includes none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans complained trading is fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month</a>, before trading was possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also evidenced by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, as if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 or more for a random chance of getting them. It cost one player around $1,500 just to complete the first set, for example, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-space-time-smackdown-expansion-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">the third in three months arrived last week</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
