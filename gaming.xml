		<p>With today’s PS5 Technical Presentation, Sony’s console Lead Architect Mark Cerny has revealed the PlayStation 5 Pro, detailing the enhanced and more powerful mid-generation upgrade to the PS5.</p>
<p>The presentation also confirms that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> will launch on 7th November 2024, costing $700 / £700 /€800 / ¥120,000. A disc drive is not included, but is an optional £100 add-on. A vertical stand is also an add-on at £25. Pre-orders will go live on 26th September 2024.</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro improves on the base PS5 in every measure. There is a bump in CPU performance, faster RAM, and a big boost to GPU performance up to 45% faster thanks to being 1.6 times the size, which should bring the 4K60 dreams that most gamers seem to have a bit closer to reality. The new generation of GPU will also bring enhanced ray tracing capabilities.</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;native 4K is still going to be pretty unlikely – that’s just no how games work anymore – and so Sony has also developed a custom in-house upscaling technique called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling). This aims to be best in class, going up against DLSS 3, FSR 3, XeSS and other temporal upscaling techniques.</p>

<p>The intention is to remove the decision between Fidelity and Performance modes. The examples used were of The Last of Us Part 2, Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart, giving Fidelity Mode graphics but at double the performance with 60FPS.</p>
<p>Advanced Ray Tracing will allow Gran Turismo 7 to bring ray tracing live in the races, as opposed to locking them to replays. Third party developers are also getting in on the act, with Hogwarts Legacy bringing greater reflections into the world.</p>
<p>Games enhanced for the new console will get a ‘PS5 Pro Enhanced’ label, while support is being added to:</p>
<p>Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Demon’s Souls, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Forbidden West, Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, The Crew Motorfest, The First Descendant, The Last of Us Part II Remastered, and more.</p>
<p>Even without native support, PS5 Pro Game Boost will be able to improve performance across the full range of PS5 and backward compatible PS4 games. Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to apply PSSR to the older games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-5-update-available-now-adding-three-new-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/honkai-star-rail-2-0-adds-penacony-realm-on-february-6/">Honkai: Star Rail</a> is now available for players to dive into, where they will finally be able to uncover the secrets of the Shackling Prison, experience the Wardance ceremony, and be introduced to powerful adversaries. Honkai: Star Rail version 2.5 also introduces three new characters for players to learn about. These characters are Feixiao, Lingsha and Moze, adding a new level of excitement to the game. For those who played Honkai: Star Rail 2.4, players were left on an intense cliffhanger, which will now be resolved in version 2.5, where players can continue the main questline and see more of the Xianzhou Luofu arc.</p>
<p>Version 2.5 of Honkai: Star Rail adds a lot to the game, especially with players finally getting to reach the climax of the silkpunk saga taking place in the Shackling Prison. A special Warp Event will take place to celebrate the first half of version 2.5, where players can pull for Robin, Black Swan, and Kafka. The Warp count for the guaranteed 5-star will be shared across rerun and current limited banners.</p>
<p>For those who want to get stuck into the Honkai: Star Rail 2.5 update, the update is already out across the globe. The update lasted five hours, but Honkai: Star Rail maintenance typically ends after four hours. Players get 300 Stellar Jade as compensation to make up for the downtime.</p>
<p>The official Honkai: Star Rail YouTube channel has also released a trailer that is just over two minutes long to showcase some of the storylines and characters players can expect to see in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Version 2.5 Trailer — &quot;Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue&quot; | Honkai: Star Rail" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMHigW8mq9g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are three new storylines, one of which is the continuation of Xianzhou Luofu- Finest Duel Under the Pristine Blue. This quest becomes permanently available after the update, with Trailblazers having to be Level 21 or above, as well as completing the prerequisite quests.</p>
<p>As stated above, there will also be a quest line for the Luminary Wardance, which also requires a Trailblaze Level 21 or above. For a more casual experience, there is also the Festive Revelry to participate in, which gives you access to traditional Luofu mini-games so you can take a break after participating in high stress questlines.</p>
<p>For those who would like to read the full patch notes of the "Flying Aureus Shot to Lupine Rue" version 2.5 update for Honkai: Star Rail, they have released a <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/news/125792" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> that details enemies added, as well as quality-of-life improvements to make the game more enjoyable for players. The update will end in October, giving players plenty of time to wrap up any loose ends from 2.5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS5 Pro Officially Announced, Launching in November]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-pro-officially-announced-launching-in-november.976986/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Looks like the rumors were true. During today's PlayStation Technical Showcase, Mark Cerny and Sony officially announced the PS5 Pro, and while it'll represent a substantial power increase over the PS5, that increase will come with a cost.</p>
<p>The showcase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-technical-presentation-ps5-pro-possible-reveal">was announced yesterday</a>, and prior to that, rumors were swirling that Sony would announce the PS5 Pro during the show. That's exactly what they've done, and lead architect Mark Cerny says it's "the most powerful console" Sony has ever built. It's arriving in November.</p>
<p>During the showcase, Cerny points out that when faced with a choice between Fidelity and Performance modes, Performance mode is chosen around 75% of the time. Cerny says he and Sony want to make that choice easier for players by upping the power of the PS5.</p>

<p>To achieve this, the PS5 Pro will focus on what Cerny calls "the big three" technical improvements: a larger-capacity GPU, advanced ray tracing capabilities, and a proprietary AI upscaling method that should make images look sharper and crisper.</p>
<p>According to Cerny, the PS5 Pro's GPU will offer up to 45% faster rendering than the standard PS5, while advanced ray tracing tech delivers results up to twice or three times as fast as the current base PS5 model.</p>
<p>As for that AI upscaling tech, it's called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, and it works in a similar way to existing tech like Nvidia's DLSS or AMD's FSR, analyzing game images and upscaling them using AI technology.</p>
<p>We got to see a number of examples of games running on the new PS5 Pro, and the machine does look pretty impressive, although I'd imagine that you'd need to see both running side-by-side for several minutes to really appreciate the differences.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-big-three.jpg?itok=QfSKhFCu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-big-three.jpg?itok=ttVn-_d2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5 Pro is targeting three main pillars of improvement over the PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>Cerny says that PS5 Pro support will be added to new games and existing titles alike, and games like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2</em>, and <i>Marvel's Spider-Man 2&nbsp;</i>were shown.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this extra power comes at a price; the PS5 Pro will cost $699.99, so you'd better be sure you really need the improvements it's offering before you open your wallet.</p>
<p>There's another caveat that might sour the deal for you; the PS5 Pro will launch without a disc drive, so if you want one, you'll have to buy the one that Sony is selling separately. That feels like it's going to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7th, both at participating retailers and via PlayStation Direct. You'll be able to preorder it starting from September 26th.</p>

But if you want to play your physical games on the new console, you’ll have to pay extra: a disc drive isn’t included, so you’ll have to buy and install one separately for an additional $79.99.</p><p>“PS5 Pro is available as a disc-less console, with the option to purchase the currently available Disc Drive for PS5 separately,” Sony’s Hideaki Nishino <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">writes in a PlayStation Blog post</a>. That means if you are buying both the console and the disc drive together, you’ll be paying a whopping $779.98.</p><p>While very annoying — it sure seems like an expensive “Pro” console should come with a disc drive! — this move from Sony isn’t entirely out of left field. Sony first released the separate <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/disc-drive-for-ps5-digital-edition-consoles">PS5 disc drive</a> alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/10/23955005/sony-playstation-5-ps5-slim-size-comparison-photo-gallery-hands-on-impressions">the “slim” PS5 redesign</a>, giving you the option of adding a drive to an all-digital PS5 slim if you wanted after the fact.

After months of leaks, Sony just announced a more powerful PS5 console during a special <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DX24BzyzQQ-8">technical presentation</a>. Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5 console, says the PS5 Pro improves on the original console in three key ways: a larger GPU, advanced ray tracing, and custom AI-driven upscaling.</p><p>The PS5 Pro <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">will launch</a> on November 7th, priced at $699.99, and it looks similar to the slim version of the PS5 — just like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231231/is-this-the-ps5-pro">recent leaks</a> suggested it would. It has three stripes down the side, and it doesn’t come with a disc drive. You’ll be able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">purchase a 4K Blu-ray disc drive separately</a> and optional console covers.</p><p>“It’s the most powerful console we’ve ever built,” says Cerny. The hardware upgrades inside will result in 45 percent faster rendering, according to Cerny, and should improve the detail of certain games and frame rates. One of the key reasons for the PS5 Pro is to allow PS5 Pro players to not have to choose performance modes over fidelity ones. “Players are choosing performance about three quarters of the time,” says Cerny.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>The new PlayStation 5 Pro, next to the </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23831415/new-ps5-model-removable-disc-drive-sony-price-release-date"><em>current standard PS5</em></a><em>, and a DualSense controller.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>Sony has upgraded the GPU inside the PS5 Pro with 67 percent more compute units than the current PS5 console, and it has 28 percent faster memory, too. That all adds up to the 45 percent faster rendering of games and the ability to improve frame rates in titles without having to lose visual fidelity.</p><p>This extra power should also improve ray-traced games, with Sony suggesting that developers will be able to allow “the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.”</p><p>The PS5 Pro also includes Sony’s new AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) feature, which is essentially an upscaling technique similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR to improve frame rates and image quality for PlayStation games. This custom PSSR upscaling is designed to replace a game’s existing temporal anti-aliasing or upsampling implementation. </p><p>Cerny briefly demonstrated a few games running on the PS5 Pro, including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> with more detail while still targeting 60fps instead of the 30fps fidelity mode on PS5. Sony’s goal of fidelity-like graphics at performance frame rates will be available in games like <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>and <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>.&nbsp;</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</p><div><figcaption><em>These are screenshots of Sony’s 4K resolution YouTube stream, and so many not show the full quality difference — but you get the idea.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshots by The Verge / Images by Sony</cite></p></div></div><p>Sony is also including a PS5 Pro “Game Boost” option, which will apply to more than 8,500 backward compatible PS4 games for the PS5 Pro. “This feature may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games,” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">says Hideaki Nishino</a>, CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment’s platform business group. “Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games.”</p><p>The PS5 Pro will also support Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, VRR, and 8K resolutions, and<em> CNET</em>’s Scott Stein, who got <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/">an early hands-on with the console</a>, says it now comes with a larger 2TB solid state drive and swaps one of its rear USB-A ports for an extra USB-C port instead. It’ll also still include an extra SSD slot for expansion too, he says.</p><p>Games will need to be patched to take advantage of some of the PS5 Pro’s features, and Sony says developers are readying free software updates to existing titles that will be labeled as PS5 Pro Enhanced games — up to 50 of them by its November 7th launch, according to <em>CNET</em>. </p><p>The first PS5 Pro Enhanced games will include <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em>, <em>Demon’s Souls</em>, <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>, <em>The Crew Motorfest</em>, <em>The First Descendant</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered. </em></p><p>Of the initial batch of titles, most should now simply feature 4K resolution and 60fps framerate, but <em>CNET</em> also got to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> in a new 8K mode and a 4K ray-tracing mode. Developers can also reportedly add volumetric lighting or even show you more characters in the background of a scene.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is also compatible with the PlayStation VR2 headset — where Cerny told <em>CNET</em> it would eventually support higher-resolution games — the PlayStation Portal handheld, and existing PS5 controllers. Sony says it’s not changing the UI or network services for the PS5 Pro, so those will be identical to the existing console.</p><p>Preorders for the PS5 Pro will start on September 26th, ahead of the launch at retailers on November 7th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>First up, the team detailed the unique campaign mechanic for each of the three upcoming legendary lords. For Orc Gorbad, that’s “Da Plan”. Lead designer Sean Macdonald describes it as “Gorbad experimenting with what different units in the roster can he pull together.” The example he gives is “send out some goblins in front of the archers and they can pick up the arrows. And it's like, well, now you've got a way to regenerate your ammunition during the battle.” To me, this sounds like various campaign and battle buffs you’ll get as you climb higher up the military chain, but we’ll see.</p>
<p>For Ogre Golfag Maneater, it’s all about contracts. “For the first time in Warhammer III we're trying to create a faction that plays like a mercenary," says Macdonald. You’ll take contracts from factions to fight others, but it sounds like this won’t affect your personal diplomatic relationship with the target faction. “We've created this new experience where he does kind of roam the world, taking on the jobs and beating up anyone he fancies."</p>
<p>For Khorne’s Skulltaker it’s…the taking of skulls, as it should be. “The whole idea of the feature is, seek out, you know, powerful characters, defeat them, claim some of their strength, and empower yourself even further so that you can become the ultimate Khorne champion," Macdonald explains.</p>
<p>As far as new units go, the team mention a generic savage orc shaman, Yhetees for the ogres, and two legendary heroes for Khorne: Scyla Anfingrimm and Skarr Bloodwrath. Elsewhere, there’s mention of tweaks for Kislev and Bretonnia mentioned, new magical items, and a new chaos invasion endgame event. Game Director Rich Aldrige also hints towards more weapon variants for some units, ala <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys-boys">the boys</a>. And that’s all the Warhammer that’s fit to shout “Warhammer” at for now. See you at the next Warhammer. Warhammer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>According to Ukrainian government-run website United24 Media, Ukraine's armed forces are using Steam Decks to remote-control gun turrets in the course of the on-going war with Russia. The site has shared a video of a new turret system, ShaBlya, which was apparently developed by Ukrainian engineers and approved for mass production earlier this year.</p> <!--more-->
<p>As described in <a href="https://x.com/United24media/status/1832807607758623209">the video</a>, the system is designed for use against infantry and lightly armoured targets. It's not clear from the video how the system works in practice, but it looks like operators can view camera feeds from the turret and shoot at people and vehicles using the Steam Deck's built-in controls. Having done a bit of digging of my own, Ukraine's military appear to have been experimenting with the Steam Deck <a href="https://x.com/krides/status/1650573735168995329">since April 2023</a>. Valve have yet to acknowledge or comment on all this - I'll let you know if they do.</p>
<p>The footage is a reminder that the games industry and the military sector are heavily enmeshed. The overlap isn't just limited to military engineers hacking consumer devices - military technology and practices and video game development and production are entangled at many levels, in what has become a circular exchange of ideas and expertise. Game engine company Unity have taken on military contracts to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/unity-dogfight-simulation-air-force-kill-chain/">work on battlefield simulations for training purposes</a>. So have Bohemia Interactive, in addition to working on their own, fictitious yet "authentic" war simulations for consumer usage - their attention to detail has reached the point that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bohemia-warns-against-spread-of-fake-israelipalestinian-conflict-videos-actually-created-in-arma-3">people have successfully passed off videos of Bohemia games as real war footage</a>. The US military has a long history of adapting video game controller technologies to work with <a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/tech-tactics/us-military-video-game-controllers-war/">drones, unmanned vehicles and submarines</a>.</p>
<p>Video games developers have, of course, borrowed ample material from the military sector, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">licensed guns in Call Of Duty</a> through the fact that Helldivers 2 is grounded in <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/helldivers-2/developers-military-conscription">its developers' experience of military service</a> to the many live service games that cast you as some kind of private military contractor. People Make Games recently published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lYaDXZ2MI-k">a comprehensive video on the subject</a> which is worth sitting through.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony announced the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro on Tuesday, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with it came the revelation</a> that the price of the console will be $200 more than the base PS5.</p>



<p>If you want to buy a PS5 Pro, it’s going to cost you $699.99/£699.99. The original base PS5 costs $499.99/£479.99, and that includes a disc drive for the system. The digital-only base PS5 retails for just $449.99/£389.99</p>



<p>Should you still want a disc drive for physical media, you’ll have to spend another $80/£99.99 for the attachable disc drive. That’ll put the price of a PS5 Pro up near $800 and well over £800.</p>



<p>So, in some cases it’ll cost $200/£200 more whereas others could be looking at $350/£350 more.</p>



<p>As far as what you’ll get for the expensive console, you get the PS5 Pro system, a DualSense controller, and a copy of the four-year-old game Astro’s Playroom. Inside the console comes a 45% more powerful GPU, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling, and more advanced ray tracing. You can check out more details on the full specs of the PS5 Pro, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right here</a>.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro launches on November 7, 2024. Preorders open later this month.</p>

Pre-orders will begin on September 26. <span id="more-913442"></span></p><p>Get the details below, via Sony Interactive Entertainment Platform Business Group CEO Hideaki Nishino on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p><blockquote><p>We developed PlayStation 5 Pro with deeply engaged players and game creators in mind—as many have asked for a console that runs even higher fidelity graphics with smoother frame rates at 60 frames per second. We achieved this on PlayStation 5 Pro with several key performance features.</p><ul><li><strong>Upgraded GPU</strong> – With PlayStation 5 Pro, we are upgrading to a GPU that has 67% more Compute Units than the current PlayStation 5 console and 28% faster memory. Overall, this enables up to 45% faster rendering for gameplay, making the experience much smoother.</li><li><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong> – We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PlayStation 5 console.</li><li><strong>AI-Driven Upscaling</strong> – We’re also introducing <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,938 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Spectral Super Resolution, an AI-driven upscaling that uses a machine learning-based technology to provide super sharp image clarity by adding an extraordinary amount of detail.</li></ul><p>PlayStation 5 Pro provides gamers with amazing graphics at high frame rates. You can hear Mark Cerny, lead architect for PlayStation 5 Pro, discuss the key innovations from PlayStation 5 Pro in the following video presentation. This presentation provides a deep dive into the key performance features that make PlayStation 5 Pro truly special.</p><p>Other enhancements include PlayStation 5 Pro Game Boost, which can apply to more than 8,500 backward compatible <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> games playable on PlayStation 5 Pro. This feature may stabilize or improve the performance of supported PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 games. <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a>d Image Quality for PlayStation 4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PlayStation 4 games. PlayStation 5 Pro will also launch with the latest wireless technology, Wi-Fi 7, in territories supporting this standard. VRR and 8K gaming are also supported.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>It’s humbling to see how game creators have embraced the latest technology from PlayStation 5 Pro, and several games will be patched with free software updates for gamers to take advantage of PlayStation 5 Pro’s features. These games can be identified with a PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced label within their title. Some games you can look forward to include blockbuster hits from PlayStation Studios and our third-party partners, such as <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, <em><a title="Games > Assassin's Creed Shadows [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Demon's Souls (2020) [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/demons-souls-2020">Demon’s Souls</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Dragon's Dogma II [16 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/dragons-dogma-ii">Dragon’s Dogma II</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Gran Turismo 7 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Hogwarts Legacy [25 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Horizon Forbidden West [36 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Marvel's Spider-Man 2 [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > The Crew Motorfest [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > The First Descendant [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > The Last of Us Part II Remastered [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a></em>, and more.</p><p>We kept the look of the PlayStation 5 Pro consistent with the overall PlayStation 5 family of products.

<p>The company that compels you to industrialize an untouched alien planet in <em>Satisfactory, </em>FICSIT, is similar to <em>Portal</em>'s Aperture Science or&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>'s Vault-Tec. You are a disposable employee, fed misinformation and pushed to ignore awful or incongruous things, all for the greater good of science, profit, or an efficient mixture of the two.</p>
<p>And yet even FICSIT was a bit concerned about how deep into the 1.0 release of <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/"><em>Satisfactory</em></a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory">Epic Games</a>, on sale until 9/23) I had fallen. I got a warning that I had been playing for two hours straight. While FICSIT approved of hard work, it was important to have <em>some</em> work-life balance, it suggested.</p>
<p>Friends of mine had told me that they had to stop playing&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em> when it began to feel like an unpaid part-time job. Given a chance to check out&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, I presumed, like I always do, That Could Never Be Me. Folks, it was definitely me. I'm having a hard time writing this post, not because it's hard to describe or recommend <em>Satisfactory.&nbsp;</em>I just stayed up very late "reviewing" it, woke up thinking about it, and am wondering whether enough friends would want to join me that I should set up a private server.</p>

<h2>Travel the galaxy, meet interesting creatures, ignore them and automate</h2>
<p>You are a Pioneer, working for FICSIT (motto: "We do anything to find short-term solutions to long-term problems"). You are dropped onto an alien planet, with a first-person view, and your first job is to disassemble your landing craft so you can use its parts for a H.U.B. (Habitat and Utility Base). Your second job is to upgrade your H.U.B. so you can build tools and workshops. Your third job is to upgrade it again, unlocking even more tools and workshops. You'll need resources to keep building, like mined ore, fuel for a generator, and, sadly, animal parts for research.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>How should you feel about the lush landscape you are slowly stripping away and populating with smoke-belching machines? Is there a greater plan for all this stuff you're making? Why is a "Space Elevator" the end goal? How bad should you feel about putting down animals that charge you as you invade their space?</p>
<p>You might think about these things, but there's a stronger pull on your brain. Can you better optimize the flow of ore from a mining machine into the smelter, onto the tool machine (Constructor), and then into a storage bin? What about your power—do you really have to manually feed your system leaves and wood and turn it off between productions? Are we really balancing the wattage input and clock speed of our machines <em>in our spare time</em>, for&nbsp;<em>fun</em>?</p>
<h2>5.5 million copies, a thousand hours, no end in sight</h2>
<p>Yes, we are. I have only glimpsed into my future in&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, and it's already full of excuses for why I didn't get other things done. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/krs37j/top_10_tips_from_540_hours_of_playtime/">People with 540 hours into the game</a> are advising me on how to site my permanent factory while I kludge it out with a "starter factory," a wonderfully evocative phrase about human nature. Searching for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=satisfactory+1000+hours&amp;atb=v371-1&amp;ia=web">people with 1,000 hours</a> of experience yields a remarkable number of people who are still asking questions and figuring things out.</p>
<p>One of the things being added into the 1.0 release is a "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkZ6CDH7Zss">Quantum Encoder</a>." I have no idea what this is or what it does, but I have a sense of where this is all headed.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jt4XOPiPJHs?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Coffee Stain Studios' 1.0 release trailer for <em>Satisfactory</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Satisfactory</em> launched exclusively on the Epic Games Store, and was one of the very few games that earned enough to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/only-one-of-epics-first-wave-of-exclusives-made-money-and-it-wasnt-metro/">actually make Epic some money</a>. Its developer, Coffee Stain Studios (maker of&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator</em>, publisher of&nbsp;<em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>), cites 5.5 million copies sold since it hit early access in March 2019. With its 1.0 release, the developer has promised "Premium plumbing," such that the toilet in your living quarters "has been updated with an advanced flushing mechanism, providing an extra luxurious worker experience for fans."</p>
<p>Perhaps my one saving grace is that&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>is "Playable," not Verified, <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/526870">on Steam Deck</a>. There are some text and input quirks and video efficiencies to contend with, though I fear the active community offers solutions for all of them. It's up to me, and all of us, to find some work/life/game-work/sleep balance. Time to do your part.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With the official launch of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 yesterday, the game is ripping and shredding a previous record for the entire Warhammer video game series apart. That's because the co-op shooter saw over 225,000 concurrent players on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/steam-player-count-record" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> pointed out that this total sets a new concurrent-player record for the entire Warhammer series, including the fantasy games. Space Marine 2 secured the top spot with 225,690 concurrent players, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2183900/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, overtaking Total War: Warhammer 3's peak of 166,754, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1142710/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. It's also important to note that Space Marine 2 hasn't had a full weekend under its belt yet with the general public, so it's possible the game sees even more concurrent players from September 13-15.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1086606407" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>Coffee Stain Studios' sci-fi factory sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> is now fully available, with the game's 1.0 update out now on PC adding new endgame content, additional customization options, and the full implementation of its story. The update also comes with the official confirmation from Coffee Stain Studios that a console version is in development.</p><p dir="ltr">No other details on the planned console release, like a release window, have been revealed. Coffee Stain in a press release only confirmed that it's in development as the studio looks "to bring conveyor-belt goodness to even more budding Pioneers."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt4XOPiPJHs" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Jt4XOPiPJHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/satisfactory-gets-a-1-0-release-and-flushable-toilets-in-september/1100-6524709/" data-ref-id="1100-6524709">massive 1.0 update</a>, which comes after five years in early access, eight years of total development, and over 5.5 million copies sold, there's a lot for factory aficionados to sink their teeth into. The 1.0 update adds Satisfactory's endgame, Tier 9 and Phase 5, where players will be able to use Quantum Technology to better ship goods off planet via a space elevator, and see the game's Save The Day program to its completion.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the alien technology players will be able to take advantage of include portals for near instant transportation and Dimensional Depots to more efficiently store and retrieve inventory. These powerful new tools allow for even more possibilities, but also require a large amount of power.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who love to customize and decorate their factories, there are plenty of new options in the 1.0 update. Factories can now be outfitted with windows, fences, and new paint finishes, and players can now customize their uniform, helmet, and build gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Satisfactory's 1.0 launch also sees the addition of achievements, with Coffee Stain stating the full list of achievements spans ones related to the game's core milestones, as well as achievements that reward exploration and "even a couple of memes thrown in as well." Unfortunately, achievements will not be retroactively awarded for those who have already completed them prior to the update, with the reason being that the 1.0 update "adds or changes something in almost every progression stage in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Coffee Stain Studios states that the 1.0 release "does not mark the definitive end for the game's development," but is nonetheless a "colossal milestone for our team as much as for our community." Satisfactory is available on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

The new console will land on November 7, 2024 and retail for $699.99.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The PS5 Pro will feature three key upgrades including a larger GPU for rendering that's up to 45 percent faster than the base model. Sony also made major upgrades to ray-tracing by taking a "streamlined and accelerated approach that allows for calculation of rays at double or even triple the speeds of PS5."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, the company added custom hardware for machine learning via an AI library called PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) that analyses game images pixel by pixel and can "add an extraordinary amount of detail that boosts the effective resolution of the games."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on why Sony has focused on those areas specifically, PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny said the company wanted to address developers' "desire for more graphics performance." He said the PS5 Pro will lessen the need for developers and players to choose between performance mode and graphics mode.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"When asked to decide on the mode, players are choosing 'performance' at least three quarters of the time. Removing that decision, or narrowing that divide, is one of the key targets for PlayStation 5 Pro," he said. "We wanted to give players the graphics that game creators aspire to, at the higher frame rates players typically prefer."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that PS5 developers are already working on adding PS5 Pro support to existing titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gran Turismo 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to enhance performance across the board. New titles will also support PS5 Pro.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In terms of how those older releases will benefit from the extra firepower, Cerny said the "goal of delivering almost fidelity like graphics at 'performance' framerate has been achieved across a broad set of [older] titles."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Contrasting the PS5 Pro experience with 'Performance Mode' on PS5, he said players will be able to see an obvious "difference in detail." He said the Pro is "much sharper and crisper" than its forebear, and claimed distant details and small flourishes will be much clearer as a result.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lighting and visual effects should also receive a shot in the arm due to that expanded GPU, allowing titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Gran Turismo 7</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to add ray-traced reflections without compromising its target of 60 frames per-second. "Simply put, it's the most powerful console ever built," added Cerny, "and a worthy addition to the PS5 family."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can the PlayStation 5 Pro revive hardware sales at Sony?">Can the PlayStation 5 Pro revive hardware sales at Sony?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn't the first time Sony has refreshed its PlayStation hardware lineup mid-cycle. The company launched a PlayStation 4 Pro to pack more power into its last-generation machine. Microsoft has also taken a similar approach, bolstering the Xbox One range with the launch of the more powerful Xbox One X and slimline Xbox One S.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The PlayStation 5 had </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/">sold-through over 56 million units worldwide</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as of April 30, 2024.

That downturn wasn't unexpected. Back in March, Sony senior vice president </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-14/sony-lowers-sales-outlook-after-underwhelming-ps5-sales">Naomi Matsuoka told Bloomberg</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it expected the annual PS5 hardware sales to lose momentum–and even indicated the console was entering the "latter stage of its life cycle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We will put more emphasis on the balance between profitability and sales," added Matsuoka. "For this reason, we expect the annual sales pace of PS5 hardware will start falling from the next fiscal year."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It'll be interesting to see whether the launch of the PlayStation 5 Pro can change the narrative.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Sony has officially unveiled its next iteration of the PS5, or to give it its full name, the PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The digital-only PS5 Pro is set to arrive on 7th November. It will cost £699.99/$699.99. Preorders will begin later this month, on 26th September. It will include a 2TB SSD, a DualSense wireless controller and - as the PS5 did  - a copy of Astro's Playroom pre-installed. As a general point, you will need to buy the vertical stand separately (£24.99).  </p>
<p>
The separate disc drive is also compatible - as per the current Slim model - but costs an additional £99.99. If you want to purchase everything, you are looking at a total of £825.</p>

The main benefit of the PS5 Pro is it will allow for Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates. It does this with three key features, as laid out by <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/">PlayStation</a>:

</p><p><strong>Upgraded GPU:</strong> With PS5 Pro, we are upgrading to a GPU that has 67 percent more Compute Units than the current PS5 console and 28 percent faster memory. Overall, this enables up to 45 percent faster rendering for gameplay, making the experience much smoother.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing:</strong> We've added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</p>
<p><strong>AI-Driven Upscaling:</strong> We're also introducing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, an AI-driven upscaling that uses a machine learning-based technology to provide super sharp image clarity by adding an extraordinary amount of detail.</p>
<p>Additionally, the console has PS5 Pro Game Boost, which PlayStation says will apply to "more than 8,500 backward compatible PS4 games playable on PS5 Pro".</p>
<p>Says PlayStation: "This feature may stabilise or improve the performance of supported PS4 and PS5 games. Enhanced Image Quality for PS4 games is also available to improve the resolution on select PS4 games. PS5 Pro will also launch with the latest wireless technology, Wi-Fi 7, in territories supporting this standard. VRR and 8K gaming are also supported."</p>

</figure>
<p>As for how it will fit into your home, the PS5 Pro is the same height as the original PS5 model, and the same width as the current PS5 model. </p>
<p>PlayStation said several titles including Demon's Souls, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart (pictured above) will be patched with a free software update, which will allow them to "take advantage" of the PS5 Pro's souped-up features. These games will all come with a 'PS5 Pro Enhanced' label within their title, so keep an eye out for that. </p>
<p>Here are all the games we know will have PS5 Pro support so far, with "more" promised down the line:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon’s Souls</li>
<li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</li>
</ul><p>

 As you would expect, all current PS5 accessories such as PlayStation VR2, PlayStation Portal, DualSense Edge, Access controller, Pulse Elite and Pulse Explore will be compatible with the PS5 Pro. Additionally, the user interface and network services will remain the same as those on PS5, PlayStation said.

<p>Today's PS5 Pro reveal comes as no real surprise. After all, Sony's official 30th anniversary artwork, which the company shared towards the end of last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">appeared to tease the next version of its PS5 console</a>, and here it is in all its glory much as the drawing depicted.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Sony also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-increases-price-of-playstation-5-dualsense-controller">increased the price of the PS5's DualSense controller</a>. Coincidence? </p>

		<p>Mirage 7 has been announced by developer Drakkar Dev, whose previous release was Blackwind, and publisher Blowfish Studios. The game is very different to the mech based brawler that Blackwind is, with Mirage 7 being an action adventure game that is set in a desert part inspired by the Arabian Nights mixed with science fiction elements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJVAdvxOoU">YouTube</a></p>


<p>“Mirage 7&nbsp;offers an unforgettable story with dynamic, narrative-driven gameplay,” said Manlio Greco, founder, Drakkar Dev. “We’ve crafted a game where daring explorers can truly immerse themselves in the world and experience a narrative that will keep them on their toes until the very end!”</p>
<p>In Mirage 7, players take on the role of an adventurer named Nadira, who is braving the desert and its dangers to reach the Palace of the Moon. Her goal is to bring her sister back from the dead. On this journey, Nadira is accompanied by Jiji, her pet lizard, who can be used to help solve the environmental puzzles that are scattered across the world. Alongside puzzles, Nadira will get in battles with various enemies, but she can use her dagger for close combat or a slingshot to get some range. There will also be choices to make as other characters try to use Nadira for their own means. Those characters include the Vizier and the Witch of Jala.</p>

<p>Mirage 7 will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC and Mac via Steam, Epic Game Store, and GOG. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>If you've been curious about V Rising and what it feels like to be a vampire, you can sink your fangs into the game for free during the free weekend commencing September 12 and finishing on September 16. The free weekend starts at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST on September 12 and finishes at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST on September 16. These five days allow those who haven't experienced the survival open-world RPG to dive deep into the world of V Rising, customize, and create their very own vampire while gaining more and more power as they defeat powerful enemies.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB_2ZRn9F_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Players won't be limited during the V Rising free weekend. They will have access to all the content added in the <a href="https://playvrising.com/launch-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent 1.0 update</a> to give them a proper taste of V Rising. In this game, you can either team up with friends or strangers or go your way while choosing the difficulty of your world. Whether you want to be able to go through the world and only fight mobs, or you want the possibility to encounter other vampires and kill them, too, V Rising allows you to experience both PvE and PvP, depending on your choices.</p>
<p>If you really enjoy V Rising, the base game will also be discounted by 30%, and the DLCs will be discounted by 20% if you want to add some Castlevania spice to your game. For those who don't know much about the game, there are over 57 unique bosses for you to take down, all providing their challenges. In addition, you must avoid the sunlight, otherwise you are at risk of burning to death. To really sink your teeth into the vampiric and Gothic fantasy, you can build your very own castle where you can launch raids on others and defend your castle from towering enemies that threaten to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Currently, V Rising has a very dedicated fan base of over 4.3 million players worldwide. Since the game left Early Access, it has received overwhelmingly positive reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The developers are continuing to add new content and updates to the game to make it more accessible and enjoyable for those who continue to put time into it. V Rising is available on PC as well as PlayStation 5. If you want to see what V Rising has in store for you, a launch trailer showcases some of the action you can expect from playing the game.</p>

Now there's an elevator pitch for the ages.</p>
<p>You'll play as a pirate who must build their reputation "from scallywag to pirate king" in a Caribbean contested not only by political factions, but also by "the denizens of the deep, the undead, and worse".</p>

<p>They include&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun: Dragonfall&nbsp;</em>lead writer Andrew McIntosh,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>narrative designer Jeffery Campbell, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull &amp; Bones</a>&nbsp;</em>senior concept artist Kate Cruz, plus Weisman himself, of course.</p>
<p>Weisman and his team say you'll be plundering ships, raiding towns, discovering treasure, and vanquishing your nemeses on this pirate adventure. Perhaps&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>can provide the piratical fantasy&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't quite manage to offer.</p>
<p>Combat will be driven by deckbuilding elements, and you'll develop your deck via recruiting crew members and developing characters. We don't have too much more info yet, but it's early days, after all.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter for the game starts on October 1st, so you'll get a chance to support the project if you want to see it come to fruition. We'll bring you more on this one as and when we get it.</p>

The Pocket GBC Colors Edition introduces six new colors — teal, berry, kiwi, grape, and dandelion — which were the five launch colors of the Game Boy Color in 1988, plus a gold version based on a special edition of the GBC created for <em>Pokémon Gold</em>.</p><p>The GBC Colors Edition collection will be <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">available to preorder</a> in limited quantities starting on September 12th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET for $249.99 each, with shipping expected within 24 to 48 hours.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>The teal version of the new Analogue Pocket GBC Colors Edition.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Analogue</cite></p></div></div><p>To ensure the new collection was closely matched in color to Nintendo’s original hardware, the company used the highest-quality “equipment, tools, and processes to achieve accuracy,” says Analogue’s CEO and founder, Christopher Taber. Those processes included referencing Game Boy Color units from “different years of production runs” and taking measurements inside the handhelds, where the colors of the plastic housings hadn’t faded from extensive use and light exposure.</p><p>The Analogue Pocket originally launched in 2021 and has been able to play original Game Boy Color cartridges since its debut, as well as carts from other handhelds like the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and the Sega Game Gear (using an adapter). Since its debut, Analogue has introduced several special editions of the Pocket, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848739/analogue-pocket-glow-in-the-dark-preorders">glow-in-the-dark version</a>, several with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23888931/analogue-pocket-transparent-price-release-date">transparent shells</a>, and an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197135/analogue-pocket-aluminum">aluminum version</a> with a steeper $499 price tag.</p><p>The company’s next product will be a recreation of another Nintendo console. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">Analogue 3D</a> is expected to have “100 percent compatibility” with N64 cartridges from every region along with 4K output. In addition, it should play games more accurately than emulators can since it uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, allowing it to function just like the original N64 hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-ps5-pro-reveal-thanks-to-unlisted-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">After reports</a> and rumors aplenty over the past 16 months, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony has officially</a> revealed the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro for players. The announcement came via a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-to-be-revealed-on-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special 9 minute event</a> on PlayStation’s YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro is an all-digital console with a release date of November 7. As far as price goes, it’ll retail for $699.99. That’s a $200 increase over the base PS5 that features a disc drive.</p>



<p>The console comes with a 2TB SSD, a DualSense controller, and a copy of Astro’s Playroom pre-installed. Should you want to add a disc drive, you can buy the separate disc drive for the console for $80.</p>



<p>As far as the look of the console goes, the design matches what was shown via leaks and teasers. The console looks similar to the base PS5 but has three black stripes on the side plate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, what’s in the console? Sony is advertising a “big three” of updates for the PS5 Pro compared to the base PS5. Those include the following, courtesy of Sony:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Upgraded GPU</strong>: With PS5 Pro, we are upgrading to a GPU<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that has 67% more Compute Units&nbsp;than the current PS5 console and 28% faster memory. Overall, this enables up to 45% faster rendering for gameplay, making the experience much smoother.</li>



<li><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong>: We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</li>



<li><strong>AI-Driven Upscaling</strong>: We’re also introducing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, an AI-driven upscaling that uses a machine learning-based technology to provide super sharp image clarity by adding an extraordinary amount of detail.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other features of the console include PS5 Pro Game Boost for backward compatible PS4 games on the console. It will also feature Wi-Fi 7 as well as VRR and 8K.</p>

            <p>After five years of early access and 6m copies already sold, Satisfactory has finally launched its full 1.0 version on PC.</p>
<p>From Coffee Stain Studios, Satisfactory is a first-person game in which players construct huge factories in an open, alien world.</p>
<p>This release includes a "full narrative overhaul complete with mysteries for players to uncover", along with Tier 9 content that allows players to use advanced alien tech in their builds.</p>

<p>Coffee Stain Studios has also revealed a console edition is in development following the full PC release, though no further details have been provided.</p>
<p>So what of the story? Players will be tasked with exploiting natural resources and alien artefacts to produce and transport parts via the "Space Elevator". It's all part of a mission called the Save The Day programme, though it's all shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>On top of this very important task, there are decorative pieces too for both buildings and player outfits.</p>
<p>Satisfactory was Coffee Stain's first game since the popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> and allows up to four players to construct complex structures.</p>
<p>It launched in early access on the Epic Games Store in March 2019, followed by a Steam release in June 2020. The full version is available now on both platforms.</p>
<p>During this time in early access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/satisfactory-upgrades-to-unreal-engine-5">Satisfactory upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> in November 2023 and, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/satisfactory-has-sold-55m-copies-after-five-years-of-early-access-10-is-due-this-year">hit 5.5m sales</a>.</p>
<p>"The absolute last thing I want to do when landing on a beautifully unspoilt, lush and exotic alien planet is build a clunking, grey, smog-spewing factory. But that's what Satisfactory makes you do, that's what it's about, and it's both horrid and inspired," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wrenching-pleasure-of-despoiling-alien-planets-for-factories-in-satisfactory">Eurogamer's Bertie on Satisfactory</a> back at launch in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once in high school, I’d finished some unnecessary standardized test early and was staring into space when a man I’d never seen before asked me what I’d thought of the reading prompts. With the know-it-all confidence only a high schooler can muster, I tore into all the ways I thought the passages sucked. When I was done, the man informed me that <em>he</em> had written the test. Instead of feeling bad for being a jerk about it, I remember thinking how sad it was that his job was to write <em>tests</em>. Little did I know that years later, writing tests would be my job too, and it would actually be pretty cool.</p><p>In my life before journalism, I often made my money grading and creating standardized tests. I had a seasonal gig evaluating reading tests, deciphering shoddily-scanned children’s handwriting and assigning it a number score. Later, I worked for a company creating math materials for standardized test prep, which would come in handy down the line when I had a stint as a narrative designer on an educational math game that was–you’ll never believe this–ultimately cancelled. I’ve also worked in schools as a teacher’s assistant (the semester after I left, my class was in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm1OADazJH0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentary</a>) and at an online tutoring company that, now I think about it, was well ahead of its time.</p><p>The math-heavy nature of a lot of this work was ironic considering that I was absolutely <em>abysmal</em> at math when I was in school. I more or less failed math every year since third grade long division, despite getting tutors and staying after school for extra help. Math is one of those things you can get in your head that you’re just naturally not good at; when the math test prep job came along, I thought about my past and was wracked with anxiety that I couldn’t actually <em>do</em> it.&nbsp;</p><p>I stuck to elementary and middle school questions, far too afraid of and traumatized by anything higher. My mom, a middle-school English teacher, sent me a bunch of curriculum materials from one of her math colleagues, which explained how teachers taught the concepts I’d struggled with as a kid. Armed with these books, the internet, and my life experience since those grades, I was shocked to find that math wasn’t as hard as I remembered, especially when I had the logic of it laid out in front of me in a more robust way than my textbooks had provided. Stuff like geometry made more sense now that I was an adult who’d actually used some of its concepts. </p><p>It also helped that each question I wrote, pegged to the <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Core</a>, had to adhere to strict guidelines regarding its content, difficulty level, and where it fell on <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloom's taxonomy</a>. This turned the tangled wilds of math into discrete, specific concepts both mathematically and in terms of the cognitive skills they required. But these limitations also made writing questions challenging–what is a high difficulty, complex reasoning question about <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/Math/Content/2/G/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">area</a> that can only involve the basic math skill of counting squares? The work required so much more than just knowing how to do elementary school math, and I had to get creative to come up with questions that met all the requirements. It was fun to put my friends’ names into word problems, and to try to think of age-appropriate, practical situations for concepts that got around the eternal complaint about learning math you’ll never use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The questions I wrote were multiple choice, which meant that in addition to providing the right answer, I also had to provide three wrong ones. These had to be “plausibly wrong;” if the question was “what’s 10+5?” one of the answers couldn’t be “1,364.” It could, however, be “105,” because a student might just put all the numbers together instead of adding their value, or “5” in case they mixed up the plus and minus sign. Coming up with these plausibly wrong answers was my favorite part of the job. I’d put myself back in the mindset of young me and try to imagine how I’d have misunderstood a word problem or made a mistake in a multi-step question. And then I got to write a supportive little note explaining the error and guiding the student back toward the right track, the kind of thing I wished I'd had instead of a teacher frowning at me as they handed back another red pen-covered failed test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the math game I helped design took all of this to another level by trying to add fun into the mix. As a kid, I had always assumed educational games were made by boring adults who didn't actually care if a game was fun or didn't really understand what games were, but our team put so much thought into avoiding what educational games people call “<a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/serious-games-not-chocolate-broccoli-matthew-farber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chocolate-covered broccoli</a>.” It was energizing to have conversations with the other narrative designers and the content team, trying to draw out the core actions of a math skill and thinking about enjoyable–but still educational–situations they could apply to. We wrote a bunch of interesting, diverse characters to go along with the game’s story; I was especially excited about a plotline involving math anxiety, thinking back to my own struggles in childhood and the skills I wished I’d been taught or the messages I wished I’d received. While we knew we were fighting a losing battle for kids’ time against games like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, we still hoped to give them something they’d enjoy, remember, and see themselves in. Though I’d left the company before the game was cancelled, I was still sad to learn that no one would ever get to play it.</p><p>The main takeaway from my experience is probably that even if you totally suck at math in school, you can still find yourself doing it as a job–so much so that you get stuck doing it all the time if you <a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start a business</a>. But young me would have been horrified by this lesson–the thing I hate the most, <em>all the time</em>?--so instead, I like to see it as proof that your relationship to something can grow and change over your life. Difficulties in school don’t mean you’re “<a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a writer</a>” or “just bad at math;” without the pressures of grades or the restrictions of a class, you can always learn something in new ways or with new tools. I like to hope I gave kids a little bit of what I was missing and, in some small way, helped them avoid some of the struggles I went through. At the very least, I hope I never wrote anything a kid would tell me sucked to my face.</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>update 1.1.2, and it's intended to address some of the more pressing concerns players have had with the game, including frustrating insta-fail stealth sections and more.</p>
<p>According to Ubisoft, highlights for this update include "tweaks and improvements on some challenging stealth moments", as well as cross-progression, PC performance improvements, and a fix for one of&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>' PS5 trophies.</p>
<p>Those stealth fixes include a lowering of the likelihood you'll be detected while you're rolling, as well as an adjustment to the "level of detection" depending on where you are. Details are a little vague, but hopefully, stealth should be a bit less punishing now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-update-1.1.2-stealth.jpg?itok=rvbuNWUq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-update-1.1.2-stealth.jpg?itok=Xobve-uG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stealth in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>should be a little easier now.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you happen to be playing&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on multiple platforms, you should now be able to access your save no matter where you are thanks to the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/cross-progression-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109498" rel="noopener" target="_blank">magic of cross-progression</a>, which has been implemented in this update.</p>
<p>In terms of performance updates, you're getting nebulous "improvements and optimizations" on PC, as well as improvements for some scenes that cause FPS drops. You're also getting "higher graphic fidelity" for ray reconstruction and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>PS5 players will be happy to learn that the Old School Cool trophy is now unlockable too, meaning that it's now possible to score the Platinum for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. As Anakin himself might say, yippee.</p>
<p>The full list of patch notes contains a bunch of other fixes and improvements as well, so if you want to see everything that's new in this&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>update, then <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is, according to Ubisoft at least, the first open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game. It revolves around outlaw Kay Vess, who must navigate the galaxy's seedy underbelly and decide whether she's going to stay on its gangs' good side or disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review">read our review of it right here</a>.</p>

Sources familiar with Sony’s plans tell me that developers are already being asked to ensure their games are compatible with this upcoming console, with a focus on improving ray tracing.</p><p>Codenamed Trinity, the PlayStation 5 Pro model will include a more powerful GPU and a slightly faster CPU mode. All of Sony’s changes point to a PS5 Pro that will be far more capable of rendering games with ray tracing enabled or hitting higher resolutions and frame rates in certain titles. Sony appears to be encouraging developers to use graphics features like ray tracing more with the PS5 Pro, with games able to use a “Trinity Enhanced” (PS5 Pro Enhanced) label if they “provide significant enhancements.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-7eb88c1b-3670-4c98-91d9-60c80e6b6745"><div><p>Go read Digital Foundry on the PS5 Pro.</p><p>The most trusted source for console analysis has just corroborated and analyzed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">the leaks</a>.</p><p>“Those hoping that PS5 Pro will turn CPU-limited 30fps titles into super-smooth 60fps experiences will be disappointed,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">writes Richard Leadbetter</a> — but he thinks PS5 Pro “should be able to deliver a far higher perceptual increase in resolution vs PS5 than the PS4 Pro did against its junior variant.”</p><p>Lots more nuance here, including how PS5 Pro has 1.2GB more RAM for games:</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-c5947753-10a9-4448-a738-38e5bb7f52e0"><div><p>More rumored specs for the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs-2024/">reported</a> GPU specifications and performance targets for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">a “PlayStation 5 Pro”</a> on Friday, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-more-specs/">now he says</a> that just like the recently revised PS5, the Pro will also have a detachable disc drive.</p><p>Other new details include rumors of faster memory running at 576 GB/s (a 28 percent boost over the PS5), better audio performance, and a new “High CPU Frequency Mode” that boosts performance by 10 percent over the standard PS5. </p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-d46b9f16-cff2-4a48-b6e9-4578239472d1"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">Sony’s PS5 Pro is up to three times faster, may arrive holiday 2024</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Sony is reportedly working on a PlayStation 5 Pro model that may well include a far more powerful GPU that’s up to three times faster for certain tasks than the existing PS5 models. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSV7BJKnZfP8">YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead</a> claims to have gotten access to a technical overview document for the PS5 Pro, codenamed Trinity, and now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs/">Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reports that the leaked specifications are accurate and the console is currently set to release during the holiday 2024 period.</p><p>Screenshots from the technical document include a mention of 67 teraflops of 16-bit floating point calculations, which works out to around 33.5 teraflops of single-precision compute. That reportedly works out to a 45 percent rendering performance improvement over the PS5. The existing PS5 is a 10.28-teraflop console, but comparing teraflops directly between these consoles is complicated due to changes in AMD’s RDNA architecture. While it sounds like tripling the teraflops would be a significant performance increase on the GPU side, comparing the base PS5 and PS5 Pro would be closer to 10.28 teraflops vs. around 17 teraflops.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-822b92db-eb4b-42e4-a3f8-a8b4b9deaac1"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072692/sony-ps5-forecast-cut-q3-2023-earnings">Sony misses PS5 sales target as console enters ‘latter stage of its life cycle’</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><div><figcaption><em>The original PS5 next to last year’s slimmer redesign.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G.
