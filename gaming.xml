		<p>Nintendo‚Äôs latest quarterly report has come with the first sales figures for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is now confirmed to have set a towering new record for sales through the first month.</p>
<p>From its 5th June launch through to the end of the quarter on 30th June, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> sold a whopping 5.82 million consoles globally, completely outpacing the PS5 and PS4 in the process ‚Äì they took seven weeks to ship 4.5 million consoles, from their mid-November launches to the end of December. Of course, Sony was struggling to meet demand in 2020 through a semiconductor shortage, but this is still seriously impressive stuff.</p>


<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold incredibly well, with a close to 100% attach rate. As the main exclusive title and primary reason to buy a Switch 2, and the fact that the game was bundled in as part of hardware bundles, the 5.63 million copies of Mario Kart World sold makes a 96.7% attach rate.</p>
<p>While the new console took the headlines, the original Nintendo Switch continues to plug away as well, with 0.98 million further sales in the last three months that bumps the total sales up to 153.10 million, and it is now sure to eclipse the Nintendo DS 154.02 million consoles sold by the end of this year. Given how sales are likely to tail off, it‚Äôs unlikely that the PS2‚Äôs 160 million will be overtaken, though.</p>

            <p>Avast, fellow salty sea-dogs. Some legally-minded landlubbers may have had words with Edward Kenway, captain of The Jackdaw and protagonist of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a>. Well, Kenway's voice actor Matt Ryan at any rate, who's been filmed at a convention saying that Ubisoft threatened to sue him over a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">previous video from another convention</a> in which he teased a remake of the game.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, this is the Black Flag remake the publisher haven't confirmed is coming, but has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">reported to be in development</a> several times over the past couple of years.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I don't know, mate," Ryan said when asked about said remake in this latest instance of a convention goer pointing a phone at him while he signs stuff. "Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [points towards the phone filming this exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. Then the company threatened to sue me. So, [now] I say nothing."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear whether Ryan's unaware he's being filmed this time around, as he does directly acknowledge that the convention goer who's doing so has their phone camera pointed at him. This latest clip was originally uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> and since looks to have been taken down there, but not before it was reposted onto what remains of Twitter.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn‚Äôt realize he was being recordedüòµ <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>‚Äî The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>We've reached out to Ubisoft for comment.</p>
<p>It's not nice to hear about anyone allegedly having Lionel Hutzes on their case over something like this, so here's hoping Ryan doesn't end up in any more hot water over this latest clip. If you approach him at a convention with your phone pointed right at his mug in the near future and try to chat Black Flag remakes, I'd expect he might have less to say.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease]]></content:encoded>

<p>As satisfying as a successful real-time strategy game campaign can be, dealing with a complex RTS map can often be overwhelming. Keeping track of multiple far-flung resource-production bases, groups of units, upgrade trees, and surprise encounters with the enemy requires a level of attention-splitting that can strain even the best multitaskers.</p>
<p>Then there's <em>The King is Watching</em>, which condenses the standard real-time strategy production loop into an easy-to-understand single-screen interface, complete with automatic battles. The game's unique resource management system‚Äîcombined with well-designed, self-balancing difficulty and randomized upgrades that keep each run fresh‚Äîmakes <em>The King is Watching</em> one of the most enjoyable pick-up-and-play strategy titles I've encountered in a long time.</p>
<h2>What is the king watching, exactly?</h2>
<p>The bulk of the action in <em>The King is Watching</em> takes place on a small, 4x4 grid of squares representing your castle. That's where you'll place blueprint tiles from your hand that then start producing the basic and refined resources necessary to place even more blueprints. Those resources also power the factories that crank out defensive units that automatically fight to protect your castle from periodic waves of enemies (in adorable pixelated animations that take place on a battlefield to the right of your castle).</p>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2109618"><p>
              A lot of good resource tiles there, but the king can only look at five squares at a time here.

                                  </p>
                          </div>
          <figcaption>
        <div>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Sounds simple enough. But the entire castle can't be actively productive at once. Instead, only a few contiguous tiles within the area of the "king's gaze" can make resources and/or units at any one time.</p>
<p>That means you have to constantly and actively drag and rotate your "gaze" around your castle, prioritizing the resources and units you need immediately and leaving others that can wait for the king's attention. You have to be careful with the relative positioning of your blueprints so that units and resources that complement each other can be produced in the same "gaze" without a lot of unproductive downtime (say, when you've hit your unit limit) or resource droughts.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>You might start off with one corner of the grid devoted to basic resources and another to basic unit production, shifting your gaze quickly between the two as your unit numbers and/or resource stockpiles dwindle. Later, you might add a market to generate the gold you'll need for the squares that produce stronger units or a crystal mine that will help supply powerful magical units you create later in the run.</p>

    <div id="caption-2109617"><p>
              If you can upgrade all the way to a Tesla towers (seen here), you're probably in OK shape...

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>You might also invest your treasure in upgrades that make certain tiles produce more quickly or on global upgrades that expand your gaze or let you station more troops on the field at once. And as your grid fills up, you must figure out which underpowered or less-useful tiles to destroy to make space for the more powerful blueprints you've hopefully earned or generated to replace them.</p>

<h2>Try to keep up</h2>
<p>Shifting your gaze and adjusting your production tiles plays out like a simple puzzle game, requiring effective juggling of both time and space to be maximally efficient. You need to constantly split your attention between your present resource and unit needs and your near- and far-future plans for upgrades. As frantic as this can get, it never feels unmanageable, thanks in large part to an excellent user interface that packs practically everything you need to know onto a single screen, no camera-fiddling or complex keyboard shortcuts required.</p>
<p><em>The King is Watching</em> also makes use of an ingenious kind of partially self-selecting difficulty system, where you periodically pick from a randomized set of "prophecies" to "predict" how many and which enemies will come in the next few waves (and which potential upgrades they might give you when they're gone). This leads to a delightfully fraught balance of risk and reward, forcing you to ride the edge of survivability in each wave. Choose too many enemies and you could be overwhelmed before your defensive units are built up. Choose too few and you won't earn the requisite upgrades needed to work through the overpowered boss waves later.</p>

          
                  </div>

      </figure>

<p>Those inter-wave upgrades are also randomized in each run, adding some roguelike unpredictability that means no two play sessions develop quite the same way. You have to be flexible, adapting to the blueprints and units you're given, while being willing to abandon plans that are no longer feasible.</p>
<p>Between waves, you'll often get the opportunity to buy emergency resource drops, useful upgrades that last through the whole run, or one-time spells that can strengthen your units or hinder the opposition. Figuring out the best potential upgrade paths requires a lot of trial and error, and you'll need a little luck in drawing some of the more powerful upgrade options. While experience and skill can make things more manageable, some runs end up a lot more winnable than others.</p>
<p>Playing through successful waves also earns you tokens you can spend between runs on permanent upgrades (including crucial expansions of that 4x4 grid) and new selectable kings with their own unique gaze shapes and special powers. But even as these upgrades make it easier to succeed in successive runs, the game cranks up the "threat level" in turn to raise the enemy strength level (and the stakes) accordingly.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZXjQRcu2B8?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>That kind of self-balancing means <em>The King is Watching</em> always manages to feel engaging without coming off as totally unfair. And individual runs are zippy enough to not wear out their welcome; you can make it through a full run of two or three bosses in about 30 minutes or so, especially if you use the "fast forward" option to speed up the routine resource production between enemy waves.</p>
<p>Best of all, those 30 minutes are so dense with important decisions and split-second management of your kingly gaze that you never have time to feel bored. <em>The King is Watching</em> perfectly rides the fine line between engrossing and overwhelming, making it perfect for quick, lunch-break-sized brain breaks that combine positional reasoning, reflexes, and strategic planning.</p>

"We build all of our trailers internally, for example. We make that part of our pre-production pipeline.

			<p>Rockstar Games is reportedly planning to implement age verification in GTA Online to play the game or access some of the online game's features.</p>



<p>As reported by Tez2 on X, users may need to verify their age in the future to play the game or access certain features like phone messages, text chat, and Snapmatic. Tez2 couldn't say which regions could be targeted for these age verification checks, but there's little doubt players in the UK will be the first to be impacted by age verification if it goes into effect, considering the enforcement of the Online Safety Act is expected to ramp up in the coming months.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Jokes aside, Rockstar is planning to implement age assurance checks in the near future, rolling them out by region.</p><p>You may need to verify your age to access <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GTAOnline</a>, or certain features, like phone messages, text chat, Snapmatic, may be restricted until you verify your age. <a href="https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh">https://t.co/v0wLwV8nyh</a> <a href="https://t.co/QYVaydlbhZ">pic.twitter.com/QYVaydlbhZ</a></p></div>‚Äî Tez2 (@TezFunz2) <a href="https://twitter.com/TezFunz2/status/1951058585359634459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Although age checks are yet to become mandatory, select publishers and developers already started implementing some form of age verification ahead of time, like Roblox and Epic Games, to prevent younger players from accessing to some features like voice and or text chat, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to do the same in GTA Online, considering the game is constantly under intense scrutiny due to its setting and content. As the developer is also said to be working on a new version of their online game to coincide with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-online-sold-separately-30-fps-target/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year, it will be interesting to see how age verification will impact this new project in some way.</p>



<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game's latest updates on its official website.</p>

			<p>There‚Äôs been no shortage of The Lord of the Rings games over the years, but precious few of them focus on the real stars of J. R. R. Tolkien‚Äôs books, the humble hobbits. Granted, outside of the unlikely adventures of the Baggins family, hobbits are known for living rather unexciting lives, so perhaps it‚Äôs not surprising that game makers would rather focus on Middle-earth‚Äôs elves, orcs, and dragons. But, of course, not all games have to focus on action and excitement ‚Äì enter <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tales-of-the-shire/">Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game</a>,&nbsp; a new cozy life sim in the vein of Stardew Valley or Animal Crossing that aims to celebrate hobbit life in all its sleepy glory.</p>



<p>Does Tales of the Shire successfully carve out its own cozy corner of Middle-earth? Or does it confirm why Tolkien‚Äôs books never stayed in the Shire for long? Venture forth for the answer‚Ä¶</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tales of the Shire begins with players creating their own furry-footed avatar before putting down stakes in Bywater, the neighboring settlement to the more famous Hobbiton. I suspect most folks who hear the phrase ‚Äúcozy life sim set in the Lord of the Rings universe‚Äù will make some similar assumptions ‚Äì that the game will have a richer, more developed world and cast of characters than your average life sim, and that it might mix a bit more adventure in with the usual farming and mushroom picking. Sadly, this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While Tolkienites will no doubt recognize some names from the books and movies ‚Äì the crusty Old Noakes and Samwise Gamgee‚Äôs eventual wife Rosie Cotton being chief among them ‚Äì the game doesn‚Äôt expand on these characters in any interesting way. There are a number of nameless NPCs that wander around Bywater, but there are only 15 characters you can actually interact with and they‚Äôre all lifelessly written, with most having perhaps a single identifying trait (and sometimes not even that). There's no real conflict, no real drama, everyone just speaks in dry awkward sentences and empty platitudes.</p>



<p>Most who play Tales of the Shire will likely start making a mental list of all the things you‚Äôd expect from a proper cozy farming game that you <em>won‚Äôt</em> find here, such as mining, festivals, livestock (aside from chickens), and romance, to name just a few. The one thing Tales of the Shire has going for it, really the <em>only </em>thing, is cooking. The game takes hobbits being hungry little buggers to the extreme by having basically everything revolve around food.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The only way to raise your relationship level with your fellow hobbits is to invite them over for a meal. The main way to earn new recipes, tools, house and garden expansions, and other upgrades in Tales of the Shire is to increase these relationships or boost your ranking in a series of food-related clubs (there are cooking, farming, fishing, and foraging clubs). Basically, if you want to get ahead, everything circles back to your kitchen, which may sound like a smart, focused approach, but in this game it just feels overly simplistic. Nobody in Bywater feels like a real character, they‚Äôre just walking stomachs.</p>



<p>To be fair, this game‚Äôs cooking mechanics actually work pretty well. In addition to finding and mixing the right ingredients, players also have to decide how ‚Äúsmooth‚Äù or ‚Äúchunky‚Äù they want to cut things, how long proteins should be cooked, and what seasonings to add. Dinner guests have certain dish and flavor profile preferences and combining certain tastes will result in more pleasing dishes. The complexity of making dinner steadily increases as more recipes, ingredients, and cooking implements are introduced, eventually becoming relatively involved.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Once you have some dishes whipped up, you‚Äôll invite guests to one of several different dining venues, place their meals in front of them, perhaps add some decorations for ambiance, and then, bon app√©tit! The whole cooking and dining process is actually rather satisfying, but does it make up for everything <em>else </em>Tales of the Shire doesn‚Äôt do or simply does poorly? Absolutely not, but when you're chopping up veggies and setting the table you do get a brief glimpse of what this experience perhaps <em>could</em> have been with a bit more ambition, time, and support from management (a recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/709797/tales-of-the-shire-lotr-development-weta-workshop">article from The Verge</a> details the game‚Äôs rocky development).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The only other way to progress in Tales of the Shire is to work through the game‚Äôs ‚Äúcampaign,‚Äù such as it is. The big dilemma driving said campaign is‚Ä¶ whether Bywater will be officially designated a village. Nothing more thrilling than the civic bureaucratic process! Story missions are almost entirely fetch-quest busy work of the most mind-numbing variety with only occasional requirements to cook a meal breaking things up.</p>



<p>As barebones as the rest of Tales of the Shire is, I‚Äôll admit, there were times when the cozy formula still kicked in and provided some moments of low-key enjoyment, but ultimately, the game‚Äôs dead-fish campaign truly killed the experience for me. Tales of the Shire makes the same mistakes so many middling cozy games make ‚Äì it‚Äôs so mellow, it lacks any form or direction, so friendly and nonthreatening that everything just turns to mush. Sure, actually-good cozy games like Stardew Valley are fairly chill, but they‚Äôre not uneventful or vapid. The promise of the hobbit life sim concept just makes the bland monotony served up by this game sting all the more.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Tales of the Shire doesn‚Äôt even impress on a technical level, which is surprising given Weta Workshop has won Oscars for its work on the LotR movies. While Bywater looks decent enough from afar, upon closer inspection, you‚Äôll find everything‚Äôs made up of chunky polygons and blurry textures the likes of which haven‚Äôt regularly been seen in a few hardware generations. Despite this lack of visual pizazz, the game runs terribly on the PS5 (I can only imagine how rough the Switch version must be) and is rife with visual glitches.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>You can experience all the thrills of Tales of the Shire‚Äôs main campaign within around 15 hours, but, of course, you‚Äôre free to while away your time in Bywater for as long as you please. That said, I suspect most will be begging for a wizard to come give them something better to do before long.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Tales of the Shire is a frustrating missed opportunity. Decent cooking mechanics aside, nearly everything else you‚Äôd hope to see from a cozy hobbit life sim is either missing or half-heartedly executed. Meanwhile, those familiar with developer Weta Workshop for their contributions to the groundbreaking Lord of the Rings films will likely be surprised by how technically inept the game is. Even the smallest person can change the course of the future, but in this case, our furry-footed friends simply fall short.</p>

                <p>The first big game of the Switch 2 era has emerged, as Nintendo has sold almost as many units of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> as actual Switch 2 consoles. In its Q1 financial results for the three months that ended on June 30, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo reported</a> that it had sold 8.67 million units, with Mario Kart World being responsible for 5.63 million of those sales. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">This is almost as many units sold as Switch 2 consoles sold</a>, indicating a very high attach rate.</p><p>To put this into context, it is worth noting that Nintendo launched the Switch 2 with a bundle deal that included Mario Kart World. Given that the game has an MSRP of $80--and Nintendo rarely drops the price on its evergreen titles--it did make financial sense to grab the bundle and save $30 in the process.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World ‚Äì Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>The game also has a long way to go before it dethrones Nintendo's best-selling game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The Switch game has reached lifetime sales of 68.86 million units, but these are still very early days for Mario Kart World. There will be some competition on the way with Drag X Drive, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A this year, but it'll be interesting to see if Mario Kart World will enjoy the same level of longevity as its predecessor. There are also plenty of third-party games on the way, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/">as this week's Nintendo Direct</a> showed off 25 games headed to the Switch 2 throughout the year and well into 2026.</p><p>Overall, business is good for Nintendo as sales during the quarter that ended on June 30 reached roughly $3.8 billion and operating profit grew 4% to $378 million. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is still predicting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> by March 2026, even during turbulent financial times brought on by US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

            <p>Nintendo sold 5.82m <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> consoles worldwide in its first month of release and 5.63m copies of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, meaning the launch title has an attachment rate of around 97 percent.</p>
<p>The figures come from <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Nintendo's latest earnings release</a> as of 30th June, where the company added software sales for Switch 2 reached 8.67m units in that same period. That means Mario Kart World accounts for 65 percent of all software sales on the new console.</p>
<p>Nintendo added, in the seven weeks since launch, the Switch 2 has sold over 6m units worldwide. Even so, Nintendo has noted demand is exceeding supply in many countries.</p>

<p>Clearly the console and racing game bundle has proven a popular option for customers. Mario Kart World was the primary launch game for the new console, and was also available to buy separately.</p>
<p>Shortly after the console's launch, Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Switch 2 was the company's fastest-selling hardware ever</a>, moving 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale. Last week, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-video-game-hardware-device-in-us-history-usurping-the-ps4">Switch 2 is the fastest-selling video game hardware device in the US</a>, beating the PS4.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, sales of the original Switch console have now reached 153.10m units.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">Nintendo expects to sell 4.5m Switch consoles</a>, which would see the console usurping the Nintendo DS as the company's highest-selling piece of hardware - it's now less than 1m sales behind. That's still quite a way from the PS2, though, which is estimated to have sold 160m units as the best selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Overall, Nintendo's net sales grew by 132.1 percent year-on-year thanks to the Switch 2's launch, while gross profit increased by 21.4 percent to 185.1bn yen. The gross profit margin declined due to a lower profit margin of the Switch 2 compared with the previous console.</p>
<p>Digital sales decreased by 13.5 percent, but still account for 59.3 percent of all software sales. Nintendo attributes this to a "decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software".</p>
<p>Nintendo has not changed its financial forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year, where it expects to sell 15m Switch 2 consoles worldwide. This has not been impacted by US tariff measures, echoing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-sales-forecast-not-affected-by-production-or-tariffs-nintendo-reiterates">statement from Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa in May</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mega-dragonite-debuts-in-fresh-look-at-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> will be released on Switch consoles on 16th October, as one of Nintendo's key first-party games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-pops-up-on-the-korean-ratings-board-sparking-hope-well-get-a-firm-release-date-soon">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> remains a 2025 release without a specific launch date.</p>

		<p>The Battlefield fanbase experiences the rollercoaster highs and lows of game releases like almost no other. Over the past 15 years, each game‚Äôs launch is greeted with a degree of dismay, the team having to go back and pour even more effort in to rectify issues and pull it into shape, and then, just as it‚Äôs become a beloved entry in the series, you crest the big drop and go hurtling back down to the depths of gaming despair as a new game arrives to start the journey all over again. But there‚Äôs hope for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>. Dreams that this beloved open war shooter really is back to the rose tinted glory days of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/10/31/battlefield-3-multiplayer-console-review/">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/11/04/battlefield-4-review/">Battlefield 4</a>. Are we back? I think we might be back.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Battlefield 6 brings us a contemporary war setting, taking place in an utterly implausible 2027, from a current geopolitical viewpoint, where the steadfast bastion of Western military cooperation that is NATO is suddenly under threat from‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶ a really rich private military corporation? No China, no Russia, it‚Äôs the mercenaries of Pax Armata that are the baddies, managing to chip away at the allies, the war that breaks out stretching from the Middle East, from Egypt, through Gibraltar and even coming to US shores with a battle in Brooklyn. Truthfully, it doesn‚Äôt matter who the goodies and the baddies are for the multiplayer, but it does feel a bit toetippy and safe after the games of the early 2010s.</p>


<p>What really matters is what the combat and action is like, and here it‚Äôs classic Battlefield. There‚Äôs four classes ‚Äì Assault, Engineer, Support and Recon ‚Äì and you‚Äôre in squads of up to four, trying to use your different roles and skills to complement one another and with a squad leader marking objectives to try and coordinate your efforts. Assault is about crashing into situations, able to boost themselves with a shot of adrenaline and coming with two main weapons, Engineer has the rockets and blow torch, Support bundles together the old Medic healing, ammo resupply and barricades, and Recon is all about scoping out the enemy with drones, placing spawn points, and the like. There‚Äôs the usual remixing of familiar abilities into these four buckets, and outside of the smushed together duties for the Support class, it‚Äôs a lot like the good old days‚Ä¶ specifically the good days of Bad Company 2‚Äôs classes. Assault does have a personal health stim, but needs Recon to take out tanks and Support for healing and ammo.</p>


<p>Alongside the gadgets of your class, there‚Äôs also a new score-based perk system in Field Specs that rewards you with passive and active boosts. These start small, like starting your own health regen when you revive an ally as a Medic, hampering enemy vehicle repairs when damaging them as an Engineer, or building up to a top tier ability that you manually trigger, like Assault‚Äôs Combat Stimulant which highlights nearby sounds and reveals enemies. These feel like they‚Äôll be gameplay style enhancements instead of wholesale class mods, but we‚Äôll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>But there‚Äôs still some controversy. You see, where weapons used to be locked to particular classes in Battlefield V and before, that‚Äôs no longer the case. Each class still has a ‚Äúsignature‚Äù weapon type, and there‚Äôs boosters for embracing that synergy, so engineers have better hip-fire control with the SMGs, and Assault can draw and switch weapons quicker with an assault rifle, but you‚Äôll also have the freedom to pick from the full selection of weapons. It‚Äôs something that a vocal part of the community has railed against for months, but really it makes sense. Having weapon freedom makes it a smidgeon more likely that someone will sacrifice being an Assault when your squad is faced by a tank.</p>

<p>Bouncing back and forth between roles and weapons, it‚Äôs a bit like putting on an old pair of slippers, but there‚Äôs plenty of fine details to adjust to as well. The one I particularly appreciate was how marking enemies works. Instead of spamming a ping button, you instead mark enemies by shooting at them, in turn giving away your position. I wish you could still just point out a tank, but this is a great change in general. I also really like the new revive system, where you can drag a fallen buddy out from the open and into cover, making you both at least be slow moving targets.</p>
<p>And if we‚Äôre really getting into the week, I love that the end of match screen that highlights squads and achievements has a line chart representation of how tickets were depleted through a match of Conquest.</p>

<p>But really there‚Äôs just all the bombast of Battlefield‚Äôs trademarked all-out warfare. Infantry plays a big role, but so too do vehicles, tanks, helicopters and fighter jets. I can absolutely see myself spending time manning the LMG for a buddy driving a tank, holding down a key position in Conquest and hopping out to fix them up when we take hits. But I also just enjoyed marauding, hopping onto an AA emplacement to take out a pesky helicopter.</p>
<p>The map I played a couple matches on was on the rocky mountainside of Liberation Peak, a set of six control points littered with military defences and buildings. There was some of the destruction available here, but it would really be for the urban battles where this will be felt the most, where entire facades of buildings can collapse in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 will arrive with 9 maps, and almost as many game modes. Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough return as the series staples, but there‚Äôs the small ball of TDM, Squad DM, Domination, KOTH and something new called Escalation. And of course there will be seasons of content with new maps, modes and events.</p>
<p>So, is Battlefield back? At first blush, it certainly feels like it might be. Thankfully it won‚Äôt be long before we can spend more time with it, with two beta weekends kicking off in August, and there‚Äôs sure to be plenty more to be said about this once we‚Äôve played more. But also, there‚Äôs stuff still to really be revealed and explored that will only emerge for the full release. How are weapon unlocks going to play out? How with Field Specs modify each class? What balance changes can DICE really make from the beta to the full game in time for October?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been a while since new information was unearthed regarding the HLX project at Valve, which is thought to be Half-Life 3. Despite the lack of new details, however, work on the project seems to have been proceeding steadily, and development may have reached the final phase, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>In new videos shared yesterday by Tyler McViker and Gabe Follower, it is reported that Counter-Strike 2's massive July 29 update not only brought changes and improvements to the competitive game but also some behind-the-scenes changes to the Source 2 engine related to the Half-Life 3 HLX project. One new line of code in particular, the one mentioning thumpers to scare antlions, which mirrors a line of code in Half-Life 2, seems to be a direct message to dataminers, and further confirmation that the project continues to be in active development.</p>



<p>Not only does the HLX project continue to be in active development, but it may have reached the final phase of development. The most significant change introduced in the new Source 2 engine update is the complete refactoring of AI scripting in the FGD and localization token files. This is pretty significant, as this refactoring has changed how NPCs react to in-game events, going from sounds to what are not called AI events. This has been known to be an HLX feature for a while, but the difference now is that there's a definition file for these AI events, which suggests that the feature is done and polished up to a point that it can be used in scripting and map-making. Hammer, Valve's level design tool, was also recently updated to support many of the Half-Life 3 HLX features discovered in the past few months via datamining, such as vehicle mechanics, wind mechanics, model deformation, thermodynamics mechanics, and more. The fact that the new documentation reads like a tutorial to explain how to use the development tools properly to take advantage of these features also adds more fuel to the fire and even suggests how mod support could be coming not too long after the project launches. Ultimately, this sort of polishing and development tool updates usually happen at the end of development, but considering how differently Valve operates compared to the vast majority of game developers, it cannot be said for certain if the game is close to being announced and released.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other recent happenings may also suggest that the HLX project thought to be Half-Life 3 could be in the final phase of development. Gabe Follower claims in their video that some parts of the project are already finished and need only to be polished, and developers have started moving on to other projects. Usually, this means the project may have been abandoned, but Gabe Follower believes these developers are moving on to other projects because their work on HLX is no longer needed.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned, Valve operates differently from other game development studios, so even if the game is in the final phase of development, an announcement and release timeline for the HLX project, thought to be Half-Life 3, remains unknown. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to learn more about what's next for one of gaming's most celebrated series. </p>

            <p>Itch.io - the digital distribution platform known for its focus on independent game developers and other artists - is today re-indexing adult NSFW (Not Suitable For Work) content that is available for free.</p>
<p>In addition, it is currently in discussions with payment processors who are comfortable with adult material, and will be reintroducing paid content "slowly" to ensure it can "confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term".</p>
<p>Itch.io noted that payment processor Stripe has said it will not support adult content that has been "designed for sexual gratification".</p>

<p>In a statement shared with Itch.io, Stripe said:</p>
<p>"Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future."</p>
<p>In the meantime, Itch.io said those who wish to have their pages eligible for today's re-indexing process must ensure they have the "no payments" option checked.</p>
<p>The platform is also putting a new content warning system in place for pages tagged as being NSFW. It states this refers to pages that have the "contains sensitive material" option checked, as well as tags that suggest the project includes adult content such as "porn" and "fetish".</p>
<p>Itch.io said anyone wanting to be eligible for re-indexing is "required to complete this". The platform added the feature is not quite ready as yet, but those who had their pages previously indexed will be given enough time to complete all the necessary processes "to avoid going in and out of indexing".</p>
<p>You <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">can find further information on the platform's re-indexing efforts via Itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>Today's update from Itch.io follows last week's news that the platform had "deindexed" all NSFW content following discussions with payment processors contacted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal">the same Australian pressure group that recently targeted Steam</a>.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/itchio-deindexes-all-nsfw-games-blames-same-anti-porn-group-that-campaigned-against-steam">itch.io creators began reporting their NSFW games were no longer being displayed in search results on the platform</a>. At this time, platform founder Leaf Corcoran said: "We are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p>
<p>Itch.io's movement followed on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve "retiring" unspecified NSFW titles and introducing vague new rules banning "certain kinds of adult content" from its own PC storefront</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/itch-begins-re-indexing-free-adult-nsfw-content-as-it-seeks-alternative-payment-processors]]></content:encoded>

In fact, with another quarter under its belt, the OG hybrid is edging ever closer to the DS' lifetime sales.</p>
<p>At the latest count, the Switch 1 has sold <strong>153.10 million units</strong>, putting it within touching distance of the DS' <strong>154.02 million</strong> and the title of the best-selling Nintendo system of all time. It only managed 0.98 million sales in the last quarter (a 53.5% decrease on the same period last year), but there was always going to be a notable slowdown once Switch 2 hit the market.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067oznmuy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Here's how the sales break down across the three Switch models:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Switch OLED - 520,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Switch Lite - 230,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Switch - 220,000</strong></li>

<p>While surpassing the DS would put the Switch on <em>Nintendo</em>'s podium of all-time sellers, it will still have some way to go if it is to ever overtake the PlayStation 2's 160+ million units sold ‚Äî which, let's not forget, got a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/as-switch-approaches-the-ps2s-lifetime-sales-sony-moves-the-goalposts">generous five million boost</a> from PlayStation's ex-CEO Jim Ryan last year.</p>
<p>The big 160 feels a long way off for the Switch 1 (Nintendo only forecasts an additional 4.5 million hardware sales for the system in FY 2026), but we'd be surprised if we're <em>not</em> looking at a new Nintendo gold medallist in the next one or two financial reports.</p>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo‚Äôs financial year is off to a bumper start thanks to explosive sales of its Switch 2 console. Following its launch in June, the Switch 2 console has now sold 5.82 million units according to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo‚Äôs Q1 earnings report</a>, more than double the 2.7 million unit sales achieved by the original Switch in its first month.</p><p>‚ÄúCurrently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers,‚Äù Nintendo said in its report, pledging to strengthen production. While Switch 2 preorders sold out across major retailers in the US ahead of the launch, some limited stock was still available on launch day, likely because Nintendo had built up enough inventory to meet initial demand.</p><p>That success is driving a 132 percent surge in quarterly revenue, which increased to ¬•572.3 billion (around $3.8 billion) between April-June, compared to ¬•246.6 billion (around $1.6 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo says it‚Äôs still forecasting to hit 15 million Switch 2 sales by the end of its 2026 financial year, despite uncertainties like Trump‚Äôs tariffs.</p><p>Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">White House announced</a> that a 20 percent tariff on goods from Vietnam ‚Äî where Nintendo produces its Switch 2 consoles ‚Äî will begin next week. That‚Äôs double the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646693/trump-tariffs-pause-nintendo-switch-2">10 percent baseline tariff</a> introduced in April that Nintendo used to forecast earnings for the current fiscal year.</p><p>‚ÄúWhile there have been changes in the market environment since we announced our initial forecast for the fiscal year, such as the US tariff measures, at this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year,‚Äù <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">Nintendo said</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2‚Äôs popularity at launch has made it the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console</a> of all time. Meanwhile, people are still purchasing the first Switch console, which has now hit 153.1 million units in lifetime sales ‚Äî inching closer to dethroning the DS as Nintendo‚Äôs most successful console, which sold 154.02 million units. The Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Right, so. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">supposed to go</a> as follows: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-3-remaster">Yakuza 3 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-4-remaster">Yakuza 4 Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-5">Yakuza 5</a> Remastered, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-6">Yakuza 6: The Song Of Life</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a>, then off into full-blown Like A Dragon land, and on to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza</a>. Easy. Except right now in my Steam library, it's not. The Kiwamis are cheekily lurking behind Yakuza 6, and the LADs are before all of their more Japanese gangsterly-named siblings.</p>
<p>It's chaos and anarchy. I can't live like this. The good news is that thanks to the update Steam's Client Beta has just gotten, it looks like I'll no longer have to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Added a customisation tab to game properties," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4397053/view/545616353498759462?l=english">the notes</a> for it read, "The customisation tab allows users to view and set custom artwork for the game and set a custom sort title that will be used instead of the actual title when sorting games in the library."</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://x.com/chibilawl/status/1951056729778823585">many</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1meelqh/theyre_finally_doing_it_oh_my_god/">many</a> folks who've been frustratedly looking at the alphabetically misbehaving names in their library letting out a big sigh of relief. To be clear, the custom name you add won't overwrite the game's display name in your library, it's just hidden away behind-the-scenes, letting the storefront's inner workings know not to put 2016's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rise-of-the-tomb-raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> above 2013's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a>.</p>
<p>Outside of that, this Client Beta update's all about useful but unglamourous fixes for various issues you might run into when Steaming. Some are specifically aimed at big picture mode, recording games, and Linux, with a good chunk of them being interface-related.</p>
<p>Oh, and the top genres list in the store menu should now be "more relevant and dynamic", which I assume means you'll know in an instant if Steamers all over the world suddenly get way more into shmups.</p>
<p>If you've taken one look at the new sorting powers on offer and are currently salivating at the prospect of getting your librarian on, instructions to opt into the Client Beta can be found <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">here</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/praise-the-kiryu-steams-latest-client-beta-update-will-finally-let-you-sort-like-a-dragons-and-yakuza-into-the-right-order]]></content:encoded>

With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin">weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</a>, some fans have said they‚Äôve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and have pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Battlefield 6, a game EA is pitching as having a ‚Äúgritty realism‚Äù aesthetic. But will this extend to skins? In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/battlefield-6-dev-responds-to-fears-of-unrealistic-beevis-and-butthead-skins-we-listen/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VideoGamer</a>, UX director Alan Pimm said he was unaware of any internal plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWhat I can tell you is I don‚Äôt know of any plans and, at the moment, that package is the ‚Äògritty realism‚Äô and that we listen. That I can tell you,‚Äù he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we must also bear in mind that there is enormous pressure on Battlefield 6 to do the business for EA. Indeed the company has said it‚Äôs all in on the game, which it sees as a platform just as Activision does with Call of Duty. It would be naive to expect EA to resist the temptation to release eye-catching skins, and even crossover with other IP for bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question is, how far will it go? Will EA, when all is said and do, stick with Battlefield 6‚Äôs ‚Äúgritty realism‚Äù when it comes to skins, as Call of Duty initially set out to? Or will it buckle and end up going down the same path with 90s cartoon skins of its own?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/01/f2dyabzwaaa5-ec-1754039802526.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Nicki Minaj hit Call of Duty in 2023.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a separate interview with DBLTAP, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's committment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg">Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúIt has to be grounded," he said.

Nintendo said demand for Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and it apologizes to consumers. ‚ÄúWe will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible,‚Äù the company said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It‚Äôs a fantastic result for the Switch 2 hardware itself, which is comfortably the fastest-selling in Nintendo history. Nintendo said demand ‚Äúhas surpassed our expectations.‚Äù Still, it‚Äôs sticking to its forecast of selling 15 million Switch 2 units in the financial year ending March 2026.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for games, Nintendo said Switch 2 software sales reached 8.67 million units. Launch title Mario Kart World made up the bulk of those game sales, shifting 5.63 million units (almost as many as the Switch 2 itself has sold). But it‚Äôs worth noting that figure includes units bundled with the hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is that overall sales totaled 572.3 billion yen (approx. $3.8 billion), and operating profit grew 4% to 56.9 billion yen ($378 million) for the three months ending June 30. After all the furore over Trump‚Äôs tariffs and changing product prices, in its financial report Nintendo said ‚Äúat this time there is no significant impact on our earnings forecast for this fiscal year.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, demand for the OG Switch has remained even after the launch of the Switch, and sales of the console inched ever higher, and are now at 153.1 million. The number of annual playing users between July 2024 and June 2025 has remained above 100 million, which means Nintendo launched Switch 2 into an environment where a huge number of people were already playing Switch.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming Switch 2 exclusives include Drag x Drive, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and FromSoftware's The Duskbloods.

The company claimed Tencent's upcoming survival adventure, Light of Motiram, is a "blatant" and "unlawful" copy of its own sci-fi series. Tencent describes the game as taking place in a "world overrun by colossal machines" on its Steam store page. Sound familiar? Sony wants a court to prevent Tencent from marketing and distributing the title, and in a wild twist even alleges that Tencent sought to license the Horizon IP in 2024 before revealing Light of Motiram a few months later.

EA boss Andrew Wilson claims EA Sports will transcend its humble origins as a mere video game studio to become the "'most valuable sports business in the world." He made the rather zealous proclamation during the company's latest earnings call, and suggested the burgeoning division will continue to explore ways to engage and integrate with real-world sports teams and their fans to cultivate "deeply immersive, socially driven experiences."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-s-grow-a-garden-had-nearly-22-million-concurrent-users-in-july" target="_self" data-discover="true">Roblox UGC game Grow a Garden had nearly 22 million concurrent users in July</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Yes, Reality Labs is still losing billions"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/yes-reality-labs-is-still-losing-billions">Yes, Reality Labs is still losing billions</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Meta's freewheeling metaverse division, Reality Labs, continues to use cash as kindling. The business lost $4.5 billion during the second quarter of the current fiscal year, with Meta attributing those losses (jn part) to declining Quest headset sales. Reality Labs was wrestled into being to fulfil Meta's grandiose metaverse ambitions, but has now lost over $56 billion since 2022.

During a recent earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the company was "the top publisher on both Xbox and PlayStation" during the last quarter thanks to the successful launches Forza Horizon 5 and Oblivion Remastered. He also confirmed the company has 40 titles in development across its studios, which recently suffered another round of layoffs at the hands of the U.S. company.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turkey-based-mobile-dev-good-job-games-raises-60m-series-a-round" target="_self" data-discover="true">Turkey-based mobile dev Good Job Games raises $60M Series A round</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-they-are-not-losing-money-they-re-gaining-less-aheartfulofgames-accuses-parent-company-outright-games-of-mismanagement-ahead-of-purported-closure">'They are not losing money, they're gaining less:' Aheartfulofgames accuses owner Outright Games of mismanagement ahead of closure</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Madrid-based studio Aheartfulofgames came out swinging this week and accused its parent company Outright Games of mismanagement and neglect after being marked for closure.

They also allege that Outright outsourced work that could have been handled internally to justify the closure.

Although The Pokemon Company has a legal right to use fan artwork, the company replaced the Ho-oh EX card and its Lugia EX counterpart with placeholders and said its production team had provided "incorrect reference materials" as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to produce the artwork.

<p>Switch 2 launched on 5th June and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf">today's Q1 financial report</a> includes figures up to the end of that month. The stated figure of "more than 6 million" accounts for sales past that date, though, to approximately 24th July (seven weeks post-launch).</p>
<p>As of 30th June, Nintendo had sold 5.82 million Switch 2s (3.5 million <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">in the first four days</a>) along with 5.63 million copies of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, including the digital downloads included in the popular Mario Kart hardware bundle. Overall Switch 2 software sales totalled 8.67 million units.</p>
<p>For comparison, the original Switch managed to shift 0.98 million units in the same period, down from 2.1 million in the same quarter last year (-53.5%), bringing it to a lifetime total of 153.10 million units so far. Switch 1 software sales came in at 24.4 million, down from 30.64 million in Q1 last year (-20.4%).</p>
<p>Here's the regional breakdown for Switch 2 hardware sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan: 1.27 million</li>
<li>The Americas: 2.08 million</li>
<li>Europe: 1.34 million</li>
<li>Other: 1.13 million</li>
</ul>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33cb7f24bec8/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> launched to critical acclaim, but isn't included in today's results (it launched in July) ‚Äî <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you'd expect following a successful console launch, gross profit increased 21.4% year-on-year (to 185.1 billion yen), although the lower profit made on the newer hardware meant profit margins declined 29.5 points to 32.3%.</p>
<p>Nintendo's forecast to sell 15 million Switch 2 units this financial year remains unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-expects-to-sell-15-million-switch-2-consoles-this-financial-year">its May forecasts</a>. The company expects to sell 45 million software units in the same period.</p>
<p>The report states that demand for the new system is exceeding supply "in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers."</p>
<hr>
<p><em>tl;dr: Switch 2 sold like hotcakes, Mario Kart World has a crazy-good attach rate (as you'd expect), and Nintendo's new generation is off to a very solid, record-breaking start.</em></p>

It will also 'only' require 75GB of your drive's space at launch, and the game even runs on a traditional HDD.</p>

<p>Of course, at this time, we don't know if there will be any support for ray tracing effects, although it would be weird if not. After all, Battlefield V was <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-bfv-nvidia-rtx/">one of the very first games to support NVIDIA RTX</a>, specifically for reflections. The support of PC upscalers like NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel is practically a guarantee, though.</p>

                                        <p>When I was growing up, E3 was one of the events in the calendar that I looked forward to the most. From console reveals to star-studded conferences, the Electronic Entertainment Expo was a series of corporate conferences that somehow felt like The Oscars, Comic-Con and Glastonbury combined. It was there that Final Fantasy VII Remake and The Last Guardian were finally shown (at the same conference); where then Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aim√© made his public debut; and the venue where Keanu Reeves told a packed LA auditorium that they were all breathtaking. Yet for all its show-stopping game and console reveals, after 2020, it was the show itself that stopped, with the last in-person E3 taking place in 2019.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540186"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540186-gamescom_24_071_091.jpg"></figure><p>Luckily for mourning gamers, there was always another world-leading interactive entertainment show that connected fans and industry folk with demos, head-turning announcements and best-in-class community events: Germany's gamescom. Where E3 was an event that was media-only for most of its existence, gamescom was always--and very much continues to be--a public-facing celebration of games and gamers; a convention that is just as brilliant for inspiring world-beating cosplay as it is for connecting journalists with publishers and industry folks in the business area. E3 may be gone, but gamescom is still here, having established itself as the world's biggest and best gaming event.</p><p>Since 2019, gamescom has begun hosting its own games announcements, with the annual Geoff Keighley-hosted gamescom Opening Night Live gaining a reputation for delivering a non-stop cavalcade of exciting reveals. With gamescom's annual August celebration now comfortably the largest gaming event in the world--and with new gamescom sister events now delighting gamers in Brazil and Singapore (gamescom Asia is moving to Thailand for its next event)--it feels like the right time to celebrate the legacy of gaming's most beloved event. So, without further ado, here's a history of how Cologne's once humble convention went on to change the game forever.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540187" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540187"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540187-gamescom_24_069_001.jpg"></figure><h2>gamescom Origins</h2><p>Starting life in 2009, gamescom immediately attracted the attention of the biggest publishers in the games industry, alongside 228,000 excitable punters. With 450 exhibitors showing up in its first year, the inaugural gamescom also saw Sony announce the PlayStation 3 Slim, alongside Microsoft revealing Fable 3 for the first time. Since then, gamescom has only gone from strength to strength, attracting more players, developers and publishers with each new year that goes by.</p><p>Esports became a cornerstone of the Cologne convention. In 2011, gamescom hosted the first-ever DOTA 2 international tournament to great success, leading to massive Starcraft 2, League of Legends, and Counter Strike competitions being held at gamescom in the following years. By 2017, gamescom had attracted over 100,000 more visitors, with 355,000 people attending the event, and gamescom's doors were opened by none other than Germany‚Äôs Chancellor, Angela Merkel.</p><p>Alongside these public-facing demos and reveals, from 2009-2016, gamescom also hosted a sister developer-focused event, a European spin-off of San Francisco‚Äôs legendary Game Developer Conference.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540188" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540188"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540188-gamescom_24_068_066.jpg"></figure><h2>gamescom Revelations</h2><p>In 2018, gamescom had over 1000 exhibitors showcasing at their event. Nvidia made headlines that year by revealing their GeForce RTX 20 Series at the event, with 370,000 gamers, developers, journalists and publishers all making the pilgrimage to Cologne to see the best games in the world. Thankfully, 2018 was also the last year that only those on the ground could share in the fun. Ten years after gamescom first opened its doors, in 2019, gamescom kicked off its first-ever livestreamed event--gamescom ONL. Hosted by The Game Awards' Geoff Keighley, gamescom ONL immediately cemented itself as a marquee, industry-shaping showcase, with new looks at Gears of War 5, Call of Duty, and Death Stranding alongside announcements of titles like Little Nightmares 2. With 1,500 people watching live in the auditorium and over 500,000 people tuning in online, gamescom ONL was a huge success.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540192"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540192-gamescom_24_068_072.jpg"></figure><p>As the pandemic hurriedly cancelled events and public gatherings across the world, gamescom took the entire show online, its 2020 edition delivering a jam-packed schedule of online developer interviews and new looks at games alongside its second gamescom Opening Night Live. It was also the first time gamescom published content specifically for independent gaming with gamescom awesome indies. The show provided recognition for the hardworking, creative indie developers who produce some of the most unique games in the industry, and also provided tantalising teasers for gamers who appreciate the indie scene.</p><h2>gamescom Evolution</h2><p>As the world reopened after the pandemic, so did gamescom, with 2022's edition offering gamers a canny mix of online and in-person events. Since then, gamescom has only become more vital for the games industry--the beating heart of in-person game feedback, world-exclusive demos, and dream-fulfilling game reveals. Over the years, gamescom's cultural and political influence has continued to grow, with Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel's visit in 2017 followed by German ministers like Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck in 2023 and 2024. Federal Minister for Research, Dorothee B√§r--the representative responsible for games in the new German government--has also attended. European games associations such as Video Games Europe and EGDF also regularly take advantage of gamescom, using it as a place to invite political leaders to the event, with 2024's gamescom hosting over 500 political guests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540193"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540193-gamescom_24_068_064.jpg"></figure><p>Yet it‚Äôs not just the in-person extravaganza that has blossomed. In its five short years of existence, gamescom Opening Night Live has only gone from strength to strength, establishing itself as a key event in gaming culture‚Äôs calendar. Gamescom ONL has been chosen as the place to reveal Borderlands 4, Dead Island 2, Dune Awakening, and many others, with 2024‚Äôs edition seeing 44 million viewers watching the show's content globally.</p><p>Last year, gamescom tripled its opening exhibitor number, hosting 1,462 exhibitors, with even more exhibitors and visitors expected in 2025. With the inaugural years of gamescom asia X Thailand Game Show and gamescom latam already attracting huge industry attention, gamescom looks set to continue its reputation for hosting the biggest and best events in video games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540189-gamescom_24_060_042.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540189" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540189-gamescom_24_060_042.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540189"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4540189-gamescom_24_060_042.jpg"></figure><p>There's <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/tickets/buy-tickets" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">still time to pick up tickets for gamescom 2025</a>, which runs from August 20th to August 24th.

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X will be able to choose between Quality and Performance visual modes when the game launches in a week's time.</p>
<p>Those who prefer a higher resolution should plump for Quality Mode, while those who would rather prioritise framerate should go for Performance Mode. <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1951012716409397433">The studio</a> said Mafia: The Old Country will run at an "average" of 60fps when played in Performance Mode. The studio's statement does not include Xbox Series S, which will presumably run at a lower framerate.</p>
<p>In addition, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a> has confirmed the PC requirements from Minimum (suitable for older hardware) to Epic ("If you've got a powerful-enough PC, these Epic specs will give you the absolute best visual fidelity for Mafia: The Old Country's rendition of 1900s Sicily").</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pok√©mon TCG Pocket</a> team has asked its community to stop directly blaming or criticising the artist who created cards for its mobile trading game using "incorrect reference materials", which turned out to be unofficial fan art.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it came to light that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-developer-apologises-deeply-after-players-discover-key-artwork-for-its-new-set-was-based-on-fan-drawing">fan artwork had been inadvertently used as a reference to create cards for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket's Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion</a>. At this time, the developer acknowledged it had "provided incorrect reference materials as official documents" to the artist who was commissioned to create the cards in question. However, it never explicitly stated how the materials were provided, and in the time since many were still directing the blame towards the illustrator themself for copying the fan art.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Now, Pok√©mon TCG Pocket's publisher The Pok√©mon Company together with developer Creatures Inc have issued a new statement, affirming the blame does not lie with the illustrator but with them.</p>
<p>"Regarding the previously announced issue with the Ho-Oh EX (3-star) and Lugia EX (3-star) illustrations ‚Äì it has come to our attention that there is criticism towards the cards' illustrator circulating online," the statement, which was shared via the official Japanese X account of Pok√©mon TCG Pocket, reads (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-claims-full-responsibility-for-tcg-pocket-card-plagiarism-issue-asks-fans-not-to-criticize-artist/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"The illustration errors were caused by the production teams of The Pok√©mon Company and Creatures Inc, who provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator, and we intend to take full responsibility for it."</p>
<p>The companies explained there are two workflows when it comes to creating cards for Pok√©mon TCG Pocket - either illustrators have creative control over the card designs, which is the most common practice, or the game's production team create a 'blueprint' of what it requires for a card. A commissioned illustrator then tweaks and finalises the concept before it is added into the game, and it would appear that this is what happened with the production of the since-removed Ho-oh and Lugia cards.</p> <div>

<p>The Pok√©mon Company and Creatures Inc have asked the community to stop blaming and criticising the illustrator for what they admit is their error, and said they will enforce stricter measures going forward, to ensure this kind of mix up does not happen again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the affected cards have been replaced with placeholders cards which read "New Artwork Coming Soon" in lieu of a creature (see below).</p>

			<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quarterly financials</a> just delivered an update on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 sales</a>. According to the Big N, the hardware has now exceeded a sell-through of six million units in the seven weeks after launch. By the end of the quarter that ended in June, the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold 5.82 million units. Software sales for the platform have reached 8.67 million units in total, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> unsurprisingly taking up the lion's share (5.63 million units, nearly one per Switch 2 buyer).</p>



<p>Nintendo recognized the existing supply issue:</p>



<p><em>Currently, demand for Nintendo Switch 2 is exceeding supply in many countries, and we regret the inconvenience this is causing our consumers. We will continue to strengthen our production and supply systems to deliver as much Nintendo Switch 2 hardware as possible.</em></p>



<p>The previous conservative forecast of 15 million Switch 2 units and 45 million software units sold in fiscal year 2026 remains unchanged. </p>



<p>Net sales predictably boomed in this first quarter compared to last year, from 246.6 billion yen ($1.6 billion) to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion), marking a 132.1% increase. However, the IP related business decreased slightly this quarter (from 17.5 billion yen to 16.7 billion yen, a 4.4% downgrade) due to decreased revenue related to The Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>

            <p>Earlier this year, Black Flag actor Matt Ryan suggested Ubisoft was set to release a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry, and it now sounds like the developer wasn't exactly thrilled about that.</p>
<p>Ryan portrayed Edward Kenway in Assassin's Creed Black Flag, which came out in 2013. It soon became a series favourite for many, and in recent times rumours of a remake have been making the rounds.</p>

<p>These rumours were amplified again in June, when Ryan hinted not very subtly to one fan they should perhaps get ready to replay the game, implying with a bit of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' that the remake was indeed real.</p>
<p>"Have you beaten [Black Flag]?" Ryan asked a fan in a clip that was shared around social media (see below). The fan confirmed they had but some time ago, to which Ryan followed up with: "Well, you might have to beat it again‚Ä¶"</p>
<p>When the fan suggested maybe playing through all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a>, Ryan replied: "Well, especially this one‚Ä¶ There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything." </p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, said this during a fan interaction.

<p>Anyway, fast forward to today, and it turns out not only was Ubisoft unhappy that Ryan had been a little loose-lipped, but the company actually also threatened him with legal action.</p>
<p>At another more recent convention, the Edward Kenway actor was asked about a Black Flag remake or remaster, to which he replied with a casual shrug and a "I don't know, mate". The questioner then pressed Ryan further, calling back to the previous video from June, when the actor then explained:</p>
<p>"Well, the thing is, that when that happened, someone was doing this [gestures towards the person filming the exchange], and I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone.</p>
<p>"And then the company threatened to sue me. So [now] I say nothing." A video of the exchange was uploaded to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kylo_hd659/video/7532502046889528598">TikTok</a> but has since been removed. A copy is embedded below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn‚Äôt realize he was being recordedüòµ <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>‚Äî The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Eurogamer has asked Ubisoft for further comment on Ryan's Black Flag-flavoured exchanges, and will update you if we hear anything more.</p>
<p>Word of a Black Flag remake first began circulating in 2023, when it was said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved". Of course, Skull and Bones - which sadly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skull-and-bones-metacritic-user-reviews-open-to-generally-unfavourable-scores">failed to really get any decent wind in its sails following its launch last year</a> - began life as a spin-off from Black Flag.</p>
<p>At the time of this initial rumour, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">project was not expected to be completed for "at least a few years"</a>, though given we are now marching firmly into the latter half of 2025, a 'few years' is actually coming up <em>relatively </em>soon now. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 6 & PlayStation Handheld Specs Leaked ‚Äì Rasterization Performance Estimated to be 3X and 0.5X of PS5, Respectively]]></title>

			<p>Following Monday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> on the PlayStation 6 and PlayStation handheld codenames (Orion and Canis), YouTube Moore's Law Is Dead (MLID) has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tym6xxCKvHg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared</a> specs for both upcoming consoles from a leaked 2023 AMD presentation.</p>



<p>According to the leaks, Sony is going for a relatively conservative system. Its main goal will be keeping power lower than a base PlayStation 5, with the target being 160W TBP. The console will employ a chiplet design, with 8 Zen 6 cores and between 40 and 48 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked at over 3GHz.</p>



<p>These are fewer Compute Units than the 60 available for the PlayStation 5 Pro, but they will run much faster. Moreover, RDNA 5 is expected to bring a noticeable improvement in IPC performance, so each Compute Unit will deliver more performance than the CUs in the PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>The memory also has a lower bus than the PS5 Pro (160 or 192 bit compared to the PS5 Pro's 256 bit), but it will be powered by the much faster GDDR7, allowing it to reach clocks of 32Gbps for an estimated bandwidth of 640GB/s-768GB/s, depending on the final bus spec. That's higher than the PS5 Pro's bandwidth of 576GB/s.</p>



<p>Overall, the estimation is that rasterization performance will be over three times that of the base PlayStation 5 and around double that of the newer PlayStation 5 Pro. That would place the performance level of the PlayStation 6 roughly around a GeForce RTX 4080, although of course, it's never quite an apples-to-apples comparison when measuring consoles and PC GPUs directly. The uplift of ray tracing performance should be much higher (6-10x), thanks to the expected advancements AMD will bring in the area. </p>



<p>Backward compatibility is expected to be maintained for PS5 and PS4. The production phase should begin in mid-2027, with an estimated release in stores in late 2027 or early 2028 for a price of around $499.</p>



<p>As for the Project Canis handheld, it should use a monolithic 3nm die equipped with 4 Zen 6C cores. The GPU is expected to have between 12 and 20 RDNA 5 Compute Units clocked between 1.6 and 2.2GHz. The memory will equip a 128-bit bus with LPDDR5X 7500 RAM. Sony is reportedly targeting a 15-watt thermal board power.</p>



<p>Rasterization performance should be around half that of the base PlayStation 5, but thanks to the advancements brought by the RDNA 5 architecture, the uplift of ray tracing performance should be higher. The handheld should also feature backward compatibility with PS4 and PS5, microSD and M.2 SSD storage support, haptic feedback, dual microphones, a touchscreen, and a USB-C port supporting fast charging and video output.</p>



<p>Overall, it should easily outperform the Xbox Ally X. However, that's not saying much since that handheld is launching soon, and the PlayStation handheld is instead targeting a similar launch window to its bigger sibling, the PlayStation 6. Pricing estimates put it around $400 or $500.</p>



<p>Moore's Law Is Dead also briefly touched upon the next-generation Xbox console, whose codename is Magnus. It should be equipped with 11 Zen 6 cores and 68 Compute Units, proving to be more powerful than the PS5 Pro but not quite a match for the PlayStation 6. However, it should launch sooner than that, which resonates with <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rumors</a> that Microsoft might be looking to try a repeat of the Xbox 360 situation, which debuted one year before the PlayStation 3 and was Xbox's most successful console to date. Still, the YouTuber says the new Xbox console won't be available before 2027.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the specs came from an old presentation. Therefore, specific details might have changed since. We won't know the official specs until well into 2026, at the very least. Until then, stay tuned.</p>
