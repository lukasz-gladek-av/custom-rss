		<p>The firmly current gen remake of Yooka-Laylee – cutely dubbed Yooka-Replaylee – has been confirmed for release on consoles, with Playtonic targeting PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and “Nintendo platforms”, which surely means Nintendo Switch 2 and not the current console, or they’d just say it was for Switch. The game is also coming to PC, as previously confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Console Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGfmssnKf1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We’re in a very curious spot for remakes and remasters right now, with Yooka-Replaylee a remake of a game that’s just shy of 10 years old. The game was the debut title for Playtonic Games, who<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/01/the-banjo-kazooie-spiritual-successor-is-called-yooka-laylee/"> kickstarted the project back in 2015</a>, eventually releasing &nbsp;it in 2017.</p>
<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a> to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p>It does look rather pretty, I must say, though I’d hope this is a stepping stone to a full 3D platformer sequel, if it proves to be popular enough. There was also the side-scrolling spin off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review/">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>.</p>

<p>The spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee was a love letter to the early heyday of the collectathon 3D platformer. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish studio established by former <a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-studio-founder-opens-up-on-2015s-mad-max-development-blames-warner-bros-for-canceled-dlc-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg</a>, has <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1849727432904872311" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first in-game screenshots of its GTA-like open-world game, and they look stunning. When asked whether these were actual images, the official X account confirmed they were real.</p>
<p>The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, whereas Avalanche has historically used its own Apex engine for Just Cause, Mad Max, and Rage 2. Tech Director Fredrik Lönn explained the engine choice with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Custom engines were historically the way forward, and that's what my former team at Avalanche did over 18 years ago when development started on Just Cause 1. The landscape has changed since then, and now it's quite the opposite. </em><em>We decided to go with Unreal Engine 5. Unreal has been proven for high-quality AAA games, both by Epic themselves in the case of Fortnite and by other game studios worldwide shipping amazing games on Unreal. With Epic making improvements toward open-world development, we get full access to the source code, and the integrations with other software and pipelines are excellent.</em></p>

<p>Liquid Swords was founded in December 2020. Sundberg recalled why he created this new studio:</p>
<p><em>In December 2020, I set out on a journey to make a difference in the world of game development– which has been my professional and entertainment world since the early 90s. I want to make a difference to how games are made, how the teams work, and how the creative process evolves. Liquid Swords is the realization of an ambition to refocus the game-development process.</em></p>
<p>Around two years later, the studio announced it had received an investment from NetEase Games. Sundberg said at the time:</p>
<p><em>NetEase Games has been exceptionally supportive from the very get-go, believing in our high ambitions and quality-focused approach to game development. We are very pleased to have them as our partners on this adventure and with their support, we can begin to realize the vision for our studio.</em></p>
<p>While those screenshots are indeed very reminiscent of a photorealistic version of Rockstar's GTA series, Liquid Swords is making a single player open world, narrative driven action RPG. We still don't know anything else, but hopefully that will change soon following these first screenshots.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-accessible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-will-be-a-very-accessible-game-for-newcomers-traversal-improvements-detailed.1019220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-accessible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be a very accessible game for newcomers, thanks to the implementation of some new features.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a>, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto commented on some of the new game mechanics, including those that are meant to ease newcomers into the experience, such as tutorials. These tutorials, which teach the basics of the experience, come with some options that allow players to tweak them to show as little or as much as they want. These tweaking options are certainly quite welcome, as they will not only help newcomers but will also allow more experienced players to hide them so that they can play without any hindrance right from the start. Tsujimoto-san also mentioned that players can get some help from Alma the handler to pick the weapon best suited for their play styles by replying to some questions. This feature was also available in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom demo</a> I had the chance to try out earlier this year, so it is likely it will be in next week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/">open beta</a>, which seems to be based on the public demos, and in the final game as well.</p>
<p>Not every new feature in Monster Hunter Wilds was implemented just to help newcomers, however. The introduction of weapon switching, for example, is meant to provide players with more options and not break the gameplay action loop too much. As for why players can only bring two weapons, Tsujimoto-san confirmed it was to make things realistic, as being able to switch between all 14 types wouldn't have been so. Palicoes now being able to talk was also a change that was made to help the flow of action, as auditory cues are just better than visual ones in this regard. If players want, however, they can revert the Palicoes' voices to the meows of the previous entries in the series. Speaking of characters talking, Tsujimoto-san also confirmed that the hunter talking was a change made to help immersion, but players shouldn't expect them to speak a lot, as the team wanted to keep the tone of the series intact in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Thanks to feedback from Monster Hunter World, traversal has been improved considerably in the new entry in the series. The introduction of bigger, seamless maps proved to be somewhat of an issue for some players in the 2018 game, and with the bigger maps of Monster Hunter Wilds, Scoutflies wouldn't have been enough. With the technological advancements made in the past few years, the development team not only was able to implement the Seikret, but also to improve their AI so much that they can bring the player to the target monster by pressing a single button.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ryozo Tsujimoto Making Monster Hunter Wilds EASIER for Newcomers | GCA 2024 Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lezi2Pwx5zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Thanks to the aforementioned open beta, players on all formats will be able to try out the game next week.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars.1019217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>has an impressive credits screen if nothing else.</p>

<p>It boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-adventure-thriller-killer7-makes-its-way-to-steam"><em>Killer7</em></a>&nbsp;creator Suda51,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>mastermind Shinji Mikami, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/akira-yamaoka-would-love-to-return-to-silent-hill"><em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka</a>, as well as legendary cult manga artist Q Hayashida, and that's a pretty darn big sell.</p>

<p>Released in 2011,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>didn't do much sales-wise, but it did garner a cult following in the years after its arrival, so here's Suda's company Grasshopper Manufacture, along with new owner NetEase, to give demon hunter Garcia Hotspur's journey through hell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-announced-by-grasshopper-manufacture-grasshopper-direct">a new coat of paint</a>.</p>

<p>Lo and behold,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>(very funny, Suda) is exactly what you think it is: a lovable, flawed relic of the seventh console generation. This is the kind of remaster that preserves all of the original's warts and selling points; it's just as fun, just as janky, and just as unfinished as it ever was.</p>

<h2><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>Is Good Old-Fashioned Fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-boss.jpg?itok=hi4GmvRu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-boss.jpg?itok=Lq2aVBgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like the simple, no-frills fun offered by old-school seventh-gen gaming, you're in for a treat here.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given Mikami's involvement,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>plays like a sort of grungy heavy metal-inflected&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, complete with over-the-shoulder third-person shooting and a slightly insane smorgasbord of gameplay styles thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>Over the course of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</em>'s eight-hour running time, you'll explore&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>-style villages, solve what could generously be described as "puzzles", and even take part in side-scrolling shooter stages apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to create a package that feels pleasingly old-school.&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>feels concerned not with wringing every last drop of dopamine out of your exhausted brain, but with showing you all of its many toys and letting you play with each one for just enough time that it never feels boring.</p>

<p>Unlike many of its contemporaries,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is split into stages rather than being one continuous journey.</p>

<p>Each stage has something unique and interesting about it, whether that's a gameplay style switch-up, a new puzzle mechanic, or a boss fight that asks you to demonstrate some of the tools you've been amassing over the past few levels.</p>

<p>Blessedly for our bloated modern age,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>doesn't outstay its welcome, either. As soon as it runs out of ideas (and some may say sooner than that), it makes its exit, so you won't have time to grow restless or bored while you're experiencing this Suda51 trip.</p>

<p>The core combat feels great in&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, too. Each weapon has a pleasing kick to it, and the upgrades you receive over the course of Garcia's journey feel meaningful, making slaughtering demons a consistent delight throughout.</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-big-boner.jpg?itok=tCC4ia3R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-big-boner.jpg?itok=ZwxPUWSA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is very much still the same&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>it was back in 2011.</figcaption></figure><p>If you feel like I've only talked about the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>so far in this&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>review, there's a very good reason for that.</p>

<p>NetEase and Grasshopper Manufacture haven't exactly gone above and beyond to show&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>how much they love it. This is very much a barebones remaster; it's a resolution increase, a few extra costumes, and a slightly half-hearted New Game Plus mode, and that's it.</p>

<p>You won't find a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed"><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em></a>-esque visual overhaul here, nor will you see the kind of attention to detail that Aspyr has shown its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>

<p>In essence,&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is a "hella" lot like playing the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, and the visual upgrade isn't particularly great at hiding some of the original's ugly Xbox 360-style sharp edges, curves, and low-quality texture work.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not a graphics fiend; I honestly don't care how good something looks as long as it plays well, and so I'm willing to give&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>a pass on this front.</p>

<p>Just be aware that if you passed on the original when it launched back in 2011 and you're hoping that this remaster will somehow transform the core experience for you, that's very much not the goal here.</p>

<p>That also means that some of the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s more questionable moments make it in unchanged, too. If the original put you off with its casual objectification and borderline xenophobic stereotypes, you might want to apply elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is effectively still a seventh-gen game means it works great on Steam Deck (at least in my testing, anyway), so it's not all awkward moments and leftover jank.</p>

<h2>All of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s Jank Is Still in <i>Hella Remastered</i></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sidescroller.jpg?itok=6Ni9FWYH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sidescroller.jpg?itok=M9RotXkv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is flat-out weird, and not in the ways it wants to be.</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, that's right: for all its superstar names,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>often felt like a fairly uneven and janky game, and&nbsp;hey,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>still feels like a fairly uneven and janky game.</p>

<p>On the whole, the difficulty here is pretty low. I died once or twice during some of the hairier moments, but I managed to breeze through most of the game on normal difficulty without trouble. You might say that's my fault for not bumping it up to hard, but normal does not provide a particularly balanced challenge.</p>

<p><em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s inconsistent enemy design makes up for some of that lack of challenge, although not quite in the way that I would like.</p>

<p>Some enemies (I'm looking at you, psycho-Paula) can kill Garcia in a single hit, and others feel infuriatingly annoying to pin down and deal damage to, making some engagements frustratingly drawn out with the promise of disproportionate punishment for failure.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>felt unfinished in places (the side-scrolling shooter stages and abrupt ending spring to mind) and that hasn't changed in this remaster.</p>

<p>Happily, there were times when the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s jank worked in its favor, and that's the case here, too. Although&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>feels a touch creaky, that's often the price you pay for the level of variation you'll find here.</p>

<p>This is also still a charmingly, gleefully stupid experience. Any game in which the main character can fire a giant-barreled gun from between his legs while screaming "taste my big boner" legally cannot be bad. It's in the Constitution, I think.</p>

<h2><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sewer.jpg?itok=SYqIaAPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sewer.jpg?itok=zW2Vqm9F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It isn't really more than the sum of its parts, but&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is a good time anyway.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is a fascinating relic of the seventh console generation. Despite Suda51's presence as a writer and Akira Yamaoka's score, this feels like a Shinji Mikami production through and through (although he didn't serve as a director on the project).</p>

<p>If you can imagine a jankier, grungier&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>- perhaps one birthed from the B-movie-loving brain of Robert Rodriguez - then you're not a million miles away from what&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>can offer you.</p>

<p>You won't find a dramatic overhaul here, but&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>offers just enough nostalgic thrills to overcome its almost lovably abundant jank.</p>

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">"beautifully designed yet imprecise platforming adventure"</a> Tales Of Kenzera: Zau are working on an Afrofuturist gothic-horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with isometric visuals and a body-sharing dual character premise. Currently known as Project Uso - the Swahili word for 'face', 'appearance' or 'surface' - it'll take place in the same world as Kenzera, and will take inspiration from Surgent Studio founder Abubakar Salim's experiences of parenthood. Providing, that is, the developers can find enough money to make it.</p><!--more-->
<p>"As soon as my daughter was born I knew what I wanted to cook," Salim (who is otherwise known as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed: Origins) told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer</a>'s Ed Nightingale yesterday. "This idea stems from this question of 'who am I?' Zau was a question of 'who am I without a parent?' This is essentially looking at 'who am I now as a parent?' I really wanted to make this very dark and visceral, a cross between an RPG and a beat 'em up power fantasy." </p>
<p>In Project Uso, you play a kind of android vampire called the Solost, who exists to hold the souls of the deceased, but who is also the vessel for Eshu, a trickster god from Banshu mythology. You'll get access to the powers of both the android and its divine passenger, but they'll sometimes disagree. When this happens, you'll have to carry out a Crucible Check - a dice roll battle, seemingly - to decide who gets control of the Solost's body. According to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>'s report, the overall experience is redolent of Disco Elysium, the Batman Arkham games and Resident Evil.</p>
<p>I've never played Tales Of Kenzera, but the shift away from platforming and into the more writing-led RPG genre makes sense, based on Alice B's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">review</a>. "Tales Of Kenzera shows great precision in its character and world design, in the writing, in the voice acting, even down to individual animations," she wrote. "But it lacks precision in some areas of the combat, in particular the platforming, which arguably is the bit that matters more in a platformer." Still, Alice B went on, "I'd like to see what other tales can be told in Kenzera".</p>
<p>It sounds like Salim has plenty more to tell. "Where else can we pluck from and play that could be really exciting within this space?" he comments in the Eurogamer story. "I designed it that way as a whole." </p>
<p>If there's room for the setting to grow, however, there isn't necessarily the means. Surgent are pretty hard up at the minute. Kenzera doesn't appear to have sold well, prompting Surgent to make layoffs in July. With Project Uso still early on in development, the company's games division is "on hiatus" while they try to rustle up some funding. It's an especially bitter predicament given the racism Surgent Studios had to face down from some quarters over Kenzera's protagonist and setting.</p><p>I hope Surgent can pull things together. Characters who share bodies are always entertaining, and I'd love to play more RPGs inspired by Afrofuturism. I'm a bit less convinced by Salim making a game about fatherhood, simply because this is an emotive gambit I associate with triple-A dudes who no longer wish to be associated with their previous gory action games, but that's mostly just me being cynical.

<p>Among all the other guns in the SMG category, the Tanto .22 stands out with a slow rate of fire but hard-hitting capabilities in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>. To get the best out of the gun, you must use the ideal attachments, perks, and equipment to support your gameplay.</p>



<ul>

</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-tanto-22-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Tanto .22 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Under Barrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The mentioned attachments will give you the best mobility while using the Tanto .22 in multiplayer lobbies. The <strong>Compensator</strong> will reduce the vertical recoil to improve accuracy while the <strong>Short Barrel</strong> will enhance in-air handling by improving Jumping Aim Down Sight and Jumping Sprint to Fire speeds.</p>



<p><strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will greatly improve Horizontal Recoil Control and slightly improve Sprinting Movement Speed. Use the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> to dominate in close-range combat as it significantly boosts Dive To Fire, Slide to Fire, and Sprint to Fire Speeds, making it a perfect attachment to use Omnimovement in the best way possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, use the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it will improve Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-tanto-22">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Tanto .22</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Enforcer</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Use <strong>Dexterity</strong> to reduce weapon motion while jumping, sliding, and diving while taking less fall damage. The <strong>Assassin</strong> perk will mark enemies with kill streaks on the minimap.</p>



<p><strong>Double Time</strong> significantly increases the Tactical Sprint, which is essential when multiple enemies are nearby. These three perks will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> specialty which grants a temporary buff to your movement speed and health regeneration rate upon killing enemies.</p>



<p>Coming to the Wildcard, during the initial levels you can use Tactical Expert (it gives you two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/#h-all-equipment-in-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tactical equi</a>pment) but once you level up, get the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> to equip an extra Perk.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shots</strong> are a must when you’re running the Tanto .22 for quick damage and heal-up. I’d say the Field Upgrade is a personal choice. For me, I find the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> useful as it grants me free kills from time to time.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-tanto-22">Best Secondary for Tanto .22</h2>



<p>The <strong>Stryder .22</strong> is one of the best secondary weapons for the submachine gun. Want to finish off enemies when they are at one HP, use the Stryder to get the job done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Reach <strong>player level 16</strong> to unlock the Tanto .22 SMG in Black Ops 6. This is easy to achieve – all you need to do is play the game. You can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level up fast</a> by playing some multiplayer matches and fulfilling all the objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tanto-22-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Tanto .22 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, despite being an SMG with a slow rate of fire, it’s an excellent choice for close and medium-range combat. You don’t have empty half of its magazine on a single enemy and is easy to control as well.</p>



<p>With the attachments mentioned above, you can achieve great mobility with the Tanto .22, making it hard for the enemies to knock you down.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the slow fire rate bothers you, go with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> SMG. It dominated lobbies during the beta and is equally impressive after the full release of the game.</p>



<p>And if you want to ditch the SMG route and choose hard-hitting Assault Rifles instead, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XMR</a> are two of the best guns to use.</p>

<h2>‘Ello, what’s all this, then?</h2>
<p><em>Fallout: London</em> takes place 160 years after the global nuclear war, 40 years before&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>, and in a part of the world that is both remote and didn't really have official Fallout lore. That means a lot of the typical&nbsp;Fallout fare—Deathclaws, Super Mutants, the Pip-Boy 3000—is left out.</p>
<p>Or, rather, replaced with scores of new enemies, lore, companions, factions, and even some mechanics picked up from the modding scene (ladders!). It's a kick to see the across-the-pond variants of wasteland stuff: tinned beans, medieval weapons, the Atta-Boy personal computer. There is at least one dog, a bulldog, and his name is Churchill.</p>
<p>As for the story, stop me if you've heard this one before: You, newly awakened from an underground chamber (not a Vault, though), enter a ruined London, one riven by factions with deep disagreements about how to move things forward. You'll take up quests, pick sides, befriend or blast people, and do a lot of peeking into abandoned buildings, hoping to find that last screw you need for a shotgun modification.</p>



<h2>London falling</h2>
<p>When you first start&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, you'll see a London that looks like, honestly, crap. Whatever London did to anger the nuke-having powers of the world, it got them good and mad, and parts of the city are very busted. The city's disposition to underground spaces has done it well, though, and you can often find yesteryear's glory in a Tube tunnel, a bunker, or a basement.</p>
<p>As you move on, you'll get the surge of seeing a part of London you remember, either from a visit or from media, and how it looks with a bit of char to it. The post-war inhabitants have also made their own spaces inside the ruins, some more sophisticated and welcoming than others. Everywhere you look, you can see that familiar&nbsp;Fallout aesthetic—1950s atomic-minded culture persisting until its downfall—shifted into Greenwich Mean Time.</p>

		<p>Nightdive Studios has shared a gameplay trailer for their latest retro remaster, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-thing">The Thing: Remastered</a>. The remaster of the 2002 psychological action horror is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thing: Remastered Gameplay Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXaWScbsF6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the more modern games that Nightdive is remastering, the team is able to bring some of the biggest visual upgrades to The Thing yet. There will be improved models, textures and environments, but there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>
<p>The team has also worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. It will be interesting to see if any of that has been adapted as well.</p>
<p>While fear and suspicion are core to the experience, there’s also a lot of action, fighting against horrific monstrosities that The Thing has morphed into.</p>

<p>2002’s The Thing is as close as we’ll (hopefully) get to a sequel to the best film ever made – not an opinion, just a fact. Speaking of facts, John Carpenter endorsed this game as a continuation of his movie, with various story beats that remain dangling at the end. Sadly, Computer Artworks never got the opportunity for a sequel to their game, despite the largely positive reception. It’s great to see their legacy continue with this remaster.</p>

		<p>The tradition of horror gaming through October has been something that’s largely passed me by, but I’ve indulged a little this year. My gaming this past week has featured non-horror stalwarts like Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (unless you consider retro mid-90s FPS graphics to be horror), but I’ve also continued on with my playthrough of Until Dawn, rather appreciating its episodic structure for concise play sessions. There’s also been a little bit of Phasmo in my life, as I try to make head or tail of how the ghost hunting game works.</p>

<p>Joining me for some ghost hunting shenanigans (and similarly perplexed by how uncooperative each spectre is to be figured out) were <strong>Nic B</strong> and <strong>Gamoc</strong>. Nic complemented that with some more Metaphor ReFantazio (as a palate cleanser from Unknown 9 last week), while Gamoc wrapped up our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a>, had a great time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/vendetta-forever-review/">Vendetta Forever</a>, and a little bit of Baldur’s Gate 3 and some real world D&amp;D, where he was “basically a werewolf”.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Final Fantasy XVI and will be grabbing the DLC soon before he heads off to do the final boss fight – as a nice bonus, that will be a bit cheaper because he discovered some PlayStation Stars points.</p>
<p>Ade’s been playing the “delightfully ridiculous and bombastic” EDF 6, alongside some Metroid Dread. He’s pretty close to the end of Dread, which is just a little bit shy of Metroid Fusion’s greatness – a stone cold classic, is Fusion.</p>


<p>Heading off to the frontiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/new-world-aeternum-mmo-relaunch-makes-strong-first-impression/">New World: Aeternum</a>, <strong>Jim</strong> has enjoyed his time with Amazon’s revamped MMO, now that it’s on console – “I’ve had the itch to play an MMORPG for some time now though the options haven’t been all that inviting. I’ve heard good things about the latest expansions for World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and Final Fantasy XIV but I wanted to try something a little different and more accessible. New World fit the bill perfectly, and was all the more appealing thanks to its one-time purchase instead of adopting a monthly recurring subscription.”</p>
<p>He’s also got emulators up and running on his Steam Deck for the PS2 nostalgia of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, while the weekend ahead will feature plenty of Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who’s play the surprise retro horror of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/tormenture-review-retro-scares/">Tormenture</a>, the surprisingly enjoyable The Smurfs – Dreams, and Nikoderiko. He also had the chance to play through the Shadows of the Damned Hella Remastered. Keep an eye out for reviews soon!.</p>

Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s so special about it, and why does it cost an eye-watering $90? It comes with a 20th Anniversary themed harness encrusted with gems representing World of Warcraft’s expansions. But beyond that, it features actually useful systems not normally found on mounts: it lets you check the in-game auction house and the mail while riding it out and about the world of Azeroth via characters Morten and Killia riding alongside the beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fueling the mount’s popularity is Blizzard’s decision to make it only temporarily available for purchase. It plans to pull it from the World of Warcraft store on January 6, 2025, so players know they only have a few months before it’s (potentially) gone forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put the cost of this mount into context, it’s the same price as the deluxe edition of World of Warcraft’s latest expansion, The War Within, or about half a year’s subscription to the long-running MMO.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/screenshot-2024-10-25-114038-1729852849941.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The mount lets you check the auction house and the mail on the go. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some players are saying the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur is a bargain at $90, and that’s because paying real-world money directly for it compares favorably to the price you’d have to pay if you were to buy it with WoW Tokens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Here’s how it works: players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20, and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will then buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then use that token to get game time or $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction), which can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including $90 mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This method relies on players selling WoW Tokens in the game’s auction house, and right now they’re scarce because so many players are buying them in order to buy this mount. Because of that, WoW Tokens are selling out fast, and so the price is going up (economics!), driving the effective cost of this mount in WoW Tokens bought with in-game gold to over $600.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The auction house's WoW Token right now is out of WoW Token supplies since you need suppliers to supply the demand, and currently skyrocketing given the 3% price cap per 20 minutes," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gbd2ap/comment/ltkslpe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor arasitar explained</a>. "WoW Token was 200k on NA. Probably going to go to 400k in a short bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all tell us? Not much that we didn’t know about the World of Warcraft community, anyway. Mounts have, over the years, proved incredibly popular no matter how much money they cost to buy. Indeed, a near-identical mount was released in 2018 alongside the Battle for Azeroth expansion that sold like hot cakes, too. World of Warcraft players love their mounts!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Blizzard, it’s laughing all the way to the bank. Or, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gbd2ap/comment/ltlo56c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as redditor Chuckieshere put it</a>: “This mount probably just made more money than StarCraft 2 for 1/1000th of the effort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It’s in this distinctive direction that the returning Adler and Woods team up with a new team of skilled operators, this time in 1991, to combat an emerging new threat called The Pantheon, amid rumors of the creation of a potentially history-changing bioweapon. Sure, 2020's Cold War had its fair share of espionage action, but the majority of Black Ops 6's missions don't take place on the flashes and bangs of the frontline, but in the shadows that lie deep behind it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two missions in particular showcase this brilliantly: the infiltration of a political gala in Most Wanted, and the casino heist of High Rollers. The former presents three different options for how you want to go about completing your objective - I had a great time tinkering with a silent auction, but other paths are available that will test your spy skills  - and while your choice has no lasting impact on the story, it does add an element of replayability to otherwise linear levels. The heist, by contrast, has you swapping between multiple members of your blacklisted team, spread across lavish slot machine-filled surroundings and the dank underground waterways beneath. You don't get to swap freely, but the slick character baton-passes add another dash of cinematic flair.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's an enjoyable amount of flexibility to how you can approach missions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an enjoyable amount of flexibility to how you can approach other missions as well. Stealth is often encouraged, but going loud is almost always an option (with insta-fail stealth thankfully only rearing its ugly head on one or two occasions). Keeping to the shadows or hidden underwater made me feel like a silent assassin, but when I let that slip I had to swiftly switch to a more combative style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunplay, crucially, delivers in both areas, with suppressed headshots satisfyingly pinging brains out of heads in one trigger pull and rattling SMGs and punchy shotguns feeling great when manically dashing in and out of cover thanks to the exciting new “omnimovement” system. This completely revamped movement mechanic allows you to sprint in any direction, as well as leap into the air sideways while firing to pull off your best gun-fu-esque stunts.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Simon Cardy Ranks Every COD Campaign He's Played</h3><p>A ranking of all of the Call of Duty campaigns that I've played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a great sense of improvisation as well. Weapons need to be constantly discarded and replaced with whatever gun is within grasp due to ammo sometimes being kept cleverly sparse. That also applies to the more DIY methods of dispatching enemies that are available, such as grabbing knives from chopping boards to then send them flying into skulls. Again, it evokes that espionage action movie feel, letting me briefly cosplay as John David Washington brutalising his way through a restaurant kitchen in Tenet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The variety of its levels and top-tier presentation makes sure that it's never once dull, but this is a feat of stamina as well: By the historical standards of Call of Duty campaigns Black Ops 6 is one of the longest, clocking in at just around eight hours for me (roughly twice the length of Modern Warfare 3’s dud of a mission chain). It’s no Baldur’s Gate 3, certainly, but that’s a respectable runtime for a shooter campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>By the historical standards of Call of Duty campaigns Black Ops 6 is one of the longest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish, though, that Call of Duty had more tricks up its sleeve by now when it comes to adding difficulty and differences to enemy encounters. Even now, after so many games, it’s still resorting to simply chucking a juggernaut or two your way to unload full magazines into when it wants to ramp up the stakes, but this time these challenges are occasionally solved via more interesting means thanks to a range of spy gadgets handed out at regular intervals. A throwing knife that can home in on targets adds a welcome dose of Batman energy to proceedings, and the trusty explosive remote control RC-XD cars make a fun return. Naturally, if all goes wrong, you can always rely on the more rustic C4 option to blow up anything you need it to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When downtime is had between outings, the writing hits a fun sweet spot between cliché and self-awareness and is supported by a cast that fully buys into their roles. Bruce Thomas in particular is in great form as the brazenly enigmatic Russell Adler, and Y’lan Noel and Karen David make a great first impression as Marshall and Sevati, respectively. The latter has a lot of fun in her chameleon-like role as a master-of-disguise assassin, with new personas taken on from mission to mission.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll spend more time with them when you return to the safe house, where you can learn more about your teammates' backstories, solve puzzles, and purchase valuable upgrades using cash found on missions. These perks range from standard stuff like explosive damage negation to ones that are more traditionally found in multiplayer modes, such as Last Stand, which gives you a temporary health and speed boost when close to death. It's a further example of the increased flexibility in game design and the way that developer Raven Software is encouraging you to adopt your own playstyle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your sizeable Bulgarian manor is also home to dormant KGB secrets, which I had a great time uncovering. While none of the puzzles are too brain-testing – usually amounting to just memorising a series of numbers or using trial and error to unlock terminals – they successfully add even further variety to an otherwise (expectedly) gun-heavy time. It's surprisingly involved, and a fantastic improvement on an idea that began as a small abandoned garage in 2020’s Cold War, serving as a great place to plan for heists, undercover operations, and the completely unexpected. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which… I won't say too much here so as not to spoil it, but perhaps the best mission of the whole campaign riffs off of previous Black Ops hallucinogenic episodes to create something that touches on the likes of BioShock, Prey, and Control in both its aesthetic and level design. It's hard to know which of Black Ops 6's many great missions will ultimately be remembered most fondly, but I have a feeling it might just be the weirdest that cements its place as an all-timer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That isn't to say you're kept completely out of more traditional combat zones. The first Gulf War serves as the backdrop for Black Ops 6's story, and you do spend a couple of missions in the ‘90s Middle East. This allows for the mission design to return to its modern military roots, but does so by innovating on the Call of Duty formula, which is best exemplified in a mid-game mission that is as ambitious in its scale as any I've ever seen from this series of campaigns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place over a vast desert map, you're given the task of destroying three SCUD missile sites in any order and by any means of your choosing. Feel like driving straight through the front door in a jeep? Go for it. It may be much more advisable to pick off a few targets from afar and think about things more methodically, though. Points of interest are also dotted around the map, and those can reveal themselves to be anything from special equipment supply drops to SAS scouts who show you enemy locations. These areas are worth exploring, too, as certain side objectives are built into the larger main mission design, such as when I blew up three different enemy SAM encampments to free up the airspace and allow me to take control of a helicopter's buzzsaw of a machine gun later on. This choice and consequence system is further explored in an equally exciting later mission, too, and is one of Black Ops 6’s true masterstrokes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A mid-game mission is as ambitious in its scale as any I've ever seen from this series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fantastic use of everything Call of Duty does at its best, and a ludicrously better example of how it can borrow from its Warzone and multiplayer modes to build something truly exciting in an open space that blows last year’s feeble attempt out of the water. It frankly puts Modern Warfare 3's "open" mission design to shame, and shows the worth of granting a development team more than a handful of months to cobble together a campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although enthralling to play, the fact that these missions take place during Operation Desert Storm doesn't serve the story in anywhere near as fulfilling a way, making the controversial conflict come across more like window dressing. They don't delve into, or address in a meaningful manner, any of the human issues at play that surrounded the conflict in 1991 Kuwait, Iraq, and the larger Gulf area. Black Ops 6 tries to have its cake and eat it too; you can't “keep politics out of video games” when the game in question painstakingly recreates several real-life world leaders and the wars their governments partook in to set the stage for its ensuing fireworks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, this is a story that’s far more concerned with being a popcorn spy thriller than it is with examining or even reacting to its own subject matter, which in and of itself isn't a fundamental issue – but after Modern Warfare’s weak argument against chemical weapons in 2019 and Modern Warfare 3's refusal to use terrorism for anything more than cheap thrills just last year, Black Ops 6 follows an unfortunate trend of recent CoD campaigns declining to offer an emotionally nuanced reading of the settings they take on. It's no doubt entertaining, and I’m not exactly looking for (nor expecting) a deep, forensic examination of the cultural cost of global conflicts here, but it still feels like the latest instalment in a series of missed opportunities. There is room to both entertain and say something real, as so many of the war and spy movies CoD emulates already do, and 2012's Spec Ops: The Line is often praised for (even though its conflict is fictionalised).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What <em>is </em>delivered is a constantly engaging spy thriller story as the exiled Woods, Adler, and a string of new faces go off the record to decipher the links between the CIA, Saddam Hussein, and The Pantheon. What begins as a fairly standard cloak-and-dagger plot really comes alive in the back half, managing to weave in personal stakes and treats for long-time Black Ops fans. The nature of its closing chapter crept up and honestly surprised me, somehow managing to balance a bombastic crescendo with genuine emotive strain. It’s as good as a Call of Duty plot has been in a long, long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A shout-out must also go to the quality animation on display, a technical area that can sometimes be taken for granted when it comes to Call of Duty. Whether it's intricate gun reloads and the mechanical finesse of your weapons when fired during gameplay, or the sheer fidelity of the cutscenes, it truly is best-in-class work. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

GAME customers are once again facing a familiar wait to play the latest big gaming launch - this time, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> - as the beleagured high street chain has failed, once again, to send out pre-order copies in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
Customers say the retailer has taken payment but failed to provide their Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copy on launch day - and with little to no communication on when it will actually arrive. 
</p>
<p>
A note on GAME's support site has acknowledged this latest snafu, and said that affected orders are currently "processing". Eurogamer has contacted GAME parent company Frasers Group for more.
</p>
<p>
"We are aware some customers may have not received their delivery of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 yet," Game's Help <a href="https://help.game.co.uk/support/home?_gl=1*zk2a5c*_gcl_au*NTgwMzQ4MjAzLjE3MjgwNDIyNTY.">website</a> states. "We are currently processing these orders and will keep you updated with further information. We apologise for the delay."
</p>
<p>
GAME previously pushed customers to pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with the promise of a Steelbook case and the ability to "pick up and play 10.25.24" - today's date.
</p>
<p>
But affected GAME customers have told Eurogamer that there's no sign of their copy, or the Steelbook, and that customer service representatives have said copies won't be delivered until at least next week.
</p>

<p>
In an email sent by GAME customer support, seen by Eurogamer, a  service advisor acknowledges that the customer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 order "is part of a group of products that are experiencing delays as part of our website updates". 
</p><p>
This refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">ongoing issue Eurogamer reported on previously that results from GAME's systems being merged into those of Frasers Group</a>. This has also blocked GAME customers from seeing older orders - or easily modifying or cancelling them - on GAME's website. 
</p>
<p>It's all left GAME customers once again in limbo - unhappy at having to wait, and unwilling to simply pick up a copy elsewhere due to the difficulties of getting a refund and the loss of GAME's Steelbook.</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">GAME customers faced an anxious wait for copies of Silent Hill 2</a> to arrive - and when they did, they initially did so without the chain's offer of a Steelbook case included. Eurogamer reported previously on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME customers waiting weeks, in and in some cases months</a>, for missing pre-orders to arrive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-pc-users-can-now-get-a-stunning-texture-improvement-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio, the new JRPG made by the Persona team, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-becomes-million-seller-on-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already a million seller</a> and has received widespread critical acclaim, too. On Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 9 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>No matter how much I engaged with the core fundamentals of Metaphor: ReFantazio, I couldn’t escape the feeling that this was largely Persona 6 by another name rather than some new IP that could stand on its own merits. That isn’t to say that Hashino’s team hasn’t created another stylish JRPG with broad appeal, but the premise that Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy is dead. If the Persona series left you wanting more, Metaphor: ReFantazio certainly is a tale worth experiencing for yourself. Those who harbor an innate distaste for the social systems and time limits of modern Persona titles will find no solace here, but those who are willing to embrace what very well could be the sixth Persona title in all but name alone will experience one of the most stylish Japanese roleplaying games of 2024.</em></p>
<p>However, Atlus games have never exactly stood out for their visuals, and this one is no exception. If you're playing it on a 4K display, chances are you will have noticed some really low resolution textures. Luckily, a PC modder has already uploaded a texture improvement mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metaphorrefantazio/mods/25?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>. As you can see in these comparisons, the difference is absolutely massive. According to the modder, some of the original textures were only 128x128 or 256x256.</p>

<figure></figure>


<figure></figure>


<figure></figure>


<figure></figure>

<p>The mod overhauls Metaphor: ReFantazio textures across all zones, NPCs, monsters, and DLC outfits. However, it is also quite big at 4.4 GB. Not all textures are 4K resolution; as the modder explained, it would have been too costly from a performance point of view. Still, they're all HD textures and higher, which is a big improvement in visual clarity over the original game.</p>

            <p>Real ones know that the only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/x-com">XCOM</a> spin off worth its salt is Hasbro’s 1999 play-by-mail banger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-COM_(email_games)">First Alien Invasion</a>, although that didn’t stop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-shock-2">System Shock 2</a> studio Irrational from getting to work on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> series’ universe after being acquired by 2K in 2006. If your sentiments are anything like I remember a lot of the internet feeling at the time, you may get nightmarish flashbacks to the trailer below, first shown at E3 2010. The project was eventually canceled and adapted into 2013’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bureau-xcom-declassified">The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</a>, but Irrational co-founder and current <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wild-bastards">Wild Bastards</a> studio Blue Manchu founder Jon Chey has shed some light on the FPS’s development, and it sounds like it was once a far more ambitious project.

What if you were one of the operatives, as opposed to just clicking on a map with them?" It’s a thought that might seem risible to purists, but looking back on that old trailer with the appreciation I have for Irrational now, I can’t help but see much of the backlash as a reaction not to the game itself, but to the fact that XCOM hadn’t had a strategy entry since, well, Microprose's 1999 play-by-email banger First Alien Invasion.</p>
<p>After releasing two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/freedom-force-pc-retrospective">Freedom Force</a> games, designer Ed Orman says that they’d "realised, with the advent of first-person, that turn-based was a bit of a niche. You're not going to hit the big numbers. And we were working on BioShock, which is a first-person shooter. So if we're doing that, why don't we have a crack at a first-person version of XCOM?"</p>
<p>An initial concept was to translate the idea of managing a squad into an FPS, says Chey.</p>
<blockquote><p>"First-person shooters have really struggled with the notion of managing a group of people. You have your AI companions who run around in front of you and get shot, or they run off and do something else, or they kite the enemy into attacking you when you don't want them to. It's very, very hard to make them behave sensibly and give you a feeling that you're managing them and not get overwhelmed."</p></blockquote>
<p>Another idea was the aforementioned Kaiju, he continues, though this was eventually abandoned because "we felt it was getting too far away from what XCOM was supposed to be about”.</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole game would be about the scale disparity, that you were little human soldiers. The aliens have brought these huge creatures as part of their invasion force, and your job is to take them out. And you have to do that by actually, Shadow of the Colossus style, getting onto them and running around, planting a bomb at the base of their spine to blow their head off.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the response to the creature designs shown in that E3 trailer, Chey says "People who loved XCOM wanted to see the same creatures from the tactical game in first-person, and duke it out with a Muton and a Sectoid. They may not be the most original monster designs ever, but they're part of what people love."</p><p>Chey eventually left Irrational in 2009, and the project became The Bureau. Do read the full PC Gamer piece for more. "The Bureau, swiftly stripped of its thematic threads and charm, begins with a dismal and disheartening room by room tour of dull third person shooting, sectoid bullet sponges and explosive barrels," was wot Adam Smith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-bureau-xcom-declassified">thunk at the time</a>. "As squads are introduced and tactical options expand, the game finds its feet, but they are encased in heavy workboots rather than natty dress shoes. Even at its best, The Bureau stumbles from mission to mission rather than striding". Hey, at <a href="https://youtu.be/nF_Ca45JRFs">least some people had fun</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Indeed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-pulls-1-game-pass-trial-ahead-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-as-it-did-for-starfield">Microsoft removed its $1 introductory Game Pass trial just weeks before Black Ops 6’s launch</a>, as it did with last year’s Starfield — further evidence, after recent price hikes and tier changes, that the pressure is now on for Game Pass to make the absolute most of the power of Call of Duty.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Will it pay off for Microsoft? In interviews with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, analysts predicted Black Ops 6 could boost Game Pass subscriber numbers by between 2.5 million and 4 million. However, analysts also predicted a significant impact on sales of Black Ops 6. Call of Duty is usually the best-selling game of the year, but there is now a big question mark over whether it will achieve that record once again with Black Ops 6 given it’s available as part of Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wedbush boss Michael Pachter told GI that putting Black Ops 6 into Game Pass could result in up to six million lost sales, based on the idea that 25% of Game Pass subscribers might have bought the game anyway. Countering this, Pachter said Game Pass could swell by between three to four million subscribers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a perhaps expected shift, but is it overall better for Microsoft and Activision? The theory is that getting more players through the door than ever before, even at the cost of sales of the game, will eventually pay out because of Call of Duty’s lucrative live service, which is fueled by premium battle passes and costly cosmetic packs. Microsoft may be playing the long game here, even though it risks negative headlines about Call of Duty sales being down compared to previous years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, now Microsoft has taken the plunge with Call of Duty little is off the table when it comes to Game Pass. The expectation now is that each year’s premium Call of Duty game will launch day one on Game Pass, and fans are still waiting for the back catalog to be added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Black Ops 6 ahead of launch, including its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-adds-strange-arachnophobia-mode-that-turns-zombie-spiders-into-floating-torsos">strange arachnophobia mode</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-built-in-support-for-better-audio-tech-that-costs-20-for-5-years">built-in support for better audio tech that costs $20</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match">Activision’s new ambitious plans to beat cheaters</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ends-the-3-year-scourge-of-the-riot-shield">confirmation it doesn't include the dreaded Riot Shield</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft boss Satya Nadella will earn a wallet-busting $79.1m (£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023.
</p>
<p>
The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft last night, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees.
</p>
<p>
2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September. 
</p>
<p>
Regardless, Microsoft's shares are up and the company's market value is now higher than $3tn, as it works to capitalise on the rise of AI. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft moved to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">shut down three Bethesda gaming studios</a> in June - Arkane Austin, the now-external Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-concerned-over-layoffs-due-to-lack-of-industry-growth">Xbox boss Phil Spencer discussed a lack of overall growth in the console market</a>. 
</p>
<p>Writing in Microsoft's 2024 Annual Report, released last night, Nadella painted a rosier picture, however.</p>
<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices," Nadella wrote. "With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we've added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenue—from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. 
</p><p>"And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want. Finally, we brought four of our fan-favorite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>That cross-platform publishing programme will continue over the next few months with the arrival of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> for PC and Xbox in December, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">PlayStation in February 2025</a>, with the expectation that other games will then follow. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Another few months, another drastic shake up has come for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> with the Vessel of Hatred expansion. It’s time to go and hunt for Nyrelle after her flight at the end of the main story, doing so with a new Spiritborn class, a complete reworking of the levelling system, and some new endgame activities, including a raid. Yes, it’s even more like an MMORPG now – there’s even a party finder.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Vessel of Hatred | Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpOW5alWgYU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new story could have been the best part. You go hunting for Neyrelle in a whole new region, called Nahantu, which is a sort of dingy jungle – just picture a dark jungle and fill it with blood and monsters, and that’s what it looks like. Nahantu is also home to Kurast and Travincal, locations you may remember from all the way back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/01/diablo-2-resurrected-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc/">Diablo II</a>, and you’ll be able to revisit them here decades after the events of that game.</p>


<p>As for how this quest goes, suffice to say that if you’ve played any Diablo game, you already know what’s going to happen. Diablo IV in particular has shown its hand already, and that handnhas only one card: nihilism. It’s very on brand for the series, but it was delivered more effectively in previous games where there weren’t a huge amount of side quests that end in everyone dying just to hammer home, again and again, that actually this is a big dark apocalypse. I love dark fantasy, but there’s so much content here that ends the same that it’s just become repetitive.</p>
<p>So the story is fine, there’s one particular moment that felt like a moment of brightness and really stood out to me and looked particularly good, but other than the specifics, the story itself is pretty predictable.</p>


<p>Also predictable is the raid. I spent a good while getting levelled up so I could try this raid and frankly 20 minutes into it I wished I hadn’t bothered. The Dark Citadel, as it’s called, is described as a “co-op endgame dungeon” that “requires teamwork” to complete. What this translates to is that it artificially splits up the party and has them do things separately in the loosest definition of teamwork I’ve ever encountered. For example, the Trial of Reflection is just the party split up, doing the same thing in different locations. The only reason you can’t do these alone is because the game forces them onto different paths and because the health bars of the enemies are so large.</p>
<p>On top of that, much of it involves running through environments before a timer runs out, hoping you run into the shrine that resets that timer before you just die. The bosses in this mode keep teleporting you to different arenas, one of which also has this timer that will just kill you. This isn’t teamwork, it’s busy work split in two to give the impression of working together.</p>
<p>It also didn’t help that, while the mode supports up to four players, the only parties I got into were with just one other person. Without difficulty scaling, we’d eventually hit a boss we couldn’t manage and give up. Three times with three different people. This is a lot of words to say that it’s frustrating, shallow, and most importantly, often has you running past groups of monsters instead of fighting them. That’s pretty much the opposite of what I want.</p>

<p>Thankfully the rest of the endgame content is more enjoyable. The Pit returns with its many tiers of increasingly difficult and rewarding challenges – in fact you need to complete The Pit tier 20 to unlock The Dark Citadel. Then there’s The Kurast Undercity, a timed dungeon similar to the Rifts from Diablo 3. You enter the rift and fight your way through legions of enemies, through multiple floors, until you find the boss. If you don’t get there quickly enough you’ll run out of time, ending your run, but killing elites earns you more time. The more monsters you kill, the higher your attunement will get, bringing better rewards once you finish the run. This is a mad dash that requires a build that can melt through enemies reasonably quickly or you just won’t finish. It’s pretty fun.</p>
<p>Now we come to the Spiritborn – the new class that’s introduced in this expansion. The Spiritborn is a kind of tribal warrior that invokes the spirits of a Centipede, Eagles, Gorilla, and a Jaguar in battle, channeling those spirits to, for example, attack with jaguar claws, or slam the ground like a gorilla to damage surrounding enemies. To me, this plays and feels remarkably similar to the Druid who actually transforms into animals for attacks, just without the trandformation. The game’s other classes, Rogue, Necromancer, Barbarian, Druid, Sorcerer are all pretty distinct in how they play, but the Spiritborn isn’t quite as distinctive as the others. It’s just another tribal fighter with animals.</p>
<p>That’s not to say it’s not fun though – in fact, at the moment I am able to use my Ultimate attack up to five times in short succession, which is immensely satisfying. On the other hand, the class isn’t balanced very well right now – I’ve gone all the way to Level 60 to find that my core skill Rake, the cool jaguar claws, is pathetically inferior to Quill Volley, the Eagle’s core skill, even when Quill Volley doesn’t have any upgrades applied to it and Rake does. I discovered this when I found a unique that allowed me to completely abandon my basic skill, so I didn’t mind that much at that point I suppose.</p>

<p>Another huge change is the level system, which now tops out at 60 before Paragon levels come into play, which are now account-wide. This is a welcome change, except all the loot tops out there as well. That is to say, once you hit 60 you’re a couple hours at best away from having all your equipment at the maximum power level as you get to Torment 1 difficulty, meaning that there are no more obvious upgrades available. Instead, you’re doomed to sift through the four or so affixes every legendary item has on them and compare them to the one you’ve got equipped for marginal increases and cross your fingers you get that holy grail loot drop that’s exactly the affixes you want <em>and</em>&nbsp;they’ve rolled well <em>and</em> it’s an ancestral item. It’s not anywhere near as enjoyable.</p>

			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 features a broken implementation of all three major upscalers, resulting in minimal performance improvements despite rendering at lower resolutions.</p>
<p>As reported on the game's subreddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Important_Shake_1491/">Important_Shake_1491</a>, every upscaler apparently has a performance overhead of around 40% when enabled, meaning that whenever NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, or Intel XeSS are enabled, the base framerate drops around 40% before getting increased by upscaling. This issue, according to the user, was also present in later seasons of Modern Warfare III and hasn't been fixed. The user also provided some benchmark results from tests conducted on two different system configurations (12900h + 3070ti mobile, 9900k + 3080 desktop) to offer proof, showing a way too big performance drop with DLAA and FSR 3 Native enabled. Other users are reporting similar performance issues, so it definitely seems like there's something wrong that needs to be patched.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1gbnd6q/dlss_fsr_xess_completely_broken_and_actually/">DLSS, FSR, XESS completely broken and actually reduces performance on PC BO6.</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Important_Shake_1491/">u/Important_Shake_1491</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/">blackops6</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Being a competitive-focused game, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 isn't particularly demanding in terms of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pre-load-details-revealed-102-gb-ssd-needed/">system requirements</a> compared to other games released this year. However, achieving the best possible performance is extremely important, so hopefully, the developers will fix this issue as quickly as possible to allow PC users to boost performance properly with upscalers without being forced to use frame generation.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

<p>"The sad part is most of the directed hate on Palworld is bait. Some rando account that posts 24+ times a day and struggles to get 1000 views per post picks up Palworld as an easy target, gets a cosy half a mil off a low-effort 'PALWORLD IS SLOP' post and then milks it for a week," they added.</p>
<p>"If you hate Palworld, and I mean if you genuinely hate Palworld, then do yourself a favour and mute us on Twitter, hide the game on Steam, and stop thinking about it. Who wants to dedicate time and energy to things they don't like?</p>
<p>"Your hate serves only to upset yourself and feed grifters their views. Move on."</p>
<p>In response, iWill - who seemingly prompted Bucky's message with a viral post earlier this week <a href="https://x.com/iWillTheGamer/status/1849269224788602936">pointing out the similarities between Pals and Pokémon</a> - said, "I would like to state, I don't hate Palworld. Never played. Think its cool how they started the year off tbh. I personally just found this funny and never seen that 'Pal' before and made that comparison. Don't talk bad about Palworld. Please? They iight."</p>
<p>Following last month's shock announcement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Palworld maker Pocketpair</a> for the infringement of "multiple patents rights", an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ps5-release-finally-available-in-japan-despite-looming-nintendo-lawsuit">IP expert has claimed it's "exceedingly plausible"</a> Nintendo crafted its patent applications specifically to target Palworld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1991, I went to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. The Turtles were barely using their weapons now, Casey Jones was gone, and April O’Neil wasn’t Judith Hoag anymore – which was like coming back after holidays to find the classmate you had a crush on had changed schools. Put simply, it wasn’t what I’d expected, and I find myself in a similar position with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed. What I <em>expected </em>was a basic 3D beat ’em up that would be over in a few hours. What we <em>got </em>is actually a 14-hour light RPG, with a basic 3D beat ’em up tying together long sections of exposition and relationship building. Unfortunately, like with The Secret of the Ooze, moving in an unexpected direction doesn’t automatically make the end result good. Despite a clear effort on the part of developer aheartfulofgames to make Mutants Unleashed a juicy and authentic follow-up story to 2023’s Mutant Mayhem film, it quickly becomes tedious thanks to a significant lack of enemy variety and small selection of constantly reused levels. It’s not ninja crap, but the T.U.R.T.L.E. power is limited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I’m concerned, the original 1990 TMNT movie is untouchable, but I do feel Mutant Mayhem is the best TMNT movie <em>since </em>the first. Its deliberately imperfect, hand-drawn appearance is remarkable, its soundtrack is impeccable, and – as the father of a 16-year-old – it contains easily the most believably teenage Turtles ever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[The graphics] ably ape the hastily sketched, asymmetrical look of Mutant Mayhem – from its crude, 2D scribbles for smoke and light sources, to Bebop’s distractingly droopy pierced nipples. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutants Unleashed comes impressively close to recreating two of those pillars itself. While the graphics don’t reach par with the exquisite, painterly appearance of the movie, they ably ape the hastily sketched, asymmetrical look of Mutant Mayhem – from its crude, 2D scribbles for smoke and light sources, to Bebop’s distractingly droopy pierced nipples. The four main Turtles themselves are also in sync with their movie counterparts, largely thanks to the fact the voice stars of the movie have returned here. If the budget could’ve stretched to include some of the film’s licensed music, they could’ve had the trifecta. It sadly didn’t but, unfortunately, Mutants Unleashed has several more pressing problems than a lack of iconic ’90s hip hop up in here (up in here).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Can I Kick It?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While a 14-hour TMNT RPG may sound like slam dunk value on paper, Mutants Unleashed is actually stretched to a breaking point over that surprisingly lengthy duration. The main story missions quickly become dreary once you notice it’s constantly rehashing the same stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutants Unleashed tries hard to obfuscate how many levels it actually has by having us run backwards through ones we’ve previously completed, or switching up the fixed camera to a different angle, but it’s very transparent. There’s also far too much loading required as we complete sections, which just feels like a cheat to shuffle the order of environments used for each mission without blending them together. Either way, clambering across the same construction site, running through the same pipe, riding up and down the same elevator, and scurrying over the same cargo ships gets old, quick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Worse, very little exploration is possible. Yes, there are hidden objects – and pieces of street art to find for Mondo Gecko – but Mutants Unleashed generally only punishes us for trying to veer off the path. I lost track of the number of times I tried to jump to a spot that appeared fine to land on, only to plummet to the street off camera – or be met with an invisible wall. On one stage I completely trapped myself somewhere I clearly wasn’t meant to be. I’ve only ever found hidden art by accidentally going the way I thought I was supposed to go anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat itself is totally serviceable, although enemies aren’t very smart, and they’re not always great at tracking you through the environments. The Turtles all have distinct fighting styles that can be upgraded with new moves as you progress specific relationships for each. There’s little need to get into the weeds with it, though, and it’s totally a button masher. This makes it accessible, but fairly mindless. I’d try out new moves, but mostly to get the tutorial boxes to leave the screen, where they sometimes cover up your Turtles thanks to the fixed camera. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That camera didn’t really bother me for the most part; I get that it’s ultimately a bit of a halfway house between an entirely third-person brawler and the 2D beat ’em ups of yesteryear, and Mutants Unleashed creatively replaces your character with a scratched silhouette when they’re hidden by pieces of the environment. However, I did have instances where the angle was a real burden. There’s not a ton of technical platforming in Mutants Unleashed, but lining up jumps and rail grinds from a 45-degree angle is like leaving your TV and trying to keep playing Tony Hawk from the toilet with the bathroom door ajar.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most disappointingly, Mutants Unleashed seems built primarily as a single-player game. The Turtles you <em>haven’t</em> selected will simply dip out at the beginning of every level, so you never feel like you’re part of a fighting foursome – which is what TMNT is all about. Sure, it has two-player co-op, but it’s not four-player, so that still doesn’t feel right. You don’t even get AI Turtles raising shell in the background. The special assist moves make it seem like a second Turtle is going to get involved, but activating them doesn’t actually bring one of your brothers physically into the space. It’s just… implied that they dropped in and bugged out, perhaps while you were blinking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also doesn’t help that enemies are just the same handful of mutants for the entire game. Trash crabs. Zebra squids. Hippo luchadores. A couple more. But it’s over a dozen hours of these same few baddies. Yes, I understand a licensed tie-in game isn’t going to be able to introduce important opponents from the TMNT universe – like the Foot Clan or such – before the film’s inevitable sequel. Hell, I wouldn’t let it either. That’s how you get Emperor Palpatine returning to Star Wars in… Fortnite. At 6am Australian Eastern Daylight Time on a random Sunday morning. But Mutants Unleashed really needed more enemy variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a host of side missions, but unfortunately these only contribute to the repetition. Civilian missions involve beating up a bunch of the same mutants across a couple of levels you’ve almost certainly been to before. Contagion missions involve running through a level you’ve almost certainly been to before, beating up the same mutants again, although this time some of them will be highlighted as key targets. Pizza deliveries are just speed runs through the same levels once more, although the enemies have been removed, and the map is now full of giant inflatable bounce pads and boom gates for no discernible reason. And no one’s carrying a pizza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutants Unleashed features a time progression system, where each mission or conversation encounter takes either a day or a night, and then the day moves on. This puts a limit on the amount of side activities you can tackle before needing to do a main mission, but there’s more than enough time to complete everything in a single playthrough. There’s about two months of tasks, but I had weeks up my sleeve before needing to do the final couple of story missions and I was already out of side missions, so the time component doesn’t really add a great deal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Diggity</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The RPG-style conversational component of Mutants Unleashed does add a lot of unexpected exposition, although I think the story of a new wave of mutants descending on New York and finding themselves at odds with the existing human population <em>is </em>an effective and totally logical follow-up to the movie. It continues the themes that hatred and prejudice are repugnant from any side they’re projected and, while “do unto others” is admittedly a message that’s been embedded in kids’ cartoons for decades, that doesn’t make it any less authentic in this new TMNT world where mutants and humans have suddenly been thrown together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, not every conversation is particularly riveting, and not all of them are actually voiced, either. These sections are also entirely passive, so there are definitely times when they’re simply filler. Even moments that seem custom made for a minigame – like Donatello visiting an arcade to play a dancing game – ultimately aren’t interactive. An indirect dig at how rubbish Raph is in the original TMNT game is cute, but otherwise there’s a bit of a weird clash of approaches at times. I raised my eyebrow as the script worked quite hard to concoct an entire fantasy catalogue of parody John Hughes films to not mention him by name – but then, on other occasions, overtly references the likes of Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cutscenes are totally hamstrung by the glacial cadence of conversations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest problem, however, is the pacing of the dialogue. Cutscenes are totally hamstrung by the glacial cadence of conversations, which waits line-by-line for huge dialogue boxes and canned reaction animations to pop up. This creates highly-unnatural pauses between sentences and very much kills the momentum of conversations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These scenes can mostly be skipped, or slightly sped up by hammering a button, but they’re nonetheless necessary if you want to progress the Turtles’ relationships with their friends around the city and unlock new upgrades. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Exactly three months ago, Overwatch 2 Game Director Aaron Keller <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began</a> the discussion between the development team and the community on how to bring back the 6v6 mode that was initially removed in the sequel. A few hours ago, Keller <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an update and shared concrete details on when and how 6v6 tests will happen.</p>
<p>There will be two tests in Season 14. The first one will begin a week after the season's debut and will feature a variation of Open Queue. Each team of 6 must have at least one hero of each role and no more than three. According to Keller, this opens up a lot of different team compositions that players haven't seen before in Overwatch 2. Roles can be switched during a match, as long as it doesn't break the 'min 1, max 3' limit. This test also aims to give Blizzard a look at how Overwatch 2's heroes, abilities, and updates work in a 6v6 environment.</p>
<p>The second 6v6 test will take place later, during Season 14's mid-cycle, and it will feature the classic 2-2-2 matchup with some twists (such as less CC and hero rework). Both 6v6 Tests will have their own map in Unranked alongside other modes and will not replace other types of game modes such as Seasonal Events or Quick Play: Hacked. Blizzard will also introduce several balance changes that will only apply to these two test modes: for example, tank power and survivability will be reduced in these 6v6 formats, and the studio will evaluate whether they need many of the passive abilities that were added in Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Season 13, Blizzard will also experiment with two 5v5 formats. In the first one, called Limit 2, the maximum number of each role will be limited to two. This includes Tanks, but they will be tuned to Open Queue balance, so they will have less health. The second format is being dubbed Kingmaker; here, the maximum number of each role is still limited to two - however, the player alone in their role gets some kind of bonus.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his article, Keller also hints Blizzard now sees a world where 5v5 and 6v6 are both available on a permanent basis in Overwatch 2. Of course, it will depend on how these tests are received. Whether that will be enough to inject some much-needed lifeblood into the game remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, during the Indie Horror Showcase hosted by DreadXP, Nightdive Studios released a new gameplay trailer for The Thing Remastered. The new trailer provides a detailed look at the bloody and mangled events inside Outpost #31 and the crew's desperation as they attempt to escape from a gruesome, corporeal alien menace.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is a remaster of 2002's squad-based third-person shooter horror game. Originally developed by Computer Artworks, it was obviously based on John Carpenter's seminal horror movie, released in 1982. Nightdive Studios, which specializes in remasters and remakes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/quake-ii-remaster-announced-quake-ii-64-new-expansion-machingames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quake II</a>, DOOM and DOOM II, System Shock, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-turok-2-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok</a>, Blade Runner, and Star Wars: Dark Forces just to name a few), has ported the old game to its proprietary KEX engine. This enabled a series of improvements: 4K resolution and up to 120 frames per second support, not to mention enhancements to character models, textures, animations, lighting, and atmospheric effects. Nightdive has also added brand new Trophies and Achievements on all platforms.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is slated to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. For more info on the remaster, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightdive's Deep Dive podcast</a>.</p>

<p><em>You are Cpt J.F. Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate the blood-curdling events and enigmatic deaths of the American scientific team that transpired at the Outpost 31 research facility located in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica. Within these inhospitable surroundings your team encounters a strange shape-shifting alien life-form that assumes the appearance of people that it kills. Trapped by the elements and infected by this horrific entity, using all your team members is critical if you hope to accomplish your objectives, let alone survive.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In 20 frightening levels, lead your team against terrifying monsters, from the scuttling head-spiders and human-like walkers to gigantic multi-tentacled beasts.</em></li>
<li><em>Advanced trust/fear interface adds a new level of interaction – How you influence your team's psychological state determines whether or not they will co-operate with you.</em></li>
<li><em>Use awesome firepower like machine guns, explosives, and flamethrowers to torch your enemies.</em></li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-game-franchises/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-owns-20-game-franchises-that-have-exceeded-1-billion-in-revenue.1019115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-game-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft is a powerhouse of the gaming industry, and that much is certain. Most of that value has come from lucrative acquisitions that the company has made over the years, such as the snapping up of ZeniMax Media and, more recently, Activision Blizzard King. In a recent financial report, it was stressed that the tech titan now owns 20 franchises that have each exceeded <strong>$1 BILLION </strong>in revenue.</p>



<p>The ‘Annual Report 2024’ that was published by the firm recently outlines just how staggering Microsoft’s gaming portfolio has been – and continues to be. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-over-time">Over Time</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that many of the franchises Microsoft is referring to are decades old and have pieced together their lifetime revenue over <strong>many years</strong>. For instance, Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Gears of War, Diablo, and Halo. Microsoft has little in the way of new IP under that umbrella, and even the gem of the collection – Call of Duty – was acquired after being on the market for more than 20 years.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e135de7-7104-4bca-b2c4-e584199eabeb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snippet from the financial update</a> that was dug up <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101314/xbox-has-20-video-game-franchises-that-have-earned-1-billion/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by TweakTown</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. </p>



<p>We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The financial update gassed up the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to no end, singing the praises of the paid-for platform that boasts ‘over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles’. It’s not the be-all and end-all, though – the ecosystem’s cloud gaming platform was also spotlighted, even if competition is running rampant.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a dog-eat-dog world, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>This year, Microsoft’s gaming revenue increased by 39% – $6 billion – thanks to growth in Xbox content and services, it was revealed. Microsoft is putting a lot of faith in the recent ABK acquisition to further bolster growth going forward: <em>‘The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming.’</em></p>



<p>What’s your favourite Microsoft-backed franchise that has made more than $1 billion in its lifetime? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Undisputed, the first boxing game to be a smash hit in more than a decade, has just passed one million sales. It entered early access last year but was released in full on October 11, being scooped up and praised by boxing fans worldwide. In a recent interview, one of the founders of the developer, Steel City Interactive, spoke about this milestone and what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Esports has always been on the table for Undisputed, and it’s about time to realise that vision.;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-opportunities">New Opportunities</h2>



<p>The esports industry is dominated by shooters, MOBA games, and the FGC. Typically, sports-based titles aren’t all that popular where esports are concerned, and that’s mostly because the real-world examples of these sports are there and readily available. It’s not possible to watch <strong>real-world shootouts </strong>unfold on a competitive level now, is it?</p>



<p>Despite that, Steel City Interactive is ready and willing to make Undisputed one of the next best esports games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/undisputed-hit-an-indie-made-boxing-game-featuring-real-fighters-has-just-sold-1m-copies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Ash Habib, one of Steel City’s founders, spoke about the competitive future of Undisputed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports was part of the original vision for the game. </p>



<p>I didn’t want the esport element to feel like a bolt-on or something that needed doing separately. With that in mind, we partnered with the WBC, where there will be an esport element where you can actually win a physical WBC belt, given by Mauricio Sulaimán, who is the president himself. So esports is in our plans, and will form a big part of Undisputed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, we sat down with Ash Habib to learn about the ins and outs of this marvellous new boxing game that has been turning heads for years.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One million sales are just the start for Undisputed. If the game can generate a popular enough esports ecosystem, it’ll be in a league of its own, as there’s nothing else to compete with it at present.</p>

Jason Voorhees first appeared (sort of) to terrify teens at a Crystal Lake summer camp, and its safe to say the original Friday the 13th is essential viewing for any horror fan. 12 movies and 11 directors later, the hockey-mask wearing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-31-horror-movie-villains">horror villain</a> has become a zombie, gone to space, and battled a fellow slasher icon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to watch or rewatch the films ahead of Halloween or the next Friday the 13th in December, here's where you can stream all of the Friday the 13th movies right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Watch the Friday the 13th Movies Online </h2><div catalogid="c47a9a39-a644-4b37-b515-8776ebd77b36" id="135369"><div id="135369" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>7 Days Free Paramount+ Free Trial</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes a 7-day free trial.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, the Friday the 13th movies have been pretty hard to find online. This October, the first eight Friday the 13th movies ("the original series," if you will) have finally found a home at Paramount+. The more recent films, including the 2009 reboot, are available to stream on Max. All of the Friday the 13th movies are available to rent or purchase from digital storefronts, which is unfortunately the only way to get your hands on Jason Goes to Hell (maybe that one's for the best) and Jason X. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Friday the 13th Movies on Blu-ray </h2></div><div catalogid="f986598b-93bb-4442-9838-53081531c46b" id="87884"><div id="87884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shout! Factory Friday the 13th Collection [Blu-Ray]</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 16 discs with the original movies in HD, special features, audio commentaries and more.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Friday the 13th movies may be all over the place online, Shout!Factory released a collected set of all 12 movies on Blu-ray back in 2020. The set also includes what can only be described as a ludicrous amount of bonus features. If you don't need the Blu-ray or all those extras, you can also grab a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGJmp?object_uuid=c0a96dbc-3ecc-400f-8f4c-fe1e52e642dc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DVD set of the first 8 movies</a> for around $20. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Order Should You Watch the Friday the 13th Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Friday the 13th franchise, like most of the 80's slashers, has a lot going on. We're talking spin-offs, reboots, crossovers, and some good ol' time travel. For those interested in the Jason timeline, we've also covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-friday-the-13th-movies-in-order">how to watch the Friday the 13th movies in chronological order</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will There Be More Friday the 13th Movies? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the 2009 reboot may have intended to bring back the series, complicated legal drama over franchise rights has stalled the production of any new Friday the 13th movies since. Instead, the biggest release the franchise has seen in the past 15 years was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, which, due to more legal drama, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/friday-the-13th-the-game-will-no-longer-be-available-to-buy-after-this-year">delisted at the end of 2023</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, we may finally get that 13th Friday the 13th movie. Earlier this year, Horror, Inc announced they would be working with some of the original license holders to build up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-universe-horror-inc-announces-multi-platform-expansion-of-friday-the-13th-franchise">multi-platform Jason Universe</a>. Yes, of course that's what they're calling it. While the Jason-verse will seemingly kick off with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/friday-the-13th-prequel-series-finds-new-showrunner-following-bryan-fullers-exit">Crystal Lake TV show</a>, hopefully we see Jason back on the big screen sooner rather than later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who is always looking for the next great horror story and turn-based RPG.</em></p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 25, 2024 1:30 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the summer of their third year in high school, Korone—the lively mood maker who brought the oddballs together—reaches out after a long time.</p><p>Looking forward to their reunion, they all arrive at the meeting place… or so they thought.</p><p>When they regain consciousness, they find themselves in a small room with no exit. The room is decorated as if themed after <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. In each corner of the square room, there is a chair and a table for each girl, as well as a lovely tea set.

It figures to move even more into the mainstream with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Yakuza-Season-Trailer/dp/B0D9PPR5FY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV series</a> on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Video</a> today, October 24. In honor of the new TV series, several retailers are holding sales on the entire Yakuza series, making now the perfect time to get into the beloved Japanese crime saga. You'll find deals on console and PC versions of the games, including an Amazon discount that drops the most recent game, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJHD3JZ8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a></strong>, to just $30 (normally $70).</p><p dir="ltr">This nearly 60%-off deal is the best price we've seen for Infinite Wealth since its release earlier this year. The discount applies to the PS5, PS4, Xbox (cross-gen) versions of the game, but it's only available for a limited time, so grab it while you can. As mentioned, Infinite Wealth is a direct sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which starts a new story arc with a brand-new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga.
