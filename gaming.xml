			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is expected to be a record-shattering game that will generate over $7 billion in revenue in its first 60 days of availability.</p>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joshchapmanb_gta-vi-we-predict-that-gta-vi-will-generate-activity-7350762544032010240-p4Eo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACr_MyIB0LsPQAIci9zs45L99nTb3k_h6f8">LinkedIn</a>, Josh Chapman, Managing Partner at Konvoy, an investement firm focusing on the video gaming and interactive entertainment industry, shared some predicitons on the sixth entry in the series by Rockstar Games, confirming the firm predicts that the game will generate $7.6 billion in revenue in the first 60 days of availability, and Take-Two Interactive will break even on the $2 billion investement into the game within 30 days of release. Grand Theft Auto VI is also expected to be a record-shattering game in terms of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time, player count and viewership.</p>



<p>Long before we knew when Grand Theft Auto VI would come out, many have predicted it will be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if it indeed will indeed be the monumental release everyone expects it to be and if it will manage to go even beyond the boldest predictions. One of the records GTA VI already shattered, however, is likely to remain unbroken for a long time. The game's development costs will likely continue to remain the highest for an entry in the series, as Grand Theft Auto 7 is expected to cost less to make, as a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-most-expensive-gta-7-ai/">development work is going to be taken over by AI.</a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has been optimized for a variety of Macs, from early M1 models up, if you want the top “very high fidelity” config then you’ll need an M3 Ultra or M4 Max machine with 36GB of unified memory.</p><p>CD Projekt Red is using dynamic “for this Mac” presets that will assign settings and resolutions based on your Mac’s hardware. M1 Macs will be able to run <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, as long as you have 16GB of unified memory. That gives you the “minimum” config, which runs at 1440 x 900 resolution or 1600 x 900 (using MetalFX dynamic resolution scaling) with a target performance of 30fps.</p><p>If you want 60fps then CD Projekt Red is recommending an M3 Pro or higher with 18GB of unified memory, which will run at 1080p resolution (using MetalFX DRS) with a target of 60fps. You’ll likely be able to achieve 60fps by dropping the resolution below 1080p on some older Apple silicon hardware, though.</p><p>The remaining “high fidelity” and “very high fidelity” configs will be reserved for some of the most powerful Apple silicon chips. High fidelity requires an M2 Ultra or M3 Max chip with 36GB of unified memory, and will enable 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS. Very high fidelity is reserved for M3 Ultra or M4 Max chips with 36GB of unified memory, and will also deliver 60fps gameplay at 1440p with MetalFX DRS enabled.</p><p>None of the “for this Mac” presets enable ray tracing by default, though. If you want to play around with ray tracing then <a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/mac/sp-technical/issue/2897/ray-tracing-on-mac">CD Projekt Red recommends</a> an M3 or newer chip. An Apple M3 Pro device with 18GB of unified memory will be able to handle the medium ray tracing preset at 1080p (with MetalFX DRS) and 30fps. If you want <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> ray-traced at 60fps on Mac then you’ll need an M3 Max or higher chip with 36GB of unified memory, which will run the medium ray tracing preset at 60fps at 1080p with MetalFX DRS.</p><p>AMD’s FSR upscaling and frame generation will also be available in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Mac, so it’s possible with a mixture of settings you’ll be able to find an even sweeter spot for playing this game on a Mac than the presets provide. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will be available from Apple’s own Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com on July 17th, and the game supports cross progression across all platforms.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708100/cyberpunk-2077-mac-system-requirements-modes-ray-tracing]]></content:encoded>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>According to their own "rules and standards"</p>

    </div>

            <p>Valve have updated Steam's rules and regulations to prohibit games that "may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam's payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers". And in particular, "certain kinds of adult only content". In other words, they are giving banks, ISPs and credit card companies some degree of control over Steam's definition of acceptable "adult only content". All of which potentially has rather dramatic ramifications, given that banks and payment companies have a track record for pressuring platform holders to nuke what they deem to be NSFW material.</p><!--more-->
<p>The new rule appears on Steam's <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5">onboarding page for developers</a>. I've verified that it was recently added using the ole <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250217163251/https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5">Internet Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<p>Valve's policy towards "adult content" and what separates this from pornography has always been rather foggy, partly because humans in general struggle to agree on what "adult" and "pornography" really mean. For a time, the platform holders tried to enforce a no-porno approach. This came to a head - probably not the best choice of words, so let's swiftly and humorously add "of steam" - in 2018, when Valve <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-threatening-removal-of-visual-novels-with-adult-content-some-authorised-years-ago-say-mangagamer">issued a bunch of rather arbitrary warnings</a> to various developers and publishers, demanding that they edit "pornographic content" out of games that ranged from horror sex comedies to puzzlers that are arguably far less raunchy than, say, the wham-bam scenes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>.</p>
<p>Following an outcry, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1666776116200553082">announced</a> that they were stepping back from the enforcement of definitions around porn and adult content, and would instead focus on equipping players with tools and systems for labelling and filtering anything they'd rather not see. The current Steam rules require adult content to be "appropriately labeled and age-gated". Still, Valve continue to intervene to remove "adult" games that, for example, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-steam-rape-day-controversy-how-it-became-a-scandal-and-why-its-further-testing-valves-policies">glorify rape</a>, in line with Steam's other prohibitions against hate speech, games that simulate the exploitation of children, nude or sexually explicit images of real people, and any content "that is patently offensive or intended to shock or disgust viewers".</p>
<p>Handing over authority to banks, ISPs and other payment providers may result in further arbitrary rejections of games, given that companies such as Stripe, Mastercard and Paypal are in <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators/">the</a> <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/patreon-continues-to-crack-down-on-nsfw-content-creators">habit</a> of nudging sites like Patreon to crack down on "NSFW" or "adult" material.</p>
<p>In particular, this could lead to a stifling of games that are in any way non-conforming, particularly given the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-indoctrination-in-k-12-schooling/">current climate of repression</a> in Valve's home country, the USA. I know about the rule change thanks to Youtuber and self-described former game developer NoahFuel Gaming, who has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/noahfuelgaming.bsky.social/post/3lu2ngnm3hc26">posted on Bluesky</a> about the potential fallout for projects the banks and financial corporations consider "adult" because they deviate from reactionary framings of sex and gender. As the Youtuber writes: "Queer content gets flagged as 'explicit' even when it's PG. A trans dev making a personal story? 'Too controversial.' A surreal queer VN? 'Sexualized.' Financial deplatforming in action."</p>
<p>I'll ask Valve if they'd like to comment on all this.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content]]></content:encoded>

                <p>So far, there have only been a handful of third-party games confirmed for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but an industry insider has claimed that many studios don't yet have development kits, and this is to blame for the limited announcements.</p><p>That's according to YouTuber Nate the Hate (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-games-delay-lack-of-dev-kits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>), who discussed the console's noticeable lack of titles from third-party studios and indie partners in his most recent<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y"> podcast</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYkD9QCBp4Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> episode</a>.</p><p>"This has been a talking point amongst Nintendo fans really since the Switch 2 has come out, and it's definitely spurred up once again in the most recent days," Nate the Hate said. "And that is the question of, 'Where are the games? Where are the game announcements from third parties and indie partners?

"And it's not just indie developers. It's also those double-A and low triple-A developers who currently lack access to dev kits. And for a lot of them, they're kind of sitting there scratching their head wondering, 'When is Nintendo going to give us access?'"</p><p>Nate the Hate's co-host, Modern Vintage Gamer, also claimed that there are "quite a few" studios and publishers who don't have Switch 2 development hardware right now, and suggested that there are roughly two-thirds that made games for the original Switch that don't have access to dev kits.</p><p>"I think one-third of developers, publishers, that have worked on Switch 1 titles have access to Switch 2 hardware, but the remaining are still waiting for their hardware to come in," said Modern Vintage Gamer.</p><p>While there's no official word on what third-party games have yet to be announced, Nate later claimed that there are several companies, including Capcom and Sega, still waiting for dev kits, and that although Microsoft is planning to support the console, the dev kit issue will push these plans back to 2026.</p><p>"I also know studios like Capcom, Sega, Ubisoft, Bandai Namco, and many others are just waiting," he said.

Drag x Drive, the Nintendo-developed wheelchair basketball game unveiled alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> back in April, is getting a limited-time demo.
</p>
<p>
Drag x Drive was one of the more unusual additions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">April's big Switch 2 news blow-out</a>, taking advantage of the console's new mouse controls in a distinctive dual Joy-Con configuration as two teams of three players propel themselves around the court in an effort to score the most points before a match ends.
</p>
<p>
If that sounds intriguing, there'll be an opportunity for Switch Online subscribers to take Drag x Drive for a spin ahead of its full release on 14th August this year. Nintendo's calling the event the Drag x Drive: Global Jam, and it'll run across three four hours slots starting 9th August in the UK.

<p>
Slot one runs from 11am-3pm UK time on Saturday, 9th August, while two additional slots - running 1am-5am and 5pm-9pm - take place on Sunday, 10th August. If you happen to live in the US, the Saturday slot runs from 3am to 7am PT, and the Sunday slots are scheduled for 9am-1pm and 5pm-9pm PT.
</p>
<p>
Drag x Drive will cost £16.99 when it arrives on 14th August as a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Drag-x-Drive-2785803.html">Switch 2 eShop exclusive</a>. Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Tom Phillips described the fast-paced experience as "exhausting" after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">brief hands on with Drag x Drive earlier this year</a>, but hopefully the full experience will be entertaining enough to balance out that arm-based exertion.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-ray-tracing-challenge/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-ray-tracing-implementation-would-be-a-challenge-tech-experts-say.1244775/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Implementing ray tracing in Red Dead Redemption 2 would be a bigger challenge than in Grand Theft Auto V for a few reasons, including the game's world diversity.</p>



<p>Replying to a supporter's question regarding the possibility of the rumored next-gen updated release adding ray tracing to the game, the tech expert at Digital Foundry highlighted how the possibility is there, as ray tracing getting added to Grand Theft Auto V on current generation consoles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-patch-new-ray-tracing-settings/">PC</a> suggests that it has been backported to older versions of the Rage engine. However, it could be challenging to implement ray tracing features in Red Dead Redemption 2, as the entire rendering has changed in the time between Grand Theft Auto V and the second entry of the wild west open-world series. Also, world diversity and the presence of a lot more vegetation than in GTAV add to the challenge, as the visual return would be different, as the game, for example, lacks a lot of man-made glass structures, and most of its world is green and brown, which would make bounce lighting less obvious than occlusion.</p>



<p>Even if Rockstar Games finds this challenge worthwhile, it's unlikely the entire RT suite would be implemented, and only some ray-traced effects would be a good fit, like ray-traced global illumination, which would enhance the game's use of SSAO with a static AO contribution with changes brought by the time of day. Ray-traced ambient occlusion would also be a good fit, while ray-traced shadows may not make much of a difference, as Red Dead Redemption 2 already features great shadows.</p>

<iframe title="Could The Red Dead Redemption 2 Remaster Add Ray Tracing?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVFBCmR0HGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Despite being released in late 2018, Red Dead Redemption 2 continues to be among the best-looking open-world games ever released, so most fans would be happy to experience the game at 60 FPS on current-generation consoles even without any other visual improvement. Even in its current state, however, the game is one worth experiencing, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/">review.</a></p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>

        <p>Yes, it’s still meant to be out next week</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>What happens when an unenforceable force meets an un-shut-uppable object? Cooperative monsterman shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> found out this past Sunday, as players of its closed online stress test were asked to agree to a nondisclosure agreement (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/killingfloor/comments/1lyxr4w/a_5_year_nda_for_2_hours/">shared on Reddit</a>) that would stay in effect for <em>five years</em>. Or four years, three hundred and fifty-four days after KF3 is supposed to launch, on July 24th.</p>
<p>Naturally, this was broken almost immediately, including by Twitch streamers clicking through the agreement <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2511631428">live on air</a>. In a <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-wednesday-stress-test-details.2341991/">forum post</a>, developers Tripwire Interactive have since declared that they stopped bothering to enforce within the test’s first hour, and apologised for making such a mad demand in the first place. The post also confirms that another stress test – which PC players can still apply to join – is happening later today, Wednesday 16th, and won’t insist on any legal gagging at all.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>NDAs are commonly wheeled out when developers run limited pre-release play sessions like these, though the half-decade duration is plainly nonsense in KF3’s case. Tripwire’s statement attributes it to essentially misused paperwork, claiming "5 years is our standard boilerplate language for internal tests and was too heavy handed for this context," adding that "It was never our intention to enforce a 5-year ban on discussing the game." The same post infers that at least some time <em>was</em> spent clamping down on agreement breakers, but then that wouldn’t have been weird at all were they only told to keep schtum for a few days. Not, y’know, the same time it took to build the Hoover Dam.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>It's not like gamers have a particularly proud history of nondisclosure compliance, either. Take the Fortnite tester who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-games-sue-tester-for-spoiling-chapter-2">let slip its Season 2 details</a>, or the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-streamer-played-an-hour-of-marathon-early-before-bungie-cut-him-off">rogue Marathon streamer</a> who managed to beam an hour of the upcoming FPS like that doomed Rebel Alliance soldier passing the Death Star plans out of Darth Vader’s murder hallway. Or my personal favourite case, YouTuber and arch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> Engie main Uncle Dane <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1cxveqf/uncule_dane_leaks_the_deadlock/">leaking Deadlock</a> so hard that Valve abandoned their secrecy altogether.</p>
<p>Anyway, this new, unbound stress test begins today at 2pm BST / 9am EST, and will run for 12 hours, making it a much meatier opportunity to test drive Killing Floor 3 than Sunday’s two-hour sesh. You can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/">via Steam</a> if you’d like to see what all the fuss is about.</p>
<p>Fuss has certainly been in no short supply for KF3; it was previously delayed from a planned March 2025 release after a disastrous open beta that produced widespread complaints on the game’s performance, gunfeel, and switch from having freely mix-matchable characters and perk classes – as in Killing Floors 1 and 2 – to a more hero shooterish Specialist system. By many accounts from the Sunday stress test, encouraging improvements have been made, though Tripwire say that unjoining characters and perks won’t take place until after release.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/killing-floor-3s-next-stress-test-launches-today-and-wont-share-the-last-ones-five-year-nda]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metaphor-refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Atlus' critically acclaimed RPG, has now sold 2m units worldwide.</p>

<p>It means the game has taken a further nine months to double its sales, suggesting its initial sales were from Atlus fans eager to play a new game from the developer outside of its famed Persona series, but longterm it perhaps hasn't resonated with a wider audience.</p>

<p>News of this sales milestone isn't entirely new, however, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-leaked-sales-figures-show-sonics-new-frontier-is-heading-in-the-right-direction">Sega accidentally leaked sales figures</a> for a number of its key franchises last month.</p>
<p>While Metaphor has sold 2m units, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> sold 2.07m units, both of which pale in comparison to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5 Royal</a>'s 7.25m units.</p>
<p>The game received rave reviews on its release.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you are a developer and you want to ground your video game in a compelling era of history, then the late Ming Period could well be for you. This was an era in Chinese history identified with great sweeping change, and the societal tension that accompanies it. Indeed, the potent series of crises – including the old favourites of ineffective leadership resulting in famine, rebellion, and war – that afflicted the Imperial Court were significant enough to bring an end to the near 300-year-old Ming Dynasty. But don’t take my word for it, take the word of Xia Siyuan, Co-Founder/CTO of Leenzee Games and Game Director and Art Director of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>, a brand-new <a href="http://theixthaxis.com/tag/soulslike">soulslike</a> that sees the player taking on hideous mythical beasties, and a game that just so happens to delve into this historic setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wuchang: Fallen Feathers 2024 Showcase Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPf0b55ixE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“The late Ming Dynasty was a period filled with conflict, cultural richness, and philosophical tension…all of which fit the kind of story we wanted to tell” said Xia “The lands of Shu, especially in Sichuan, gave us a unique backdrop with deep historical roots and regional myths that many of us on the team grew up hearing. It offered the perfect mix of real-world texture and space for dark, imaginative storytelling.”</p>


<p>“Real historical events gave us a strong foundation. The turmoil during the late Ming Dynasty — especially the chaos in Sichuan during Zhang Xianzhong’s invasion — helped shape the atmosphere of collapse and unrest that runs through the game. We took those real moments of instability and layered in myth, using them to imagine how the world might have unravelled if something like the Feathering had taken hold.”</p>
<p>What is this Feathering that afflicts the land? Well, it’s a particularly cruel condition, one that causes the poor unsuspecting victim to sprout feathers from their limbs before ultimately going mad and transforming into a hideous monster. Lovely stuff, but where did the initial idea for this disease originate from? That’s what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>“According to existing records,” Xia dramatically intoned, “the Feathered People first appeared in the <em>Classic of Mountains and Seas</em>, and a significant number of unearthed artefacts also depict them. These relics, texts, and folk legends have all served as sources of inspiration for us.</p>

<p>“Many of the creatures in Wuchang draw from Chinese mythology, regional folklore, and ancient archaeological finds. We looked at stories about resurrection, spiritual corruption, and shape-shifting beings, then imagined what those myths might look like if they were warped by the Feathering disease. Sanxingdui relics, with their abstract, otherworldly designs, were a major visual influence, and we used them to help create enemies that feel both ancient and unsettling but woven into the world in which they live.”</p>
<p>If I wasn’t intrigued enough already, now my Indiana Jones senses were really tingling… ancient archaeological finds? Relics? Otherworldly designs? What exactly are the archaeological discoveries of Sanxingdui? Well, Sanxingdui is an archaeological site in modern Guanghan, Sichuan. Initially uncovered way back in 1927, it has since proven a treasure trove for bronze age artefacts, which archaeologists have attributed to the ancient Kingdom of Shu.</p>
<p>“The archaeological discoveries at Sanxingdui are a fascinating topic” continues Xia, “We’ve incorporated those elements not only into the design of certain bosses, but also throughout the environments and the story’s background. As players continue exploring, these cultural references will gradually become more prominent — eventually culminating in the ancient capital of the Bo people, where this unique cultural thread reaches its narrative peak.”</p>
<p>Sanxingdui excitingly consists of numerous sacrificial pits, which in total are crammed with over 13,000 relics, with more than 3000 items intact. This is mighty impressive, considering many of these artefacts are millennia old. My smart phone barely sees the year out before promptly self-destructing. Some of the relics uncovered depict half bird half man figures – human bodies transmogrified with feathers, wings and bird claw feet. It is these that proved the inspiration for the Feathering disease, and for many of the bosses that will repeatedly kill you until you get good.</p>

<p>“The game’s world, it’s actually set in a parallel timeline—one shaped by a small divergence during the time of Du Yu” explains Xia, “In this alternate world, the worship of the Feathered People and legends of resurrection have taken root.”</p>
<p>Which is all very well and good, but if players are going to fight hideous monsters inspired by the relics of an ancient mysterious culture, they’re going to need a range of weapons to dish out some damage, right? Well, don’t worry, Wuchang has you covered, with twenty-five brutal weapons to assist you in cleaving feathered wing from feathered body, like an overenthusiastic KFC chef.</p>
<p>“Several of the weapons are rooted in real historical designs from the Ming Dynasty, as well as legendary arms from Chinese mythology” begins Xia, “The Ming era was a transitional period in terms of warfare — moving from traditional cold weapons like swords and spears to early firearms and explosives. That shift gave us a lot to work with, both mechanically and visually. We incorporated these changes into the game’s weapon variety, blending grounded historical detail with mythological symbolism. Some weapons are stylised interpretations of relics from the period, while others are tied to specific folklore or spiritual beliefs, adding another layer of meaning to how they function in combat and within the world. It was important to us that each weapon felt like it belonged to the era, even if touched by the surreal or supernatural.”</p>
<p>Quite frankly, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers sounds fantastic, the perfect game for lovers of history, mythology, and weird looking bird-dudes. Before I wrapped up my time with Xia, I wanted to know, what do the team at Leenzee Games hope players will learn about Chinese history, culture, and mythology through experiencing Wuchang: Fallen Feathers?</p>

<p>“Jiangkou sunken treasure, the Four Loyal Sons, Sanxingdui, the Jinsha ruins, Taoping Qiang Village, Baoyun Temple in Pingwu—these Sichuan landmarks and legends are part of the memories that shaped me and my team as we grew up. We drew inspiration from local folk culture such as the Sanxingdui relics, Sichuan opera’s face-changing, the iron firework ritual datiehua, as well as from Ming Dynasty philosophies—Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism—and the evolution of firearms. All of these influences were woven into the gameplay.</p>
<p>Our hope is that these elements not only reflect historical authenticity, but also allow players to experience the unique cultural richness of the region. For us, sharing these memories and stories with more people is meaningful in itself—and we believe they’ll resonate with players.”</p>
<p>Wuchang: Fallen Feather is being published by <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/505-games">505 Games</a> and will launch later this month on July 24 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p><em>Excellent news! The first Playing with History book – featuring over 100 games, 200 pages, and 10,000,000 years of history –has been successfully funded on Kickstarter.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-publishing-guidelines-updated-with-clause-prohibiting-content-that-violates-payment-processor-and-bank-rules.1244724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Steam publishing guidelines have been recently updated with a new clause that prevents the release of certain types of content on the platform if they violate payment processor and bank rules.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/">Automaton</a>, the Rules and Guidelines section of the Steamworks Documentation has been recently updated with a new clause that prohibits the publication of "content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers." The clause clarifies that this refers to certain kinds of adult-only content, of which there's a lot on the Valve platform. A few hours ago, SteamDB confirmed that several games that are definitely in violation of this new rule have been removed from the store, although it's still unconfirmed if their removal has anything to do with the new publishing guidelines clause.</p>



<p>As payment processors and card networks have very strict rules regarding adult content, it was only a matter of time before adult content on Steam would be impacted. Hopefully, the clause will only impact content that's in clear violation of the rule and won't be used to further limit what can be published on Steam, regardless of the presence of what is deemed adult content by a third party.</p>



<p>Besides the addition of the new clause, the rest of the Steam publishing Rules and Guidelines haven't been changed. You can check them out by going <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding#5">here.</a></p>

            <p>I liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, and having read through the notes for its summer update, patch 1.5, I reckon I'll like it even more whenever I next decide to don <a href="https://www.vg247.com/becoming-avoweds-most-toxic-360-no-scoper">the persona of a trickshotting Envoy</a>.</p>
<p>This patch is the <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945182871930511524">second of three seasonal updates</a> Obsidian outlined that the game'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-latest-update-comes-with-community-requested-features-lots-of-tweaks-and-a-promise-of-a-roadmap">over the course of this year</a>. It's brought a substantial rework of fighter and ranger skills, some extra unique weapons for you to get your mitts on, Steam Deck verification, plus a bunch of other tweaks and fixes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The changes to abilities on offer to non-magical scrappers form the meat of <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/">the patch's notes</a>, and Obsidian say they've been made "to round out the classes compared to the Wizard tree". Those damn wizards, always getting the fancy tricks.
</p>
<p>The new abilities added in include the likes of a Shadow Step skill for sneaky stealthers that'll let you casually "step into the Beyond, reappearing behind your enemy", with upgrades offering the chance to do stuff like ensure these killer backstabs reset the ability's cooldown.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Update 1.5 is now live for Avowed! Please update your game when you see that this update is available to receive the following features, fixes, and changes: <a href="https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r">https://t.co/XKApoZIa0r</a></p><p>• Explore new weapons, abilities, and armor<br>• Korean and Japanese language support<br>• ✔️ Steam… <a href="https://t.co/6VEIccb1Ir">pic.twitter.com/6VEIccb1Ir</a></p></div>— Avowed (@AvowedtheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1945181691800076625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Melee Maurices, on the other hand, get skills like reviving allies "from a great distance", a Barbaric Smash that lets you absorb an enemy's built up stun reserves if your "massive blow" kills them, and the ability to take a deep breath that immediately recovers all of their stamina. That last one's something I need in real life.</p>
<p>Alongside that, Obsidian have aimed to address folks "not able to play specific builds that they wanted to early on in the game" by littering a bunch of extra unique weapons throughout Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, Shatterscarp, and Galawain’s Tusks. The former two have gotten the most, with six and five items respectively, mirroring the goal to frontload some more fun.
</p>
<p>Meanwhile, enemies have been given some player abilities "such as Returning Storm, Ring of Tire, Taunt, Clear Out, Blizzard, and Tanglefoot" as well as new physical and magical barriers to block attack. So they should be equipped to try and hold off your newfound skillage.</p>
<p>Add in the Steam Deck verification, some changes to the cooking and crafting interface, and a bunch of bug fixes. The result's a patch that looks to me like a decent excuse to dust off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-beginners-guide">your facial shrooms</a> if you fancy a fresh playthrough, even if it's unlikely to turn your view on Avowed around if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">the release version</a> wasn't up your alley.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avoweds-summer-update-revamps-fighter-and-ranger-skills-so-those-pesky-wizards-arent-having-all-the-fun]]></content:encoded>

The dark fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> will be £33.50, and it's Julian Gollop's Snapshot Games handling the adaption. I had a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/frosthaven-is-getting-a-digital-follow-up-to-gloomhaven-and-you-can-play-it-this-month">short hands-on preview</a> with the director back in March. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the series, Frosthaven and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gloomhaven">Gloomhaven</a> (which has been treated to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gloomhaven-pc-review">excellent digital adaption</a>) are some of the most elephantine and absurdly lavish of the big box 'legacy' board games. The idea behind a legacy game is, instead of whipping it out for the odd isolated session, you play a full campaign. There's character progression with little bags to store your stuff in, stickers to put on the map to mark new locations you've discovered, and mystery boxes to be opened when the game tells you to. It feels like pure magic when pulled off by a board game, but you naturally lose some of that when everything's being done digitally. What's impressive with cards, tokens and stickers just becomes rote when performed by a computer.</p>
<p>Luckily, Gloomhaven and Frosthaven have clever and deep tactical combat that's worth engaging with for its own sake, alongside story events with choice and consequence. I haven't played the physical version of Frosthaven, but Gloomhaven was a biblical bollockcrusade to set up and tear down. I cannot promise you the PC version of Frosthaven will be good but, as with the Gloomhaven adaption, I can confidently say it will never require you to glue together an MDF token tray.</p>
<p>Where Frosthaven most differs from its prequel is in the town itself, where you'll construct and upgrade buildings to unlock more equipment and events. Some features from Steam, a digital storefront and therefore immune to the psychic damage caused by the following irresponsible abundance of capital letters:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>UNIQUE CHARACTERS</strong> - Choose from six starting character classes—including the Banner Spear, Boneshaper, Drifter, Geminate, Blinkblade, and Deathwalker</li>
<li>Additional classes will be unlocked as you progress your campaign</li>
<li>Each class features its own unique abilities and playstyle to master</li>
<li><strong>DEEP, TACTICAL COMBAT</strong> - Engage in deep, tactical turn-based combat, testing your skills against an array of new enemies and formidable bosses</li>
<li>Utilize an ability card system that requires careful planning to unleash devastating attacks, execute powerful combos, and try keeping your party members alive</li>
<li><strong>BUILD YOUR OUTPOST -</strong> Manage the Outpost, constructing and upgrading various buildings, unlocking new game features and mechanics</li>
<li><strong>A STUNNING WORLD TO EXPLORE</strong> – A stunning art style, highly detailed models and textures, and expressive animations all bring the world of Frosthaven to life.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>There's 130 quests in the full thing, and I'm assuming quests here means a full location with enemies, an objective, and likely a story event or two. There'll be "35+ quests across Acts 1 and 2" in the early access build at launch. You can also play with up to three mates. Another reason you might be interested in Frosthaven is if you're weary of 'brutish' fantasy races - Cephalofair hired <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-not-easy-being-green-a-brief-history-of-orcs-in-video-games">good orc opinion haver</a> James Mendez Hodes to help build on Frosthaven's world, and what I've seen seems much richer for it. His writings have been over-simplified over the years in some well-meaning but ultimately clumsy "orcs are black people" cultural criticisms, but it's <a href="https://jamesmendezhodes.com/blog/2019/1/13/orcs-britons-and-the-martial-race-myth-part-i-a-species-built-for-racial-terror">great work</a> from a great writer who, like me, just bloody loves a good orc.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dark-fantasy-frosthaven-is-a-dm-free-dungeons-and-dragons-campaign-in-a-box-and-its-coming-to-steam-this-month]]></content:encoded>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>We are straining Rock Paper Shotgun's innovative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-the-demo-for-this-magical-scandinavian-skiing-game-is-so-serene-then-why-do-i-die-constantly">"News To Me, Anyway"</a> subcategory to breaking point with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anoxic-depths-caves-of-the-yendori">Anoxic Depths: Caves Of The Yendori</a>, a turn-based spelunking roguelite from Studio Tectorum. The scurvy bean-counters among you might protest that it came out 10 years ago, possibly before some of you were old enough to read, operate video games, or count beans. To you scurvy bean-counters I would say: if you're going to be so picky about details, how about you help me remember which way is up, because I am stuck in an underwater cave.</p>
<p>I have maybe 12 breaths left in my oxygen cylinder, and all I can see is rock texture. The ladder to the surface could be a foot away or 20. Soon, my body shall join those of the divers who came before. Ye gods, I love being this confused in video games.</p><!--more-->
<p>Anoxic Depths offers "3D gameplay in a 2D world", to which the only appropriate response is surely "you magnificent bastards, get the hell in here and also, get the hell out, I never want to see your face again". It casts you as a diver fetching bones, pottery and amulets from procedurally generated underground lakes, at the request of a mysterious researcher.</p>
<p>The researcher "is not a cave diving instructor", <a href="https://www.studiotectorum.com/anoxic-depths/">the developer's official website cautions</a>, which is presumably why there is no tutorial in the demo, just sparse hints from NPCs in the shops and dwellings around the cavemouth. I would appreciate a tutorial, in that Anoxic Depths simulates "decompression sickness" and "pulmonary barotrauma", and I don't quite know what either of these are. But before I can get pulmonary barotrauma, I need to master the art of descending through a world that appears flat.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dwarf-fortress">Dwarf Fortress</a>, Anoxic Depths deals out its geography in cross-sections. Unlike in Dwarf Fortress, you can roll the view by 90 degree increments, turning a horizontal cross-section into a vertical one. There is no HUD indication of your orientation by default, so you have to really build up a mental map of the volume you're exploring, and count the number of times you've rolled. There are gear items such as diving lines to help you retrace your path to the surface. While we're talking gear, don't forget to switch on your breathing apparatus before you plunge in.</p>
<p>As and when you've got your head round these things, you can try playing the game with a kanji tileset or ASCII, if you want to really layer up the Dwarf Fortress comparisons. Are there any Dwarf Fortress-style procedural demons below? I've yet to encounter one and I sincerely hope not. Imagine trying to elude a Forgotten Beast when you can't remember which way is up.</p>
<p>Thanks to Resetera user Toma for <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/anoxic-depths-roguelike-kanji-scuba-diving-simulator-free-demo.1243713/">passing this on</a>. You can try the demo for yourself on <a href="https://studiotectorum.itch.io/anoxic-depths">Itch.io</a>. It limits how deep you can dive, but saves do carry over to the full game, which will set you back by around the price of a posh supermarket sandwich.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will amend the way trading works at the end of this month, following previous criticism of the feature.</p>
<p>Trading was added to the digital card game back in January, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-brand-trading-system-a-joke-and-downright-greedy">players quickly criticised the need for an extra currency</a>, calling the system "a joke". Then, back in March, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-overhauls-trading-following-player-backlash">acknowledged the backlash and announced an overhaul</a>.</p>
<p>Today, an in-game notification states an update will take place on 29th July. This will discontinue trade tokens and instead the existing shinedust will be used for trading. In addition, players will no longer need to consume cards in order to trade.</p>

<p>To compensate, the amount of shinedust acquired for duplicate cards will be doubled. Trade tokens will also be exchangeable in the shop for pack hourglasses and shinedust.</p>
<p>The exchange rate will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x pack hourglass = 1 x trade token (maximum 60 exchanges)</li>
<li>10 x shinedust = 1 x trade token (unlimited exchanges)</li>
<li>100 x shinedust = 10 x trade tokens (unlimited exchanges)</li>
<li>1000 x shinedust = 100 x trade tokens (unlimited exchanges)</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to this update, the trading function will be unavailable from 25th July 7am until 30th July 06:59 am.</p>
<p>Another addition will be a Wishlist feature, where players can indicate to others which cards they'd like to trade for. This will make trading for the right cards considerably easier.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>The Pokémon Company / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>The Pokémon Company previously stated these changes would arrive by the end of autumn 2025, so this update is arriving a lot sooner than expected.</p>
<p>The annual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-presents-livestream-date-reveal-points-to-something-musical-rather-than-simply-an-update-on-pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Presents livestream will take place on 22nd July</a>, which was teased yesterday with a Pikachu at a set of DJ decks. Perhaps we'll receive an update to Pokémon TCG Pocket too.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-finally-receives-much-needed-trading-overhaul]]></content:encoded>

And frankly, it was a very exhausting, long process doing the two movies together. So it was nice to have a bit of a break from it. I love it like crazy, but it’s nice to have a bit of a break.

<p>One source added how the new project was effectively "back to the drawing board" for the franchise and its future.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067gzhpov&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Arc System Works most recently revealed <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_tokon_fighting_souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a></strong> - a new 4v4 fighting game which is backed by Sony Interactive Entertainment and will be releasing on the PlayStation 5 and PC next year. So, most of the focus is likely going to be on this game in the immediate future.</p>
<p>This rumour follows the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/guilty_gear_-strive-_nintendo_switch_edition">Guilty Gear Strive</a> on the Nintendo Switch at the beginning of this year. Unfortunately, this particular platform is still waiting on DLC. Producer Ken Miyauchi has <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/07/big-plans-teased-for-guilty-gear-strive-after-season-4-and-cyberpunk-edgerunners-lucy">also recently teased "big" plans</a> for the current game's future, with the fourth season of DLC scheduled to add Lucy.</p>

<p>The second Pokémon Presents showcase of 2025 will be taking place next week, and ahead of this broadcast, The Pokémon Company has issued a reminder on its social channels.</p>
<p>As part of this, the official Pokémon social channels in Japan <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1945045929620349069">have also shared a new image (above)</a>. It shows Pikachu, who is apparently preparing something, and in front of the same Pokémon is what looks to be a DJ setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The "Pokémon Presents" to be streamed on Tuesday, July 22, will have its viewing page open from 9 PM on the same day. It seems like Pikachu is preparing something...?

<p>Again, there's only one week to go now, and this event will be taking place on <strong>22nd July 2025</strong>.
