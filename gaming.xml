			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> has more than 100 notes across all 14 chapters, and it's worth your time to find them all to get the additional story context they provide.</p>
<p>The storytelling in South of Midnight is one of the game's strongest aspects, the notes included. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 11.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 11</h2>
<p>Chapter 11 is one of the lighter chapters, with only eight notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>An Anguished Cry</strong> - Early on in the chapter as you follow the path, you'll jump to a dock with exploding mushrooms covering the front end of it. Jump over the mushrooms and look to your left to find this note in the form of blue art on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Stowaway's Tin Box</strong> - You can find this note in a room on the second floor of the wrecked ship, after dealing with the Stigma knot with Crouton. Walk into the room where the Stigma knot was, and turn right to find a Floof knot and this note.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Bill of Fare - </strong>This note can be found on the third floor of the ship, on a table on the left side of the room, where you enter, as Hazel says she remembers the story of the boat disappearing.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Old Pain, New Life</strong> - After viewing the second memory for Ayotunde, you'll find this note as another blue painting on the tree on the left side of the combat arena.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Bittersweet Reunion</strong> - After seeing the third memory of Ayotunde's past, this note will appear as blue art on rocks on the left side of the main path as you move to continue the rest of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>False Knowledge</strong> - After avoiding the mud thrown by Altamaha-ha, and Honey helping you back onto the boat, you'll re-enter the boat by blowing through some pieces of wood blocking the path. This note will be on the left side of the room you enter, in the form of blue paint on the wall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Captain's Log</strong> - You'll find this note on the right side of the room you enter after using the elevator, on a desk to the right of the boat's wheel, with a Floof knot in front of the wheel.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Final Message</strong> - This last note can be found after the cutscene where Honey and Altamaha-ha meet, once again as a blue painting. It'll be on a large tree on the left side of the main path.</p>
<p>That's where to find all eight notes in Chapter 11. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 82 out of 103 notes. The search is almost over, with only 21 notes left to find.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo issued a subpoena request to a California court that, if approved, would require Discord to provide Nintendo the identity of the Pokemon Teraleaker. "Teraleak" is the moniker Pokemon fans gave to the massive leak from October 2024 that reportedly included not just information about Game Freak and The Pokemon Company's upcoming projects, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, but personal information about Game Freak employees as well. The leak also included data from past <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-pokemon-game-reviewed/2900-3706/" data-ref-id="2900-3706">Pokemon games</a>, including concept art and scrapped designs.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo owns approximately 33 percent of Pokemon, with Game Freak and The Pokemon Company owning the other two-thirds.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/561817/pokemon-teraleak-nintendo-discord-subpoena" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon </a>obtained a copy of Nintendo's court filing, which shows the company requested the leaker's name, address, phone number, and email address. Nintendo also provided redacted images taken from a Discord server called FreakLeak, where the leaker, who went by GameFreakOUT on the platform, posted 1 terabyte of information taken from Game Freak's internal servers. The image Nintendo provided in the court filing showed GameFreakOUT posting a file containing the leaked data and a message telling the group's members to "Enjoy."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo issued DMCA takedown notices in an attempt to remove the stolen data, though it remains publicly available online. While the company hasn't indicated an intent to sue the Pokemon leaker, Nintendo has a history of seeking litigation against those whose actions it perceives as a business threat.</p><p dir="ltr">Gary Bowser, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowser-sentenced-to-more-than-three-years-in-prison/1100-6500590/" data-ref-id="1100-6500590">arrested on federal charges</a> of fraud for his part in creating and selling tools to hack video game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, so people could play games on their devices without paying for them. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/" data-ref-id="1100-6513332">Bowser was released from prison</a>, but owes Nintendo $10 million in compensation and has 25 percent of his monthly income garnished to pay the settlement.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Bethesda finally revealed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">launched The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, one of the games industry's worst-kept secrets for months, and caused a few ripples in the mod community by <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">publishing a post</a> that said Oblivion Remastered mods aren't supported. That's a slightly vague statement, as it only means that Bethesda has no plans to develop and support an official Oblivion Remastered creation kit like the studio did for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/">Skyrim</a> or some of its other games.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Oblivion Remastered still allows for<i> </i>mods, even without a creation kit. You can download and run Oblivion mods or try to make your own without any kind of penalty or fear of a ban. The game just might not run properly, hence Bethesda recommending players disable mods if their game crashes for no other discernible reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever issues may or may not be present with early mods, the Oblivion Remastered mod scene is already lighting up. NexusMods has a handful of creations, including one that<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/36" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> restores the color shading from Oblivion's original release</a>, one to turn the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">desktop icon</a> into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-adoring-fan-explained/1100-6531032/" data-ref-id="1100-6531032">Adoring Fan</a>, and one that makes a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/31" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">longsword deal 10,000 damage</a>, because why not. Early downloaders have also reported no issues getting these mods to work, and that may be due to how Bethesda and Virtuous made Oblivion Remastered. It's a hybrid of sorts, one that's built in Unreal Engine 5, but that still runs on the original Oblivion engine.</p><p dir="ltr">As of the time of publication, modders are uncertain about the ease of porting old Oblivion mods to the remaster, and whether it's even possible, as questions persist regarding how these changes might interact with Unreal Engine 5. However, they have discovered that it's possible to open Oblivion Remastered's files in the Oblivion Construction Set, a mod creation and management tool that lets creators modify the original game's files. Some modders said that, even while they wait to figure out how to create new assets and enable mods, they should still be able to work with existing assets--for example, tweaking existing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-classes-in-oblivion-remastered-all-elder-scrolls-4-classes/1100-6531030/" data-ref-id="1100-6531030">Oblivion classes</a> instead of making brand-new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">Once there's a greater consensus about how Oblivion Remastered mods work, we'll update with detailed steps for how to install them and a roundup of the best ones worth downloading.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, if you're just getting started in Oblivion for the first time or need a refresh, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a> for everything from tips on combat skills to how to navigate factions.</p>

			<p>The Onimusha series may not be as popular as other CAPCOM franchises, but it remains to this day one of the most unique series ever released by the Japanese publisher. Starting out as a different take on the formula made popular by the Resident Evil series, the franchise evolved considerably until the launch of Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, the latest entry in the series, which plays slightly differently from its predecessor, doing away with the signature fixed camera angles that make the series so different from the vast majority of action-adventure games of the time.</p>
<p>With a new entry in the series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gameplay/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> on the way, CAPCOM has decided to bring the second entry in the series, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, to modern gaming platforms with a remaster that aims to faithfully recreate the original game with improved visuals and some small additions which have little impact on the experience. This is, in my opinion, not a bad thing at all, as the game has aged incredibly well.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250403123231_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster is so faithful to the original, which I have gone through countless times back in the PlayStation 2 days but never revisited in over 20 years, that it felt instantly familiar. So much so that I could remember how much of the stiff but incredibly charming English language script was delivered by the voice actors, awkward pauses included. I also had no trouble getting used again to some of the game's unique mechanics, which, as mentioned above, have aged so well that I have no doubt even newcomers will have no trouble getting into the game and enjoying it.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny, much like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/onimusha-warlords-feudal-japan-evil/">predecessor</a>, is a rather unique action-adventure game that strikes a happy medium between the survival horror experience of the first three entries in the Resident Evil series and the more action-oriented approach of the original Devil May Cry, whose development started back in the day, as a new entry in the Resident Evil series. Employing the same fixed camera angles and pre-rendered backgrounds of the older entries in the popular CAPCOM survival horror series, which have been touched up and upscaled like the 3D character models in the remaster, players control Jubei Yagyu as he embarks on a journey to gather the five orbs created to protect humans from demons and defeat Nobunaga Oda, the famous daimyo and one of the three great unifiers of Japan, who has become the lord of the demons following the death of Fortinbras by the hands of Samanosuke Akechi in the original Onimusha. During the course of his journey, Jubei will encounter multiple companions who will help him, depending on his actions, and involve him in their personal stories that will evolve as he continues his war against the demon lord.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250404005042_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The epic journey depicted in Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is extremely enjoyable right from the start. In the first few hours, the game immediately shows its best cards, featuring a combination of simple puzzle solving in the vein of the Resident Evil series and fast and engaging combat against all sorts of enemies, ranging from regular humans to powerful demons, which is made extremely enjoyable by Jubei's mobility and the many techniques he can employ using the currently equipped weapon, which include the thunder katana Buraitou and the ice spear Hyoujin-yari. Unlike the original Devil May Cry, which requires good knowledge of every ability at Dante's disposal, Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is a little less hardcore, meaning that even newcomers will instantly have fun unleashing elemental magical attacks and avoiding enemy techniques while they get to learn the intricacies of the combat system, which features plenty of advanced techniques, including a satisfying Issen critical attack with a strict timing that can kill enemies in a single blow. The fixed camera angles, sometimes, don't provide the best view in combat, especially against the powerful but incredibly memorable boss encounters, but even this flaw is part of the charm of the experience. Combat in the remaster is greatly enhanced by a new feature that allows Jubei to switch between different weapons on the fly, removing some of the downtime of the original, as weapons could only be swapped via the menu in the PlayStation 2 release.</p>
<p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny couldn't be releasing at a better time. With the next entry in the series still a ways off, this remaster will be an excellent way for veterans to get re-acquainted with the unique quirks of the franchise as well as for newcomers to understand why the series is so beloved. Jubei Yagyu's war against Nobunaga Oda will return on May 23rd on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>
What is a video game NPC, if not a scared creature that needs a bit of help? That's exactly what the just announced PANIK cuts right to the core of, and I've been charmed by it quite quickly. In PANIK, there are Panikers, which are a type of scared creature that are just so unbelievably anxious they cannot move from where they stand. This is where you come in, a, uh, well they didn't name the player character so I'll just keep saying you.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You, both the real you and this video game you, have to find different ways to get the Panikers to move. As the trailer quite deftly demonstrates, that might be as simple as moving right up to them on its simply designed but pleasing to look at isometric, square layout, calming them down instantly.

<p>This can even have a chain effect, as long as they all stand roughly adjacent to each other. Once they're calm enough to move themselves, you can guide them to specific chequered squares, which there might be more than one of. Fill them all up, and you've completed a level!
</p>
<p>
According to a press release, every Paniker you meet brings about a new mechanic, so you'll have to come up with new solutions every level. There's more than 100 of those, by the way, so it sounds like there's lots to dig your teeth into. Honestly PANIK is really giving me the vibe of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game you find and get sucked into during an IT lesson because who needs to learn about Excel again.
</p>
<p>
PANIK doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749610/PANIK/">Steam</a> here. Or, alternatively, if you fancy just a taste of it, you can try out an earlier version of it on <a href="https://chumasgames.itch.io/panik">itch.io</a>, which is quite good even if it's short!

It’s a lengthy explanation for what Bethesda itself defines as a remaster and why it chose to take the path that it has. As the developer thanked those who are playing Oblivion for the first time or revisiting it, it outright said it “never wanted to remake it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never wanted to remake it – but remaster it – where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today’s technology,” Bethesda explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio’s clarification arrives as fans not only (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-images-leak-from-developer-website">officially</a>) see Oblivion Remastered for the first time but also go hands-on, too. It’s out now, bringing visual changes across the board alongside a few fundamental gameplay tweaks. Highlights include the ability to sprint as well as a new level-up system that is being described as a cross between what was found in the original Oblivion and the process players saw in The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether it’s a new design for a sewer grate or a game-changing addition, the insurmountable number of tweaks has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake">many players feeling like Oblivion Remastered is more of a remake</a> than a simple fresh coat of paint. The last decade has indeed been polluted by video game remasters that mostly focus on minor visual improvements, but Bethesda is still hesitant to call its Oblivion re-release, which it started working on in 2021, a full-on remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We looked at every part and carefully upgraded it,” Bethesda continued. “But most of all, we never wanted to change the core. It’s still a game from a previous era and should feel like one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know many of our longtime fans will be thrilled to revisit Oblivion and the land of Cyrodiil. But there are also so many who have never played it. We can’t thank you enough for all the support you have given us and our games over the years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/opinion-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-hit-harder-than-skyrim-and-still-does<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ask most gamers who were around for the Xbox 360 and, Red Ring of Death aside, odds are most of them will share a lot of fond memories with you. And The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion generated plenty of those memories for a lot of Xbox 360 owners. I’m one of them. I worked at Official Xbox Magazine at the time, and for whatever reason, the hugely successful port of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to Xbox never quite hooked me. But right from the jump, Oblivion – which was initially planned to be a day-one launch title for the second Xbox – did. We did multiple cover stories on Oblivion leading up to launch – the screenshots alone blew everyone away – and I eagerly volunteered for each trip out to Bethesda in sleepy Rockville, Maryland. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, when it finally came time to review Oblivion – and this is back in the days when exclusive reviews were a common, accepted thing – I again eagerly jumped at the chance. I returned to Rockville one more time and holed up in a conference room in Bethesda’s basement for four days. I spent four consecutive – and glorious – 11-hour days almost literally living in Cyrodiil, spending almost every waking moment inside this stunning, wide-open, next-gen medieval fantasy world. Before I boarded my return flight home, I’d clocked 44 hours prior to penning OXM’s 9.5 out of 10 review of Oblivion, which I wholeheartedly stand by to this day. It was an incredible game, filled with gripping quests (Dark Brotherhood, anyone?), off-the-beaten-path surprises (if you know about the unicorn, you know), and so much more. Because I was playing a submission build at Bethesda – meaning, a mostly finished version of the game on an Xbox 360 debug kit rather than a regular retail console – I had to start over when I got my final boxed disc copy of the game I’d already put about two full real-life days into.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I dropped another 130 hours or so into The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion without hesitation,so it’s probably no surprise to hear that I’m absolutely thrilled it’s been remastered and re-released on modern platforms. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For the younger generation of gamers who grew up on Skyrim, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim first released.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, I’m envious of the whole generation of younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim and thus, that is The Elder Scrolls for them. Because for them, the just-released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered will be their first “new” mainline Elder Scrolls game since Skyrim released (for the first of many, many times) over 13 years ago – while franchise fans of all ages continue to wait for The Elder Scrolls VI, which is likely another 4-5 years away.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although if I’m being honest, I doubt Oblivion will hit the same way for them as it did for me in March of 2006, because, for starters, it’s a two-decade-old game (side note: shout-out to Bethesda for delivering this week instead of waiting an extra year when Oblivion will hit its far-more-elegant-sounding 20th anniversary instead of just having passed its 19th). Other games have built upon what Oblivion did, including several by Bethesda itself: Fallout 3, Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield. And second, it just doesn’t pack the same visual punch that it did in 2006, when I’d argue it was the first true <em>next-gen </em>game of the HD Era ushered in by the Xbox 360. Obviously the remaster looks better than the original release – that’s the point, of course – but it doesn’t stand head and shoulders above nearly every other game as something that you’ve never seen before. By definition – or at least in practice – remasters aim to make an older game look modern on current platforms. It’s a sharp contrast to a proper remake a la Resident Evil, which carries the expectation of starting from scratch and, in turn, looking as good or better than anything else on the market. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was the right game at the right time. By taking full advantage of HD televisions and expanding the scope and scale of what gamers could expect from an open-world game, it was a punch in the face to console gamers who, up to that point, had spent their entire gaming lives seeing their interactive worlds through an interlaced 640x480 television. (Although speaking of punches in the face, prior to Oblivion’s March release, in February 2006, EA released Fight Night Round 3, which was jaw-droppingly gorgeous itself.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My memories of Oblivion are plenty, as it was a world with so much to discover and so much to do. For first-time Oblivion players, let me give you a recommendation: either blast through the main quest as quickly as possible, or save it until you’ve exhausted every last sidequest or open-world activity. Why? Well, the Oblivion gates will start randomly spawning and pestering you once you start down that main questline’s path, so for my money it’s best to seal them off straight away. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, the technological leap made from Morrowind to Oblivion might not ever happen again – though I suppose if we wait long enough for The Elder Scrolls 6, maybe it will. But at the very least, playing Oblivion Remastered won’t present such a staunch difference from any release of Skyrim, and for that I suppose those same younger gamers who grew up with Skyrim won’t get what I had. But no matter if you’re playing Oblivion for the first time or you’ve clocked hundreds of hours with it, its fully realized medieval fantasy world and the surprises and adventures contained within it have always made it my favorite Elder Scrolls game. And I’m thrilled it’s back, even if its surprise release was spoiled many times over before it finally showed up again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

Its goal is to remake the 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion entirely within The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's game engine. It's an impressive effort that has been in the works for several years. In February, TESRenewal suggested that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">could be released this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-bethesda-microsoft-bds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a move equal parts surprising and totally expected (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23880264/bethesda-oblivion-dishonored-3-fallout-3-leaked-documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for literal years</a>), Microsoft shadow-dropped its not-so-secret <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster today. Cool, great. Also, it does not need to exist, and you do not need to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft, Bethesda, and Virtuos’ remaster of <em>Oblivion </em>is perhaps one of the least necessary in history considering the 19-year-old RPG’s still-active modding scene, a hallmark of Bethesda’s lineage that will always put its games at odds with the idea of a remaster. The most visible effort sprouting from this verdant, bloom-lit landscape is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Skyblivion</em></a>, a fan remake of <em>Oblivion </em>inside <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>. After over a decade in development, <em>Skyblivion </em>is set to release… later this year. In a show of grace, the <em>Skyblivion </em>team <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skyblivion.com/post/3ln3xolvwg22j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a statement</a> a few days before the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster’s official reveal:</p><blockquote><p>We want to emphasize that there is no need for comparisons or a sense of competition between <em>Skyblivion </em>and a potential official remaster. Both projects can exist and thrive together, offering unique experiences for players. <em>Skyblivion </em>is a labor of love, built by a dedicated community for the community, offering a distinct way to revisit <em>Oblivion </em>within the familiar framework of the Creation Engine. Similarly, an official remaster would undoubtedly bring its own set of advancements with the full funding of a development studio. We see this not as a conflict, but as a fantastic opportunity for <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to have even more ways to enjoy the classic world of Cyrodiil.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This still raises the question of why Microsoft and Bethesda deemed the remaster necessary, the answer to which is obviously money. And regardless – or precisely because – of how it impacts the companies’ almighty balance sheet, there’s simply not a good reason to buy a shiny, $50 version of this specific game that you probably already own. As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written about previously</a>, Microsoft now finds itself in the crosshairs of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for its glaringly apparent complicity in Israel’s ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, especially where its Azure cloud services are concerned.&nbsp;</p><p>"To pressure Microsoft, boycott Microsoft’s consumer products whenever possible (including Microsoft gaming services), demand your institutions divest from Microsoft, and exclude the company from contracts," <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft#why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reads the movement’s page</a> on Microsoft, which it has declared a "priority target."</p><p>As a reporter, I recognize the inevitable complexities that arise when choosing whether to engage with works produced by systems and companies that are exploitative or, in this case, worse. I imagine that I, personally, will be forced to spend more time and energy agonizing over exactly how to cover future Microsoft releases – and I will feel grateful, on those occasions, that I’m working for a publication with the support necessary to stand by its convictions and write about games critically rather than as simple products.</p><p>But beyond that, purely from a consumer’s perspective, this one’s easy! <em>Oblivion </em>is almost two decades old. And in addition to the modding scene I mentioned above, which essentially allows the original game to self-revitalize on a regular basis, this remaster is coming out during a new-release avalanche. In the past month or so alone, we’ve gotten: <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Schedule 1</em></a>, <em>Runescape: Dragonwilds</em>, <em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>, <em>Lost Records: Bloom And Rage</em>,<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wanderstop</em></a>, <em>Atomfall</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/two-point-museum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a>, and so many others that it’s nearly impossible to keep track.</p><p>None of those scratch the <em>Oblivion </em>itch? Pick up one of the dozens of interesting indies inspired by old-school Bethesda games, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a>, whose gleefully alien worldbuilding puts recent Bethesda fare to shame. It only has a few thousand Steam reviews. You probably missed it when it came out last year. You probably missed hundreds of good games when they came out last year – and the year before, and the year before.</p><p>Everybody is posting about the <em>Oblivion </em>remaster today, and over 100,000 people are playing it on Steam. But in a couple days – probably when the review embargo lifts on the next big game that’s about to come out, realistic France simulator <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> – they’ll stop. That’s one of the few upsides of living through this era of Peak Media: Whatever your reasons, be they budget or boycott, you can always just skip the thing everybody is talking about. Give it a day or two, and there will inevitably be something else.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom"><h3>Fine, I’ll Play Star Wars XCOM</h3></a><p>It's got permadeath, and that's enough for me</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-10/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There are more than 100 notes to find in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, and it's worth your time to seek out all of them beyond just doing it to get the achievement.</p>
<p>Arguably, the storytelling in South of Midnight is its strongest aspect, and each note adds strong context to the storytelling that would otherwise be missed. Of course, you can still have a great time with the story if you didn't find all of them, but the experience is so much more enhanced if you do.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find all of the notes hidden in Chapter 10.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Thankfully, it's easy to clear all the notes in Chapter 10 as there are only five to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hope's Crossing Homecoming</strong> - Soon after the first combat encounter of the level, you'll reach a point where you'll see a hole for Crouton to enter to your right. Go left instead, and you'll find this note and a Floof knot waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sleep and Smoke</strong> - After Crouton grabs your first Spindle, grapple across the gap and stick to the right past some exploding mushrooms. This note will be on the wall as blue art in the broken house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Close Call</strong> - After interacting with the first firefly tree, follow the strands left and see a set of echo stairs to enter an old house. Enter the house and you'll find this note on the wall to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Grand Wedding</strong> - From the first firefly tree, go right and turn right again when you reach a bushel of exploding bramble. Directly ahead, you should see a grapple point leading to a broken-down house, where you'll find this note on the wall on the left.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Flower Child</strong> - Once you're inside Honey's home, you'll find this final note on the back wall of his cave.</p>
<p>That's where all five notes are found in Chapter 10. What's especially helpful here is that most of these notes are on the main path anyway; you just have to pay attention to the walls around you as they're all notes in the form of the blue art that's seen throughout South of Midnight.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 74 notes out of 103. Only 29 more to go.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-updates-magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets.1170807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-updates-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Changes are coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Commander ban list. Wizards of the Coast's new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-takes-over-commander-format-following-abuse-to-rules-committee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">format panel</a> has announced changes to the most popular way to play the acclaimed card game. In addition, changes are coming to its Game Changers brackets.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/commander-bans-and-restrictions-april-22-2025" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast's Gavein Verhey updated the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list. Like all prior ban list updates, these changes are in response to changes in the competitive meta of the game and are done to facilitate engaging, ongoing matchups.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-sway-of-the-stars-card-artwork.jpg?itok=fwdBUvKU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-sway-of-the-stars-card-artwork.jpg?itok=iuvD08x0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To that end, five cards are being removed from the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list. Yes, these five cards are Commander-legal again. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Gifts Ungiven</em></li>
	<li><em>Sway of the Stars</em></li>
	<li><em>Braids, Cabal Minion</em></li>
	<li><em>Coalition Victory</em></li>
	<li><em>Panoptic Mirror</em></li>
</ul><p>The post continues, explaining the reason for these unbannings. <em>Sway of the Stars</em>, while a potent reset option, has too high of a mana cost compared to other more impactful effects. Similarly, <em>Coalition Victory</em> takes too much time to set up. It is an auto-win if you have one of every color, but simply removing one of those lands from the field means eight mana spent for nothing.</p>

<p>These <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list changes occurred alongside changes to the Game Changers bracket system. In <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/commander-brackets-beta-update-april-22-2025" rel="nofollow">another blog post</a>, Verhey explained the connections between the ban list and these updated brackets.</p>

<p>Generally, the Game Changers bracket is a list of cards that have a huge impact on play. These cards are broken up into five brackets, each one denoting different levels of competitive play. Bracket one, Exhibition, is casual play. Bracket five, CEDH, is highly competitive and built with the current meta in mind. The system is currently in beta and still receiving player feedback.</p>

<p>It is thanks to the (mostly positive) feedback that Wizards of the Coast is making some slight adjustments to what cards are in what brackets. Two cards are being removed from the list: <em>Trouble in Pairs</em> and Trinisphere. Alternatively, eighteen cards are being added to Game Changers. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Teferi's Protection</em></li>
	<li><em>Humility</em></li>
	<li><em>Narset, Parter of Veils</em></li>
	<li><em>Intuition</em></li>
	<li><em>Consecrated Sphinx</em></li>
	<li><em>Necropotence</em></li>
	<li><em>Orcish Bowmasters</em></li>
	<li><em>Notion Thief</em></li>
	<li><em>Deflecting Swat</em></li>
	<li><em>Gamble</em></li>
	<li><em>Worldly Tutor</em></li>
	<li><em>Crop Rotation</em></li>
	<li><em>Seedborn Muse</em></li>
	<li><em>Natural Order</em></li>
	<li><em>Food Chain</em></li>
	<li><em>Aura Shards</em></li>
	<li><em>Field of the Dead</em></li>
	<li><em>Mishra's Workshop</em></li>
</ul><p>These Game Changers brackets are not official ban lists for any format of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. They are intended to give players a rough estimation of how competitive their built deck is. If you want to play more casually, brackets 1-3 are just fine. If you expect to enter any major tournaments however, brackets 4-5 is your floor.</p>

In a free world, all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> heroes would be playable no matter how annoying they might be to face off against because sometimes them's the breaks. We don't live in a free world though, not anymore at least, as <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24178102/a-new-mode-new-hero-and-new-rules-in-season-16/">Overwatch 2 season 16 starts today</a>. Most notably it's introducing its new mode Stadium, but also something that'll change up the competitive aspect of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> quite a bit: hero bans.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This isn't like something in your local fighting game tournament where one TO just really has it out for Marth or whatever and has decided no one can play as them, it's a built in feature. Before you jump into a match of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, either side will be able to vote to ban up to four heroes from play. Both sides get to vote for two, and no more than two per role can be banned. 
</p>
<p>
An official blog post says this is to "add an extra layer of mind games before the real fighting begins", though your mileage may vary depending on who you play with. It does seem like a good way to mix up the meta at least, but as with all new features I'm sure it'll see some tweaks further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Of course, as mentioned, season 16 also introduces Stadium, a new third-person mode where you're locked into one hero, vying to win the best of seven rounds. Game director Aaron Keller recently described the mode as Overwatch's third pillar in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch/559233/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-blizzard-interview">Polygon</a>, so expect this one to be heavily promoted for a while.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new DPS hero, Freja, who has a fancy cross bow and can move around real fast like. Skins wise, Juno is getting a Dokiwatch-themed mythic skin, Overwatch's take on the magical girl genre, and there's some heavy-metal themed skins for characters like Ashe and Lifeweaver. You know, the usual Overwatch seasonal stuff!

While playing with some friends, the group encountered some “rando” players. </p><p>About 3 minutes [later] a video appeared on my screen,” claimed Tado422. “I have never seen this before but it took up the whole screen. It was a Russian pop video or something that played for 20 seconds or so. Most of us were talking in chat about what the heck was happening.”</p><p>Tado422 further explained that, shortly after the first video, a second video appeared. This one showed a man entering a store and shooting people in the head. </p><p>“At this moment I freaked out and hard closed out of <em>StarCraft 2</em>. My 5 year old daughter was in the room with me, half paying attention to me playing a video game. This is beyond unacceptable. I should never have to worry about seeing people murdered or porn while playing a <em>SC2 </em>game.”</p><p>Tad0422's post blew up on Reddit and led to many other <em>SC2 </em>players sharing their stories about similar hackers injecting annoying or graphic videos while people are playing the game. I reached out to Tado422 and they shared with me a replay of the match that was hacked by someone. They also made it clear that this isn’t an issue with the Arcade map they were playing or the creator of that mode. It appears to be a larger exploit within <em>StarCraft 2</em>'s Arcade Mode. You can find others reporting similar incidents with screenshots, too. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>404Media</em></a></span>, some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players shared stories</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing swastikas</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">while playing</a></span>.

The $50 remaster launched the same day it was announced on Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, PS5, and PC. The remastered RPG features improved visuals, new gameplay options, and a long list of quality-of-life changes. But, it’s still a Bethesda game, which means you can likely expect bugs, wonky elements, and some general roughness and weirdness. Normally, this stuff gets fixed by modders shortly after release and Bethesda supports those efforts with official tools.

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier today, fans of The Elder Scrolls were delighted not only to officially learn of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-new-and-different-in-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>'s existence, but also that the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/"> game is available now on consoles and PC</a>. However, those who watched the Bethesda livestream who aren't familiar with Cyrodiil and its inhabitants may have had a question: Who the heck was that Adoring Fan?</p><p dir="ltr">In Oblivion, the Adoring Fan is a commoner who lives in the Imperial City and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEL4X8fZViU">lavishes praise on you</a> once they become the Grand Champion in the Arena. He's technically a "Follower" in that he'll follow you around the world, but unlike other Followers, his contribution to combat is to run and hide from enemies--which sometimes attracts more in the process.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751"></a><figcaption>The Adoring Fan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Adoring Fan has gained notoriety in the Elder Scrolls community due to his zealous devotion to following the player around, which can lead to some hilarious situations--if you tell him to leave you alone while standing on top of a mountain, for example, the Fan heads back to the Imperial City via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRi6GBF5zB0&amp;pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv">most direct route possible</a>. He's so notorious, in fact, that Bethesda created a successor to the Adoring Fan in Starfield, though the spacefaring version can only be recruited if you choose the "Hero Worshipped" trait.</p><p dir="ltr">The Oblivion remaster retains much of what made the 2006 RPG so beloved, including the silly bits of dialogue that players still remember today. The remaster was developed by Virtuos Studio, built using Unreal Engine 5, and includes 4K resolution, 60-frames-per second performance, and dynamic time-of-day and weather effects, among other improvements.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is available now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It has also been added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog of downloadable titles.</p>

This includes the class system, which allows you to further customize your character by giving them a specific specialization. The class you choose also determines your favored attributes and the major skills your character has access to. While you can create a custom class that suits your exact needs in Cyrodiil, the preset classes offer some great options.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available classes in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered as well as our picks for the best overall classes in each of the three categories. If you want a more in-depth look at the classes or a broad overview of the game altogether, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full walkthrough of Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><h2 id="All_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">All Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>There are three main categories that every class in the game falls into, and each category features seven classes. This gives you a total of 21 classes to choose from. You're able to choose your class after you make your way through the Sanctum area in the tutorial of Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>The class you choose should largely be based on the race and Birthsign you selected earlier in the game, and you'll initially be recommended a class based on those choices. However, you don't have to choose that class or even choose a class in the same category. You're entirely free to make a jack-of-all-trades character that can wreak all sorts of havoc throughout Cyrodiil.</p><p>Here's a list of all 21 classes in Oblivion Remastered:</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><ul><li>Warrior</li><li>Barbarian</li><li>Crusader</li><li>Knight</li><li>Archer</li><li>Scout</li><li>Rogue</li></ul><p><strong>Mage</strong></p><ul><li>Mage</li><li>Sorcerer</li><li>Battlemage</li><li>Healer</li><li>Spellsword</li><li>Witchhunter</li><li>Nightblade</li></ul><p><strong>Stealth</strong></p><ul><li>Thief</li><li>Agent</li><li>Acrobat</li><li>Assassin</li><li>Monk</li><li>Pilgrim</li><li>Bard</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730"></a><figcaption>You're able to edit your class and other character options before the tutorial ends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png"></figure><p>Your initial class choice can be altered before you leave the Sewers in Oblivion Remastered. Right as you go through the exit door, you're able to change your class, Birthsign, and other character identity options. So if you don't like your class within the first few minutes of testing it, you can change it before you get out into the world of Oblivion.</p><h2 id="Best_Combat_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Combat Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Now that we've reviewed all the classes in each category, it's time to determine which one is the best in each category. First up is the Combat category, which is mainly going to feature your attack-focused classes. The classes in Combat represent two forms of combat, melee and ranged, as well as some subclasses based around those combat types.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735"></a><figcaption>The Combat classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png"></figure><p>If you're a beginner in Oblivion Remastered and you're just looking to stick with a basic class, choose from these three: <strong>Warrior, Archer, Rogue</strong>. These are classic RPG classes, and they focus on a specific playstyle that's easy to grasp.</p><p>The Warrior excels in hand-to-hand combat while wearing heavy armor and has plenty of strength and endurance. You'll mainly wield a melee weapon with a shield, unless you're using a two-handed weapon, like a Battle Axe, and your character will always be able to tank some hits from enemies before you need a healing potion.</p><p>As for the Archer class, this utilizes a bow and arrows to attack enemies from range. Light and medium armor are your friends, so you can keep your stamina up to fire off more shots. You could also choose the Rogue class if you want to use a bow, but Rogues generally use light melee weapons and attack from the shadows. Rogues also excel in thievery and talking their way out of sticky situations while in dialogue.</p><p>While those are the basic Combat classes to pick, if you want something more advanced, go with either<strong> the</strong><strong> Crusader or the Knight</strong>. The Crusader is granted the ability to heal yourself and allies while still wielding large melee weapons, giving you the option to use a couple of playstyles simultaneously. The Knight also uses melee weapons, but they specialize in persuasion through the personality attribute.</p><p>Combat is arguably the most basic of the three categories of classes in Oblivion Remastered, but there are some great options here for beginners and veterans.</p><h2 id="Best_Magic_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Magic Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>As you might expect, the Magic category is all about the art of magicka in Oblivion Remastered. These classes are centered around all forms of magicka, but you'll also gain some bonuses in alchemy for any potions you want to brew down the line.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741"></a><figcaption>The Magic classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png"></figure><p>Arguably the best class in Magic is <strong>Spellsword</strong>, which is also one of the best attacking classes in the game. You gain access to a number of offensive magic skills, including Destruction, Illusion, and Alteration, as well as the Blade and Block skills. Spellswords also have proficiency in heavy armor, which isn't common for a magic class.</p><p>While you'll want to stick with magicka a majority of the time, these skills do allow the Spellsword to whip out a melee weapon every now and again during close range encounters. The <strong>Nightblade</strong> class also features some of these characteristics, but is more of a glass cannon due to its proficiencies in light armor and acrobatics. Of course, if you like light armor more than heavy armor, the Nightblade might be the way to go.</p><p>If neither Spellsword nor Nightblade excites you, then the next best options are <span>either<strong> Sorcerer</strong></span><strong> or Mage</strong>. Both of these classes are a little more on the generic side of things when it comes to magicka, but they're both incredibly powerful. The Mage has access to most forms of magicka in Oblivion Remastered, while the Sorcerer utilizes heavy armor and alchemy to reliably stay healthy.</p><p>The Mage is more of a veteran class choice, while the Sorcerer is better for beginners, but both are viable if you're looking to solely deal damage with magicka.</p><h2 id="Best_Stealth_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Stealth Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the most versatile set of classes in Oblivion Remastered. The Stealth category mainly focuses on the melee and ranged combat types, but the classes themselves offer a number of different benefits outside of combat. You'll gain skills in acrobatics, sneak, speed, speechcraft, and more that make life easier when exploring Cyrodiil and interacting with its many inhabitants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743"></a><figcaption>The Stealth classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png"></figure><p>In our opinion, the two best classes in Stealth are <strong>Assassin and Thief</strong>. Both are somewhat similar in regard to what attributes and skills you gain, but the Assassin focuses more on combat, while the Thief is a class useful for dealing with NPCs and exploration.</p><p>The Assassin class features speed and intelligence as its favored attributes, gaining skills in sneak, acrobatics, light armor, marksman, alchemy, blade, and security. You'll be able to sneak efficiently, deal damage from afar or up close with great precision, and even partake in some alchemy right out of the gate. With how powerful sneaking and ranged combat is in Oblivion Remastered, Assassin just might be the best overall class in the game.</p><p>However, if you're more worried about exploration rather than the combat, the Thief needs to be your pick. Its favored attributes are speed and agility, while it adds the speechcraft and mercantile skills in exchange for blade and alchemy from the Assassin's list of skills. The speechcraft and mercantile come in especially handy when dealing with NPCs during exploration or quests, which can save you a ton of time in the long run.</p><p>If neither Assassin nor Thief floats your boat, though, go with the <strong>Pilgrim or the Bard</strong>. Bards are arguably the best class for persuasion and dealing with NPCs, and the Pilgrim is a great all-around class for either melee or ranged combat as well as exploration.</p>

            <p>
After years of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaks</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Bethesda's Oblivion remaster is finally here</a> and it's already going down a storm - if its place at the top of Steam's best-sellers list is any indication. However, Bethesda has now shared one bit of potentially disappointing news, confirming there'll be no official mod support for its fancy new Oblivion.
</p>
<p>
Bethesda has, of course, long been a strong proponent of the modding scene - part of the reason many of its games have remained so popular years after their launch - going as far as to release official modding tools, AKA Creation Kits, for the likes of Skyrim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>. That won't be the case for Bethesda's newly shadow-dropped Oblivion remaster, however, with the developer <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">confirming the news in an FAQ on its website</a>, simply writing, "Mods are not supported for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered."
</p>
<p>
That's potentially disappointing for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 players, especially given the increasing number of Bethesda titles able to access curated mods on consoles in recent years, but what this means for PC players - if anything - is a little unclear. Modders are currently poking around the Oblivion remake's innards to see what's what under its fancy Unreal Engine 5 hat, with one redditor having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k5c32e/oblivion_remake_is_infact_just_as_moddable_as_the/">already discovered the remaster's files can be opened in the original The Elder Scrolls Construction Set</a>. The lack of official modding tools might slow things down a bit, then, but maybe not for long.

<p>
But mods or no mods, interest in Bethesda's Oblivion remaster is clearly high. It had <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts">reached the top of Steam's best-sellers list</a> within an hour of release (it's currently enjoying a Very Positive rating on Valve's platform, with seemingly minimal complaints so far) and that's with its £50 price tag. It's also available as part of a Game Pass subscription on Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>
One group that won't be forking out for the remaster, however, is the team behind the Skyblivion fan modding project, which has spent the last few years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine</a>. It recently confirmed Bethesda's official remaster "changes nothing" as far as its own release plans go - and it took to social media earlier today, revealing Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914751791381495955">had just given game keys to the entire modding team</a>.

			<p>Astrolabe Interactive announced that the studio's co-op sandbox survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/aloft-by-astrolabe-interactive-scheduled-to-launch-into-early-access-on-january-15th/">Aloft</a> has surpassed 200,000 copies sold in early access since its launch in January 2025.</p>
<p>Astrolabe has partnered with <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/act-now/stream-for-cool-earth/">Cool Earth</a> to celebrate the milestone and will donate 5% of the revenue it earned during the Earth Appreciation Festival on Steam to the Cool Earth Initiative. Astrolabe and Cool Earth are also working with content creators and streamers to stream Aloft today, livestreaming the game in charity streams, and the proceeds will also go to the Cool Earth Initiative.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is an organization working to protect the world's rainforests and support the indigenous peoples who have been living and working with them, instead of against them, for generations.</p>
<p>In a press release, Astrolabe's creative director, Manuel Bergeron, discussed how Cool Earth's work and Earth Day directly relate to what Astrolabe wanted players to learn when playing Aloft.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">One of our goals in Aloft was to offer a chance for players to learn about the fragile balance of ecosystems and have a direct positive impact on their environment</span>. <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">It's our honor to contribute to the environment by giving to the Cool Earth Initiative.</span></em>"</p>
<p>Aloft's first major update in early access, Critters and Wonders, launched this past March. According to the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/543345713449272665?l=english">roadmap</a> for 2025, more major content updates and plenty of feature improvements are planned for the year, though specific release dates or windows around when that'll be have yet to be announced.</p>
