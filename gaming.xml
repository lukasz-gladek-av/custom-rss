The change will allow Xbox controllers to easily access the Task View on Windows 11 to tab between apps and games, using the Xbox button.</p><p>“A new change we’re introducing is when you long press the Xbox button, it will open Task View,” explains Microsoft’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/09/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6682-dev-channel/">Windows Insider team</a>. “Pressing and holding the Xbox button continues to turn off the game controller.”</p><p>The change will align Xbox controllers with the work Microsoft is doing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">handheld gaming PCs with Windows 11</a>. The upcoming Xbox Ally devices will have an Xbox button, which opens a handheld-friendly task switcher with a long press. Microsoft has tweaked the task switcher on handhelds so it has new animations, and it’s not clear if this same interface will come to all Windows 11 gaming PCs.</p><p>You can already use a single press of the Xbox button on handhelds or controllers to open the Game Bar in Windows 11, and access widgets, games, and performance information.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>MicroProse has announced that it will be publishing Darkenstein 3D, a throwback to 90s first person shooters, and that the game will be available for free from October 21st. The game has been inspired by the likes of Wolfenstein, Doom, Enemy Territory, and Quake 3, with Darkenstein 3D putting you in the boots of American drifter Hobo Guy who has somehow ended up fighting Nazis after they kidnapped his dog.</p>
<p><iframe title="Darkenstein 3D | MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oorwB_xHoGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Darkenstein 3D will have 13 levels to play through, a variety of weapons to use against enemies with the shotgun being the primary, fast paced combat where you need to keep moving to survive, and a rat companion that has a thirst for blood. The levels will vary in style too and include castles, deserts, bunkers and valleys to navigate and shoot your way through.</p>
<p><em>“I spent years immersed in games like Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Enemy Territory, making maps for the latter as well as Quake 3. Darkenstein 3D is my way of bringing that same fast, chaotic energy back. It is a raw shooter that lives between the first FPS classics like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D and the modern era. Louder, bloodier, silly, and built to be played hard.”</em>&nbsp;said Rowye, creator of&nbsp;<em>Darkenstein 3D</em>.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2195910/Darkenstein_3D/">Darkenstein 3D demo</a> available to play on Steam, and currently it looks like the game is only going to be released on PC for now via Steam, GOG, itch.io.</p>

            <p>Some weeks, finding new games for the Maw is like scouring a village of octogenarians for the last remaining virgin to throw into a rumbling volcano. You awkwardly pop the question during a dozen hastily organised afternoon tea dates, and riffle through family trees in desperation as the air thickens with sulphur.</p>
<p>This week, it's like the mountainside has been invaded by a horde of teenage firebugs. Stop shoving! Form an orderly queue! You are going to give the volcano <em>constipation</em>. Here's a moderately curated round-up of the most promising specimens. May they burn brightly and stave off the magma for at least another seven days.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> developers Gearbox have chucked more wrenches at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>'s PC performance over the weekend, following issues that've landed it mixed Steam review fortunes since launch last week. However, if you're looking for patch notes, you're gonna be a bit disappointed. Ah well, at least there are essay-length Randy Pitchford Twitter threads to scroll through if you're partial to someone waffling about how the game runs.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Initially, Gearbox's response to the PC performance problems was to publish a massive recommended settings table. Our James had a go at seeing if following it made a tangible difference. While you can and should <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-the-new-recommended-settings-for-borderlands-4-and-oh-no-they-dont-actually-fix-its-stuttering">read his full testing write-up </a>, the short version is that the stuttering many players have reported wasn't magically wiped away by that guidance.
</p>
<p>Cue this latest update, which as Gearbox <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802578411?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>, aims to "help improve stability for a wide range of PCs". Unlike most patches, they declined to get into any nitty-gritty specifics beyond that. There's a warning that whenever you change your graphics settings, it can take up to 15 minutes for your shaders to recompile, as well as a reposting of those optimisation guides for <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/nvidia-optimization/">Nvidia</a> and <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/amd-optimization/">AMD</a> hardware.</p>
<p>Aside from those, the studio added: "We’re continuing to read your feedback, planning additional updates and will have more details to come". So, no bullet-pointed patch notes to illustrate exactly how the update's gone about trying to make things run in a more stable fashion, which seems a strange choice and has understandably raised eyebrows among <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngje07/borderlands_4_update_notes/">some</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ngdo16/bl4_new_patch_steam/">players</a>.</p><p>Who needs full patch notes, however, when you've got Gearbox CEO yammering into the void about Borderlands 4 on the socials. He has at least emphasised that the studio are putting in "significant work on PC performance". Though, that did come midway through an essay-length thread that began with the declaration: "Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Every PC gamer must accept the reality of the relationship between their hardware and what the software they are running is doing.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>After shouting at anyone who's assumed that PCs between minimum and recommended specs "can achieve all of extremely high frame rate, maximum/ultra features, and extremely high resolution", the tweetman asserted that "there are a few real issues, but they are affecting a very, very small percentage of users."</p><p>

In other Borderlands 4 launch-related news, publishers Take-Two took the opportunity to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-no-spyware-in-borderlands-4-take-two-insist-following-upset-over-terms-of-service">reiterate they aren't in the "spyware" business</a> via the game's terms of service agreement. That followed some concern over the contents of such Take-Two docs in terms of data collection earlier this year, with some older Borderlandses <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-is-the-latest-battleground-for-steam-review-bombing-but-the-justification-is-extremely-flimsy/">briefly being review-bombed</a>.

Fox <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a>. "From last time's updates, you guys have access to exactly how long each step of the development took. Anyway, we don't have any external factors surrounding the release date this time. We'll release it when it's done, and we will continue to update you guys on the progress of its completion. Thanks!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox also took the opportunity to describe exactly where in the development cycle Deltarune Chapter 5 is, revealing that the "early parts" are complete, albeit needing a little polish. The last "40%-or-so" is in a "rough first pass state, and the last 10% is in a prototyping state."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Probably around 85% of cutscenes have been created up to a first draft state, however, of those at least 20% or so will require more polish," Fox said, adding that regular enemies are mostly done, with at least one programmer already working on the regular enemy bullet patterns of Chapter 6. The "direction of the boss battles" has been decided, and boss attacks have already been planned and completed.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/hirogami-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hirogami-review.1297881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Hirogami is an origami platformer. What that means is that much of the world around you is made of paper, folded into elaborate shapes, and so are you. In fact, you can fold yourself into a variety of animal themed shapes to help you navigate your way through Hirogami’s levels, puzzles, and fights. But is it worth taking a gamble on, or should you just…fold?</p>
<p><iframe title="Hirogami | Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC &amp; PS5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LBclwM6DNzo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hiro is a little origami person who used to be able to fold himself into other forms. Unfortunately, he lost this ability when coming into contact with the blight that is ravaging the landscape, corrupting temples and animals alike. Now Hiro is stuck in his cool-origami-figure-with-a-cape self, so his self confidence isn’t great. Nevertheless, he’s still tasked with cleansing some corrupted temples and, whilst doing so, discovers that cleansing a corrupted animal will reawaken some of his missing power, allowing him to fold himself into the shape of that animal.</p>


<p>In addition to his humanoid form and just being a piece of paper, which is more useful than you might think, there are four animals you can shift into once you defeat them in-game. The armadillo can roll up into a ball and roll forward very quickly, handy for destroying obstacles and enemies alike, the frog can jump higher than all the other forms as well as spit sticky saliva at enemies, and the gorilla can smash things and swing on vines. The fourth form, the bird, only happens during certain gameplay sequences, and functions more like a fighter jet, complete with a boost and ranged attacks somehow.</p>


<p>You’ll be switching in and out of these forms regularly. The way it works I think is quite brilliant, with you holding the right trigger to flatten yourself into a simple piece of paper, then pressing a face button to refold yourself into your chosen form. Whilst you’re a piece of paper, you can also fit through tight gaps, float through the air, and ride up drafts. It’s a smart little bit of design, but it does have a few finicky little bits that get in the way. The most common one is that, when you’re unfolding into paper as you’re approaching something you need to break, you often find a corner of your now rectangular self goes under a little bit of scenery, which blocks you from transforming and forces you to back up again so you have space to transform. It’s a tiny little thing, but it happens so often and breaks the flow of the platforming.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the platforming is a bit simple anyway, so it starts to get repetitive after a few hours, especially once you’ve already unlocked all the animal forms. It’s a lot of fun initially, and switching between the forms multiple times to make it through a section can be very satisfying, but with the few control difficulties getting in the way, the challenge not really ramping up enough, and much of the stuff you’re doing being things you’ve done in other, more accomplished platformers, it just starts to get a little old after a while.</p>
<p>Combat is the same, but with one or two poorly considered enemies. One enemy just triggers a damaging shield when you get close, which it is happy to keep up for an extended period of time and retrigger almost immediately as you approach, making it a very annoying enemy to deal with. I’ve found that the best tactic in combat is to roll up into a ball as an armadillo and just charge into everything, both because it’s effective and because it’s good, chaotic fun – when there aren’t shielded enemies in the way, forcing me to switch to a frog and spit at them before I can hit them.</p>

<p>What doesn’t help either the combat or the platforming is the camera, though. It tries to frame the action on its own, without giving you control beyond tilting the camera, and that means the perspective can change from a pseudo third person view, &nbsp;to side scrolling, to awkward angles that feel slightly askew and make platforming a little more difficult to judge. There was one moment where the camera fully swung through the scenery as I was entering a new area, completely blocking the character and level from view, my only option was to continue going forward and hope it worked itself out before I hit a hazard or enemy, which it thankfully did. Similar things can happen during combat, where you can find yourself obscured by scenery, making it difficult to dodge incoming armadillos and apes. This fixed camera is at best inconvenient, but at its worst it can be an issue resulting in death.</p>
<p>One area where there is little to criticise is the aesthetic of the game. It’s gorgeous, whether you’re on the tilt-shift heavy overworld map or in one of the levels – it’s a very good looking game whichever way you look at it. What is a bit disappointing is the music, not because it isn’t good, but because there isn’t enough of it. The soundtrack repeats quite a bit and is often at odds with what’s going on in game. There shouldn’t be whimsical, happy music while I’m dealing with a giant lake of lava, for example. It just doesn’t feel right.</p>

<p>There are some oddities with how the game is presented as well. Levels are usually in a chain, at the end of the first level you can see the next area where you’ll be going to next, but it cuts to the overworld map after a brief chat or cutscene. Then you go start the next level, and you can see the end of the previous level, and you’re now in the next area, but for some reason you had to go to the world map to get here. It’s just a little strange. Another odd aspect is when you’re cleansing corrupted temples and altars. You have to go find a macguffin that is usually at the end of some platforming sequence, or a fight, or just something, but one or two just…aren’t. Just climb up a vine and there it is, no challenge involved. It just feels odd.</p>

<figure><a title="Borderlands 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4e6c7f186c7aa/borderlands-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: 2K</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest UK charts data is in and the newly-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> has performed admirably, hitting the number 1 spot ahead of both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, we still have a couple more weeks or so to wait until the Switch 2 release, with Borderlands 4 scheduled to launch on <strong>3rd October</strong> on Nintendo's new console. It's difficult to say whether this early momentum spells good news for the Switch 2 release, but we'd wager the game probably won't sell half as much as it has on the PS5 (which commands 80% of the platform split).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> received its physical release, and although it's sitting fairly low down at number 25, the platform split just about favours the Switch at 52%. Jolly good.</p>
<p>That's a brief overview of the numbers, but here's the full top 40, with platform breakdowns for games available on Switch, Switch 2, and other consoles:</p>

            <p>
Balatro was set to receive a 1.1 update this year, but its solo developer LocalThunk has pushed it back in order to preserve his "hobbyist" approach to game development.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/im-slow">statement titled "I'm slow"</a>, the developer apologised for the delay, adding he "probably shouldn't have announced any date". "I feel bad for not keeping that promise, and I am sorry," he said.
</p>
<p>
Since release, LocalThunk has been crunching alone on a balance patch and a mobile port, before taking some time out and then beginning 1.1 work slowly this year. "However, I chose to only work on the game like I did when the project began, as a hobbyist," he said, "and it turns out that it's a lot slower than working in crunch mode 12 hours per day like I was around launch."

<p>
LocalThunk said the prospect of rushing the work "felt terrible". "I am working slowly, but I like it that way," he said.
</p>
<p>
"I have never, before Balatro, set a deadline for any of my creative projects and I now realise how important that is for my process," he continued. "I am in a very lucky position in that I can choose to work this job however I wish, and I think the best version of 'work' for me is the version that makes me want to come back to my keyboard every day, healthy, and hopefully just as excited about game development 5 years from now as I am today. I don't want 1.1 to be the last update this game gets."
</p>
<p>
As such, the 1.1 update will be "done when it's done", and will be available for free across all platforms. It just won't be this year.
</p>
<p>
He concluded: "The Balatro player in me will absolutely not allow me walk away from developing this game...Rest assured, it will happen."
</p>
<p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-wins-formal-appeal-to-reclassify-poker-game-as-pegi-12">shaky start with ratings boards</a>, Balatro has gone on to find phenomenal success. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/100-completing-balatro-has-developer-better-equipped-to-design-the-next-big-update">LocalThunk has 100 percent completed his own game</a>, which has "equipped" him to better design the next update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Testing on the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started</a> via the BF Labs platform last week, and thanks to YouTube user Tomski, we've already got a 15-minute leaked gameplay video to check out. The first impression isn't exactly great, as this looks too much like Call of Duty's Warzone, according to most fans.  Of course, that may change when they actually get to play it.</p>



<p>One of the defining features of the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode is supposed to be destruction, which has been more or less synonymous with the franchise ever since the release of 2008's Bad Company. Beyond that, the mode retains Battlefield's trademark squad system. Each squad (so far, there's no talk of a solo or even a duo mode) selects its classes before the match, and the chosen class cannot be changed during the match. Players begin with two gadgets from their class and can level up during each match, gaining access to special traits, such as the Assault class being able to equip an armor plate more quickly. Experience is earned by defeating an opposing player or completing missions. Additionally, finding Intel Cases scattered throughout the map will yield experience to the entire squad.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlefield 6 battle royale" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fUfMY9pAb0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode also features a slight twist on the regular shrinking circle formula, or at least on how it affects players. Whereas most circles slowly damage those players on the outside, allowing for tactics such as sneaking from behind the circle, here the circle will instantly kill every player upon contact, therefore eliminating such strategies.</p>



<p>The rest is fairly standard fare for the genre. Squads will be randomly assigned missions that can provide powerful rewards, but players must always be on the lookout because those rewards will be air-dropped in and could technically be stolen by other squads. </p>



<p>There's no word or even rumor on when the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode will be released. It will likely depend on this testing phase; given that it will miss the main game's launch (slated for October 10) anyway, it doesn't make sense to rush it before it's ready and the players have provided their own feedback. </p>

We'll update this story if that happens with Mario Tennis Fever.</p><p>The full game is stored on the Switch 2 game card. Nintendo estimates a 10GB download for the digital edition of Mario Tennis Fever, which is available to preorder on the eShop for the same price.</p></div>                      </div><p>Technically, Mario Tennis Fever is the second Mario sports game to release exclusively on Switch 2. Nintendo recently added Super Mario Strikers to the GameCube catalog for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Expansion-12-month-Individual-Membership/dp/B09WJY877B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> members. But Mario Tennis Fever is the first all-new Mario sports game for Switch 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568010-mariotennisfever2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568010" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568010-mariotennisfever2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568010"></a><figcaption>Mario Tennis Fever (Nintendo)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568010-mariotennisfever2.jpg"></figure><p>Mario Tennis Fever will have local and online multiplayer for up to four players. It supports button/stick controls as well as motion controls with the Joy-Con 2. You'll be able to play as 38 different characters from the Mushroom Kingdom. The "Fever" moniker is a reference to this entry's new twist: Fever Rackets. There are 30 Fever Rackets with unique special effects such as freezing the court and shrinking your opponent's racket.</p><p>In the new Adventure Mode, monsters who inhabit a mysterious island turn Mario, Luigi, Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies. Donkey Kong is also in the campaign, but he isn't a baby (sadly). Baby Mario and his friends will need to develop their tennis skills all over again to escape the island.</p><p>Other game modes include Trial Towers, Tournament, Ranked Matches, Online Room, and Mix It Up. Mario Tennis Fever will borrow from Super Mario Bros. Wonder by having Talking Flowers commentate matches in Tournament Mode and by introducing Wonder Effects to Mix It Up Mode.</p><hr><h3>Mario Sports Games for Nintendo Switch</h3><p>The last Mario Tennis game, Mario Tennis Aces, released back in 2018 and was the first Mario sports title for the original Switch, too. Since the Nintendo Switch 2 is backward compatible, you can play the trio of Mario sports games for Switch on the new console: Mario Tennis Aces, Mario Golf: Super Rush, and Mario Strikers: Battle League.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Tennis-Aces-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B078XYF9SV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Tennis Aces</a> -- $51.87 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Mario+Tennis+Fever+Preorders+Are+Live+-+First+Mario+Sports+Game+For+Switch+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-09-14+22%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-14+22%3A01%3A38&amp;fnarticle_id=6534725&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fip%252FNintendo-Mario-Golf-Super-Rush-Nintendo-Switch-Games%252F432567681%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide%2F1100-6534725%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Golf: Super Rush</a> -- $46.49 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09SP2RMDG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> -- $52.69 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568012-mariosports.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568012" data-ratio="0.53883495145631" data-width="1030" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568012-mariosports.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568012"></a><figcaption>Mario Sports games for Nintendo Switch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4568012-mariosports.png"></figure><h2>More Nintendo Direct Game Preorders</h2><p>Along with the new Mario games, Nintendo announced release dates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/" data-ref-id="1100-6530754">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/" data-ref-id="1100-6534713">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-on-track-2026-venom-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel%E2%80%99s-wolverine-on-track-for-2026-venom-game-still-in-development-%E2%80%93-rumor.1297677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumors surrounding Insomniac's Marvel's Wolverine game are heating up. Earlier this month, Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-play-insomniac-worlverine-playstation-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> a State of Play could show off gameplay for the first time later this month. Last week, Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-looking-fantastic-according-playtesters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that he learned the game is being extremely well-received by internal playtesters, and a trailer is just about ready, although it might be shown off at The Game Awards in December instead of the aforementioned State of Play.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/marvels-wolverine-aims-2026-release-venom-project-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP1st</a>, through its anonymous sources, is assuring fans that Marvel's Wolverine is very much on track to be released next year. The report did not add anything else about the upcoming debut of the Canadian mutant; however, it does shed some new light on Insomniac's other project: <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-venom-insomniac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Venom</a>.</p>



<p>Firstly, MP1st says the game is very much in development. Much like Marvel's Wolverine, Venom was the subject of Insomniac's leak, and there were fears that the project might have been paused or even canceled. MP1st's sources add that Eddie Brock should be the host of the alien symbiote this time around, after what happened in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, where Peter Parker and later Harry Osborn were its hosts. According to the report, Brock should be portrayed more closely to the comic book character than Venom's live action film trilogy (where actor Tom Hardy played Brock).</p>



<p>Insomniac's Venom game would also see the return of Carnage. Players glimpsed this in Marvel's Spider-Man 2, when Cletus Kasady, the leader of the Crimson Hour cult, leaves Peter Parker and Yuri Watanabe with the following words: <em>'And when the Crimson Hour rolls over this Earth, it shall bring truth, judgement, and carnage.'</em> </p>



<p>Of course, seeing Carnage in a Venom game makes perfect sense, since the two are closely related (in general Marvel lore, Carnage is Venom's darker, more powerful and destructive offspring). It should be noted that while Insomniac and Sony confirmed Marvel's Wolverine a long time ago, no such confirmation ever came for Carnage. The leaks confirmed its existence, but as always, we'll have to wait for an official reveal to be sure.</p>
