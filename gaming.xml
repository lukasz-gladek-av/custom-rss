		<p>Nintendo’s latest quarterly report has revealed that the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> has already sold more than 10 million consoles by the end of September, continuing its record-setting status as the fastest selling games console.</p>
<p>Having launched on 5th June, the Switch 2’s sales figures are split between the quarters ending on 30th June and 30th September. In its launch month alone, the Switch 2 raced to 5.82 million units sold, and this was followed by 4.54 million units through the rest of the summer. That puts the total at 10.36 million after four months, far outpacing the 7.8 million record of the PlayStation 5 through its first two quarters, and massively ahead of the original Switch. That console launched in early March 2017 and shipped 4.7 million through its first four months.</p>


<p>And here’s the thing. This 10 million consoles sold? That’s before the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> last month, which will absolutely have pushed many prospective Pokémon players to upgrade.</p>
<p>Instead, the main highlight games for the Switch 2 are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> which, thanks to being a console bundle game, enjoys a near 1:1 sales record at 9.57 million copies, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> at 3.49 million copies. A pretty good effort from DK, I’d say.</p>

<p>Indeed, while we heaped praise on the game for its excellent interactive documentary and wide selection of games in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">7/10 review</a>, we noted that the online functionality is simply not up to scratch at the moment.

<p>In fact, this latter issue appears to be so prevalent that some players over on PS5 have actually been awarded full refunds from Sony (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/11/sonys-allowing-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-refunds-because-the-ps5-ps4-compilation-is-a-downright-nightmare-for-some">Push Square</a>).

<p>Digital Eclipse is, however, working incredibly hard to resolve the issues that have arisen since launch. In fact, Head of Production Stephen Frost has been remarkably communicative over on X regarding player grievances, and recently stated that he is "running on fumes" in attempting to respond to all of the complaints.</p>

<p>The company has, however, confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-update-announced-here-are-the-patch-notes">a patch is already available on Steam</a>, with fixes addressing audio issues when playing online, missing audio from the 32X version of MKII, and more general stability. This patch is due to release on console at any moment.</p>
<p>Stephen Frost has also stated that more patches are due to go into testing imminently, so it seems crystal clear that the team is razor-focused on improving Legacy Kollection for players on all platforms. If you're not keen on diving in right now, we'd advise keeping your eye out for future updates – we're confident Digital Eclipse can stabilise things.</p>

In its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/index.html">latest earnings release</a>, covering April 1st to September 30th, Nintendo now predicts that it’ll sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, compared to its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717163/nintendo-earnings-q1-2025-switch-2-sales">previous forecast of 15 million</a>.</p><p>The Japanese gaming giant reports that 10.36 million Switch 2 consoles have been sold so far following its launch in June, with 4.54 million sales falling under its latest earnings period. 20.62 million Switch 2 games have also been sold since launch, though Nintendo has only raised its Switch 2 game forecast from 45 million to 48 million.</p><p>The combined hardware and software sales are driving a 110 percent surge in revenue, which increased to ¥1,099.5 billion (around $7.1 billion) between April and September, compared to ¥523.2 billion (around $3.4 billion) for the same period last year. Nintendo also increased its end-of-year sales forecast to ¥2,250 billion (around $14.6 billion), and said it’s taken US tariff measures into consideration for these revisions.</p><p>While the Switch 2 is the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">fastest-selling game console of all time</a>, the first Switch console is also still creeping up in sales. The Switch has now hit 154.01 million lifetime sales, <em>just shy</em> of the 154.02 million total units sold for the DS, which still reigns as Nintendo’s most successful console. After dethroning the DS, the Switch then just needs to surpass 160 million sales to become the best-selling console of all time — a record set by Sony’s PlayStation 2 last year.</p><p>By comparison, the Wii U sold just 13.7 million units over its entire lifetime, a figure that the Switch 2 is pretty much guaranteed to surpass before its first birthday.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/813025/nintendo-switch-2-sales-september-2025-earnings]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Yo ho, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civ 7</a>'s 1.3.0 update arrives today, November 4th.

<p>As outlined in the developer update video above, the "sweeping changes to individual civs" promised in the studio's last blog are mainly focused on delivering "significant buffs" to 12 nations a lot of folks play as. Axum, Chola, Egypt, Great Britain, Hawaii, Maya, Mississippian, Prussia, Qing, Sanghai, and Spain have all seen changes, with the newly renamed Achaemenid Persia rounding out the list.</p>
<p>These civs have gotten "more specific bonuses" aimed at ensuring they "lean into a unique play style" and making your starting position on the map factor more heavily into how your wider strategy plays out. For example, Egypt will now receive tailored bonuses for building settlements and districts along river tiles, better reflecting their historical reliance on the Nile," explained Civ creative director Ed Beach. "Achaemenid Persia will get far more culture benefits for the Pairidaeza unique improvement as well as additional happiness and culture from capturing settlements."</p><p>These sorts of changes extend into the update's fresh addition when it comes to sea and coastal tiles, with the Hawaii civ getting a head start on working with ocean tiles in the exploration age, rewarding using them to push in a watery direction from the get go.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the update overhauls the treasure fleet's interface via the addition of a "clear treasure point value" to help you tell how much the swag they're carrying is worth at a glance. Resource icon art has also had some distracting background colours toned down, so they should be easier on the eyes. Finally, selecting a scout will now see tiles with things to discover highlighted with a special blue and white outline, making it harder to miss things if you're leaning on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-is-getting-auto-explore-for-scouts-reminding-me-that-i-both-hate-and-love-auto-explore">auto-explore</a>.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how these tweaks go down, as Civ 7 and devs Fiarxis continue along what's at times been a pretty rocky and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7-developers-firaxis-have-laid-off-an-unspecified-number-of-workers-2k-confirm">saddening</a> post-release road.</p>

<p>Saints Row 1 Director has stated that he has been asked to create a pitch for a prequel instalment to the series, and it will not be a VR game. </p>



<p>The 2022 Saints Row reboot didn’t go down well with anyone, as most of the charm of the game was lost in this new version. The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saints-row-2022-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly generated $1.7 million</a> before Volition closed down, but it failed to meet fan expectations due to its lackluster narrative and shift in tone. However, it seems that all is not lost for the Saints Row franchise, as a new game is currently being pitched. </p>



<h2 id="h-saints-row-1-director-is-going-back-to-his-roots-with-the-prequel">Saints Row 1 Director is Going Back to His Roots With the Prequel</h2>



<p>The revelation about a Saints Row prequel pitch comes from the design director of the first title, Chris Stockman, latest post on the r/SaintsRow <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintsRow/comments/1ok2dh3/ive_been_asked_to_a_create_a_pitch_for_a_saints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/saints-row-1s-director-is-pitching-a-prequel-that-gets-back-to-the-roots-of-what-made-sr-1-entertaining-but-i-mostly-want-to-know-what-became-of-the-saints-row-2-pc-patch-whose-developer-died/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>). Titled, “I’ve been asked to create a pitch for a Saints Row prequel!” Stockman’s post says he has hopeful news for the fans, as he has been approached “to create a pitch for a Saints Row reboot.” He is unable to share any more information right now, but his “dreams for this game just became a little more than just dreams.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moreover, Stockman also stated that the prequel will not be a VR title, and he is returning to his roots. Sotckman added that he has a “very clear vision” for the prequel as he was the director of the first game. He also indulged in other conversations with players, explaining his vision for the title. </p>



<p>Stockman stated, “The core idea of Saints Row ’77 is to go back to the roots of what made SR 1 entertaining in the first place. It was somewhat grounded in reality but also a bit zany too. It had a lot more satirical elements vs. the later entries.” He added, or maybe they could “start in the 90s, then go 80s, then go 70s! Bookmark this reply. *wink wink*.” Whatever this ends up being, fans definitely seem excited about a prequel instalment to the series. </p>

		<p>As is tradition for Sony, and for me writing about them, it’s time to take a look at the weird advert to sell PlayStations over the holiday season. This time there are three vignettes rather than one longer ad and as usual they do not feature any games, or indeed PlayStation consoles, instead, they sell an idea which this years is “anything can happen on PlayStation”.</p>
<p>The first advert is clearly influenced by Grand Theft Auto and finds a driver waking up in a truck which has landed somewhere unexpected.&nbsp; Unfortunately, YouTube still gives away exactly where that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="It Happens On PS5 - Stunt Jump" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/woGbrJqimvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second advert is set on a fishing trawler which has landed a monstrous creature, but there is a twist in the tale that isn’t spoiled by YouTube.</p>
<p><iframe title="It Happens On PS5 – Unexpected Catch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uyYzIT7kNUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The third and final advert is just very odd. Two survivors from a wrecked spaceship spot a truck heading their way which is driven by an older woman and not much else happens.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="It Happens On PS5 – Crash Landings" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VTi78EVDDJ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sony usually pack these adverts with Easter eggs but I really cannot see that many this year. The truck in the first advert has the PS5 logo on the seat, and an Astro-bot badge can be seen, and the boat in the second advert also has the PS5 logo. The palm tree air freshener in the truck may be something but I cannot make any connection, and there is a wooden monster head at the back of the truck in the first head which again may be a reference, what do you think?</p>
<p>The adverts have rather more impact that last year’s effort which just features lots of people bouncing around for no reason.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiNPo7KvWCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc">&nbsp;one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened fourteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>

<p>As we'd expected, Sonic Frontiers is ahead of Superstars, likely due in part to the simple fact that it released much sooner, but we also believe that folks are generally more receptive to fully 3D titles these days. Indeed, Sega has previously stated that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/sega-reports-sluggish-sales-of-sonic-superstars-and-other-major-titles">sales for Superstars were "sluggish"</a>.</p>
<p>As for the specific figures, Sonic Frontiers sits at <strong>4.57 million units</strong>, while Sonic Superstars has shifted <strong>2.43 million units</strong>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> is, for some reason, completely absent.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tijzuk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>We unfortunately don't get a look at what the platform split is for the sales data, but something tells us that the Switch is probably up there as the most popular console; at the very least, it'll be second to the PS5.</p>
<p>All in all, these certainly aren't bad figures, but it definitely puts into perspective that Nintendo's recent performance with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. The game, which launched back in July, has already shifted 3.49 million units, which compared to Frontiers and Superstars is kind of astonishing.</p>
<p>Still, we have nothing but love for the blue blur (even if we weren't particularly fond of Frontiers), so we hope Sega can shift even more units going forward. For racing fans, the Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> will also be released soon, so keep your eye out for that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pillars-of-eternity-launches-turn-based-mode-beta-tomorrow.1342969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian announced that the cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-crpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pillars of Eternity</a> will receive the fan-requested turn-based mode tomorrow. It will be a public beta going live on Steam and the Xbox PC app.</p>



<p>As you already know if you played the game, Pillars of Eternity is currently available only as a real-time with pause (RTwP) game, whereas its sequel, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadfire</a>, eventually introduced an optional turn-based mode. Fans had long requested this option in the first installment, and now Obsidian is delivering.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>You'll have a number of settings to tweak in the new turn-based mode.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Josh Sawyer, the project director (also known for Fallout: New Vegas and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pentiment</a>), who said:</p>



<p><em>There were a number of very reasonable criticisms of how the turn-based mode was implemented in Deadfire. Nick Carver and Jesse Bureno are trying to address those as well as they can. One of the major changes is that the action economy is a lot more accurate to the real time with pause game. It's not a 1:1 translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real time of pause mode. A lot of people commented that free actions felt abusable, which is true. That is now restricted and limited. That will feel like a significant change.</em></p>

<iframe title="Pillars of Eternity – Turn-Based Mode Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Another criticism levied against the turn-based mode in Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire was that it simply felt too slow. A fix for that was increased lethality, which Deadfire got through a mod and the first installment is now receiving by default straight from Obsidian. Lastly, it will be possible to switch from combat to combat between real-time with pause and turn-based modes. Of course, being a beta, issues are expected. Obsidian encouraged players to check out the beta and deliver their feedback ahead of the final release of the mode.</p>



<p>Even though Pillars of Eternity is now a pretty old game (it was released ten years ago), the addition of the turn-based mode, now preferred by most users to RTwP, could be enough to make some people go back and check it out, especially after the positive launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a>, which is set in the same world.</p>



<p>A couple of years ago, Josh Sawyer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> he'd love to make Pillars of Eternity 3 with a Baldur's Gate 3-type budget. If that opportunity came along, he'd make it turn-based, so more experimentation feels like an interesting step toward that idea.</p>



<p>In other Obsidian news, the seemingly tireless studio has just released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another great RPG: The Outer Worlds 2</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-let-pillars-of-eternitys-surprise-turn-based-mode-spark-a-wave-of-turn-based-updates-for-all-other-games">much-anticipated turn-based mode</a> debuts in PC open beta form on November 5th, with Obsidian seeking more input on their very nice tenth anniversary gift before rolling out a final version. That's not to say the devs haven't already been working to ensure "very reasonable criticisms" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>'s own turn-based mode, though, as outlined by director Josh Sawyer in the beta's announcement video.</p>

<p>"This has been a lot of work primarily from Nick Carver and Jesse Bureno," Sawyer said. "Special shout out to Kurt Decker, who's also been adding a lot of work of his own recently. This turn-based mode is something that we wanted to do because turn-based mode was received so well in Deadfire. That being said, there were a number of very reasonable criticisms of how turn-based mode was implemented in Deadfire. Nick and Jesse are trying to address those as well as they can."</p>
<p>Getting into specifics, you'll have the option to switch between turn-based mode and the standard real-time with pause combat at any point in your playthrough by heading into the options, rather than being locked to one system based on your choice at the start of the game. Obsidian are also "investigating" letting you toggle between the two via a button on the HUD, according to an announcement <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode">blog post</a>, but Sawyer makes it sound like this addition's already set in stone.</p><p>The number of turns you get per round is now tied to your character's speed and recovery stats, while the likes of swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions limited to one use per turn, in an effort to avoid them being "abusable". Finally, you should end up in less skirmishes which devolve into three hour long slogs, with combat lethality having been "significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful", mirroring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/pillarsofeternity2/mods/43">popular Deadfire mods</a>.</p>
<p>As of right now, there's no set duration outlined for the beta, with Obsidian simply saying it'll "run for some time as we continue to roll out updates and prepare for a full release". We do at least know that the beta'll be available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/291650/Pillars_of_Eternity/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition/bs34vnw7h61f">Xbox app</a> players when it arrives tomorrow. There aren't any instructions in Obsidian's blog post, but it's probably safe to assume you'll be able to opt into it as you usually do Steam update betas on the former storefront. Xbox appers may have to press a special button that summons Phil Spencer or something.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is launching on November 14, 2025, as previously announced; there will be no early access for the title. </p>



<p>A few days ago, there was speculation that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s campaign and Zombies modes would arrive a bit earlier than the multiplayer mode, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-campaign-zombies-release-early-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-load dates</a>. There were also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-launch-a-week-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumours</a> about the game’s release being preponed by a week. However, all of these rumours about playing Black Ops 7 early have been debunked by Activision. </p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-no-early-access-everyone-start-playing-on-november-14">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Has No Early Access, Everyone Start Playing on November 14</h2>



<p>Reliable Call of Duty news source CharlieINTEL debunked the game’s early access rumors through a recent post on their official <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1985132037498433755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that Black Ops 7 releases on Friday, November 14. “There is no early access. There is no change to the release date.” An Activision representative confirmed these details to CharlieINTEL, so this should clear up all the confusion that players had. </p>

<p>For those wondering, Black Ops 7 will feature a co-op campaign mode at launch, where players will be able to visit a variety of different environments, “from the neon-lit rooftops of Japan to the Mediterranean coast.” Coming to the multiplayer mode, players can start their BO7 journey with 16 6v6 maps and two 20v20 maps at launch. Lastly, round-based Zombies returns with the upcoming title as players descend into the heart of the Dark Aether. </p>

            <p>Arc Raiders players are getting free in-game currency following server problems earlier this week. These problems were caused by an influx of players that broke launch-day figures.</p>
<p>In a post on the Arc Raiders Discord server, Embark Studios community lead Ossen Julia stated: "Our team is working with determination to get you into those shuttles in a timely manner and we thank you for your patience while we're fine-tuning the system. To show our appreciation, we're sending you 500 Raider Tokens to use as you see fit."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-online-connection-error-launch-server-problem">Arc Raiders launched to a whopping 130,000+ concurrent Steam players</a> on its release day, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">growing even larger the following day</a>. However, days later it reached a new peak of 354,836 concurrent players over the weekend, showing strong momentum and word of mouth for the extraction shooter.</p>

<p>It's not the only favour Embark Studios has been doing for suffering players.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raider-is-committed-to-skill-and-fun-not-unfair-advantages-and-is-refunding-gear-lost-to-cheaters-even-if-you-didnt-report-them"> Those who have been killed by cheaters have been getting their lost loot sent back to them</a>, with the developers stating they're: "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages". This happened to me just this morning, and I've got to say, it does feel rather good to have an unfair death reversed.</p><p>If you've not played Arc Raiders yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">why not check out Eurogamer's preview</a>! In it, the game is described as such: "It's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p>Nintendo's latest financials are out and while the focus is on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-its-first-few-months-on-sale-switch-2-outpaced-the-ps4-the-ps5-and-the-original-switch-and-nintendo-only-expects-things-to-get-better">how well Nintendo's newest console, the Switch 2, has performed</a>, it's the older generation machine that's a hair's breadth from reaching a staggering milestone for the company: becoming Nintendo's best-selling games machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Sales data for the period ending 30th September 2025</a> shows Nintendo Switch is around 10,000 sales from levelling the colossal lifetime record set by Nintendo DS. The DS has 154.02m sales and the Switch has 154.01m - it's neck and neck. And given that the Switch is still actively selling in notable quantities, it's a record this industry-shaping hybrid handheld console looks set to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">The full-year sales forecast for Nintendo Switch</a> is 4m units, incidentally, and there are two more sales quarters to go.</p>
<p>For reference, the Nintendo Wii - another champion seller for Nintendo - sold 101.63m units during its lifetime, which gives you an idea of the enormity of Switch's success. The Wii U, meanwhile, sold a woeful 14.56m units.</p>
<p>But there's still a bigger fish in the proverbial pond when it comes to lifetime console sales, and that is, of course, PlayStation 2. Sony's best-selling machine is the record-holder, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-officially-surpasses-160m-sales-retaining-its-best-selling-console-crown">the PS2 surpassing 160m sales last autumn</a>. But that tally is not out of reach for Nintendo's Switch should the sales keep trickling in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Two NetEase-funded companies founded by MMO veterans, T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle, shared the fate of losing NetEase's support, <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just like many other studios</a>. Both have scrambled to find alternate publishers and ways to stay alive, and now, they have two announcements - one of hope and another of (almost) defeat.</p>



<p>T-Minus Zero <a href="https://www.t-minuszero-relaunch.com/tm0-news/t-minus-zero-relaunch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in a press release</a> that a small group of veteran directors and founders has decided to acquire the studio name to carry the team's spirit forward, and they are relaunching as an independent production company. The studio now aims to create high-quality gaming experiences that bring people together with a close-knit team of veteran technical and creative leaders who work exceptionally well together. T-Minus Zero also claims to already possess a 'genre-forward concept' with substantial proof of interest and scalability across platforms.</p>



<p>Zachary Beaudoin, the new CEO, stated that the team is now seeking co-financing partners for T-Minus Zero's next round of development financing. Beaudoin previously worked at BioWare, Blizzard, and Crystal Dynamics.</p>



<p>As for Fantastic Pixel Castle, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmo-fantastic-pixel-castle-is-in-danger-netease-pulls-plug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we already knew the studio was in serious trouble</a>. Yesterday, founder Greg Street <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in a LinkedIn post that the studio now has a closure date: November 17. There is a chance the studio might still secure funding for its Ghost MMO after this date, but by then, the priority will be to help team members find employment.</p>



<p>I had interviewed both <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-mmorpg-qa-ex-wow-designer-opens-up-on-every-aspect-of-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Greg Street</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-qa-neteases-latest-aaa-team-plans-ambitious-things-never-before-seen-in-online-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rich Vogel</a> (the original founder of T-Minus Zero) back in 2023 when NetEase established the respective studios. Street was a key figure at Blizzard on World of Warcraft and later at Riot Games on League of Legends and the League of Legends MMO <a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-mmo-is-still-in-development-but-has-been-rebooted-says-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that was eventually rebooted last year</a>. Rich Vogel, on the other hand, had worked on Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, and Star Wars: The Old Republic. It is currently unclear whether he'll stay after the studio's reboot.</p>

<p>All in all, there's not a whole lot to report on with the OG Switch. The numbers are all gradually going up, but there are no changes to the overall order. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is just shy of 70 million units sold now, so we fully expect the game to hit this for the next financial release.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> has bumped itself over the 22 million mark, which is a fantastic achievement for a sequel. You might wonder, in fact, why both this and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> didn't see an even bigger jump, considering both received Switch 2 Editions. Well, the reason is simple: Nintendo has stated that Upgrade Packs don't count toward total software sales, so there you go.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tijzuk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> its quarterly and half-year results for 2025, covering the period from April to September, and revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 is already outselling its predecessor.</p>



<p>As of September 30, the new hybrid handheld console has sold 10.36 million units, significantly outpacing the original Switch (which took about ten months to sell a similar amount of units). When it comes to Nintendo Switch 2 software sales, they have reached 20.62 million units, meaning that there's an average of nearly two Switch 2 games per unit.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, the big launch exclusive, predictably secured the lion's share of the software sales, selling 9.57 million units. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> also sold pretty well, achieving 3.49 million units from July to September.</p>



<p>In light of these promising results, Nintendo has revised its previous conservative forecast of 15 million units sold by the end of the fiscal year (March 2026). It now forecasts 19 million Nintendo Switch 2 units sold in the console's first year on the market. If achieved, it will be all the more remarkable because it happened under the shadow of the US tariffs. For example, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously revised its original 17 million units forecast down to 15 million</a> specifically due to that ongoing issue.</p>



<p>During the reported timeframe, the original Nintendo Switch sold 1.89 million hardware units and 61.56 million software units. The full-year forecast for the older console was slightly reduced from 4.5 million units to 4 million, although software units are now estimated to reach 125 million copies, up from the 105 million copies of the previous forecast. Overall, the Nintendo Switch has sold 154 million units since its launch in March 2017. At this rate, it seems unlikely it will ever reach the 160.6 million units sold by Sony's PlayStation 2, the best-selling console of all time, but it probably doesn't matter that much to Nintendo.</p>

<p>Sentinels have announced they are exiting Marvel Rivals Esports, though the door has been left open for a return in the future.</p>



<p>The team competed in the inaugural Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals in China, but, as preparations start to prepare for the end-of-season Ignite tournament, expected to take place next month, Sentinels announced they are exiting the competition.</p>



<h2 id="h-sentinels-leaving-marvel-rivals-esports">Sentinels Leaving Marvel Rivals Esports</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Departure. Image via Sentinels</figcaption></figure>



<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/senrivals/status/1985492677669110241?s=46&amp;t=SjOb542MOiUY8kbKILY2Og" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Sentinels stated they were “pausing” operations in Marvel Rivals, but they would “revisit the decision” if NetEase were to roll out a program with team incentives.</p>



<p>It’s added that all players in the team are “now free to explore new opportunities,” with those who were on the team now available to sign for another organisation.</p>



<p>The stance from Sentinels aligns with what the organisation’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sentinels-ceo-says-marvel-rivals-team-bundles-are-critical-for-esports-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CEO Rob Moore told Insider Gaming</a> at the Marvel Rivals Ignite mid-season finals, where he described the introduction of purchasable team bundles as “critical” for the future of the title in the Esports scene.</p>



<p>NetEase is yet to announce any decision regarding bundles, though <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1953474966185214111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Esports Tournament lead Adam H</a>uang did state that skin bundles could be added in the future, which could contribute to the prize pools of the grand finals.</p>



<p>Similar incentives are commonplace across other Esports, helping to establish the economics of the scene, and it remains to be seen whether NetEase will introduce a similar stance.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for comment on the Sentinels exit from the Esports scene and whether team incentives are being planned.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has increased its sales forecast for its recently debuted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console ahead of the festive season.</p>
<p>"The full-year sales unit forecast for Nintendo Switch 2 hardware has been increased by 4m units to 19m units, and software by 3m units to 48m units," the company wrote in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">most recent financial report</a>.</p>
<p>As of 30th September 2025, the Switch 2 has sold 10.36m units, Nintendo revealed. This means the company has shifted a total of 4.54m Switch 2 hardware units during the three months ending 30th September of this year. To put that into perspective, 4.54m sales in the second quarter is unmatched by any other console.

<p>"Additionally, the forecast for Nintendo Switch hardware has been decreased by 0.50m units to 4m units, and software has been increased by 20m units to 125m units," the company continued.</p>
<p>The original Switch, which first released back in 2017, has sold a total 154.01m units as of 30th September. According to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">latest financial reports</a>, Nintendo's best selling console thus far remains Nintendo DS, but only by an actual smidge. The DS as of September has sold 154.02m units. It seems more than likely that the Switch will usurp the DS in terms of sales by the next reporting period.</p>

<p>If you compare this to other consoles in the same launch time, you can see just how impressive these stats are: the PS4 managed 7.5m in the same timeframe, with the PS5 achieving 7.8m, and the original Switch shifting just under 5m (4.7m, to be precise).</p><p>Looking ahead to full 12-month figures, Nintendo's target of 19m Switch 2 sales will put the new console comfortably ahead of the original Switch (which managed just over 14m), the PS4 (clocking in at 13.5m), and the PS5 (which had a peculiarly similar trajectory to its predecessor at 13.4m).</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Nintendo news, earlier this week it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-apparently-a-very-good-mario-themed-reason-you-should-go-and-see-wicked-for-good-this-november">a trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie will be attached to screenings of Wicked: For Good</a>, which is set to release on 21st November. Some have since started speculating that Rosalina, should she appear in the upcoming sequel, will be voiced by Ariana Grande, who stars and Glinda the Good in the Wicked film adaptations.</p>

<p>Only 10,000 units separate it from the DS</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="104c3f1734b63"><a title="Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/104c3f1734b63/switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been positively <em>itching</em> to see the latest financial report from Nintendo, as we had expected the Switch to finally surpass the Nintendo DS and become the company's best-selling console of all time.</p>
<p>Alas, that hasn't quite happened yet. At <strong>154.01 million units</strong>, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">Switch is a mere 10,000 units away from the DS</a>, and considering the data is only viable to the end of September 2025, it's likely that the gap has already been closed in the couple of months following.</p>
<p>We don't <em>know</em> that though, so we just have to assume for now that the DS is still in the lead.</p>
<p>Still, what a remarkable feat by the Switch! And let's not forget that the console commands the most software sales by a <em>huge</em> margin, shifting a total of <strong>1,452.79 million units</strong>. DS, meanwhile, managed <strong>948.76 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Looking at the Switch 2, which has now sold a total of <strong>10.36 million units</strong> after just 4 months on the market, it's only 3.2 million units away from surpassing the Wii U - <em>mad</em>.</p>
<p>So let's take a look at where things stand at the moment:</p>

<p>We're still kind of astounded that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has a firm release date, and the fact that it's now so close is just too exciting! Otherwise, this is a pretty solid look at the immediate future, and while much of it is still made up of Switch 2 Editions (yes, including Prime 4 itself), there are also a bunch of completely new titles for the new console.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tijzuk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it will start delisting Football Manager 2024 from storefronts, and the process will begin on November 5th. The reason for the delisting is the end of license agreements and new ones likely being agreed for Football Manager 26. There does not seem to be any kind of discount for Football Manager 2024 ahead of its delisting. The dates for the delistings are below.</p>



<p>As you can see from the table, Football Manager 2024 will be delisted tomorrow from Steam and the Epic Games Store, including the demo. Then on November 16th the game will be removed from Windows Store, PC Game Pass, Xbox consoles, and Xbox Game Pass. On 18th November, Football Manager 2024 will be removed from PS5’s store, and on December 5th Football Manager 2024 Touch will be removed from the Nintendo Switch Store. Those playing FM24 Touch on Apple Arcade and FM24 Mobile via Netflix will be able to upgrade to Football Manager 26.</p>

<p>In our Football Manager 2024 review I wrote, “There’s a lot of depth to Football Manager 2024, but how deep you go is up to you. You can sit back and just focus on the basics of the match day and transfers, or you can all the way to managing individual player training and using the new player targets feature Whatever approach you choose, Football Manager 2024 offers a near full package to start or continue your managerial career.”</p>

<figure data-uuid="9cd0e499927a1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9cd0e499927a1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has released its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">financial data</a> for the six months ending <strong>30th September 2025</strong>, and has provided updated sales figures for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The console has now sold at least <strong>10.36 million units</strong> according to the official figures, which is seemingly more than even Nintendo itself was anticipating. As such, the company has increased its forecast for the year, bumping expected Switch 2 sales up from <strong>15 million</strong> to <strong>19 million</strong>. Switch 2 software has seen a similar jump up from <strong>45 million</strong> to <strong>48 million</strong>.</p>
<p>Naturally, this also means that sales for the original Switch family of systems have tanked, with the console pulling in a meagre <strong>1.89 million</strong> in sales, a hefty drop of 60% year-on-year. As a result, Nintendo has decreased its forecast for the Switch accordingly, lowering console sales from <strong>4.5 million</strong> to <strong>4 million</strong>. On the flip side, however, thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility, the software forecast has been increased from <strong>105 million</strong> to <strong>125 million;</strong> a bump of 19%.</p>
<p>Here's a look at how the Switch 2 has sold across various regions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Americas - 3.68m</li>
<li>Europe - 2.40m</li>
<li>Japan - 2.35m</li>
<li>Other - 1.93m</li>
</ul>
<p>With the help of bundles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has also sold an extraordinary amount, shifting a total of <strong>9.57 million</strong> <strong>units</strong> since launch – a remarkable attach rate of over 92%. Meanwhile, it's been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold <strong>3.49 million units</strong>, which perhaps isn't as high as fans would have hoped for. Still, it's a good start nevertheless.</p>
<p>Nintendo states that a total of <strong>20.62 million software units</strong> for the Switch 2 have been sold since launch, of which approximately <strong>8.10 million</strong> were bundled with the console itself.</p>
<p>A pretty solid start for the Switch 2, then! As expected, this also means that gross profit also saw a nice little bump for the company, "rising 25.3% year-on-year to 398.4 billion yen". It's also increased its financial forecasts for the year, including net sales to 2,250.0 billion yen and operating profit to 370.0 billion yen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Best ARC Raiders Maps for Quests and Items]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-maps-quests-items/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-arc-raiders-maps-for-quests-and-items.1342912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a pretty challenging game when it comes to finding quest items and locations. It doesn’t <strong>entirely </strong>hold your hand and requires you to explore a little to get to the objectives you need to resolve the game’s many tasks. With that being said, there are a few ARC Raiders maps and resources you can rely on to get the fastest route possible to what you need.</p>



<p>In this guide, I’ll help you figure out what the best sites are for ARC Raiders maps.</p>



<h2 id="h-find-quest-objectives-in-arc-raiders-with-ease">Find Quest Objectives in ARC Raiders with Ease</h2>



<p>When it comes to playing extraction shooters, you’ll often need to rely on maps and wiki pages to track down what you need. It’s an inherently tricky genre that wants players to go the extra mile, rather than relying on map markers and guide lines to find where they need to go.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders might be more accessible and have maps and a more detailed UI, but the quest objectives are sometimes tough to find, as all Embark Studios has offered is a <strong>clue</strong> or two.</p>



<p>That in mind, here are two of the best resources for ARC Raiders maps:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://mapgenie.io/arc-raiders">MapGenie</a></strong></li>



<li><strong><a href="https://metaforge.app/arc-raiders/map">MetaForge</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>These maps are brilliant, as they’re adjustable and modular, meaning you can apply filters to select exactly what you’re looking for in ARC Raiders, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>ARC locations</li>



<li>Containers</li>



<li>Nature resources</li>



<li>Events</li>



<li>Biomes</li>



<li>Supply Stations</li>



<li>Field Debots</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-what-s-the-easiest-map-in-arc-raiders">What’s The Easiest Map in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>By definition and rating, the easiest map to learn in ARC Raiders is Dam Battlegrounds. It’s a relatively open map with a lower difficulty ranking, except for when night falls and it becomes much more treacherous. It’s also the first map that players can explore after completing the opening sequence of ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Buried City is the next easiest map to learn, but the tight-knit streets and densely-packed buildings make PvP a challenge, as you never know where enemies might be lurking. There are a few observation points higher up that players can use to scan the map with a powerful rifle, so you’ll need to keep your eyes open when on this map.</p>



<p>The Blue Gate is the hardest map by the game’s rating, but it’s not <strong>that </strong>bad. It’s so open that your chances of running into other players are slimmer, and it has plenty of verticality, meaning you can jump deep into tunnels to escape pursuing ARC enemies.</p>



<p>I think Spaceport is the toughest map, mainly because of the way it’s built. It’s a sprawling thing that’s heavily occupied by ARC forces, and the central Launch Tower area serves as a hub that players rush to at the start of the match, but to get to it, you need to cross an immense amount of open ground without cover.</p>



<p>Any budding snipers can pick off their kills with ease.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Latest Fortnite Leaks Suggest Kill Bill and Hollywood Are Coming to The Game]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-kill-bill-hollywood/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-fortnite-leaks-suggest-kill-bill-and-hollywood-are-coming-to-the-game.1342903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been suggested in the latest round of Fortnite leaks that a <strong>movie theme </strong>might be front and centre when Chapter 7 lands next month. On social media, a famed leaker posted images claiming that Kill Bill is coming to Fortnite via a collaboration, and eagle-eyed users noticed Epic teasing the ‘Hollywood sign’ in a new trailer for Chapter 7.</p>



<p>That, in addition to recent claims that both Harry Potter and SpongeBob Squarepants crossovers are coming, is enough for fans to believe that the next Chapter will be focused on film and television.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-a-huge-leap">Not a Huge Leap</h2>



<p>It’s not a vast leap to assume that Fortnite’s Chapter 7 will be focused on film and television, based on the latest leaks.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Shiina, one of the most reliable Fortnite leakers, revealed references to Kill Bill that had been discovered by two other users.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Others have noticed further references, such as the coordinates to the <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1985358100870963419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollywood sign</a> being found in a recent teaser trailer for Chapter 7, and the presence of a ‘Nevada’ theme that includes both a <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1984705463112384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">casino and Area 51 POI</a>.</p>



<p>In the most recent leaks, it was suggested that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-harry-potter-collaboration-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Harry Potter</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-spongebob-collab-season-7-leak-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpongeBob Squarepants</a> are headed to Fortnite in future collaborations. All this is poised to follow the current period of the immensely popular battle royale game, which features classic television icons, The Simpsons.</p>



<p>This is all lined up as the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of pop culture collaborations that have swollen the skins and bundles repository in Epic Games’ free-to-play shooter over several expansive years.</p>



<p>What are you expecting from Chapter 7? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-has-solo%E2%80%99d-the-queen-in-arc-raiders%E2%80%94but-it-took-a-while.1342888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a feat that everyone deemed impossible, a content creator has managed to solo a Queen in ARC Raiders. The hulking mech is the most dominant and terrifying enemy in the game right now, and up until this point, it was believed that it was <strong>not possible </strong>to take it down as a solo player.</p>



<p>To put it into perspective, during an earlier testing session, the Queen was killed 58 times out of <strong>four million raids</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-solo-the-queen-in-arc-raiders">How to Solo the Queen in ARC Raiders</h2>



<p>In a short clip uploaded to social media, JGOD revealed the closing moments of a <strong>20-minute battle </strong>with the Queen on Dam in ARC Raiders. In the comments under the video, JGOD revealed that he used a variety of locations, some of which could be considered ‘cheesing’ the boss character, but remaining dynamic was key to defeating the fearsome enemy.</p>



<p>JGOD suggested taking a good Hullcracker into the fight and running in with ‘around 200’ shots for it. The rifle that he used went from 125 durability to under <strong>20 </strong>as the fight progressed. Any longer, and his weapon might have broken entirely. He didn’t <strong>count</strong>, but he said that he fired ‘about 180’ because he ‘missed a bunch as well’.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another user suggested taking in a stack of Wolfpack grenades to whittle down the Queen’s HP pool, which sits at around 30,000 points.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is becoming famous for having some of the most entertaining AI enemies to fight, and that naturally includes the gargantuan Queen. In this PvPvE extraction shooter, the ARC enemies represent something dynamic, unpredictable, and adaptable, which is much more enjoyable than the cannon fodder NPCs seen in some extraction shooters.</p>
