            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-have-4k-output/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is set to get its full reveal on April 2, and there are plenty of rumors and speculation about what the latest console from Nintendo will feature. One such rumor is that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K resolution in some fashion. </p>



<p>Past rumors suggest that the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will support 4K when docked</a>. When in handheld, however, it will have a 1080p resolution.</p>



<p>Despite the claims of 4K support, however, there is some question as to whether that’s accurate based on what was said during the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco earlier this month.</p>



<p>“I heard this from one developer at GDC and also heard it separately in an email but the dev kits, or some of the dev kits, don’t have a 4K output,” Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLUrxzSPZhU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It should be emphasized that the lack of 4K output on a dev kit doesn’t automatically mean that the system won’t support it. Console development kits don’t often fully match the specs of the final system. For example, some dev kits could offer more memory to allow for better debugging and leave out features that don’t impact testing too much like, in this instance, a 4K output.</p>



<p>Sticking on the topic of dev kits, to follow up on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior Insider Gaming report</a> on developers expecting them in June, it was clarified that it’s likely that some of the major third-party developers have them already. It’s the smaller studios that are still waiting on them to come in.</p>



<p>Do you think the Nintendo Switch 2 will support 4K in some manner? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1794/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Jagex has officially revealed its new game in the RuneScape franchise called RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The game, set in the same universe as the traditional RuneScape titles is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">set to release</a> in early access this spring.</p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall where up to four players work together to build camps, improve skills, and work to survive a land where “dragons have awoken”.</p>



<p>“Journey through the vast, vibrant regions of Ashenfall and unveil the ruins of forgotten civilisations to discover why&nbsp;wild, transformative magic&nbsp;spills from its fractured lands,” the game’s description reads. “Explode ore veins with a snap of your fingers. Conjure a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in an instant. The Anima-rich landscape of Ashenfall offers you a power unlike any other.”</p>



<p>There will also be various quests to complete while level up your skills and even wield the runes the series is known for.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The continent itself will be made up of two regions with give biomes. Players of the franchise will be able to recognize various creatures from the series, however they will look a bit different due to the magic of Ashenfall. Some will be fused with thorns or other plant elements. </p>



<p>Ahead of the game’s early access release later this spring, Jagex will be holding a deep-dive for players on April 15 at Noon ET/9am PT. Though not confirmed, it’s expected that an early access release date will be announced at, our around, the deep dive event.</p>

"But you still have to squint a little bit. It's still animation. It's terrific animation. But we don't really have interactive entertainment yet that really looks like live-action. Technology will get us there, but probably [in] a shorter period of time than maybe even I expect. That doesn't mean that every game is going to look like live-action.

			<p>Today, Jagex has unveiled RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a new game set in the beloved fantasy setting made popular by the 24-year-old MMORPG. It's an&nbsp;<span>open-world survival crafting game with cooperative multiplayer support for up to four players, and it will debut this Spring&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>. This is the studio's first proper spin-off to be released after they </span>canceled the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unannounced-runescape-action-rpg-jagex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous action RPG project</a>.</p>
<p>Jon Bellamy, CEO of the Cambridge-based developer, stated:</p>
<p><em>We’re so excited to finally give players a glimpse at the next entry in the RuneScape franchise today with RuneScape: Dragonwilds. This is an entirely new RuneScape experience set within the iconic world of Gielinor and is a game which is worthy of wearing the RuneScape name. From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of RuneScape: Dragonwilds. We’ve already conducted closed alpha tests with some of our closest community members, and we’ll be listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access. We’ve built an entirely new team filled with industry veterans who are focussed on making sure that RuneScape: Dragonwilds sits naturally within the RuneScape franchise, and a game that is loved by both our biggest RuneScape fans and entirely new players alike.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing RuneScape: Dragonwilds | Q&amp;A With Mod Dutch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30mkN1Hw83Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The backdrop is that, as suggested by the title, dragons have awoken on RuneScape's forgotten continent of Ashenfall. Players will have to master survival while uncovering ancient secrets to try and slay the Dragon Queen, who appears to be positioned to be the final boss.</p>
<p>They'll get to use what Jagex described as 'wild, transformative magic' to gather resources, such as exploding ore veins with a finger snap or conjuring a spectral axe to chop down a line of trees in a single hit. RuneScape: Dragonwilds also reportedly features a unique progression system that players will use to unlock new spells and craft recipes and abilities.</p>
<p>Jagex estimates that early access should be completed in early 2026, though that may vary depending on player feedback. RuneScape: Dragonwilds is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but the system requirements listed on the store page are quite low.</p>

He does this to save Ellie, his cargo-turned-surrogate-daughter, who was nearly killed in order to salvage the mutated cordyceps fungus in her brain that could help to make a vaccine. It’s a difficult situation, the morality of which fans have debated for over a decade. Was Joel right to save someone he cared about from certain death and, in so doing, doom humanity? Did he have any right to make that decision without Ellie’s consent? Did the doctors who were ready to kill her without asking what she wanted have the responsibility to do what they thought was right for the greater good? All of these are good questions. <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> explores them through shifting perspectives, and the sequel manages to end on a note that acknowledges all of them with equal weight.</p><p>Meanwhile, Druckmann and Mazin have expressed to <em>IGN</em> that they see Joel as in the right, even if Mazin is unsure if he could follow through on such a plan.</p><p>“I believe Joel was right,” Druckmann said to <em>IGN</em>. “If I were in Joel’s position, I hope I would be able to do what he did to save my daughter.”</p><p>“That’s so interesting, because I think that if I were in Joel’s position, I probably would have done what he did,” Mazin said. “But I’d like to think that I wouldn’t. That’s the interesting push and pull of the morality of it. And that’s why the ending of the first game is so provocative and so wonderful. It just doesn’t let you off the hook as a player.”</p><p>I could drag Druckmann and Mazin for trying to definitively weigh in on the foundational debate that has been the lifeblood of <em>The Last of Us</em> for a decade, but I will at least couch this all as them being asked about their personal belief, rather than arguing that the text is explicitly making one case or the other. (I would argue, however, that the TV show tries <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tlou-hbo-show-finale-joel-lies-ellie-part-ii-1850209559">real hard to shift us away</a></span> from condemning his actions entirely.) However, after following this series for so long, I always leave Druckmann interviews feeling like what I find profound about these games is just a series of happy accidents. <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>can’t just be a meditation on grief that uses violence as a language when Druckmann is talking about it as if the game is meant to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/video-games/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-ellie-evolution/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/video-games/news/the-last-of-us-part-2-ellie-evolution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scold the player for taking violent actions they have no say in</a></span>, or when he’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-not-so-hidden-israeli-politics-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">citing the Israel and Palestine conflict as an inspiration</a></span> for the game’s cycle of violence in a comparison that has only gotten more fraught since the game launched in 2020.

The modern Wikipediafication of art means everyone’s looking for definitive facts to point to and regurgitate in order to justify everything they feel with cold hard evidence. Sometimes, it feels like modern pop culture discourse is uncomfortable with questions that can’t be easily moralized. We’re seeing it right now with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965">ending of <em>Severance</em>’s second season</a></span>.

It follows Raidou Kuzonoha--who fans may recognize from his appearances in other MegaTen games like Shin Megami Tensei III and Soul Hackers--an apprentice occult investigator and Devil Summoner who allies with demons to solve various mysteries in 1930s Tokyo and the mysterious Dark Realm.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike other games in the MegaTen series, Raidou Remastered is an action RPG featuring real-time combat where players combo attacks as Raidou and leverage the powers of over 120 recruitable demons. Strangely, the remaster retools the game to use the combat system of the original game's sequel, Devil Summoner 2: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. King Abaddon--though the sequel is not included in this remaster. Along with the new combat system, the remaster will feature revamped visuals, new voice acting, an all-new interface, expanded environments, and numerous quality-of-life changes.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-sci-fi-and-fantasy-spring-book-sale-save-big-on-popular-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon Sci-Fi And Fantasy Spring Book Sale - Save Big On Popular Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-sean-connery-4k-steelbook-collection-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530389/">James Bond Sean Connery 4K Steelbook Collection Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-skywalker-saga-4k-box-set-featured-in-amazons-spring-sale/1100-6530379/">Star Wars Skywalker Saga 4K Box Set Featured In Amazon's Spring Sale</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-gets-nice-discount-a-month-after-its-release/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-blu-rays-box-sets-in-amazons-b2g1-free-big-spring-sale/1100-6530318/">Best 4K Blu-Rays &amp; Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-handheld-preorders-are-live-at-best-buy/1100-6528675/">Lenovo Legion Go SteamOS Handheld Preorders Are Live At Best Buy</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-twilight-princess-11-book-manga-box-set-is-nearly-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6520959/">Zelda: Twilight Princess 11-Book Manga Box Set Is Nearly 50% Off At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-optimus-prime-is-finally-back-in-stock-with-a-big-discount/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime Is Finally Back In Stock With A Big Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>This comes from the ever-reliable Billbil-kun, although they admit they aren't sure which game in the series it could be. "Could it be for Part 1, Part 2, or something entirely new?" they <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1906684709146366140">mused</a>.</p>

As for pricing, Billbil-kun stated it will retail for €119.99 EUR or $109.99.</p>
<p>"Everything seems to indicate that the officialisation of this edition, as well as the opening of pre-orders, would take place very soon, in a time window that we estimate within two months," Billbil-kun wrote (via Google Translate).</p>

            <p>
Jagex have announced RuneScape: Dragonwilds, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> co-operative survival game set in the same fantasy realm as their ancient MMO. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, looks a bit like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enshrouded">Enshrouded</a>, and will launch into early access this spring. Dragonwilds takes place on the continent of Ashenfall, a wilderness abundant in winged lizards, and your overall goal is to "slay the Dragon Queen". 
</p>
<p>
I'm going to make the obvious prediction here: you will spend much more time in Ashenfall chopping down trees and composing their delicious, grainy innards into barn doors than chopping down any dragons, regal or otherwise. It's a survival game, after all. The ratio of dragons to logging and carpentry in the first screenshots is a nail-biting 1:1 - if it weren't for that subtitle, I might have assumed this to be a game about woodlands management with optional Smaug-bashing QTEs.</p><p>Rather than dragon-felling cantrips, the announcement release gives prominent mention to a spell for summoning spectral axes to chop trees down for you, which feels a bit like a car salesman leading with the option to just buy a train ticket instead. Still, let's not be <em>entirely</em> miserable before we've even played the game. Here's the announcement trailer.

The game is said to blend "high fantasy with light RPG elements and iconic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> lore." You will "reshape your experience" by means of a magical power called Anima. "Summon spectral axes to fell trees in an instant or channel nature's energy to repair broken armour," the press release explains. Got you: automatable tasks and an equipment degradation system.</p>
<p>There's a progression system with new spells, crafting recipes and abilities to obtain. You'll be able to gad about in groups of four, fighting creatures you might recognise from regular ole RuneScape. And also, massacring the vegetation. Have at you, timber!

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">Read more on Steam</a>. I've never played the original RuneScape or its more recent free-to-play version, which yet graces our list of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">best MMOs and MMORPGs</a>. As such, I'm not really equipped to comment on whether Dragonwilds is a blasphemy unto RuneScaping or a promising fresh start fuelled by a finely calibrated mix of nostalgia and approachability. But I do know that it takes a lot to get me enthusiastic about a fantasy survival game right now. Still, I like the colourfulness of this, and I strongly relate to the expression of unholy joy on the face of the character in the picture there, as she unleashes the full force of the occult upon an unsuspecting sycamore.

One year removed from the infamous in-game liberation of Malevelon Creek, Helldivers 2 is sending its players back to the planet to hold it against surging Automaton forces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a recent Major Order failure, players were worried about a return to the Creek, as reports indicated the Automatons — pushing forward with their fiery new Incineration Corps — were targeting the Severin Sector. The sector, and Malevelon Creek in particular, was the center of one of Helldivers 2's earliest and most notable collective moments in the game. Helldivers converged on the planet to try and keep the Creek under Super Earth control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combination of jungle terrain and extremely dangerous foes led to Malevelon Creek being dubbed things like "Robot Vietnam." After the fight concluded and the Creek was securely under Helldiver control, Arrowhead released a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-gives-all-players-a-special-commemorative-cape-for-malevelon-creek-memorial-day">special cape to commemorate the fight</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, over the weekend, a new Major Order confirmed Helldivers <em>will</em> be heading back to Malevelon Creek. The offensive, led by the Incineration Corps, is on its way, with Malevelon Creek as the target. Already, invasions and skirmishes are underway across the sector, with lines pushing towards the Creek.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through the in-game briefing, Super Earth is urging its Helldivers to protect the resting place of many "Creekers" who fell in the push to free the planet. This is all to prevent the "greatest net desecration" of the upcoming Malevelon Creek Memorial Day.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers Alerts (@HelldiversAlert) <a href="https://twitter.com/HelldiversAlert/status/1906316365507748312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 30, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 players are, predictably, amped for this Major Order.

There's a lot to be said for these communal efforts, where Helldivers start logging on and building towards big moments together. When it ties into the long-running story and a feeling of a shared experience in a universe, it can be really incredible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, concerns are already rising that Arrowhead hasn't fully tipped its hand yet. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1jnz8re/this_mo_is_going_well_too_well/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post notes</a> that while the defensive efforts are going well and Malevelon Creek is currently safe, there are still five days left on the Major Order.

It's fascinating to see it unfold in real-time, and will no doubt make this week an exciting one for Helldivers players as the war for the Creek picks up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-is-having-its-halo-moment-with-the-dark-ages<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The last thing I expected Doom: The Dark Ages to remind me of was Halo 3. And yet, half way through a recent hands-on demo with id Software’s gothic prequel, I was mounted on the back of a cyborg dragon and unleashing a salvo of machinegun fire across the side of a demonic battle barge. With the vessel’s defensive turrets destroyed, I landed my beast atop the ship and proceeded to charge through its lower decks, turning the entire crew into a few gallons of red slop. Seconds later, the warmachine was toast and I burst through its hull, leaping onto my dragon to continue my crusade against the machines of Hell. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those familiar with Bungie’s landmark Xbox 360 shooter will instantly recognise the shape of Master Chief’s assault on the Covenant’s scarab tanks. The helicopter-like Hornet may have been swapped for a holographic-winged dragon and the giant laser-firing mech for an occult flying boat, but the core of the experience is all here: an aerial assault that transitions into a devastating boarding action. Surprisingly, this wasn’t the only moment in the demo that reminded me of Halo. While the combat core of The Dark Ages is unmistakably and singularly Doom, the campaign’s design seems to have a very “late-2000s shooter” spin thanks to its love of elaborate cutscenes and a greater push for gameplay novelty.    </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-1743152759607.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A dragon assault on Hell's battle barge. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Across two and a half hours I played four levels of Doom: The Dark Ages. Only the first of them, the campaign’s opener, resembled the tightly paced, immaculately mapped design of Doom (2016) and its sequel. The others saw me piloting a colossal mech, flying the aforementioned dragon, and exploring a wide-open battlefield dotted with secrets and powerful minibosses. It’s a big departure from Doom’s usual pursuit of mechanical purity, instead feeling akin to the likes of Halo, Call of Duty, and – weirdly – old James Bond games like Nightfire, all of which thrive on scripted setpieces and novelty mechanics that guest star for a mission or two. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a fascinating direction for Doom to head in, because once upon a time the series made something of a U-turn away from this. The cancelled Doom 4 was set to resemble Call of Duty, not only due to its modern military aesthetic but also thanks to an increased emphasis on characters, cinematic storytelling, and scripted events. After years of work id Software concluded that such ideas simply weren’t a good fit for the series, scrapping them in favour of the much more focused Doom (2016). And yet, in 2025, here they are in The Dark Ages. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The campaign’s rapid pace is punctuated with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo opened on a long and elaborate cutscene, (re)introducing the realm of Argent D'Nur, the opulent Maykrs, and the Night Sentinels – the knightly brothers-in-arms of the Doom Slayer. The big guy himself is depicted as a terrifying legend; a nuclear-level threat on two legs. While all of this lore will be familiar to Doom obsessives who poured over the prior games’ codex entries, the deeply cinematic approach with which it’s now presented feels very new. Very different. Very Halo. That continues into the levels themselves, with NPC Night Sentinels scattered about the environment akin to UNSC Marines. While they don’t fight alongside you (at least not in the levels I demoed) there’s certainly a greater sense that you’re part of an army – like Master Chief, you’re the invincible spearhead of a large force. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot of character work in the introductory cutscene and it remains to be seen if this is something Doom really needs. I’m a big fan of the prior games’ slight approach to story, and part of me would rather The Dark Ages continued to tell the Slayer’s tale through environment design and codex entries, reserving cinematics only for the big reveals à la Eternal. But while I have my reservations, the cutscenes thankfully know their place: they tee up a mission and are never seen again, refusing to interrupt Doom’s signature intense flow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are interruptions in other forms, though. After that opening mission, which starts with pure shotgun slaughter and ends with you parrying Hell Knights using the Slayer’s incredible new shield, I was thrown into the cockpit of a Pacific Rim-like Atlan mech and asked to wrestle demonic kaiju. After that, I was soaring through the skies on that cybernetic dragon, taking down battle barges and picking off gun emplacements. These tightly scripted levels create a significant gear shift, punctuating the campaign’s rapid pace with new gameplay ideas that are reminiscent of Call of Duty’s biggest novelties, such as Modern Warfare’s AC-130 gunship sequence or Infinite Warfare’s dogfighting missions. The Atlan is slow and heavy, and the skyscraper-high perspective makes Hell’s armies look like Warhammer miniatures. The dragon, meanwhile, is fast and agile, and the shift to a wide-angle third-person camera results in a very different experience that feels a dimension away from classic Doom. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/28/doom-the-dark-ages-mech-1743152796190.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The mech battles are Pacific Rim-scale punch ups. | Image credit: id Software / Bethesda</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the best FPS campaigns thrive on this kind of variety. Half-Life 2 and Titanfall 2 are the gold standard for it. Halo has endured so long partly because its mix of vehicular and on-foot sequences provides it with a rich texture. But I’m unsure if this will work for Doom. As with Eternal, The Dark Ages is once again a wonderfully complex shooter to play – every second demands your complete attention as you weave together shots, shield tosses, parries, and brutal melee combos. In comparison, the mech and dragon sequences feel anemic, stripped back, and practically on-rails – their combat engagements so tightly controlled they almost resemble QTEs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Call of Duty the switch to driving a tank or firing from a circling gunship works because the mechanical complexity of such scripted sequences isn’t that far removed from the on-foot missions. But in The Dark Ages there’s a clear gulf between gameplay styles, so much so it’s akin to a middle school guitar student playing alongside Eddie Van Halen. And while I know Doom’s core combat will always be the star, when I’m beating the snot out of a giant demon with a rocket-powered mech punch I shouldn’t be wishing I was back on the ground using a “mere” double-barrelled shotgun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My final hour of play saw The Dark Ages shift into another unusual guise, but one built on what feels like a much sturdier foundation. “Siege” is a level that returns its focus to id’s best-in-class gunplay, but it opens up Doom’s typically claustrophobic level design into a huge open battlefield, its geography shifting between narrow and wide to provide a myriad of pathways and combat arenas. The goal, to destroy five Gore Portals, has the same energy as Call of Duty’s multi-objective, complete-in-any-order missions, but I was reminded once more of Halo – the grand scale of this map versus the tighter routes of the opening level evokes the contrast between Halo’s interior and exterior environments. And, like Halo, the novelty here is that the excellent core shooter systems are given new context in much larger spaces. You must rethink the effective range of every single weapon in your arsenal. Your charge attack is employed to close football field-length distances. And the shield is used to deflect artillery fired from oversized tank cannons. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Were these ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The downside of expanding Doom’s playspace is that things can become a little unfocused – I found myself backtracking and looping through empty pathways, which really does kill the pace. It’s here I’d like to have seen The Dark Ages veer even closer to Halo by throwing the dragon into the mix and using it like a Banshee; being able to fly across this battlefield, raining down fire before divebombing into a miniboss battle, would have helped maintain the pace and make the dragon feel more integral to the experience. If such a level exists beyond what I’ve seen, I’ll be very happy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of the overall shape of the full campaign, though, I am fascinated that so much of what I’ve seen feels like a resurrection and reinterpretation of ideas that were once considered an ill-fit for the series. Very little of the cancelled Doom 4 was released for the public to see, but a <a href="https://kotaku.com/five-years-and-nothing-to-show-how-doom-4-got-off-trac-468097062" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotaku report</a> from 2013 paints a distinct picture. “There were a lot of scripted set pieces,” a source told the publication, among them allegedly an “obligatory vehicle scene.” And that’s exactly what we’ve got in the Atlan and dragon sections – mechanically simple scripted sequences that hark back to the novelty vehicle levels of Xbox 360-era shooters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://youtu.be/PS6SBnccxMA?t=812" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Talking to Noclip</a> in 2016, id Software’s Marty Stratton confirmed that Doom 4 “was much closer to something like [Call of Duty]. A lot more cinematic, a lot more story to it. A lot more characters around you that you are with throughout the course of the gameplay.” All that was scrapped, and so it’s genuinely fascinating to see so much of it return in The Dark Ages. This is a campaign set to feature big boarding action setpieces, lusciously rendered cinematics, a much wider cast of characters, and huge lore reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is: were those ideas always a bad idea for Doom, or were they just a bad idea when they looked too much like Call of Duty? Part of me is just as skeptical as the fans who once decried “Call of Doom”, but I’m also excited at the idea of id Software finally making that approach work by grafting it on to the now-proven modern Doom formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beating, gory heart of The Dark Ages unquestionably remains its on-foot, gun-in-hand combat. Nothing in this demo suggested that it will not be centre stage, and everything I played affirms it's another fantastic reinvention of Doom’s core. I think that alone is strong enough to support an entire campaign, but id Software obviously has other designs. I’m surprised that a couple of the studio’s new ideas feel so mechanically slim, and I am concerned that they will feel more like contaminants than fresh air. But there’s still a lot more to see, and only in time will these fractured demo missions be contextualised. And so I eagerly await May 15th, not just to return to id’s unrivaled gunplay, but to satisfy my curiosity. Is Doom: The Dark Ages a good late-2000s FPS campaign or a messy one? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Jagex is stepping beyond the realm of MMORPGs with the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>: Dragonwilds - an open world survival crafting game. Best known as the developers behind the long running MMORPG RuneScape 3 and its spin off, Old School RuneScape, Dragonwilds will be mechanically different to these games but is set within the RuneScape universe.</p>
<p>Alone or alongside three players, RuneScape: Dragonwilds will see you venturing to Ashenfall - a forgotten continent on Gielinor (the planet where RuneScape is primarily set), where you'll use magic and level up skills to carve out a life for yourself in the wilds. </p>
<p>Here we find echoes of the MMORPGs, as it wouldn't be a game in the RuneScape universe without skills and the progression system will be on hand to supply you with new skills, crafting recipes and abilities to aid in your survival.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to wield Anima - also known as the living energy of the universe, source of all magic and what the Wilder Gods eat to sustain their eggs. </p>
<p>Outside of what I'm sure you'll agree is very interesting RuneScape lore, Anima has a variety of uses in Dragonwilds, such as summoning axes for instantaneous tree cutting or repairing armor after a tough battle.</p>

<p>Survival won't be easy though. Ashenfall is home to forgotten secrets and legendary RuneScape monsters, which means there be dragons. Where there's dragons you can also reliably find fire, chaos and the increased chance of being eaten. The task of defeating the Dragon Queen is on your shoulders though, so best to get over any fears about the last fact pretty sharpish. </p>
<p> Luckily, there does seem to be some popular RuneScape characters on hand to help (or at least, people who resemble them). Pretty sure I spotted the Wise Old Man wearing his definitely legally acquired party hat…</p>

<p>On the development of RuneScape: Dragonwilds, Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy has said: "From the very beginning, community feedback has been at the heart of RuneScape: Dragonwilds."

Bellamy added closed alpha tests have already been conducted and Jagex will be "listening to player feedback when building the game throughout Early Access". </p>
<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds will launch in Early Access in Spring 2025. Though you can add it to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1374490/RuneScape_Dragonwilds/">Steam wishlist</a> today and, if you'd like to learn more, there will be a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/RSDragonwilds">Twitch livestream</a> covering the game at 5pm (BST) on Tuesday 15th April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/639509/unity-matt-bromberg-runtime-fee-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, I’m talking with Matt Bromberg, who is the CEO of Unity, one of the leading video game development platforms. He’s been in the job for less than a year, and in many ways, he is the perfect <em>Decoder </em>guest.</p><p>Unity is one of those companies that we love here on <em>Decoder</em> because we interact with its products all the time, but the company itself is somewhat hidden from view. Unity doesn’t make or publish its own games. Instead, its core product, the Unity game engine, is what all kinds of games — especially mobile ones — run on. If you play games on your phone, which you probably do, you’ve used a product built with Unity. It’s not just on phones by a long shot, and you’ll hear us talk about that quite a bit, too, but Unity as a company is what makes a core part of the mobile phone experience work.</p><div><p>Listen to <em>Decoder</em>, a show hosted by <em>The Verge</em>’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/welcome-to-decoder/id1011668648?i=1000496212371&amp;itsct=podcast_box&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ls=1&amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;ct=verge091322">here</a>!</p></div><p>That’s a <em>Decoder </em>all by itself, but Bromberg took over the job of CEO in a moment of crisis, and he’s made significant changes to the company since. You’ll hear him describe Unity as being “at war with its customers” before he joined, and he’s not wrong. The former CEO, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/18/23269218/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-apology-game-developers-fucking-idiots-ironsource-merger">John Riccitiello</a>, led the company through a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">major pricing model change</a>, called the runtime fee, that was going to raise costs for many of its customers. The communication around that pricing model change was also, frankly, terrible. Unity developers were in open rebellion, leading to Riccitiello’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/9/23910441/unity-ceo-president-john-riccitiello-out-retire">resignation</a> and, eventually, the company’s decision to scrap the runtime fee altogether.</p><p>So you’ll hear me ask Bromberg about his decision to walk the fee back after he joined, because it was clear to him even before he took the job that he would need to make that choice if there was going to be a Unity left for him to run. And you’ll hear him explain that while deciding to make such a big change was easy for him, working out how to execute that change slowed him down a bit.</p><p>Bromberg’s in charge of Unity during a moment of contraction for the game industry overall — studios are closing, and some big bets on things like the Metaverse and live service games haven’t paid off. So we talked about all that and where he sees growth ahead: Unity isn’t just a game engine provider, but the platform for everything running those big live services and the monetization on top of that.</p><p>One note before we start, because it really grabbed me: Bromberg’s one of the first CEOs to come on this show and disagree with me about the importance of structure. I tend to think of a company’s org chart as a proxy for its culture and its tradeoffs. I’m always saying that if you tell me your org chart, I can guess 80 percent of your problems, and so we joke that <em>Decoder </em>is really a show about org charts. But Bromberg told me he thinks culture isn’t enabled by structure. You’ll hear what he means.</p><p>Unity CEO Matt Bromberg. Here we go.</p><p><em>This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.</em></p><p><strong>Matt Bromberg, you are the new CEO of Unity. Welcome to </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Thank you so much for having me. It’s really my pleasure.</p><p><strong>I am very excited to talk to you. This is a perfect episode of </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>: You are less than a year on the job as the new CEO. You took over, you made a bunch of changes to the company, you restructured the company, you hired a new C-suite, you used to work for the old CEO — and then, Unity itself is a very core piece of technology that I think is under-covered. So, it’s like a perfect episode. Thanks for joining us.</strong></p><p>You bet.</p><p><strong>Unity really is kind of under-covered. It’s on everyone’s phone: Everyone has games on their phone, and Unity is almost certainly powering those games. What is Unity? What are game engines?</strong></p><p>Game engines are effectively the thing that developers use to build games. And maybe that’s obvious, but the technology is pretty deep and pretty complex. Unity is a platform where developers can aggregate all the tools, technologies, and content they need to build interactive applications. And yeah, to your point, it’s a really important tool in our world. About <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/mobile">seven out of every 10</a> mobile games in the world are built on Unity. About 30 percent of the [top 1000] PC games in the world. Seven out of 10 best AR games were built in Unity. Last night, or two nights ago, at GDC, eight out of 10 of the top independent games that won awards were built on Unity. We’re an important partner in that ecosystem.</p><p><strong>There’s a lot of history in game engines and investments in game engine development. A lot of companies that made popular games and then thought they could peel the engine out of those games and turn that into a business; that’s worked or, mostly, not worked in various ways. Unity is just an engine company. You’re not trying to make consumer-facing games.</strong></p><p>That is correct. We do a little bit. It’s funny you should say that. Generally speaking, that’s absolutely true. We are not a game developer <em>and</em> a publisher. We have recently been doing more development ourselves on a couple of projects. But only to ensure that our tools are production-ready and dogfooding what we’re doing. We have an expert team that does some of that, but it’s really about feeding back into our development process more than trying to be a games company. I was the chief operating officer at Zynga for a lot of years —I know what it is to run a games company. I think it can be very hard and unnecessary to try to run a games company and an engine company.</p><p><strong>I made that comparison explicitly because your biggest competitor is Unreal Engine, which is Epic Games. Epic is a games company, they’re the </strong><strong><em>Fortnite </em></strong><strong>company. They’re doing both, and then they’re expanding their engine into Hollywood, into automobile design, all this other stuff. You seem pretty narrowly focused on games still. What do you think about that competition?</strong></p><p>There’s a lot to unpack there. First, there are increasingly lots of applications of Unity outside of gaming. And in fact, <a href="https://unity.com/industry">what we call industries</a> is the fastest-growing part of our subscription business.</p><p>But we are, to your point, much more focused now than we were before. We were chasing sort of everything: Hollywood, architects, digital twins for building nuclear reactors, and all sorts of things. Right now, we’re really just focused on a few core verticals.</p><p>For example, most of the <a href="https://unity.com/news/unity-chosen-by-toyota-motor-corporation-for-next-generation-hmi">in-dash experiences in cars</a> are built on top of Unity. If you think about the little computer that’s in the dashboard of your car, it feels a lot like a phone or some other small device. And that’s really our strength to be able to design and develop interactive experiences for those things. [We work in] virtual, retail, and lots of applications on the manufacturing floor, so we do a fair bit outside of gaming.</p><p>I guess the other thing to understand is that Unity as a platform is focused on making games, but we are the only company in the world that helps developers through the whole lifecycle of development. From prototyping through building, operating in life service, and then crucially to acquiring new players, monetizing, and inventorying your games. The big second piece for us is the advertising and marketing piece. It’s a piece that we think grows really organically out of our core business, which is about deeply understanding consumers, and helping developers build for those consumers. And then when they turn to that next phase where they need to acquire players, we’re also there to help them.</p><p><strong>I kind of understand why all the car makers use Unity. They under-spec the processors in their cars, and the closest comparison to that is a mobile phone, which is power constrained. I don’t think a car is power constrained; I think they’re just cheap, but there they are. They’re just using under-specced mobile processors to drive their dashboards. Unity is a great engine for mobile phones. It makes sense that you just expand in that direction.</strong></p><p><strong>But that’s not games, right? That’s just another set of constraints that looks familiar, so you end up there. When you talk about games, we’ve just gone through an apocalypse of live service games recently. That industry doesn’t seem as predictable. It doesn’t seem like the games industry knows where its next set of growth will be, or how many people it should employ quite broadly. There’s some big change there that it feels like I can’t draw the line as quickly as I can to the expansion into cars, right?</strong></p><p>Yeah, listen, there is a lot of consternation about the video game industry. I’m someone who shares that. I’ve been around long enough to know that towards the end of hardware cycles, everybody’s throwing up their hands and saying, “Gee, I don’t think gaming’s doing so well.”</p><p>I’ve been through this cycle several times. Here’s what happens: Creative people innovate, and they make new experiences. Those experiences explode into hits, and that drives growth. That has always happened. I think the pain that we’re feeling right now in the industry is principally a pain born of creative destruction, so I accept that there’s been a fair bit of pain. There’ve been a lot of layoffs and other really unfortunate things. I think that’s about folks reimagining themselves for the future. The explosion of new devices and new experiences is going to be the gateway to that innovation.</p><p>The thing about Unity is… It’s not so much that we’re optimized to run on low-spec phones, it’s that when you build any experience in Unity it can operate at a really high level of performance fidelity anywhere. And that’s where consumers are moving. We used to be in this world where, and I remember this… I worked at Electronic Arts for many years. We were in this world where folks believed that visual fidelity and high-quality visuals were the primary things that video game consumers wanted, and they were obsessed with it. And I think what we’ve realized now is: that’s not what’s driving the consumer. I don’t think it ever has been what’s driving the consumer. We’re really proud of the quality of our visuals, but what drives consumer adoption is gameplay innovation. And all that is what’s going to drive this industry forward. I’m hugely optimistic about it.</p><p>Keep in mind, again, web games, AR, and VR. We’re going to get a new Nintendo platform. We’re going to get new Sony and Microsoft platforms. Phones are going to become ever more powerful. You’ve got dual-screen phones. The form of games will change, and the nature of them will change, but the appetite for interactive experiences, to my eye, has not lessened in any way.</p><p><strong>Just in the context of what a game engine is, what you’re describing here is: Let’s say I have an idea for a game. I see a market that’s changing. Unity is going to provide me with the physics engine that lets me build the game, with the ability to render the game in high fidelity across a number of platforms. And that number of platforms is important because a game needs to be everywhere now. You’ll operate the live service that lets people connect and play multiplayer, and then you’ll help me monetize the game by putting ads in it. Which part is the hardest right now? Because it seems like the games industry is “every part is the hardest,” and it seems like you have a much clearer view. What do you think is actually the hardest part?</strong></p><p>My experience of making video games for many, many years — which is what I did before I came to Unity — is that generally speaking, especially for game publishers of any scale, there’s a really simple equation. At the end of every year, they look at their P&amp;L and say, “How much money can I spend next year making new things?” They usually have a big life service or many, and that’s what’s kind of driving forward the business on a day-to-day basis. But the video games world is about hits and about new experiences, and you have to make investments. You also have to control and modulate those investments. The most important equation is people and time. If it takes me, if it’s 300 people and three years to make a game, versus 50 people and a year, that equation is very, very different.</p><p>The amount of innovation I can afford, the amount of new starts I can afford, and the amount of marketing I can afford, are very different in both equations. To me, when I think about Unity’s place in the world and where we can be the most help, it’s there. We’re a proud tools provider. We help video game developers make games, hopefully, as efficiently, quickly, and easily as possible so they can spend more time creating innovation. And if we’re really good at our job, they can have more starts, because they’re moving more quickly and they can do it more efficiently. And that’s the role I’d love to see us play there. And then to your point, as many new starts as we can get out there, great. Now we’ve got to go out and find new players. So, that’s the flywheel you want to see.</p><p><strong>Let me ask one more kind of existential question. I want to get into the changes you’ve been making here. I feel like every industry, but in particular, the games industry got fundamentally confused by the combo platter of the pandemic and <em>Fortnite</em>. Meta was like, “We’re all going to wear headsets all day long in our house.” And I don’t know, it doesn’t seem like that’s happening. A bunch of companies thought, “Okay, we can see all these people playing <em>Fortnite</em>. The future of live music is going to happen in video games, and we’re going to build these huge live service multi-experience games, and everyone’s going to spend all their time in them.” And all that’s left from what I can tell, that’s sustainable, is <em>Fortnite</em>. There’s not another <em>Fortnite</em>, and that drives a lot of your competitor’s business. That drives a lot of Epic’s business. Do you see that as a mistake that the industry is correcting, or do you see other games being able to reach that level and then go even one step farther into, “Okay, we’re having true metaverse experiences”? Because I don’t see that anywhere right now.</strong></p><p>I don’t think about it exactly that way. Listen, I think that the pandemic more than anything pulled demand forward. It pulled about a couple of years of consumer demand forward, and then we did see some natural slackening after having pulled all that forward. And I think that part of the dynamic is obvious.</p><p><strong>Meta renamed the company, and they were like, “We’re not Facebook anymore. We’re Meta now.” And I don’t know if that’s paid off for them.</strong></p><p>I was never a massive believer in the metaverse during that period of time. I’ll tell you why: Because, as a game maker, I experienced all those new platforms and just thought they were garbage. And I thought, “This looks like the games we tried to make 15 years ago. There is no way that’s a sustainable consumer experience.” All sorts of metaverse companies — I was completely confused by them. Having said that, I actually continue to believe, and I see the vibrancy of big live service platforms and communities as being fundamental to the games business. I mean, yeah, <em>Fortnite</em>, but Roblox, FIFA, and every game… Every major company has many enormous live services with millions or tens of millions of players. And in some ways that is the fundamental feature of the video game business right now — 80 percent of the people are deeply invested in this experience that they’ve been playing for years.</p><p>And I think one of the challenges now is, “Okay, how do I get those folks to move to something new?” I think that’s the push-pull that we’ve had. But I see platforms, communities, and interactive communities of gaming continuing to dominate and explode. And I do think we’ll see some new things. I think we’ll see innovation, some lighter experiences that will begin to challenge those. But I wouldn’t confuse the failure of the metaverse with some lack of sustainability in major life service gaming.</p><p><strong>That’s a connection that has always been the most interesting to me. If you believe that the world is going to be big live service games, it’s not that much of a jump to say, “And we’ll all wear headsets all day long.” We’re spending time virtually which will just get more immersive. That’s a straight line. But it seems like we didn’t hit the first spot.</strong></p><p>No, I think some of that has to do with — again, put aside the idiocy of some of the metaverse stuff… The future, to some degree, is going to be tied to massive consumer adoption of peripherals, or maybe that’s an old-fashioned word for it, but new devices. I’m an enormous believer in AR, for example. I think that one of the things that happened during the course of the pandemic and the couple of years since is we’re starting to get closer and closer with every rev to something that’s real here. I have no doubt that a couple of years from now everybody’s going to be wearing AR glasses. And how long has it been since Google Glass came out? But the combination of AI and voice, which enables really easy interactions with the form factor, the battery life that is now possible, and the ability to overlay information and services in front of your eyes, to me, is obviously going to explode.</p><p>And we’re going to look back and think about the time when we kept reaching into our pockets to pull out this thing for everything, it’s going to seem quaint. But it takes a long time to get true mass consumer adoption of these devices because it all has to be perfect. But once it hits, it explodes.</p><p><strong>You’re a glasses wearer. I can see you wearing your glasses. I wear contacts. My theory is that you have to deliver far more value than is required to care for whatever you mount to your face. And glasses deliver an extraordinary amount of value. I’m horrible at maintaining my glasses; they’re very scratched, they’re very dirty. I wear them just to go to bed. I don’t have to care for them, but they deliver. I’m allowed to see, that’s a huge value amount.</strong></p><p>But you go outside in the sun and you put on sunglasses, right?</p><p><strong>But I only get value at that time. I don’t come back in and keep wearing my sunglasses, which is what I think Meta wants me to do. I think they want us to believe that transition lenses are going to be cool, and maybe they’ll pull that off. Who knows? Mark Zuckerberg’s wearing a chain. He’s got a haircut. Maybe he’s going to pull this off.</strong></p><p>Well, we will see.</p><p><strong>My point is, right now the most compelling AR experience is way down on the curve, right? It’s actually the Vision Pro, which is a huge thing that has an external battery and limited app support. Do you see, when you put on the Vision Pro, “Okay, I can get from here to there if the hardware improves on some curve?” Because when I reviewed it my conclusion was, “We’re racing down a dead end. This is the best pass-through VR that I’ve ever seen, and we should not keep doing this. It’s never going to get better than this.”</strong></p><p>We partnered with Apple in the creation of that device. And I would say this, I would not… History is littered with first-generation devices that seemed absurd and then in another form became ubiquitous. And I do fundamentally believe that when the device form factors get right, consumers will adopt them. I do think it’ll be a mix though. I think one of the things we learned is that there’s a pretty high bar for folks wanting to isolate themselves completely from the world. And that’s why. When I think about AR, I think that the first mass-adoption devices we’ll see will be those that allow people to continue to be social and interact in the world while overlaying or enhancing that experience. Completely absorptive experiences have… I think folks will engage in those things, but there’ll be a time and a place for it. So, my view of that device was that it was a first swing. And also, by the way, Apple has a very long history of that as well. The first generation of devices is not necessarily the thing that takes off. So, I continue to be hugely encouraged by that.</p><p><strong>Are you of the view, I think the cliche was, that this is a simulator for the thing they want to actually build?</strong></p><p>I don’t know. I mean, I guess maybe that would be something you’d say after you’ve shipped it, maybe it didn’t go quite as well as you’d want to. But I applaud their willingness to put a stake in the ground, get out there with something, and then go back to the drawing board and continue to invest. At the end of the day, all of us making technology products need to do that. So, pushing the envelope for me is a good thing.</p><p><strong>I ask this, because again, with the games industry as it is currently configured, we are at the end of a console generation. It appears to be restructuring, reconsolidating in some ways, and falling apart in other ways. It was <a href="https://unity.com/events/gdc">just GDC</a>. There’s just a lot of turmoil when you get the whole games industry in one conference center and talk about the future. And the big bets, like “We’re all going to play a bunch of AR games,” while <em>Pokemon Go</em> just got sold. A lot of the big bets seem to be structurally changing.</strong></p><p><strong>Unity obviously plays a part in that. But the sugar rush of the pandemic led Unity itself to make big decisions about how much demand there would be that fundamentally you’ve had to undo. The decision to charge the runtime fee feels like your predecessor as CEO was saying, “Okay, there’s going to be this much more demand for all this stuff. I can now extract a toll.” Do you see that in that framework?</strong></p><p>I don’t. I don’t. By the way, I also don’t, fundamentally… I believe in the vibrancy and growth of the video game business, which, by the way, is still growing nicely and continues to be larger than streaming media, streaming music, and theatrical distribution combined. And this you will grow in high single digits, or maybe low double digits. I see this business as really vibrant. I don’t think the things that Unity has done in the past were sort of a ... And frankly, the other folks were a direct response to demand… I accept it maybe as folks staffed up across the industry and then demand slackened a little bit. I don’t think that’s so much this year, but maybe in the year before — you had some dislocation.</p><p>But I think for us, the thing about Unity which is spectacular and fascinating, is that we sit at the intersection of so many powerful forces: 3D, digital advertising, interactive entertainment, AI, I could go on. And you could convince yourself that you have a meaningful role to play in all of that. Because we have this platform and this engine, this tool that is connected deeply to all those powerful forces. But you have to make choices in the world if you want to execute at an exceptionally high level. And the way we’re thinking about this business now is that we are going to make some really focused choices, hit the ball out of the park around those things, kind of re-earn the trust of customers, be better partners, and deliver at a much higher level. And that all good things are going to come from that. Which doesn’t… It’s great to be expansive, but if you want to deliver, you have to make choices.</p><p><strong>I think this is a perfect transition to what I think of as the </strong><strong><em>Decoder </em></strong><strong>questions. I want to start with a quote. You </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-want-to-be-a-fundamentally-different-and-better-company-says-new-unity-boss-as-unity-6-launches"><strong>gave an interview to IGN</strong></a><strong> where you said, “We want to be a fundamentally different and better company. It is what we want. We have to have a fundamentally different relationship with our customers and our community. We want to develop and deliver products in a fundamentally different way. And that starts with you thinking about it differently.”</strong></p><p><strong>One of my ideas for the show is that structure is a proxy for culture. You have to build a corporate structure that enables the culture you want. You’re basically talking about totally transforming the company, in that quote. Everything has to be different, down from how you deliver the products to what your relationship with the customer is. You’ve been there less than a year. How have you restructured Unity to get to the culture you want?</strong></p><p>It’s funny. Culture is a really interesting thing. And the way I think about culture is that I think it’s actually fundamentally backward-looking in a way. What I mean by that is, when we think about our culture in the context of a company, we usually, what we’re usually doing is saying, “Hey, we got together to do this thing and it went pretty well.” Now, let’s stop for a second and look backward and ask ourselves, “How were we behaving? What were our values while we were doing that? Because it went pretty well. Let’s write those down, and we’ll put them on a mug or a T-shirt,” and those are going to be … that’s how we’re going to talk about our culture. That’s not a criticism from my perspective. I just think that’s usually this thing where we look back to understand how we’re behaving. And because it’s worked.</p><p>And so, the way I think about transforming culture is about setting really clear expectations and communicating more than anything an approach and an expectation about how we’re going to behave with one another. What’s going to count as the way we do what we do? How do you know you work here? Because every great company feels that way. Like, “Hey, this is how we do.” When you unpack that idea, folks get clear on that, having a common view of it. But having that view be authentic to the actual experience is important. For example, on my first day there was a lot of pressure to do the kinds of things that you’d expect in a big company. “Hey, we should send out new values.”</p><p>I don’t do that. Because how do I know? I just got here, I haven’t met anybody, we haven’t done anything yet. How about let’s work together, let’s get to know each other. Let’s figure out how. And then we go back in an authentic way that’s actually connected, in a way that isn’t about mugs and T-shirts. Can we get to a short list of what we expect of one another? And that’s sort of how I think about culture.</p><p><strong>It’s interesting you say that. It reminds me that when we started </strong><strong><em>The Verge</em></strong><strong> 13 years ago, we used to argue endlessly about what a </strong><strong><em>Verge </em></strong><strong>story would be. And now our audience knows, right? And that’s a backward-looking reflection of how we made some definitions and held onto them, communicated them. But you have also restructured the company. You have a new COO, you have a new CTO, you have a new CFO — that’s an entirely new C-suite. You’ve rethought how the company should work. What are the changes that you’ve made?</strong></p><p>The first and most important thing for us was to reinvest in the relationship we had with customers and to be a better partner. We were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development">at war with our customers</a>, effectively, when I arrived. Folks were boycotting us. They were really unhappy with how we were charging them and how we spoke. And you can’t have a business where we’re your customers. That’s insane. The first thing was to take a breath and reorient ourselves around being good partners, around authentically trying to deliver, to listen to people, and authentically trying to deliver what they need as the primary touchstone of what drives our behavior. And I know that, in a way, that sounds obvious and like a cliche. But some organizations do that and some don’t. The process of coming to understand in an authentic, but also accurate, way what signals to listen to and respond to is more complicated than it seems. But the first piece was to be better partners.</p><p>The second piece, to your point, was I wanted us to lead differently. I wanted our organization to be different and to have different values. And in my experience, the fastest way to do that is to make changes at the top. Especially, by the way, if you think you might later have to change the rest of the organization, what is soul destroying for people is when somebody comes into a company that’s having a little bit of difficulty and they start restructuring the company and they leave the management layer intact and they think, “Well, hang on a second, who is responsible for all this stuff? How do we skip over the folks who were in charge?” And suddenly like, “I’m taking it in the neck. How did that happen?” If you want different outcomes, if you want different approaches, some of it’s changing culture, but a lot of it is changing people.</p><p>And especially if you want to do it quickly, you can’t be afraid, because you need alignment. You need instant and immediate alignment if you want really fast results. So yeah, we changed a lot of leadership. Then, I think about the other things we did… We did some important things in our business, which we can talk about if you want to, just in terms of we needed to make certain investments, especially in our advertising business and other things. But putting those aside for a second, the third big thing from a culture and a company perspective was that I think we went about trying to redefine how we do what we do. And honestly, that is my obsession. I am someone who believes that the <em>what </em>is a lot less important than the <em>how</em>.</p><p>If you have the how right, all the what’s will go better. And you have to ask yourself when you come into any organization, if that organization is not organically producing really high-quality answers all the time… What you should not do is run around trying to tell people what to do and ask them to do it differently. There’s no leverage in that. There’s no leadership in that. There’s no inspiration in that. What you need to do is ask yourself, “Why is that? How come this organism doesn’t produce good answers?” And start to get into the how and start to fix the how and then you start getting better answers. That’s the key to transformation.</p><p><strong>Those ideas are in a little bit of tension. Let me just push you on that.</strong></p><p><strong>There’s the notion that you came into the company, you didn’t want to impose culture from the top down. You wanted to wait and see and diagnose the problem of how the company made choices. And then there’s a need to move fast in taking out all this old management, putting in new people, and you have to have a vision in order to go hire all those new people and change fast. Those ideas are in a little bit of opposition.</strong></p><p>You’re right, you’re right. Totally fair. You have to listen. The truth is you have to do both. And you have to do both in a way that is authentic and effective. I am generally very, very clear and we as a team are very, very clear about what we want to do and what we think the right direction is. But here’s where they’re not in conflict: It’s the process through which you get clear about what you want to do, which is where all the action is. So, it’s not, “Hey, here I am, here’s what we got to do.” It’s much more about, “Hey, here I am, help explain to me how we got here.”</p><p>What do you do? What are the challenges? How do you guys see this? You fly all over the world, you talk to customers, you meet with everyone you can inside the company. You have hundreds of conversations, hundreds. Because in the beginning when you get here, you have no idea. If you’re being honest with yourself, you ought to have no idea what to do. Where you get that inspiration is through the coalescing of the hundreds and hundreds of conversations.</p><p>And at least what I experience is, I begin to understand where the areas of energy are and where the areas of opportunity are. And so then, when you show back up, and you stand up in front of people and you say, “Hey, here’s the direction I think we ought to go in.” It doesn’t feel like something you came up with by yourself in a room with a legal pad. It’s a reflection and an echo of what you heard from all the assembled people. It’s organic to what you’re doing, and it’s a byproduct of listening as opposed to stuffing it on top of people. And that’s why if you do it that way, it ought to be better.</p><p><strong>You are the new CEO, but you also used to work for the old CEO: John Riccitiello was the CEO of Electronic Arts when you worked at Electronic Arts. Then he became the CEO of Unity, and you replaced him. What did you learn about what not to do or what to do from that experience working for the old boss?</strong></p><p>John actually hired me in my first job in video gaming, back in — well, it wasn’t my first job in video gaming. He hired me at Electronic Arts in 2012. I learned a lot of what I learned about this industry from him, and have an enormous amount of respect and admiration for him, so I have really no inclination to sort of pick apart what he did or didn’t do.</p><p>The world is a new place now than it was four or five years ago. Unity is a new company and we’re pursuing a different direction.</p><p><strong>All right, it was worth a shot! So, you made some changes to the top. I think this is the big </strong><strong><em>Decoder </em></strong><strong>question: How is Unity structured now?</strong></p><p>Here’s the thing, and maybe you and I just won’t agree about this. I’m much less interested in structure than I am in behavior. And I’ll tell you why. I’ve worked in big companies, a lot of them over the years. My experience is that what people want to do, especially if they think they want to improve things, is they immediately go to an org chart. They go and they start moving things around. The truth is, if people are not properly oriented, if they’re not properly situated, if they’re not spiritually in the right place to do what you need to do, I don’t care what the structure is, it’s not going to work. And there is no right answer to structure. People think, “Hey, if I could just get it in the right shape, it’s going to be okay.” The truth is that some structures accelerate some outcomes and create different tensions, and other structures accelerate other outcomes and create other tensions. I tend not to think first about structure. I try to think first about the landing approach and behavior.</p><p>Once we get oriented around how we’re going to do what we’re doing and people start behaving differently, different things happen. If somebody comes to me, for example, and says, “You know the reason we can’t do this, it’s because this thing is over in this division and this thing is over in that division and they can’t talk to each other; they should be in the same division.” I have no time for that conversation. What do you mean? Do you have a phone for that person? Do you guys sit down and have a conversation about that? If we’re properly motivated, what difference does it make where it sits? Look, of course, I’ve restructured things and I’ve changed things, so again, I don’t want to, but in terms of orientation, I want to land one before the other because one I think is more substantive and more likely to fundamentally change things than the other, if that makes sense?</p><p><strong>It does. My joke on the show is that I always ask that question, because to your point, if you tell me your structure, I can abstractly tell you 80 percent of your problems. I can identify the trade-offs that come with various structures. And it seems like you are making different trade-offs. You changed the structure, which means there’s something you wanted to change in the trade-offs you were making.</strong></p><p>Yeah, I’d say principally the change in the structure… The only meaningful changes we made were around reducing layers and making sure that everybody was communicating, and that we could quickly escalate any issues, make decisions, and move on. We always had the right folks in the room to operate in a unified way. And if ever there were issues, we insisted that they get escalated and resolved quickly. So if there was some organizational thing that made it impossible for us all to sit together, or if there were too many layers and I couldn’t see, we made some of those changes. And I do think those have been important, but again, not as important as the behavioral changes.</p><p><strong>Obviously, part of restructuring is shrinking. You’ve had a few rounds of layoffs now; last year, in January, </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030695/unity-layoff-staff-25-percent"><strong>25 percent of the company</strong></a><strong> was let go. You</strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610165/unity-layoffs-2025-runtime-fee"><strong> just had another</strong></a><strong> [round]. Is that all to get smaller to reduce those middle layers, or is there something else going on there?</strong></p><p>I wasn’t at the company for that really, really big one, but I will offer my strategy and my approach to these things. And I can already anticipate you’re going to tell me there’s a tension in them.</p><p><strong>Welcome to </strong><strong><em>Decoder</em></strong><strong>. The producers, by the way, joke that that is what the tagline is.</strong></p><p>Yeah. And by the way, that’s life, right? Nothing is black and white where it’s a Zen thing. But I never… We as a management team do not think about trying to get financial leverage by doing layoffs. I hate that. I think it’s nonsensical. What you have to do is make decisions and try to be really disciplined about the very few things you think you can do really, really well, and be a little bit ruthless about stopping the other things. And so for me, those kinds of restructurings are about putting your money where your mouth is as it relates to investing in the things that are important and ceasing the other things. </p><p>The thing I think that most leaders miss is, when they stand up and they talk about things that are important, what they don’t realize is that all they’re doing is adding another thing to people’s to-do lists. Because last week you said something else was important. The week before you said something else was important, and folks drown in those priorities. And nobody ever tells you what to stop doing, because that requires courage, and you probably wouldn’t be doing them if it wasn’t a pretty good idea at some point. </p><p>There’s a reason why people do things, but if you want organizations to perform really well, you have to be really, really clear about what you’re not doing, and then you have to put your money where your mouth is with respect to that. And sometimes there’s real pain associated with that, and it’s the unfortunate part about it, but in my experience, you come out the other end in much better shape.</p><p><strong>Here’s the other big </strong><strong><em>Decoder </em></strong><strong>question: How do you make decisions? What’s your framework?</strong></p><p>I’m a big believer in full transparency, context, sharing with people, and having them share with me everything they understand about something. And then holding that up and making a call. And so, for me, it’s about engaging in a really deep conversation, being sure we’re talking about the same thing that we understand at the same level. I expose all the thinking I have on a topic, I’d like you to do the same thing. And we balance the pros and cons and then we make a call and we move on. For me, it’s much more important that we make a decision, than it is what that decision is. And it goes back to what we were talking about before. I believe in the <em>how </em>more than the <em>what</em>. If it turns out that decision was wrong, we’ll make a different decision. But the thing that kills companies, especially large companies, is a lack of courage and clarity around making decisions. So, my thing about decisions is, mostly make them.</p><p><strong>That one comes up a lot. You are an interesting person to ask that question, because you came into the company and one decision that you had to make was obvious, I think, right? You said you came into a company that was at war with its customers, and that is </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development"><strong>because of the runtime fee</strong></a><strong> that your predecessor had announced, which has shifted the pricing model of Unity to a per-install fee. Every time someone installed the game, the developer would have to pay, which would skyrocket costs.</strong></p><p><strong>I don’t know why that fee was instituted. It was obviously a problem. Here you are, you’re the new CEO. You knew you were going to walk that back, right? But you’re saying the </strong><strong><em>how </em></strong><strong>was really important. Walk me through how you made this decision, where the outcome seems so clear.</strong></p><p>You’re absolutely right, and I appreciate you asking the question because I do think it’s a good example of what we’re talking about. I absolutely knew I was going to roll it back before I even took the job. The important part was not that I was going to roll it back, and not even so much how we were going to roll it back, but in the way in which we’re going to roll it back. For me, the most important thing, as I said, was, “Hey, I wanted to get back into a place where we were being partners with our customers.” And so, what I did was get on an airplane and started flying around, meeting with customers, and saying, “Hey, between you and me, we’re going to repeal this fee. I have some ideas about how, what do you think of them? Here’s what they are. If you want to vent about how upset you are about the old thing, that’s why I’m here too.” But I prefer to say, “If I did this, how would that strike you?”</p><p>And we started an open conversation. You have to select the folks you talk to because it is confidential. It’s important, you have to trust people. But we consulted and what we heard again and again was, “Hey, I accept that we’re not paying you enough. I actually think you’re delivering more value. I just hate the way you ask for the money. I don’t like the structure, I don’t like the tone. And by the way, if you’re going to raise prices, I need you to deliver better and execute better, because the two together strike me as aggravating.” And so, by the time… It took a little while, but it wasn’t a very long time. It was a few months and people were saying, “How come it took you so long?”</p><p>But it’s because I wanted to be sure we heard people and I wanted to be sure they understood that we were going to do things differently. We’re going to be disciplined, we’re going to communicate, we’re going to execute at a high level, and we’re going to listen. What came out of it was pretty sharp increases that, by and large, and listen, nobody likes to have prices raised... But we came out of it with a stronger bond with our customers, and the way we talked about it internally was equally important. Because to your point, we made this decision which was really ruinous for the company. You have to ask yourself, “How did that happen?” And so, how we make the new decision, how we have that conversation, who’s at the table? What kind of analysis do we do? What kind of feedback do we take? Getting into that and using that exercise to fix the organism and fix the process was equally important. It’s like, again, it was less about the thing and much more about using the thing to get healthy.</p><p><strong>Can you just, in a sentence, diagnose how the decision to impose the runtime fee was made since you looked into it? And then how the decision to pull it back was made since you made that one differently?</strong></p><p>I see Unity as a product company, and I’m a big believer that the way we create value is by delivering product value, and then folks will pay us for the value that we create. The thing about the runtime fee was that it was a business model. We were thinking about dynamics and how you can get people to do this versus that. If we raise one price here, then they’ll be forced to do that. That has nothing to do with creating value. That’s a trick. It’s a business model trick. It’s a hack. I don’t believe in that. I believe you create value by building better products. And so, the runtime fee decision was about, “Hey, we’ve got an engine business and we’ve got this ad business and we can’t exactly figure out how those two things would leverage one another and work together really well.” Okay, here’s a way. “I think we can structure a fee that brings them together and sort of encourages (which would be a kind word) folks to spend in one area if they spend in another.” I think customers found it more coercive than encouraging, but whatever. </p><p>My point is that, no… The way those two things come together is that both the developer part of our business and the ad part of the business depend on a deep understanding of consumer behavior. And just as folks who are building games need to understand how consumers are behaving in those games, in order to effectively acquire users, they also need to understand how consumers behave and that we can create product linkages and value there. That’s how we’ll drive value, and that’s substantive. I think that was sort of the distinction between the two approaches if that makes sense.</p><p><strong>When you rolled back the runtime fee, you increased prices on some of the tiers of Unity. It seems like those could go up independently if you think you’re delivering more value there. But they did go up pretty steeply as you mentioned. And then there’s a monetization side where you’re making investments in ad companies to help you deliver more monetization. There’s a tension there. You can see that increasing ad monetization helps you get more money if there are more installs, so you might want to lower the price on the engine to get more market share and compete there. But if you increase the price on the engine, you might just make more money upfront against this ad thing that you have to keep developing. How are you reconciling those things?</strong></p><p>I agree that there is a tension there. </p><p><strong>We’re going to make a Decoder game in Unity called </strong><strong><em>There’s a Tension There</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Any ad business at a high level thrives by opening the top of the funnel as broadly as possible. That’s what drives so that you’re left with something at the bottom of the funnel. That’s what ad-driven businesses do. And you’re right, there is some tension if you charge for the product, then presumably fewer people will use it, and then that’s not good. I think the important thing to understand about our structure is that Unity is free for everybody if you make less than a couple of 100,000 dollars in revenue. The top of the funnel is really big and broad. And there are millions of developers of Unity, and that’s why in the aggregate we have something like eight billion DAU (daily active users). It’s not deduped data. Cut it in half, say four billion people who are touching that Unity runtime in some way. So, it is hugely distributed. </p><p>I accept that if it was completely free, maybe you’d have more people using it, but again, keep in mind that you’re only paying us once your game is really successful. And as a percentage of what you’re making it’s not… it ought not to negatively impact you.</p><p><strong>That’s interesting because I’ve seen that dynamic play out on other platforms, particularly the app stores. Where you’re free to a point and then you tick over into the next tier of success and suddenly you’re paying a penalty — or what developers perceive as a penalty — for success, right? You’ve tipped over into the amount of revenue it would cause you to pay. And you actually have an incentive to stay just under a certain level of success in order to stop paying more money, in order to prevent paying more money. Do you see that dynamic in Unity?</strong></p><p>Listen, I think that, in general, our customers and the community understand that in order to invest in the engine, it’s important for us to be able to charge folks. And engines are very complex beasts and there’s a lot of engineering there, and there’s a lot of investment we make every year. And in general, I think there’s an understanding about that.</p><p><strong>The hard part of the ads business, particularly on mobile, is that you’re up against the platform vendors. Google is particularly interested in ads in various ways. Apple is not interested in ads in various ways. The mobile ad business, particularly in iOS, took a big hit from app tracking transparency.</strong></p><p>Apple is interested in their own ad business. Just to be clear.</p><p><strong>They’re definitely interested in their own ad business. They’re not interested in anyone else’s business. I think that’s a good call out. </strong></p><p><strong>But they made the ad business on iOS much harder with app tracking transparency. I think I would argue that they made the correct trade-off. They made it harder to track people across apps and platforms, the web, and mobile. I don’t know that anyone perceives that that has gotten better. I still feel awfully tracked. But it had an impact on, for example, Meta’s business to the tune of billions of dollars. Is that a challenge that the ad industry has overcome? Is that a challenge you’re still working on?</strong></p><p>I think it’s a challenge that largely the industry has overcome. It certainly had a meaningful impact. Different folks could be more or less cynical about what Apple’s motivations were or not. I don’t know. But I think now it’s largely in the rear-view mirror. And that in general, the systems have adapted.</p><p><strong>You mentioned Apple is interested in its own ad business. The other thing they’re particularly interested in is in-app purchases. Their services revenue line is the one that’s growing as iPhone sales taper or even decline. I look at a show like Severance or Ted Lasso and I say, okay, that’s the shiny face on a huge revenue line that is mostly in-app purchases and games, right? Candy Crush whales are the growing business, and we just get Ted Lasso for free because we don’t want to talk about in-app purchases and games in that way.</strong></p><p>I think 60 percent of the app economy is actually the game economy.</p><p><strong>How much pressure do the platform vendors put on that? Because across the non-game iOS app ecosystem, the developers we talk to are basically just in full outrage mode, right? Apple calls them, they call it a shakedown. You can see various developers argue loudly for and against Apple. Sometimes the rules change. Sometimes all of Europe’s issues or regulations change the app store. The games industry has not been as loud, right? The game makers… In-app purchases make everybody money, and it seems to be left alone. Do you see that same conflict or that same angst there?</strong></p><div><p>Well, I think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050696/epic-games-tim-sweeney-apple-app-store-response">Tim Sweeney</a> at Epic <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367904/epic-parody-apple-1984-ad-fortnite-removal-app-store">has been</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/8/23500363/tim-sweeney-epic-games-ceo-interview-apple-app-store-google-legislaton">exceptionally loud</a>, in fairness.</p></div><p><strong>That’s true.</strong></p><p>But listen, I think that there’s a tension there, Nilay.</p><p><strong>Are you all just following behind him? Are you just letting him take the heat?</strong></p><p>Apple and Google are incredibly important partners to the industry. And they’re incredibly important partners of ours. They’re platform partners. They’re partners to our customers, and so there’s a tension. I think it’s probably a brilliant flash of the obvious to learn that folks would rather pay less. But I think what you’re seeing in the industry is tension between folks who are relatively small in the scheme of the world, have important partnerships, and probably don’t have a lot of interest or incentive to be at war with their biggest platform partners.</p><p><strong>Right, that’s why I’m asking about Tim. I was going to come to that. Most game makers are not willing to be at war. He is, because he has </strong><strong><em>Fortnite</em></strong><strong>, and that’s just a weapon that he can wield or shield, I suppose, from attacks he might face. No one else has that as far as I can tell. Is the industry just waiting to see what happens with Epic, or is there anything else concerted going on? Because I would say the pressure from the platforms is coming in different ways, particularly as different countries around the world regulate their fees and how open they have to be. They’re going to seek that revenue and games are already the largest portion of the revenue.</strong></p><p>I think your description of the landscape is accurate. There are clearly pressures, significant pressures, regulatory pressures in Europe, regulatory pressures in the U.S., lawsuits, alternative app stores, and new devices. These are all pressures. And I do think that that is a feature of the world we’re in right now, and I’m sure Apple and Google are feeling some pressure around those things.</p><p><strong>At the top of the episode, you were saying you perceive that there’s a lot of growth yet to come in the industry. You mentioned </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24284512/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-games-features"><strong>the Switch 2</strong></a><strong>. There’s a new console generation, there are new form factors, and potentially there’s new hardware that’s coming.</strong></p><p><strong>All of that is up against those pressures. That’s the escape valve. Apple can keep squeezing gaming on the iPhone for fees, but if you can escape and the business is actually on the Switch 2, that’ll relieve the pressure. If the business Ray-Ban AR games — let’s say that works — maybe relieves the pressure, you get some competitive relief there. What’s the number one relief valve that you see as being viable in the near term?</strong></p><p>Well, one of the things that’s really interesting in the most recent version of Unity we shipped has support for web GPU. I think web gaming is a really fascinating, really fast-growing part of our world, and it’s maybe a little bit back to the future. But I think that’s a great example of what you’re talking about.</p><p><strong>I see the web as an out for a lot of app store problems, and then there’s a lot of pressure on, are the browsers good enough? Are they being held back by the mobile vendors in particular? Do you see the browsers being held back? Is there something you want to do in the browser that you can’t do on a mobile phone?</strong></p><p>I think that as it relates to tools and standards there’s progress we need to make. But I’m optimistic about that, and again, I see web gaming exploding. I think we’ve largely got what we need, and you’re going to see more of it.</p><p><strong>Do you think that web gaming is on a phone, or on a desktop?</strong></p><p>I think principally you’ll be on your phone.</p><p><strong>So, you see people playing more games on mobile Safari.</strong></p><p>Why not?</p><p><strong>I think Apple at least thinks it’s “Why not?” That’s the problem.</strong></p><p>They might, well… I just think that the consumer will ultimately push people and partners where they have to be pushed. I think that. And I don’t know exactly how that’ll play out, but I don’t see Apple and Google as preventing web gaming.</p><p><strong>I’m curious because the other thing I see from our audience is, boy, people love building gaming PCs, and actually, that’s a relief valve in a way. People love the Steam Deck; that’s another relief that way. But it doesn’t seem like those are flickers of growth that would give you some relief from the pressure</strong>.</p><p>I am much more optimistic in a generalized sense about the industry than you are, so I wouldn’t say flickers and you’re making me feel sad about it. I don’t see it that way.</p><p><strong>I think the Steam Deck is real, but it’s not —</strong></p><p>It’s real. It sort of seems to be, it is what it is. It’s a sizable audience. I don’t know that it’s going to suddenly become more massive, a place of more massive consumer adoption. I think that we have… Gaming happens on your TV. It happens on your phone and happens on your PC. There’s overlap in some of those places. But we continue to be, I think, more of a lean-back society in the living room and a more on-the-go society than we are a sit-down-at-your-desktop society. I think you’ll see those two probably grow more quickly than the third.</p><p><strong>I want to be very clear for you and the listener, </strong><strong><em>The Verge</em></strong><strong> as an organization </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc"><strong>is very high on the Steam Deck</strong></a><strong>. I feel like if I didn’t assign other stories, we would only write about the Steam Deck. That might be the only thing that happens in our newsroom, but I also know who we are.</strong></p><p>We’re usually supportive of PC gaming too. As a tool, what we mostly think about is how can we ensure that whatever the new platforms are, we’re supporting them on day one so that developers can push to those platforms. We don’t have favorites. We don’t choose. We want to be everywhere, and that’s mostly how we think about that.</p><p><strong>The one thing that would change that is another idea that I think flashed really brightly, particularly during the pandemic, and then has maybe come back to Earth, which is the idea that we would stream the games. Unity would run on big data centers operated by Netflix or Microsoft or someone, and really what we’re doing is live-streaming video, which maybe requires a total re-architecture of the entire industry. Everyone loved this idea. This idea has not, I would say, panned out in any realistic way. Do you think it has a future?</strong></p><p>Not in the near term.</p><p><strong>Why is that?</strong></p><p>I don’t see it. I think the hurdles were a combination of technical, really hard problems to solve there. And I think it was a consumer solution looking for a problem that people didn’t have. It was like, “Well, I don’t know. I’m playing this game on my PlayStation or my PC. Why do I need to use my phone as a controller or get some other controller, because you want to delivery the game? I mean, okay, I downloaded the game last month. What are we talking about here?” I just don’t think consumers cared.</p><p><strong>I think there was some desire to play the games everywhere. I agree with you, it obviously didn’t happen. But the thing that really prevented it was that you couldn’t install a game streaming app on a mobile phone, which would have been, I think at least one thing to market as opposed to however the platforms wanted you to do it. Do you think if they opened that up it would become more viable?</strong></p><p>I don’t think, I don’t. Again, I think that the input device is maybe more important that people understand in this context. I don’t want to play Call of Duty on my phone with an external controller. And I want to pick a mobile version of Call of Duty, which is a different experience. I think different platforms should be developed as unique experiences. So, this idea that it was going to be this one version, which, I get it at a high level, at a technical level, but I don’t think consumers wanted it.</p><p><strong>I feel like I’m required by law to ask you about AI to wrap up this conversation. I have to say it’s been a relief to not be mostly talking about AI with a CEO. I appreciate that.</strong></p><p>I would never force you to talk about AI if you don’t want to.</p><p><strong>I appreciate it. If you listen to some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel">other episodes of <em>Decoder</em></a>, you can see, I’m just fighting it for an hour.</strong></p><p><strong>The games industry, like almost every creative industry, is in turmoil because of AI, right? The creatives are upset. We see video game voice actors <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630176/ashly-burch-sony-ai-horizon-aloy-tech-demo-sag-aftra-strike">putting out Instagram Reels</a> about having their voices cloned by AI for AI characters. You see entire games being made in AI. Actually, there’s a very funny video where someone claims a game is AI, but it’s actually just Elden Ring. That’s deeply amusing to me.</strong></p><p><strong>But you see this happening. I generated some simplistic game using AI. I </strong><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/26/silicon-valley-ceo-says-vibe-coding-lets-10-engineers-do-the-work-of-100-heres-how-to-use-it/"><strong>vibe coded</strong></a><strong> it here. I shipped it, we’re ready to go. And then you see the creatives in the industry really worried that their jobs will be taken over by AI. I know Unity is somewhat agnostic to this. I think that’s actually <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/unity-ceo-strives-for-execution-and-accountability-matthew-bromberg-interview/">the phrase you used</a>. “The Unity platform is agnostic to the derivation of the 3D asset,” but then there’s the actual making of the game. Then there’s who gets paid. There are layoffs across this industry for a variety of reasons and rethinking of cost structures. How do you see AI playing out?</strong></p><p>Yeah, this is a big topic and we could probably spend longer than you’d want to talk about it. I would say this, first, you’re right. We are agnostic with respect to where and how 3D assets get created because Unity is an assembly point. And it’s always been a place where you ingest or build the assets you want to build. You assemble the tools you want to assemble, and then you build these deep systems around them, which become fully formed games. I actually don’t think that any of the layoffs we’re seeing in gaming are driven by AI. I don’t think that. I think what video game developers and publishers will do, as we talked about a little bit earlier, is if they gain efficiencies in the making of games, I think they’ll make more games. And that’s where they’ll use that extra wiggle.</p><p>What we sort of believe will happen at the end of, maybe not the end, later in this process, is that there’ll be human creators sitting in the middle of the process of creation of these games, using a platform to create them. And they will have vertically oriented agents that are helping them do so. An agent that specializes in physics, an agent that specializes in sound, an agent that specializes in I.O., whatever it is. And there’ll be multiple people in that loop, and they will have those tools at their disposal, and they will need to bring them together in an interactive experience. We would like to continue to be at the center of that, and we think there is a need for a platform to be there. I think that it’s sort of a slightly Grognardian, boring point to make, but it’s critical. The biggest problem with either the creation of assets or even the full imagining of games, this hallucination of full game experiences, is that there’s no connection to workflows.</p><p>Games are massively deep systems, successful games, that need to be built around some of these assets and even some experiences. I think AI will be a really important part of putting those things together, but the systems, workflows, connections, how you manage large teams of people doing those things, and how we output and distribute those things — those are likely to be a part of this process for a really long time.</p><p><strong>We have talked about a lot of things that are pressure on the industry, and you’ve pointed out that you’re more optimistic. What are the things that are making you excited about the future of games right now?</strong></p><p>There almost isn’t anything that’s not making me excited about the future of games. Again, I see the difficulty we’re experiencing as this moment of creative destruction. One where the industry is going to have to reimagine itself to some degree, and that reimagination is going to take the form of innovation and gameplay, innovation and distribution, innovation and business models. And just we’re going to rethink. Just to take one example, because I think we haven’t talked about it, think about how meaningful game-related and actual property has become in the broader entertainment industry. That, by the way, was never true, until very recently, right? There had been a million unsuccessful movies and things that related to games, very few good ones. Now, suddenly there’s this whole other life. We’ve talked about some of the new possible distribution platforms, the shifts in the business models, and platform partners. All these things are opportunities. And yeah, we as companies… You feel pain and then you respond to that pain, and I think the history of the industry is that we innovate through those things.</p><p><strong>Do you agree with me that </strong><strong><em>Uncharted </em></strong><strong>would’ve been better as a long-running series instead of </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/17/22937238/uncharted-movie-review"><strong>a movie</strong></a><strong>?</strong></p><p>I do.</p><p><strong>This is my thesis. Adaptations got good when we started making TV shows out of them, not movies.</strong></p><div><p>It’s easier. Yeah. I mean, even though I think <em>The Witcher</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill">was good as a series</a>, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23808594/the-witcher-season-3-volume-2-finale-review-netflix-henry-cavill">initially</a>.</p></div><p><strong>Spicy take.</strong></p><p>I know. I know. I’m sorry. I enjoyed it.</p><p><strong><em>Fallout</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p><em>Fallout </em>was great. Listen, I think there are a lot of things that are better in that form than a full movie form.</p><p><strong>All right, well, Matt, we’re going to have to have you back and only talk about video game adaptations for a full hour.

It’s listed as normally having a $99.49 MSRP, but you can get one for a very reasonable $69.99. While it lacks a built-in heatsink, making it a plug-and-play affair with PS5, you can buy a heatsink for about $10 (here’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Heatsink-Cooler-Double-Sided-Thermal-Silicone/dp/B09DBF8FX1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">one</a> of many examples) and easily add it on yourself with next to no technical knowledge required.</span></li><li><span>We’ve covered this deal before, but it bears repeating: you can get a good 48-inch OLED TV for just $549.99 at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://howl.link/fb2i4rixxpjc4">Best Buy</a>. This deal is on the <strong>LG B4</strong>, which unlike the previous generation B3 has four HDMI 2.1 ports instead of two. It also supports nearly all of the same gaming-savvy features found in the pricier LG C4, including a fast refresh rate (120Hz versus 144Hz in the C4), variable refresh rate, and Nvidia G-Sync support. It just doesn’t get as bright as the C4 with its HDR or SDR modes, which is, I feel, the most notable difference among the list compiled by the folks at <a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/lg/b4-oled#page-top:~:text=The%20LG%20C4%20OLED%20is%20better%20than%20the%20LG%20B4%20OLED">RTINGS</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A remaster of The Sinking City, the Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective game released back in 2019 by Frogwares on PC and consoles, has been announced today ahead of the end of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-qa-frogwares-on-renewed-combat-focus-ue5-switch-and-continued-war-impact/">sequel</a>'s <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-shows-off-gameplay-and-launches-kickstarter-campaign/">Kickstarter campaign</a> conclusion.</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the remaster, which will be available for free to all owners of the original game on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, will feature an upgraded visual experience, sporting 4K textures, new lighting, improved detail and reflections, 4K textures, support for NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and TSR upscaling and more. The Sinking City Remastered will also feature some requested quality-of-life features as well as a brand-new Photo Mode, providing players with plenty of reasons to dive back into the flooded city of Oakmont together with Charles Reed.</p>

<p>The upgraded visuals featured in The Sinking City Remastered will make the experience even more immersive, as the original game definitely nailed the atmosphere. Hopefully, the quality-of-life improvements will make the game more fun to play, especially the combat, which I found pretty lacking compared to the excellent investigation mechanics, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-sinking-city-strongest-fear-unknown/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Sinking City is probably the best Lovecraft-inspired game currently available on the market, thanks to its oppressive atmosphere and its story, which utilizes the lore masterfully without deviating from the canon. AI and technical issues, as well as the clunky combat, are often immersion-breaking, but the excellent investigation mechanics and exploration features make it easy to look past these issues. Highly recommended to survival horror fans and those who live and breathe Lovecraft.</em></p>
<p>The Sinking City Remastered launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

This is where their most obvious differences come into play: mobility and defense. The Heavy Bowgun, true to its name,restricts your hunter to pretty slow movement. For the cost of slow movement, however, this weapon lets you guard and even trigger a Power Clash against monster attacks.</p><p>The Light Bowgun doesn’t slow your hunter down and ends up feeling a lot smoother in comparison. It lacks the option to guard, but offsets this with fun movement options such as a sidestep and slide. Rapid Fire Mode expands upon these and incorporates a strafing dodge that lets you keep shooting called Burst Step.</p><p>I’ll also add that both weapons (and in particular the Heavy Bowgun) are great to use on your Seikret. Being limited to only standard fire and Focus Blasts while mounted isn’t that restrictive with so many ammo types.</p><h2 id="h46264"><a id=""></a>Rate of fire and damage</h2><figure id="" data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although the standard fire for either weapon can use the same ammo, there are still some important differences. With the Heavy Bowgun, you’ll deal with a slower rate of fire and strong damage numbers. The range for critical damage also tends to be a bit farther away from your targets.</p><p>All of that is naturally reversed with the Light Bowgun. Your shots come out faster, but they won’t hit as hard. I’ve also noticed that the critical damage range is comparatively closer across all ammo types.</p><h2 id="h46265"><a id=""></a>Special modes and ammo</h2><figure id="" data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each of these has access to a secondary firing mode and choices for Special Ammo.

When it comes to the Bowguns, some ammo types are just a better fit on one or the other. Pierce Ammo is arguably the best ammo type in the game and works well for either weapon. I’ve enjoyed using it on the Heavy Bowgun more, simply due to how much damage it does.</p><p>Ammo associated with elements or status ailments meanwhile shine with the Light Bowgun. Any extra elemental-based damage adds up nicely with all the rounds you shoot off. Similarly, it’s a lot easier to trigger a status effect when you’re constantly hitting a monster with status ailment ammo.</p><p>Both bowguns are fantastic tools that serve as excellent secondary weapons if you prefer having a melee as your primary.

<p>A Minecraft Movie is one of the biggest movie prospects in 2025, and while promoting it, Jason Momoa told journalists that he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa plays Garrett “The Garbage Man” Garrison in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-minecraft-movies-cast-in-the-game-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Minecraft Movie</a>. The character has become one of the most iconic images from each trailer. Aside from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-has-logged-more-than-100-hours-on-minecraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black</a>, Momoa is easily the biggest star power. It’s hard to see A Minecraft Movie not doing well, and it’s likely to help the already-enormously successful franchise.</p>



<p>While promoting A Minecraft Movie, Momoa shared fascinating details about his kids and specific strict measures he implements.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s a strict lifestyle. Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://x.com/Deadline/with_replies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Momoa was asked if his children play video games. The actor answered frankly: “We don’t have a TV, my son doesn’t even have a phone. He’s 16 and doesn’t have a phone—we’re different dude. Sorry, man.”</p>



<p>The actor explained that his son can have a phone when he turns 18, and “explore the world” after that. Momoa justified the decision by saying he wants his kids to “use their creativity in a different way.” He also adds that he didn’t grow up with a phone and “everyone was doing just fine” without them.</p>



<p>You can see the full exchange for yourself.</p>



<div><article><p><span>‘A Minecraft Movie’ star Jason Momoa on why he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones: “We’re different dude. I just want them to use their creativity in a different way”</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s a unique way of operating life, of course, but it’s interesting to see one of A Minecraft Movie’s key stars admitting he doesn’t let his kids play video games when he’s starring in an overtly video-game movie.</p>

<p>The Game of Thrones franchise is one of the most popular in modern entertainment history. Unfortunately, for as well-received as the books and shows have been, the games—for the most part—have left a lot to be desired. For developer Netmarble, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is an attempt to turn that around and release a new game in the series that will have people talking.</p>



<p>Sadly, the type of talking most people will have about this game is its uninspired gameplay and heavy monetization practices.</p>



<h2 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-early-access-review">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Early Access Review</h2>



<p>As the title mentions, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">currently in early access</a>. While the game will be free-to-play once out of early access, those who want to play now will have to buy one of three bundles of the game. The cheapest is the standard pack for $24.99 while the most expensive, the Ultimate Pack, costs $89.99. Each of the three packs come with access to the game along with various benefits like Iron Bank Marks, outfits, emojis, and even battle pass access for the two higher bundles.</p>



<p>Without giving away much in terms of spoilers, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s story takes place during the fourth season of the show. You play as a brand new character to the world who is the heir to House Tyre.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Getting started, you pick one of three classes—knight, sellsword, or assassin—and create your character using a pretty limited character creator. I mean, you can’t even make yourself bald. What’s up with that?</p>



<p>In and of itself, the story isn’t too bad. The dialogue is solid, and nothing feels out of place as you play. What does feel out of place, though, are the animations. In an area where the game feels exactly like a mobile game or something from the mid-to-late 2000s, everyone’s mouth either looks like it’s chewing the words being said or is nowhere close to how it should be. In some cases, you kind of feel like you are watching a 1970s kung fu movie with English voiceovers. And yes, I likely dated myself with that reference.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Moving on to gameplay, there’s nothing really special to write home about. It’s your typical action RPG with your basic attacks, special attacks, blocking, and dodging. Most of the moves look solid, but there’s no weight behind the attacks. Every swing of a weapon or kick you make just feels like you are swinging around the lightest paper towel tube. Even dry pool noodles feel like there’s more power behind attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other animations also feel janky, such as any movement in a diagonal direction. Whether you are running, walking or riding a horse, it all looks and feels like your characters are sliding around and/or floating. Like the attacks, there’s no weight behind what’s being done. It just all feels like going through the motion with no sense of reward for anything you do.</p>



<p>There are three different trait trees—attack, defense, and support—that you can progress through as you play. They add things like increased damage, mount stamina, parrying ability, and other skill improvements that you’d expect. They are fine for what they are, but the trees are so small that it just feels like something to be added to the game rather than help improve your play.</p>



<p>One other area with the game that bothers me is with your equipment. You can buy, find, and unlock better equipment like other games. But, when you equip them, you don’t see it. It’s there, but the only look you have is the basis of your character. Get a rare set of gloves to equip? They are there in stats only. Some might not care about it, but not being able to see the gear I’ve found is a major turn off with games like this.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-the-mobile-monetization">The Mobile Monetization</h3>



<p>Now onto what is, arguably, the most frustrating of the game: the microtransactions. First things first, this is going to be a free-to-play game, so in-app purchases are expected. However, there’s a way to do it right and then the way Game of Thrones: Kingsroad does them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As expected, there are various cosmetics that you can pay to unlock for your character. That’s the norm in almost every game, free or paid, at this point. The problem lies in some obvious cash grabs within the game right now.</p>



<p>Should you die and you want to revive with your health, it’ll cost you copper. Want to fast travel to an area you unlocked? It’ll cost you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Early on in the game it’s not too bad, but the further into the game you go, the more and more tedious it becomes. There are energy restrictions throughout, and timegating becomes a major concern that will make you feel like you wasted the dozen or so hours you have spent in the game to that point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game is advertised as co-op, but only dungeons are able to be played with friends. Oh, and that’s another area where an in-game currency is needed in order to access. It’s easy to continue on with the problematic monetization practices, but it’s not really worth rambling at this point.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review-verdict">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad Review Verdict</h3>



<p>Don’t let the fact that it’s available on PC fool you, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad is a mobile game. It looks like a mobile game and plays like one, too. While in 2025 that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s when it attempts to pass itself off as something more that it becomes an issue.</p>



<p>At this present moment, it’s hard to tell anyone not to hold off for the game to go free-to-play after the early access period ends. Even then, with the heavy—and I mean heavy—microtransaction push, the lack of exciting gameplay and frustrating animation issues, this is one trip to Westeros you’re better off postponing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: SKIP</strong></p>
