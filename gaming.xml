It’s an excuse to laugh at each other, celebrate small victories, glorious failures and delight in ruining your friends’ plans. The rules change every minute and the game doesn’t care about fairness; it cares about giving you stories to shout about afterwards and we’re really happy Wired Productions have joined us on our journey of chaos. To be honest, we wanted to make <em>WarioWare</em> but Nintendo already did that, so we made some friendslop instead.”</p><div id="carousel_996988"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p><em>Task Time</em> challenges up to eight players to compete across six frantic gameshow-inspired rounds where sabotage is encouraged, friendships are tested, and laughter is guaranteed.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Across six chaotic rounds, Tasklings can complete over 500,000 random task variations. One moment you might be solving puzzles, the next you’re blasting your mates with paintballs or scrambling across a collapsing map as the floor turns to lava. Whether you win or lose, every match is a story: ridiculous comebacks, glorious failures, and moments of sabotage you’ll be laughing about long after the round ends.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer and a set of gameplay videos below.

When we started working on <em><a title="Games > Outward [9 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/outward">Outward</a></em> in 2015 with our Kickstarter, we wanted to create the ultimate <a title="Genres > Simulation [843 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> of an adventurer’s life. With a small team of 11 dedicated people, we surpassed expectations and delivered something greater studios could not have achieved. With <em>Outward</em> 1 we learned a lot from our players, we improved from their feedback and gave them what they wanted with our downloadable content. We stayed true to our vision that they loved while elevating the experience of living a true adventurer’s life. Much better graphics, better immersion and better combat.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nine Dots Studio:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>The original <em>Outward</em>, which eclipsed three million players earlier this month, challenged conventional <a title="Genres > Open-World [741 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [17,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> by trading the typical power fantasy for an adventure that demands preparation, persistence, and tactical execution. <em>Outward 2</em> takes the formula that gathered a dedicated community and injects it with new and enhanced features fueled by the same intention and effort the developers ask of its players as they embark.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>An Average Joe On A Remarkable Journey</strong> – You’re not a hero of legend. Shape your modest and meager beginnings through three distinct starting scenarios and eleven backgrounds, which will determine where to start in this brutal world. Whether you’re a devout worshipper of Elatt trying to strike it rich as a miner or a vagrant deadbeat in Simeon’s Bastion, the world of Aurai will not be kind… not even in defeat. If you’re knocked out, your journey continues, and you must live with the consequences. You could be robbed and left to rot, be saved by a kind passerby, wake up in town badly injured, or… worse.</li><li><strong>A Living, Evolving World</strong> – A full-year seasonal cycle transforms the world of Aurai. Merchants and other NPCs relocate, frozen rivers become traversable in winter, and more. Comprising of four distinct areas, regions will feature their own biomes, seasons, and specific gameplay. From the blizzards of the Gilded Mountains to the acid rains in the Gathes of Catharsis, players will find a renewed challenge every time they travel.</li><li><strong>Growth Through <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>tery</strong> – Every factor in <em>Outward 2</em> molds your playstyle. Your tactical choices as a player, from the weight and material of your armor to particular weapons you use, are reinforced by the new <a title="Genres > Exercise [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/exercise">Exercise</a> system, where passive skills will spark and grow based on how you play. Seek out special trainers scattered around Aurai, who will teach you how to survive the most brutal encounters for a fee.</li><li><strong>Ritual Spellcasting and Tactical Combat</strong> – Wielding magic in <em>Outward 2</em> is no mere button press. Cast spells through rituals, like sending a fire stone into the air to create a ring around you that allows you to empower your skills with deadly flames. Challenging combat, where every weapon has its own distinct moveset, is further enhanced in the sequel with a larger variety of tools and weapon combinations, along with animations that bring more fluidity and control to players. Major combat improvements were cultivated based on extensive player feedback from the original.</li><li><strong>Intentional Inventory <a title="Genres > Management [33 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> -Your backpack is your lifeline, and every space within is worth its weight in gold. Pack provisions, potions, weapons, and camping gear for an expedition, but manage it carefully as you gather more along the way. Some discoveries won’t be worth the precious space. In a fight, you may want to drop your backpack to attack and evade more deftly. The sequel adds a mule you may earn to carry your wares throughout your journey, but its vulnerability may influence your path as well. Weigh each decision carefully.</li><li><strong>Two-Player Split Screen and Online Cooperative</strong> – Aurai is a grueling place, but you mustn’t go alone. Plan and prepare alongside a friend, covering each other’s weaknesses and marrying your strengths. Teamwork expands the opportunities and options for tackling the many challenges you will face in <em>Outward 2</em>.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Window Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="OUTWARD 2 - Official Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PKSH4d-iN-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/outward-2-launches-in-summer-2026]]></content:encoded>

              <p>If you’re a fan of LEGO sets featuring Harry Potter, Star Wars, and other pop culture icons, you probably already know they usually become collectibles rather than play sets. But when you must let your imagination run rampant and build anything you can imagine, nothing beats a big box of hundreds of colorful bricks.</p>
<p>With Prime Day coming in October, Amazon just dropped an unbeatable deal on a two-pack of huge LEGO Classic Creative Brick Boxes, which together total nearly 1,600 bricks: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4350/">The package is available for $78, reduced from the original $120</a>, which makes an all-time low on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4350/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Unleash Endless Building Possibilities</h2>
<p>This package has <strong>two large boxes with a total of 790 pieces in 33 different colors</strong>. That variety enables every builder of every age to construct anything ranging from simple toys like houses and scooters to more complex figures and castles. The bricks come with eight types of toy windows and doors to complete your constructions realistically, and six toy tires and wheel rims perfect for cars. These include two green baseplates of differing size-one about 6 inches square and the other, smaller-one-that serve as a stable base for imaginative play scenes.</p>
<p><strong>All the pieces are compatible with every other LEGO building set</strong> so this kit seamlessly fits into and expands your existing collection. Unlike theme-based sets that come with complex instructions and a single-minded focus, this creative brick box is all about open-ended play with no rules or limits. Kids can play with colors and shapes and refine their fine motor skills and spatial awareness in the process.</p>



<p>The packaging itself serves as a <strong>clever storage system</strong>, keeping tidy time simple at home or in the classroom. With <strong>nearly 30,000 reviews averaging 4.8 stars</strong>, customers appreciate the amount and quality of bricks, along with the creative freedom it provides for imaginative building sessions. This makes it a perfect gift option for girls and boys who love hands-on play.</p>
<p>With Prime Day discounts, this set provides you with <strong>double the bricks for close to half the price of one box</strong>. That kind of value is hard to find elsewhere, especially given the prolonged entertainment that you get out of this set. It turns playtime into a creative exercise that involves problem-solving and storytelling in a manner that is beyond a digital device.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The 9 Best Silent Hill Games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-9-best-silent-hill-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-9-best-silent-hill-games.1310866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill series has been at the forefront of feel-bad survival horror storytelling for close to three decades now, and with the success of 2024’s Silent Hill 2 remake and the recent release of Silent Hill f, it felt like the right time to take a look back through Konami’s catalogue of psychological horrors to see how each scarefest stacks up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, admittedly the series hasn’t been immune to the odd misstep here and there, and there have certainly been periods of time where things have gone more downhill than Silent Hill. Thus you won’t find the likes of forgettable mainline entries like Silent Hill: Homecoming and Silent Hill: Downpour here, or the inappropriately aggressive shoot ‘em up action of Silent Hill: The Arcade, or indeed the co-operative dungeon crawling of Silent Hill: Book of Memories that absolutely nobody asked for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all that in mind, here’s IGN’s picks for the very best entries in the Silent Hill series, from portable terrors to playable teasers.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Silent Hill: Origins</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-origins-1758725465973.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A Silent Hill adventure that can fit into your jeans pocket and still scare your pants off? That’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-origins">Silent Hill: Origins</a>, the 2007 prequel originally developed for the PlayStation Portable and later ported to the PlayStation 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its story taking place several years before that of the original Silent Hill, Silent Hill: Origins puts you into the shoes of Travis Grady, a truck driver who takes a wrong turn into North America’s freakiest fog-shrouded town, and things get appropriately hair-raising from there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes Silent Hill: Origins stand out from other instalments in the series is how it handles the exploration of the sleepy small town’s nightmarish otherworld. Unlike most other Silent Hill games that drag you kicking and screaming towards the jagged edges of the industrial nightmare realm when you least expect it, Silent Hill: Origins gives you full control in determining when and where you want to shift between realities via the use of special mirrors scattered around the town.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the one hand, this does diminish Silent Hill: Origins’ ability to surprise you with scares, but on the other hand it creates some uniquely creepy scenarios for puzzle-solving, such as examining the plastic organs of an anatomy mannequin in one reality, only to find that it’s an actual corpse in the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combined with a dread-inducing atmosphere on par with the foreboding feel of the original game, Silent Hill: Origins on PSP made for some truly terrifying train trips.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. Silent Hill 4: The Room</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-4-the-room-1758725491076.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it sounds like some sort of bizarre crossover between the much-loved survival horror series and director Tommy Wiseau’s infamous best worst movie ever made, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> isn’t quite as wild a departure as that – although it does shake up the formula pretty significantly. Shifting the terror out of the foggy streets of Silent Hill and into the new setting of Ashfield – specifically the locked-down apartment of protagonist Henry Townshend – Silent Hill 4: The Room alternates between claustrophobic, first-person exploration of Townshend’s home and more traditional third-person combat in the nightmarish otherworlds he can reach by stepping through the ominous holes in his apartment walls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These otherworlds serve as small pocket dimensions, each visually distinct and with its own story to tell, from the filthy, tiled circular hallways of the water prison to the abandoned hospital packed with a variety of disturbing dioramas. As the story progresses, the apartment you return to gradually evolves from safe haven to haunted house, as Townshend’s tracking of an undead serial killer gradually consumes his reality and the game’s skin-crawling atmosphere grows all the more oppressive.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the sudden switch in the story’s second half to an annoyingly dragged out escort mission proved to be divisive amongst fans, there’s no question that its cast of genuinely disturbing creatures, haunting original soundtrack from Akira Yamaoka, and the uniqueness of its decaying apartment hub made for arguably one of the most spectacularly tense Silent Hill adventures in the entire canon.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 4: The Room would also mark the fourth and final instalment in the series to come from Japanese developer Team Silent. That team would then disband, with its members going on to work on various other horror games like Forbidden Siren and The Evil Within, and it also saw the development of subsequent Silent Hill games shift into the hands of western developers with fairly mixed results… We’re looking at you, Homecoming and Downpour. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-shattered-memories-1758725527934.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all of the western-made Silent Hills have been bad, though. The only entry in the series to ever make it onto the Nintendo Wii, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-shattered-memories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a> from British developer Climax Studios reimagines the original Silent Hill and features the same premise: Harry Mason is the survivor of a car crash searching for his missing daughter in the fictional American town of Silent Hill. However, its plot unravels in an entirely new way and the gameplay is dramatically restructured, shifting between first-person psychotherapy sessions to the more typical over-the-shoulder explorations of Harry’s harrowing journey through Silent Hill.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shattered Memories is a tricky instalment to rank in the Silent Hill series, because it’s so unlike any other entry to date. It completely ditches combat, instead forcing Harry to flee in regular chase sequences inspired by the unstoppable antagonists of slasher movies. It swaps out the fog of previous adventures for ice and falling snow to limit player visibility and build an atmosphere of dread in interesting new ways. It also makes quite brilliant use of the Wiimote, using its motion controls to give players full command over the beam of Harry’s flashlight, and its built-in speaker for the hiss of the series’ signature radio static among several other unsettling bits of sound design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shattered Memories also profiles the player while they play, taking the answers chosen during the psychotherapy sessions to make subsequent changes to level and enemy designs, as well as altering how the story progresses and eventually determining which of the multiple endings you will arrive at. While this mechanic is yet to resurface in subsequent Silent Hill stories, Supermassive Games’ Until Dawn seemingly took a great deal of inspiration from it given its similar mix of psychotherapy sessions and slasher-style horror. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Shattered Memories’ writer/designer Sam Barlow (who also worked on Silent Hill: Origins) has since gone on to find considerable success as an independent developer with his critically acclaimed works of interactive fiction: Her Story, Telling Lies, and Immortality. All three involve solving a mystery by sifting through assortments of out-of-sequence video clips, which in a way are their own form of shattered memories.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Silent Hill f</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-f-1758725545341.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It took 13 long years for a new mainline Silent Hill game to emerge from the fog, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> finally arrived in 2025 with a brand new Japanese setting, a twisted and compelling story that continues to unfold and satisfy in subsequent playthroughs, and a strict focus on melee-based combat to further distinguish itself from the more gun-centric assaults of the previous year’s Silent Hill 2 remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be fair, the deliberately sluggish feel of Silent Hill f’s fighting system might not be to everyone’s taste. With its mix of light and heavy attacks, dodges and counters, and a reliance on the careful management of health, stamina, and sanity bars, its monster-mashing seems inspired by the slow and weighty combat of the Dark Souls series, though thankfully minus the punishing difficulty. Yet even though your controller might not be in any danger of being smashed to bits after repeatedly dying to the same boss, your lead pipe or crowbar certainly is due to the irritatingly brittle nature of Silent Hill f’s destructible weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if you can embrace the clunky combat clashes – or simply force yourself to endure them – there are huge rewards for persevering because Silent Hill f’s story is simply one of the most captivating tales in the entire series. The psychological effects of high schooler Hinako Shimizu’s domestic abuse and bullying is truly gut-wrenching to examine, the monsters she encounters provide a full-fat dose of nightmare fuel, and the world around her is an absorbing place to pore over, whether it's the misty streets of her mountainside village or the mysterious shrine realm she enters in her dreams.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You would think that a Silent Hill game that doesn’t actually feature the town of Silent Hill would be like a Resident Evil game without some sort of resident evil in it, but Silent Hill f successfully proves that you can take the series out of Smalltown, USA, but you can’t take the spinechilling psychological horror out of the Silent Hill game. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">5. P.T.</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/pt-1758725565702.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While ultimately a proof of concept rather than a fully fledged Silent Hill game – the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> stands for Playable Teaser – this standalone slice of psychological torment got fans' appetites whet for a Silent Hills game that sadly never saw the light of day. Quietly shadow-dropped as a free download on PlayStation 4 amidst a number of more headline-grabbing announcements at Gamescom 2014, P.T. quickly took social media and Reddit threads by storm as more than a million players discovered it and collectively set about unravelling its most enigmatic puzzles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a single, looping, L-shaped corridor inside a suburban family home, P.T. was capable of delivering scares in ways both micro and macro; subtly rearranging the decor to unsettle you in one loop, before ensuring you’d never sleep with the lights off again by surprising you with a murderous ghost named Lisa the moment you dared to look over your shoulder. Much like the apartment sections of Silent Hill 4: The Room, P.T. also broke from the Silent Hill series’ typical third-person perspective, presenting its horrors in a more claustrophobic first-person view that made them all the more immediate. It was compact, cryptic, and completely terrifying. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What further adds to P.T.’s mystique is that it’s extremely hard to actually play at this point. After the cancellation of Silent Hills and Kojima Productions’ seemingly acrimonious split with Konami in 2015, P.T. was removed from the PlayStation Store for good, making it impossible to reinstall even if it was attached to your PSN account. There are some questionable PC-based workarounds to regain access to it, but otherwise the only way to play P.T. today is by somehow tracking down a PlayStation 4 console with it already installed, or playing a fanmade remake such as the impressively faithful recreation in Media Molecule’s Dreams. Or perhaps by breaking into that same warehouse that the Ark of the Covenant was stashed in at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for its legacy, though, P.T. has gone on to be one of the most influential horror games released in recent memory. Layers of Fear ran with P.T.’s looping environments to unsettle players exploring its artist’s mansion setting, while Resident Evil: Village terrified fans with the P.T.-esque tight hallways, combat-free puzzle-solving, and nightmare-inducing deformed fetus found in its House Beneviento section. That’s not to say anything of the countless P.T. pretenders that continue to flood Steam to this day. Not bad for a playable teaser for a Silent Hill game that never was. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. Silent Hill 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-3-1758725579705.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The storytelling brilliance of Silent Hill 2 made it a hard act to follow – and we’ll get to exactly why in a moment – but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> distanced itself slightly from its landmark predecessor by positioning itself as a direct sequel to the original Silent Hill instead. The third game in the Silent Hill saga digs into compelling new details about the doomsday cult from the original game, as well as introducing an almost entirely new line-up of nightmarish creatures, brought to bowel-loosening life by visuals that pushed the PlayStation 2 hardware to its limits.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its biggest departure from its two predecessors, though, is the fact that its protagonist is a plucky teenage girl instead of a miserable, 30-something year old man. Heather, who’s surname we’ll keep vague for story spoiler reasons, came as a breath of fresh air through the fog and proved to be one of the best written and most relatable leads in the series’ history. Not to mention that up until the release of Silent Hill f, she was the only playable female lead in the mainline entries (unless you count Maria in the Director’s Cut of Silent Hill 2). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon its release, Silent Hill 3 was criticised for lacking gameplay innovation and being a bit too similar to the first two games, but given the string of subpar Silent Hill games released in the aftermath of Silent Hill 4: The Room, perhaps in retrospect staying true to the look and feel of the two most respected entries in the Silent Hill series wasn’t such a bad thing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Silent Hill 2 Remake</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-2-remake-1758725595465.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Shattered Memories which completely overhauled the structure and dramatically altered the plot of the original Silent Hill, the 2024 remake of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a> preserves the story, characters, and vibe of the PlayStation 2 original, but updates it all for modern audiences with superb visuals, anxiety-inducing audio design, and controls that allow for far more fluid player movement and inventory juggling.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Bloober Team wasn’t exactly new to the horror genre nor the process of remaking of horror games, having previously both made and remade its own spooky stories in the form of Layers of Fear and Observer. This experience evidently served the team well since the Silent Hill 2 remake is by far and away its biggest triumph to date, dramatically enhancing the unsettling and claustrophobic atmosphere of the original, and expanding the small town setting to make it utterly absorbing to pore over for returning fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crucially, almost every modernisation made here has resulted in Silent Hill 2’s overwhelmingly shuddersome setting seeming all the more immersive and alarming. The volumetric fog feels thicker and more oppressive than ever. The new level of detail applied to the dwellings you shuffle through make them seem infinitely more dank and depressing, if not completely disgusting at times. The use of light is particularly brilliant, and being forced to explore every inch of the Toluca Prison area in limited bursts of illumination thanks to failing circuit breakers makes for one of the most frantic and frightening sequences the series has ever seen. Or indeed, not seen, since so many of its horrors are quickly plunged into blackness. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add in some superior voice acting and a terrifying soundscape from Akira Yamaoka that will have you doubting your own sanity, and there’s no question that the Silent Hill 2 remake is the best way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Silent Hill</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-1758725613579.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Take a splash of Stephen King, a dash of David Lynch, a flash of Francis Bacon, and filter it all through the Japanese cultural lens of developer Team Silent, and you have the twisted and truly terrifying journey through the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>. Stepping away from the typically campy, B-movie style popular in ‘90s survival horror, Silent Hill plunged you into previously unseen depths of psychological torment, putting the emphasis on properly disturbing atmosphere in favour of cheap jump scares, and establishing the tone for a series that, at its best, is somehow incredibly uncomfortable yet utterly enthralling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike prior survival horror games like Resident Evil and Parasite Eve that relied on pre-rendered backgrounds, Silent Hill bucked the trend by putting you into an environment rendered entirely in 3D. Remarkably, this meant that the series’ signature darkness and oppressive fog were actually borne out of a need to mask the meagre draw distance and ugly graphical pop-ins that plagued the original PlayStation, turning the system’s hardware limitations into a powerful tool for terror that has remained a constant in the series to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From your first steps as Harry Mason entering the eerie small town searching for his lost daughter, Silent Hill assaults you from all sides with its genuinely unsettling nothingness, and the fear of not knowing what’s waiting for you in the fog is arguably more petrifying than the actual beasts that lie in wait. This unending sense of unease was only intensified further by ingenious atmospheric flourishes, like the screeching static from Harry’s radio that hissed with more urgency as you arrived in the vicinity of some unseen mess of pissed-off polygons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill ushered in a chilling new standard for slow-burn survival horror, and its influence can still be felt decades later in the likes of The Medium and Alan Wake 2. Yet it only took Team Silent a couple of years to drag players into new depths of depravity and despair… </p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Silent Hill 2 </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/silent-hill-2-1758725629819.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Silent Hill may have established the series’ combination of overwhelmingly bleak atmosphere and disturbing adult themes, but 2001’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-2001">Silent Hill 2</a> perfected it. A thoroughly absorbing and emotionally-draining examination of grief and guilt, Silent Hill 2 put us into the role of the recently widowed James Sunderland and set us on a tortured tour through his own private hell, one crawling with awful apparitions that symbolised his increasingly decaying mental state and the suffering of the people around him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas the original Silent Hill focused primarily on the corrupt religious practices of a local cult and how it permanently altered the town’s reality, Silent Hill 2 deals with themes that were more nuanced and extremely taboo at the time, at least in the world of gaming. Sexual abuse, suicide, and self-harm are all explored as Sunderland encounters other survivors trapped within the foggy lakeside town, with each form of trauma made all the more confronting by the twisted creatures they manifest as. 2001’s Grand Theft Auto 3 might be widely regarded as the first proper video game for grown ups, but Silent Hill 2 arguably beat Rockstar’s opus to the punch just one month prior. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 also introduced one of the most iconic antagonists in the series’ history, if not survival horror in general. There are few enemies as shit-your-pants scary as Pyramid Head, an intimidating and unstoppable tormenter who stalks Sunderland at several stages through the story, and who also does unspeakable things to mannequins. Ominously dragging one half of a giant pair of scissors and with an angular skull so rusty you need a tetanus shot just from looking at it, this pointy-headed predator’s potency was diluted somewhat by subsequent appearances in weaker instalments such as Silent Hill: Homecoming and Silent Hill: Book of Memories, but his importance to Silent Hill 2’s sustained sense of dread cannot be understated.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From its tragic story to its provocative symbolism and no shortage of genuine scares, Silent Hill 2 remains the bone-chilling benchmark for the series, and is therefore the obvious choice for the number one slot on this list.</p><div id="every-silent-hill-game-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Silent Hill Game, Ranked</h3><h3>Every Silent Hill Game, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And there we have it: the nine best games in the Silent Hill series.

<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159005/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> presents, essentially, an episode of the sci-fi show in interactive, visual novel form.</p>
<p>Where Starfleet combat sims focus on phaser battles and starship strategy, and often struggle to capture the many facets of the show beyond the iconography, Dramatic Labs threads life's moral quandaries, familial and political themes, and the sheer wonder of the universe throughout this game. Plus all the <em>"Shields up, red alert!"</em> and phaser fire you'd expect from a standard episode of '90s Trek.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2023 on PC and non-Switch consoles, the dev team of Telltale veterans uses a two-protagonist narrative to deliver familiar (and, for fans, thrilling) starship activities aboard the USS Resolute. First Officer Jara Rydek and Petty Officer Carter Diaz give you perspectives spanning the ranks, combining day-to-day engineering and workplace shenanigans with investigation, political intrigue, and tension at the top, until the two characters eventually meet and their stories converge.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159011/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a smart approach to split those two strands without contriving a single character to carry the narrative, solve diplomatic crises, counsel colleagues, beam down on away missions, scan anomalies, administer medical aid, <em>and</em> fix the warp core. The crew is still the star here, despite this being a Rydek/Diaz episode.</p>
<p>And it's a decent episode, too; one that nails the show's mise-en-scène and writing style. Split into chapters, the titles (all presented in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/starfleetdesign.bsky.social/post/3l5wtt63kks2r">Crillee Italic</a>, naturally) riff on old episode names or notable lines from the franchise. We're in the <strong>Lower Decks</strong> era, timeline fans; so, post-<strong>Nemesis</strong>, around a decade after TNG's TV run ended, with Riker out there on the Titan and everyone wearing the late-season <strong>DS9</strong>/<strong>First Contact</strong> uniforms. The Resolute isn't the sparkling new flagship, though, so there's plenty of old 2360s LCARS colouring and design language from the earlier shows (plus some lovely Type 6 shuttles) mixed in with the sleeker, metallic sheens of the movies.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159017/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's on to this freshly refitted science vessel that Rydek arrives following an incident that tarnished not just the ship's hull but her new CO's reputation. Anxious to rehabilitate his career, Captain Solano needs his next mission to succeed at any cost. There's tension amongst his crew, too, as others had been eyeing Rydek's post.</p>
<p>Again, this is essentially an interactive novel. Beyond a couple of moments where you might push the left stick forward to walk along a prescribed path, you have zero direct control of your character; each environment presents static shots with interactable icons to investigate, each initiating a short scene. Dialogue options influence your relationships — the classic Telltale 'X will remember that' branching narrative setup — and the pause menu contains a summary of each character's current opinion of you.</p>
<p>Beyond conversations, you get to operate equipment - reordering isolinear chips, modulating carrier beams, flipping open tricorders and scanning, that sort of thing. On a controller, you'll be rotating sticks and pushing between icons, whereas in handheld mode the touchscreen has you pushing sliders and hitting prompts. It's simple stuff, but well implemented.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159008/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Every 'puzzle' is broadly similar (move the tricorder around and scan across bands to find three substances, job done), but they're brisk and pleasantly Trek-y, with all the right terminology and sound effects. Elsewhere in the audio department, although you don't get any of the shows' recognisable, roaring themes, the score does a fair job of approximating the mid-'90s auditory ambience of DS9 or <strong>Voyager</strong>.</p>
<p>Resurgence is definitely a budget production. The video quality varies between environments, but the Unreal Engine-powered visuals hold up surprisingly well on Switch, although it could use an optimisation pass on Switch 2, where things looked a little rougher to my eye. There's some sleight of hand going on with prerendered video mixed in with rendered scenes (at least that's what it feels like) and the image can be a little soft, the video a little choppy, with awkward pauses between selecting an action and awaiting the result. But it all just about hangs together, whether you're playing docked or handheld.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159004/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the topic of things that would raise a Vulcan's eyebrow, Quick-Time Events feel as clunky and pointless as ever here. Elsewhere, a character appeared at their station missing some vital headwear before it magically materialised a couple of shots later. Another time, as the camera whip-panned around the bridge, I swear I glimpsed a Bolian I'd previously dismissed, too.</p>
<p>There's a little jank around the edges, then - again, this isn't the flagship. All that said, Dramatic Labs spent its resources in the right places, 100%. No, you can't control your characters directly, but that restriction gives the devs total control over the camera and nearly every scene and environment <em>feels</em> like something that could have been shot on a Paramount soundstage in the Berman era (including a trip to 'Planet Hell'), with good depth of field and strong direction grounding the story well enough that you don't get hung up on minor tech hiccups or uncanny glide-walks.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159007/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The facial animation and voice work are excellent, too, conveying emotions accurately in the shows’ Shakespearean style, with writing quality to match. Carter's got easygoing Geordi vibes which work well against Jara's more sober, commanding presence, but both are likeable with the actors delivering great performances. It's a testament to the writers and performers that Spock and Riker don't feel shoehorned in for the fans, and you'd be hard-pressed to tell Piotr Michael's excellent rendition from Nimoy himself. It's all very well done.</p>
<p>Some crewmembers are more prickly than you'd expect on a Starfleet vessel, but I generally warmed to them - all except one, who offered only terrible takes and the worst recommendations. Perhaps other characters go into full-on sulks when you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edflm7Hh3hs">shut them down repeatedly, Worf-style</a>, and this one <em>did</em> suffer personally due to a 'needs of the many' decision I made. In another playthrough, if I channelled my Mirror Universe self and made different choices, perhaps we could be best buds.</p>
<p>Beyond that one officer, though, one of the most attractive elements of Trek is well represented here: the competence porn of seeing professional, intelligent people doing jobs they enjoy, and well.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159021/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's been a while since I played <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/mass_effect">Mass Effect</a>, but the balance here between diplomacy, your own moral integrity, and the reality of the situation put me in that frame of mind. By tapping into a story with callbacks to a Season One TNG episode, you get a little TOS flavour, too: capricious godlike creatures, energy crystals, and some pleasant, '60s-style hokum. For dyed-in-the-wool Trekkies, it's exhilarating, although the ending — at least <em>my ending</em> — left a significant plot thread hanging in a way which felt unsatisfying.</p>
<p>Still, the "seven hours or more" before the credits rolled were solidly engaging. Resurgence doesn't serve up dry starship resource management or frontier strategy - it's all about the complex decision making and moral quandaries of <em>actual</em> Star Trek, plus the occasional thrill of saying "On screen" or "Engage" or "Energise". It's accurate enough with terminology across the board to satisfy anyone who knows photons from phase inducers, and just scanning crap with your tricorder is a thrill. It puts you <em>in</em> an episode, living that dream of being a hyper-competent Starfleet officer, working with diverse, clever, empathetic people towards the greater good. And looking fetching in a jumpsuit while you’re at it.</p>
<figure><a title="Star Trek: Resurgence Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158997/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, as episodes go, this is a good 'un. Not a <strong>Best of Both Worlds</strong> — not something you're going to dig out the Blurays for specifically — but a solid mid-Season Three-er that's absolutely worth a (re)watch.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Star Trek: Resurgence is a modest enterprise, but Dramatic Labs did a stellar job of capturing the qualities of the show, specifically its '90s era, with all the strengths and weaknesses thereof. As with the show, technically, you may notice some rough edges, but the creators have worked wonders with their resources. The visual novel stylings here suit the material, and it's got it where it counts, with excellent writing and performances across the board.</p>
<p>Non-Trek fans won't get half as much out of it, and you may not be tempted to go back for a second playthrough. But if the current crop of Trek shows isn't quite scratching your itch, Resurgence does a great job of transporting you back a generation.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Silksong</em> resembles the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> in many ways, though right from the start, you can hear one key difference: Hornet. <em>Hollow Knight</em>’s protagonist was silent, but just as Hornet was voiced in that game, as the protagonist of <em>Silksong</em>, she has a voice, too, and actor Makoto Koji brings a lot of personality to the role.</p><p>“She’s confident, she’s sure of herself, she’s very stoic,” Koji says in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. But Hornet has a goofiness as well, according to Koji, and she thinks Team Cherry did a good job showing how multifaceted Hornet is. This is particularly impressive because Hornet, and all of the characters in <em>Silksong</em>, talk in brief statements of gibberish. Even if you’re reading a long text passage, characters don’t speak those full sentences, instead saying a word or short phrase in a pretend language.</p><p>“I did a lot of making up my own gibberish,” Koji says. That meant she could only use one or two words to express something that’s happening in the narrative. Koji chose to make words that felt natural to her and that were “instinctual,” but she’s been surprised with how the <em>Hollow Knight</em> community has taken to some of the gibberish she made up.</p><p>Koji walked me through an example from the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> where (spoiler warning!) she created words for Hornet’s optional, heroic appearance during the final boss fight. “It’s a moment where Hornet is telling the character, ‘Now is the moment. Do it now.’ That was the only direction I got,” Koji says. So she scribbled down the words “gek tuu” — which the players have jokingly interpreted as Hornet telling the player to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEI4-c9x1C4">“git gud.”</a></p><p>Koji is <a href="https://www.paperrabbits.com/">an animator</a>, not a trained voice actor, but she got the role of Hornet in part because she shared an office with <em>Silksong</em> developer Team Cherry, a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/about">very small team in Adelaide, Australia</a>, while it was working on the first <em>Hollow Knight</em>. Originally, the role was supposed to go to a friend of hers, but after learning that that friend was going to move overseas, Koji offered to give it a go. “And I guess the rest is <em>Hollow Knight</em> history,” she says.</p><p>With <em>Silksong</em>, “I went in wanting to do the best for the character,” Koji says. Team Cherry — “the boys,” as she frequently called them during our interview — allowed her to express emotions that she doesn’t usually tap into in everyday life. “I had a lot of fun with it.”</p><p>Ultimately, she feels she’s just one part of all of the work that goes into creating Hornet who she is. “There is so much work involved to bring a character to life, from an initial sketch, to drawing each frame, to implementing the behaviours and weaving all the narrative strands,” she says. “The voice / sounds of the character, or lack of, is only the final icing on the cake.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/785915/hollow-knight-silksong-hornet-voice-actor-makoto-koji-gibberish]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser has opened up on why we never received a follow-up to 2006's Bully.</p>
<p>Talking to IGN at LA Comic Con, House was asked why he never returned to Jimmy's life despite Bully's popularity and critical acclaim, and his response was both candid and probably a little frustrating for those who'd been patiently waiting for Bully 2, as he simply attributed it to "bandwidth issues".</p>

<p>"I think it was just bandwidth issues," Houser admitted (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bully-2-rockstar-development-bandwidth-dan-houser/">InsiderGaming</a>). "You know, if you've got a small lead creative team, and a small senior leadership crew, you just can't do all the projects you want.</p>
<p>"And you know, we certainly– how we're structured at [Houser's current studio] Absurd [Ventures], we're doing two projects with a fairly small team, and it's really trying to think through that. How can we do that and keep them both moving?"</p><div>

<p>Since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">unveiling</a> in June 2023, Absurd Ventures has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">announced</a> two "universes" - American Caper and A Better Paradise - intended to form the basis of multiple transmedia projects, beginning with a graphic novel and podcast, respectively. Meanwhile, a job advertisement spotted in May 2024 confirmed Absurd's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-company-is-creating-an-open-world-action-adventure">first video game project</a> is also in the works, and after a difficult year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/immortals-of-aveum">Immortals of Aveum</a> developer Ascendant Studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/core-team-of-immortals-of-aveum-developers-joins-rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-absurd-ventures">a "core team" of around 20 employees decamped to Absurd this time last year</a>, establishing a new studio now known as Absurd Marin.</p>
<p>As for Rockstar's primary project at the moment? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is currently expected to launch for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 26th May 2026, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-delayed-to-2026">not exactly unexpected delay</a> earlier this year. And there's little doubt it's going to be big; as recently Take-Two confirmed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-has-now-sold-a-staggering-210m-copies">GTA 5 has now sold an astonishing 210m copies</a> since its release 12 years ago, so it's probably not unreasonable to presume its massively anticipated sequel will manage to match that and then some.</p>

<p>I love 4X games. I've tried other strategy game genres, but frankly, they don't stick if they're not first and foremost 4X games—at the heart of it, it must be about exploring, expanding, exploiting, and yes, exterminating.</p>
<p>I suspect that the first 4X game most people played was some entry in the Civilization franchise—though certainly, a select few played precursors dating back to text-based games in the 1970s.</p>
<p>But for me, the title that kicked off my obsession was <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8984087-15232592?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fmaster_of_orion_1_2"><em>Master of Orion II</em></a> (<em>MOO2</em>)—a game that has you develop and build up planets across a simple galaxy map, researching speculative future technologies, and ultimately wiping out your opponents and claiming dominion over the known universe. (There are other victory conditions too, but that one is the most fun.)</p>
<p>There is something satisfying about making a couple thousand small choices that all add up to that galaxy map gradually changing color in your favor until the final cut scene plays, declaring you the true Master of Orion.</p>
<p>The games I love the most are the ones where you make decisions that compound over many, many hours to a long-term payoff. I'll take that over games with bite-sized, contained challenges and short play times any day. The deeper and longer the experience, the better the payoff can be. To me, that's ultimately what makes 4X games great. <em>MOO2</em> is no exception.</p>

<h2>Nostalgic but flawed</h2>
<p>That said, it's not a perfect game. It benefited from the lessons it could learn from more than a decade of 4X games before it, and its designers were clearly thinking about how to make it balanced and fun.</p>
<p>They just missed the mark sometimes. For example, a big part of the game is choosing perks that customize your empire from before the first turn. One of those perks is called "Creative," which allows you to learn multiple technologies at once rather than one at a time. It's pretty hard to imagine anyone consciously declining to choose that perk unless they're looking to make things a lot harder for themselves.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-yoshi-touch-and-go">Last week</a>, we matched up a pair of covers for everyone's favourite dino, as we looked at a duo of designs for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshi_touch_and_go">Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</a>. There's no polite way to put this: it was a blowout. The colourful North American and European design walked away with a staggering win, taking 83% of the vote and leaving the simplistic Japanese variant with the remaining 17%. <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>This time, hot off the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">The New World of Steam</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam-has-been-delayed-until-2026">delay</a>, we're taking a look at the <em>last</em> Layton game to see the light of day: the catchily-titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/laytons_mystery_journey_katrielle_and_the_millionaires_conspiracy_-_deluxe_edition">Layton's Mystery Journey: Katrielle and the Millionaires' Conspiracy - Deluxe Edition</a>. It's not the greatest Layton mystery by a long shot, but if we had known how long it would be until we got another series entry, perhaps we would have looked at it a little more fondly.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ilvqxm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Well, let's do exactly that today, shall we? There are two covers to choose from this time, in a classic duel between East and West. So, let's get into it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:93248 @ 1759079900 -->
<h2>Europe / North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="809205d30a0c4"><a title="Layton's Mystery Journey - EU/NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/809205d30a0c4/laytons-mystery-journey-euna.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123265-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-deluxe-edition">Level-5/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Western box art borrows a lot from the DS/3DS Layton games, as far as formatting is concerned. Our titular hero stands centre stage, looking puzzled, while several of the in-game head-scratchers float around her. The brown background and frankly unruly title don't do much to draw the eye, but you've got to respect a bit of design cohesion — even if it's not quite as dramatic as some of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/04/poll-box-art-brawl-professor-layton-and-the-curious-village">earlier series entries</a>.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="38648b0f9c5d1"><a title="Layton's Mystery Journey - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38648b0f9c5d1/laytons-mystery-journey-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/123265-laytons-mystery-journey-katrielle-and-the-millionaires-conspiracy-deluxe-edition">Level-5/LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now this is a swing in a different direction! Instead of following the puzzle focus of the West, the Japanese design instead puts its main ensemble front and centre. We like the dramatic poses that everyone seems to be striking, and Sherl slotting in around the corner logo is a nice touch.</p>
<p>There's not nearly enough top hats on display, though. Shame...</p>

<p>Here's everything announced</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Mojang aired its second major <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> Live broadcast of 2025 this weekend, and it was once again packed with all sorts of announcements and reveals. If you didn't catch it, here's the full rundown:</p>
<nav><ul><li><span title="On This Page"></span></li></ul>
</nav>
<h3 id="new-drop-the-copper-age-out-30th-september-2025">New Drop - The Copper Age (Out 30th September 2025)</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Many of you have already been testing features of this drop that changes up early-game tool and weapon progression, introduces the copper golem, shows off powered shelves (including the cheeky ways you’ve been using them), and more!</p>
<p>Even more exciting, you’ll be playing this game drop in just a few days. The Copper Age releases on September 30th. Prepare to download!</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:184677 @ 1759081438 -->
<h3 id="happy-ghast-music-video">Happy Ghast - Music Video</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>"Our last drop, Chase the Skies, brought loads of great features to Minecraft and the happy ghast continues to be a community favorite. We created a short video to celebrate just how adorable it really is."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="dragon-ball-z-dlc-is-coming-soon-to-minecraft">Dragon Ball Z DLC is "coming soon" to Minecraft</h3>
<figure data-uuid="cd0e1f120db7d"><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cd0e1f120db7d/minecraft.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll be powering up Kamehamehas and throwing down Spirit Bombs in this new DLC – all about Dragon Ball Z! It will be releasing later this year, though a free Super Saiyan hair character creator item is available to download right now! This DLC has everything you can imagine (so long as you’re thinking about Dragon Ball-Z stuff) so check back soon for more details and have your Dragon Ball wish granted!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-underwater-mob-the-nautilus">New Underwater Mob - The Nautilus</h3>
<figure data-uuid="9a899ebbb2f8a"><a title="Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a899ebbb2f8a/minecraft.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The Nautilus (part of the "<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem">Mounts of Mayhem</a>" drop coming later this year) is the new underwater mob and makes it easier to build underwater. You can also tame it, ride it, and equip it with armour. Additionally, there's Zombie Nautilus with Drowned riding the new mob.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We introduce the nautilus, a rideable underwater mob that will have you exploring the depths like never before! You can even build from it, like our old friend the happy ghast, and deck it out in colorful armor. Deep sea exploration is still dangerous, but the new “Breath of the Nautilus” effect (which pauses your breath meter), as well as your increased maneuverability, will make things a bit less daunting."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="new-weapon-the-spear">New Weapon - The Spear</h3>

<p>Another "<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/unveiling-mounts-of-mayhem">Mounts of Mayhem</a>" update will add spear and Zombie Horses (with spears). Here's a bit more about this new weapon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spear – our first tiered weapon in quite some time. “Tiered” means you can craft it out of different materials, and each one will act in a slightly different way...You can jab with it or use the charge attack. But watch your timing - hold the charge attack for too long and your attacks will lose attributes and effectiveness. Just as exciting is the way that the spear’s damage is affected by your movement speed. Go faster (for example on a mount) and you’ll hit even harder!</p>
