            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At least two of Nintendo’s Switch 2 games are going to be more expensive than most games on the first Switch. Many Switch games cost $59.99, but Nintendo revealed today the Switch 2’s <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a June 5th launch title, will cost $79.99, while <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, releasing a little over a month later, will cost $69.99.</p><p>These aren’t Nintendo’s first titles to exceed a $59.99 price. That honor goes to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591275/nintendo-70-dollar-game-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">launched at $69.99</a>. When that price was announced, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2023/02/08/update-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-costs-70">told <em>Game Informer</em></a> that “we determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>Nintendo is taking some of the sting off <em>Mario Kart World’s</em> higher price if you get it as part of a special $499.99 Switch 2 bundle. (On its own, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2 costs $449.99</a>.) But it appears that Nintendo’s next-generation console could have games that are generally more expensive than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new console is set to launch on June 5 and will cost $450. And one of the launch games for the console is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a big, sprawling kart racer that looks like a lot of fun. But uh, what the heck is Mario drinking in that can?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A little context. So in the trailer for <em>Mario Kart World</em>, there’s a moment where we see the iconic plumber himself leaning up against a small truck (a kart, you might even call it) and he looks pretty chill. In his hand is an open can that he is drinking. And if you zoom in on that can you can see that its marked “Yoshi’s Drink.” </p><figure id="" data-id="cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-recommend-id="image://cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-recommend-id="image://cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This led to a lot of questions in my head and I decided to ask my fellow <em>Kotaku</em> writers and editors what they thought Mario was drinking. Here are their responses:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It’s a cocktail of Yoshi’s own design. He made it in secret and started putting it in cans with no oversight from the Mushroom Kingdom health organizations. It’s never been verified and has no ingredients or nutritional information on the side of the can like it’s supposed to. Mario’s drinking it on faith that Yoshi would never put something bad for him in this, so he’s chugging this swill with reckless abandon. <strong>- Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Yoshi is running an energy drink company that sources ingredients of questionable origin on the side. And maybe he’ll sell you an expensive blender to make your own. <strong>- Claire Jackson</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Some of my colleagues are suggesting that Mario is drinking something gross, or that Yoshi has done something untoward. I’m here to tell you that Yoshi is a perfect, innocent creature made in the image of God, and that what Mario is drinking is clearly a wonderfully refreshing, sparkling fruit-flavored beverage. The can even has an image of the fruits that Yoshi famously eats in <em>Super Mario World </em>on it! </p><p>What kind of fruit is it, exactly? It’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Fruit_(Mario_franchise)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Fruit_(Mario_franchise)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fruit</a></span>! It’s the platonic ideal of fruit; fruit as a concept, but made real and delicious. I’m glad Mario gets to kick back and enjoy such a refreshing beverage. Even if Yoshi makes it by crushing the fruits in his mouth to squeeze the juice out of them and then spitting it directly into the cans. <strong>- Carolyn Petit</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Yoshi’s drink is him pissing after whatever he last ate. <strong>- Ethan Gach</strong></p></blockquote><p>I’ve reached out to Nintendo for an official answer. For now, I guess Mario is either drinking some fruit juice, an energy drink, or uh...urine. </p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w" target="_blank">Check our roundup</a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank">including launch games</a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank">pricing information, release date, pre-order information</a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank">what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</a></span><em>.</em></p><p>  <em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-development-began-before-2019-super-nintendo-switch-was-considered-as-a-name/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> (and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather expensive game prices</a>), Nintendo's website was updated with a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/April/Ask-the-Developer-Vol-16-Nintendo-Switch-2-Chapter-1-2787951.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy developer interview</a> with the three key figures seen in the Direct presentation: Producer Kouichi Kawamoto from the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department; Senior Director Takuhiro Dohta, also from the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department; and General Manager Tetsuya Sasaki from the Technology Development Division. From the interview, we learned that R&amp;D for the Nintendo Switch 2 began before 2019.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kawamoto:</strong> </em><em>The three of us started working together on the new hardware project around 2019. But as far as the core development of the Nintendo Switch 2 goes, I recall that research and development had already started even before the project formally kicked off, right?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sasaki:</strong> </em><em>That's right. We knew that we would continue to develop new gaming consoles even after the launch of Switch, so we needed to get ahead of ourselves and start sowing the seeds of ideas for what we could do with the next console. Hardware development takes time, and if we didn't start early, the software development environment, known as the Software Development Kit, that's needed afterwards wouldn't be ready in time. We started by actively gathering information each day on different kinds of technology and the results they could achieve. In that sense, you could say that we began the development even before 2019.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, another name considered at some point for the console was Super Nintendo Switch. As someone who grew up with the Super Nintendo as his first console, I can say that it would have definitely tickled my nostalgia. However, Switch 2 is clearly easier to understand and, therefore, the right choice in that regard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kawamoto:</strong> There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one. We even considered ideas like "Super Nintendo Switch". However, the Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. Since the Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new console with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs but rather to think of it as the latest console developed by Nintendo. So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dohta:</strong> That’s right. From the beginning of development, we wanted the Switch 2 to be a console that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. This hasn’t changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest console. We really struggled because there were so many different ideas, but in the end, after lots of back and forth, we all agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all.</em></p>
<p>Throughout the interview, the hardware developers also talked about the battery capacity, which was increased to 1.2x that of the original Switch to offset the increased battery consumption rate caused by the more powerful processor. The JoyCon 2's HD Rumble 2 was also improved to support a wider variety of vibration types, not to mention a stronger rumble effect and quicker response times. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, on the other hand, features 'smooth-gliding sticks' and 'seamless grips' that feel better to touch.</p>

The Switch 2 battery life fares better in a matchup with Valve’s Steam Deck, however. The LCD model only offers 2 - 8 hours, and the OLED model maxes out at  3-12 hours. <br></p><p>Still, it’s disappointing to see the Switch successor backslide in such an important part of the hardware user experience. I’m guessing later iterations of the Switch 2 will improve the battery life, but it sucks having to go back to where we were eight years ago for a device that otherwise appears to deliver a lot of the upgrades fans have long wanted from a next-gen Switch. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      Switch 2's "Partner Spotlight," Part 1

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>With the promise of new hardware capable of 1080p, 120 frames per second, HDR, and even mouse capabilities, the Switch 2 is getting attention from developers eager to make up for lost time—and stake out a place on a sequel to the system that sold more than 150 million hardware units.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em>,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 0</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6, </em><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> <em>Intergrade</em> stood out as games from the near-to-middle past slated to arrive on the Switch 2.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake,</em>&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6, Civilization 7, </em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are due to arrive at launch on June 5, with the rest arriving in 2025.</p>

<p>The cruel games industry joke, ever since&nbsp;<em>Silksong's</em> announcement in 2019, is that the game, originally intended as DLC for acclaimed platformer/Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, is always due to be announced, never gets announced, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-reach-as-yet-unheard-of-levels-of-cope-as-the-metroidvanias-nintendo-switch-store-page-briefly-disappears/">resumes torturing its expectant fans</a>.</p>
<p>But there it was, for a blip of a moment in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal:&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, coming in "2025." That's all that is known: it will, purportedly, arrive on this console in 2025. It was initially due to arrive on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox when it was announced, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Another delayed indie gem,&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, a kinda-sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, purports to land all four chapters of its parallel story on Switch 2 at the console's launch.</p>
<p>Other notable games from across the studio-size spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>(2025)</li>
<li><em>Split Fiction</em> (at launch)</li>
<li><em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster&nbsp;</em>(at launch)</li>
<li><em>Enter the Gungeon</em> 2 ("Coming soon")</li>
<li><em>Two Point</em> Museum (2025)</li>
<li><em>Human Fall Flat 2&nbsp;</em>("Coming soon")</li>
</ul>
<h2>The legally distinct game that sure looks like <em>Bloodborne 2</em></h2>

  </div>

<p>The next original game from FromSoftware, maker of beautifully realized finger-torture titles like <em>Elden Ring</em> and the&nbsp;Dark Souls series, is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive,&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods. </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niKHDEKQ7xA">The trailer</a>, with its gore-etched hands, gothic churches, and eldritch/Victorian machinery, certainly stood out from the <em>Kirby</em> and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em> games around it. The game arrives sometime in 2026.</p>

My entire wardrobe is almost exclusively black. But the Switch 2’s mostly-black design looks off to me. The original Switch may have launched with a gray Joy-Con option, but the neon red and blue controllers that also launched on day one became iconic. Now, the Switch 2 has just splashes of colors, and they’re mostly hidden.</p><p>I imagine Nintendo will inevitably release full-color Joy-Con 2 controllers in the future, but I think the Switch 2 out of the gate could have looked much more fun.</p><p><em>-Antonio Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="a-meaningful-screen-upgrade"><h2><strong>A meaningful screen upgrade</strong></h2></p></div><p>No, it’s not an OLED. And yes, Nintendo will almost certainly repeat its strategy of launching a Switch 2 with that display technology down the line. But even right now, there’s a lot to like about the Switch 2’s new 1080p screen.</p><p>Its much larger 7.9-inch size is a blessing for the eyesight of a generation that grew up with Nintendo consoles — myself included. And I was pleasantly surprised that the company went with a 120Hz panel that supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and wider HDR color.</p><p>It won’t deliver the inky blacks of OLED, but as long as Nintendo’s quality assurance is up to snuff, the LCD won’t dissuade me from buying a Switch 2 on day one.</p><p><em>-Chris Welch, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-joy-con-seem-like-a-big-improvement"><h2><strong>The Joy-Con seem like a big improvement</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">new Joy-Con</a> are bigger, look more comfortable, do indeed attach via magnets, and can even be used like a mouse. Now, the real question is: will the sticks drift?</p><p><em>-Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p id="social-features-no-thanks"><h2><strong>Social features? No thanks</strong></h2></p></div><p>Just imagine: the joy of Zoom meetings, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">now integrated into your gameplay</a>. Voice chat and video streaming are the worst parts about gaming to me.

While it unfortunately uses AA batteries, it includes an additional ZL button that lets me play most of my Switch games. While Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">official wireless GameCube controller</a> for the Switch 2 brings rechargeable batteries, Nintendo opted to give it a little nub of a ZL button instead of a full button.

I was hoping for $399. But still I’ll be doing everything I can to snag the $499.99 bundle with <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a game that costs an eye-watering $79.99 on its own. </p><p>Let’s just hope pre-orders, which start on April 9th, go ok.

Launch joint offenses with allies, break through the frontlines en route to enemy castles, and appoint officers to influence both political and economic strategies as players experience the life of a daimyo—a powerful Japanese leader—in the troubled times of the Warring States Period, 16th century Japan.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

Nintendo says they’ll be more comfortable, too. They have the same general button layout as the originals, but with a new “C” button on the right Joy-Con that’s used for a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">Discord-like GameChat feature</a> that lets you talk to friends using a microphone embedded in the top of the Switch 2 and that includes screen sharing functionality and the ability to start streaming with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">Switch 2 camera accessory</a> Nintendo is selling separately.</p><p>As Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto describes in a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">new “Ask the Developer” interview</a> published today, the Switch 2’s Joy-Cons have “larger and more durable” analog sticks “with smoother movement.” On its site, the company says that the Joy-Con 2s are quieter, too. Smoother and quieter makes sense if Nintendo is using Hall effect sensors this time around, as previously rumored. Kawamoto also points out that the L and R buttons curve further down the side for easy reach. </p><p>The Joy-Con 2s connect to the Switch 2 magnetically, something Kawamoto says the company originally wanted to do with the first Switch. The Joy-Cons have larger SL and SR buttons that are made of metal, while the magnets themselves are embedded in the console. Disconnecting them involves pressing a release button on the back. In its Direct today, Nintendo claims they “won’t easily detach” on their own, but we’ll see about that when the system launches this summer. </p><p>Another big new feature of the Switch 2 Joy-Cons is that they can work like a mouse with select games. When they’re detached, you hold them, connection rail down, on a surface like a coffee table. Kawamoto said the feature will be used in games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a><em>, </em>for aiming (gyro control is still an option, too, according to a footnote on the page), and the thoroughly named <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em>.</p><p>Comparing it to the Wii Remote’s cursor, Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta, who is also featured in the interview, says the company sees the mouse functionality of the new Joy-Cons as a way to let the Switch 2’s touchscreen capabilities transition to playing in docked mode. The Joy-Cons come with wrist straps, which Nintendo says gives them a wider base for “smoother gliding and better stability.”</p><p>Kawamoto said the new Joy-Con rumble feature, now called HD Rumble 2, is updated “to allow for a wider variety of vibrations.” They’ll also be stronger, he said, and have “quicker response times.” According to Nintendo’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs%2F%23joycon2" rel="sponsored">official specs</a>, the controllers will last about 20 hours between charges and recharge in about 3.5 hours, same as the original Joy-Cons. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessories%2F" rel="sponsored">As for accessories</a>, apart from the included wrist straps, Nintendo has also announced a $19.99 set of two wheels you can attach the Joy-Con 2s to for games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. The company will sell a $34.99 charging grip, and the console comes with a standard non-charging grip as well. </p><p>Nintendo did away with the IR sensor found on the right-hand first-generation Joy-Con, which I will miss for no reason other than that I love when gadgets have IR sensors. In every other way, the updated Joy-Cons sound like an improvement over their predecessors, with intriguing new features and Nintendo’s promise of better comfort and improved rumble. Now, we just have to wait to see if Nintendo managed to solve the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">stick drift problem</a> of the first Joy-Cons.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is a powerful console and looks to be a huge improvement over the first Switch, but the cost of Switch 2 physical and digital media has left a sour taste in the mouths of players and potential buyers.</p>



<p>The Switch 2—almost known as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-was-almost-named-super-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Nintendo Switch</a>—has gone from being an unknown entity to being given an imminent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>. I’m happy, fans are, and the thought of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-120fps-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">120 FPS, 4K &amp; HDR</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is bliss.</p>



<p>What isn’t bliss is the projected prices of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> games. We’re entering a new era of gaming, but it could be a scary one for wallets and bank accounts.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-do-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost">How Much Do Nintendo Switch 2 Games Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will you buy straight away? Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 games are expected to cost between $70-90 for base copies of games.</strong></p>



<p>This figure could vary based on the physical nature of the game, as well as how much Nintendo possibly values the license—let me explain. </p>



<h3 id="h-increased-rrp">Increased RRP</h3>



<p>A ton of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">games were announced during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>. Some of the biggest reveals included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a> (AKA Mario Kart 9) and the aforementioned Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>



<p>Mario is a launch-day title, whereas Donkey Kong arrives later. But the key thing to note is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-will-cost-80-for-digital-90-for-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of both games</a>. The official Nintendo website states <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mario Kart World</a> has an MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) of <strong>$79.99</strong>, with the physical edition costing an even steeper <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>



<p>Over the years, it’s become traditional for digital games to be more expensive than physical media. Personally, this has never made sense to me as physical media requires shipping and practical manufacturing. But now it seems the tide is turning somewhat.</p>



<h3 id="h-franchise-status-could-affect-price">Franchise Status Could Affect Price</h3>



<p>Mario Kart World looks to be getting the full-price treatment. If we compare it to Donkey Kong Bananza—another first-party Nintendo series—it’s currently locked in at <strong>$69.99</strong> for digital and <strong>$79.99</strong> for physical.</p>



<p>I’m not here saying Mario Kart is a superior franchise to Donkey Kong in any way, but the evidence suggests that’s how Nintendo views Donkey Kong Bananza compared to Mario Kart World. The company believes Mario Kart will sell many more copies than DK, hence the price point difference.</p>



<p>This likely means the $80-90 RRP <strong>won’t apply to all games and franchises</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-nintendo-switch-2-game-costs-compare-to-switch-1">How do Nintendo Switch 2 Game Costs Compare to Switch 1?</h2>



<p>If we compare Mario Kart World to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the former has an MSRP of <strong>$79.99 for the digital edition</strong>, whereas The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is <strong>$69.99 for a digital copy</strong>.</p>



<p>Nintendo is notorious for keeping the cost of its AAA titles the same. The top-tier games don’t get permanently discounted like Sony would God of War or Horizon. So there’s a clear difference of $10 between the two, showing you game media prices are going up.</p>



<p>The famed “$100 game” might, unfortunately, be closer than you think.</p>
