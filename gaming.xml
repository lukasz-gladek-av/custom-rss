        <p>Amid claims teams learned projects were canned "at the same time as everyone else".</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend Studio says it "still plans on creating cool shit", following Sony's decision to cancel its unannounced live-service game - amid claims Bend and the similarly affected Bluepoint only found out about the cancellations "at the same time as everyone else".
</p>
<p>
Word that Sony had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">cancelled two more first-party live service games</a> - this time in development at its Bend and Bluepoint studios - emerged via by Bloomberg last week. Sony, of course, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">plans to invest heavily in live service titles</a> back in 2022, under the watch of then-PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, but the company has cancelled numerous live service games - including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-op Spider-man from developer Insomniac</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">The Last of Us multiplayer game</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">Twisted Metal project at Firesprite</a> - since Ryan's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">departure last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for the latest casualties of Sony's apparent strategic rethink, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier claimed Bluepoint had been developing an unannounced live service God of War game. And while no details of Bend's canned project were shared, the studio previously said it was working on a new IP which would include multiplayer and "[build] upon the open-world systems of Days Gone". It's unclear, however, if this is the same game that's now been axed.

<p>
Regardless, Bend has now broken its silence, thanking fans for their support and offering assurances it's not done yet. "I'll keep this short," Bend community manager Kevin McAllister wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623">message shared on social media</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit."
</p><p>
As to what's next for Bluepoint and Bend, that remains uncertain. According to journalist Jeff Grubb in his latest Game Mess Mornings video show (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bluepoint-and-bend-staff-learned-their-live-service-ps5-games-were-cancelled-at-the-same-time-as-everyone-else/">VGC</a>), both teams have had little time to process the news. "The two studios found out at the same time as everyone else," Grubb told listeners, "so people will be going into work today wondering, 'Hey, okay, what are we doing next?'. And what they're going to have to do next, very likely, is pitch something to Sony, and the landscape of that has changed pretty drastically.‚Äù
</p>
<p>
"A couple of years ago," he continued, "you'd bring to PlayStation your pitch, that is: 'It's a live service game, we know you want to hear that'... And now they have to go back to the drawing board, and come up with a pitch that PlayStation wants to hear, when no one really knows what they want to hear, and so it's a rough situation."
</p>
<p>
Following last week's cancellations, Sony told Bloomberg "neither of the two affected PlayStation studios will be shut down", adding that the "highly accomplished teams" would be "working closely with each studio to determine what are the next projects".
</p>
<p>
Sony's continuing shift away from live service titles follows the high-profile failure of last year's Concord, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">pulled from sale just two weeks after its launch</a> amid low player numbers. Back in 2023 it was reported the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-pivot-may-not-pay-off-the-way-jim-ryan-had-once-hoped-says-industry-insider">company was "uncomfortable"</a> about former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan's decision to focus heavily on live service games.

The Bluepoint game was reportedly a live-service God of War game, according to Bloomberg‚Äôs <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lfvfm2febc2e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jason Schreier</u></a>. Bend Studio‚Äôs live-service game remains unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Sony spokesperson confirmed the cancellations to Bloomberg, adding that neither studio will be closed and that it will work with each to determine next projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony's live-service push has struggled significantly. While Arrowhead‚Äôs Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony‚Äôs other live-service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony‚Äôs Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid drastically low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer. The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog‚Äôs The Last of Us multiplayer game. Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-legend-shuhei-yoshida-wouldve-tried-to-resist-sonys-live-service-push">former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida said he would have tried to resist Sony‚Äôs controversial live-service video game push</a>, were he in the position of current Sony Interactive Entertainment Studio Business Group CEO Hermen Hulst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Bend Studio community manager Kevin McAllister issued a short message to the developer's fans: ‚ÄúThanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S. We still plan on creating cool shit.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As it stands, Bend Studio's last release was 2019‚Äôs Days Gone on PlayStation 4. It launched on PC in 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent financial call, Sony president, COO and CFO Hiroki Totoki said the company had learned lessons from both the record-breaking launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> earlier this year and Concord‚Äôs failure. On Concord specifically, Totoki said Sony should have run its development gates such as user testing or internal evaluation ‚Äúmuch earlier than we did.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúCurrently we are still in the process of learning,‚Äù Totoki admitted. ‚ÄúBasically, with regards to new IP, of course you don‚Äôt know the result until you actually try it. So for our reflection, probably we need to have a lot of gates, including user testing or internal evaluation, and the timing of such gates, we need to bring them forward. We should have done those gates much earlier than we did.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suggestion here from Totoki was that Sony should have noticed and reacted to Concord‚Äôs issues earlier in the development process, presumably so that it could have improved the game before launch ‚Äî or canceled it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Totoki then went on to point fingers at Sony‚Äôs ‚Äúsiloed organization‚Äù and Concord‚Äôs release window, which may have caused cannibalisation. Concord launched in August, not long after smash hit Black Myth: Wukong hit PS5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe have a siloed organization, so going beyond the boundaries of those organizations in terms of development and also sales, I think that could have been much smoother,‚Äù Totoki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúAnd then going forward, in our own titles and in third-party titles, we do have many different windows. And we want to be able to select the right and optimal window so that we can deploy them on our own platform without cannibalisation, so that we can maximize our performance in terms of title launches.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Sony senior vice president for finance and IR Sadahiko Hayakawa compared the launches of Helldivers 2 and Concord, saying lessons learned would be shared throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe launched two live-service games this year,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúHelldivers 2 was a huge hit, while Concord ended up being shut down. We gained a lot of experience and learned a lot from both.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe intend to share the lessons learned from our successes and failures across our studios, including in the areas of title development management as well as the process of continually adding expanded content and scaling the service after its release so as to strengthen our development management system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúWe intend to build on an optimum title portfolio during the current mid-range plan period that combines single-player games ‚Äî which are our strengths and which have a higher predictability of becoming hits due to our proven IP ‚Äî with live-service games that pursue upside while taking on a certain amount of risk upon release.‚Äù</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking to the future, a number of PlayStation live service games remain in the works, including Bungie‚Äôs Marathon, Guerrilla‚Äôs Horizon Online, and Haven Studio‚Äôs Fairgame$.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

They chose to make it so good, and so comprehensive, that it removed the need to make any more. It has now been over ten years since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> first released, more than double the length that‚Äôs ever come between an entry in the series before. Honestly, they could re-re-release <em>8</em> for the Switch 2, and it‚Äôd still sell millions. Given this, here‚Äôs an idea: why not do something <em>dramatically </em>different with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196001" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>All I‚Äôm saying is make it into an RPG.</p><p>It‚Äôs really hard to underline properly how unprecedented is the success of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This game was first released for the Wii U in 2014, then re-released for the Switch in 2017 as <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Now, it was an embellished version, with all previous DLC, new characters, let you hold two items, and a rejuvenated battle mode, but it was still very much the same game. The Wii U version is thought to have sold almost 8.5 million copies, and the Switch release is one of the best-selling games ever made, at an astonishing 64 million copies. With frequent new content, and endless fixes and tweaks, the game is still receiving patches even since what appears to be its final content update when it hit version 3.0.0 in November 2023.</p><p>It‚Äôs been such a phenomenon that Nintendo has very wisely not attempted to usurp it, doubling the longest ever gap between entries, the previous longest stretch being from 1996's <em>Mario Kart 64</em> to 2001's GBA title, <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em>. And listen, remember when Nintendo formerly announced the Switch 2 last week, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">everyone spent a couple of hours arguing over whether the game footage shown was <em>Mario Kart 8</em> or something new</a></span>? People seemed like they‚Äôd be happy with just some more of <em>8</em>.</p><p>So why not? May as well just tip that numeral over and call it <em>Mario Kart ‚àû</em>. Add a whole bunch more tracks, update something else, call it a day. And for <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, let‚Äôs go deep.</p><p>One of my all-time favorite games is 2004's <em>Mario Golf: Advance Tour</em>. I have never played a real game of golf in my life, and have no interest in golf games in general, but that Game Boy Advance game was utter joy from start to finish. You played as one of two kids, Neil or Ella, who join the Marion Clubhouse as potential star golf students. There you meet an eclectic mix of humans and <em>Mario</em> characters, with the ultimate aim of beating Mario himself in the final championship. And it‚Äôs wonderful! Utterly bonkers, with splendid writing, the vast majority of the time you‚Äôre actively playing the core golf game, but all within a narrative, and surrounded by RPG elements.</p><p>When developers Camelot returned with 2014's <em>Mario Golf: World Tour</em>, I was so excited! Ten years later there was to be another entry! And then I found out this was a follow-up to the GameCube‚Äôs <em>Toadstool Tour</em>, no RPG at all, and I went off and sulked. I went through much the same in 2021 with <em>Mario Golf: Super Rush</em>. I‚Äôm still sulking now. But I still hold hope in my heart. I still believe that every single <em>Mario</em> game can be massively improved by being an RPG. So let me sell you on this idea for <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-recommend-id="image://c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-recommend-id="image://c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You pick a character, whether it‚Äôs a Neil or an Ella or a Toad, and you get your first kart.

Once you‚Äôve completed these tasks, you can take part in each track‚Äôs big race, and once you‚Äôve won trophies in all four, you unlock access to the next site, the one that has Toad‚Äôs Turnpike, Frappe Snowland, Choco Mountain, and Mario Raceway.</p><p>Along the way, you gain levels, letting you spend points in speed, drift, bounce, steering, and the all-important luck. You develop your character according to your own preferred approach to <em>Mario Kart</em>, the relatively minor tweaks letting you lean in to your own skills.</p><p>Each site has <em>Mario</em> characters scattered about, people to talk with, little secrets to discover. And each has its own unique bonus rounds, time trials, and extra challenges. The ultimate goal is, of course, to beat Mario on the Rainbow Road, but that‚Äôs a distant dream when you begin. You‚Äôll need to have developed your kart into something really special to manage that, tweaked its brakes and drift to your ideal settings, and gained the best skills in a starting boost.</p><p>Obviously this is the greatest idea anyone has ever had, but alongside my rightfully being given a million-billion dollars and a crown, I imagine there are a few ne‚Äôer-do-wells who would argue, ‚ÄúBut I want a PROPER <em>Mario Kart 9</em>!‚Äù That‚Äôs because they didn‚Äôt read the first half of this perfect argument properly, and realize they just already have it. It‚Äôs <em>Mario Kart Infinite</em>, remember? When Nintendo is building me my throne made of Master Swords, I‚Äôll remind them they have to make that Switch 2 upgrade for <em>8</em>/<em>Infinite</em>, with the handful of new tracks, and that‚Äôll keep them distracted while the rest of us have <em>the best time ever</em>.</p><p>Glad we could get this sorted.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-gives-small-update-on-hollow-knight-silksong/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is still on the way. That‚Äôs according to the game‚Äôs developer Team Cherry over the weekend. </p>



<p>In a reply to a fan wondering if the game is progressing or if the developers had ‚Äúgiven up on the project‚Äù, the game‚Äôs head of marketing and publishing, Matthew Griffin, gave a short answer to the question.</p>



<p>‚ÄúYes the game is real, progressing and will release,‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1880523110816051696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>, following it up with a heart. </p>



<p>While it‚Äôs not the update fans are waiting for from a  game that was officially announced in 2019, it‚Äôs still something from a team that‚Äôs been quite silent up to this point. Originally set to be an expansion to the first game, Silksong turned into a full-fledged sequel during its development. According to Team Cherry, it will feature over 165 new enemies and 100 different benches. </p>



<p>The game sees you play as Hornet, who has been captured and taken to an ‚Äúunfamiliar land‚Äù where she has to fight her way out to get ‚Äúto the kingdom‚Äôs peak‚Äù.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/hollow-knight-silksong-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Team Cherry</a>, in addition to the new enemies and additional benches, Silksong will feature a branch new Kingdom, a new original soundtrack, a challenge mode, new movement mechanics, and new weapons to learn. </p>



<p>The game was originally planned for a 2023 release, but development kept it in the oven. Since then, however, there‚Äôs been no hint as to when it could be coming. When it does finally release, Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. </p>

But that‚Äôs exactly what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> fans are excited to uncover with the release of guest character Conan the Barbarian this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let‚Äôs back up for a bit. Mortal Kombat is perhaps most famous for its various ninjas. Everyone knows Sub-Zero is blue and Scorpion is yellow. Ermac is red and Rain is purple (you see what they did there?). But there's no pink ninja, which is where Pink Floyd come in. Floyd is the name given to a rumored pink ninja supposedly buried within the bowels of Mortal Kombat 1, just waiting to be discovered. NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon has teased fans on multiple occasions by referencing a pink ninja called Floyd, and, back in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1706734341982687374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mortal Kombat dataminer TheThiny</a> unearthed text in the Mortal Kombat 1 files that referenced a character called Floyd.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes. I honestly want to make a PINK ninja and name him FLOYD. No kidding.</p>‚Äî Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1577123361498759168?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 4, 2022</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it looks like Floyd may finally become a reality inside Mortal Kombat 1. Recently released gameplay showing off Conan the Barbarian includes a blink-and-you‚Äôll-miss-it 'Floyd' pop up in pink text displayed on the left of the screen. Bemused fighting game YouTuber Super, whose <a href="https://youtu.be/-pvxw2aRT9o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">early access Conan gameplay</a> contained the Floyd name, took to social media to express their excitement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Listen closely and you‚Äôll hear a guitar riff play alongside the Floyd pop-up during the Conan victory cutscene. Super had no idea how they activated it and couldn‚Äôt replicate it, but Mortal Kombat 1 fans are determined to get to the bottom of this mystery as soon as Conan comes out tomorrow.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The secret floyd fight in MK1 is coming with conan. I somehow activated it but didn't actually go into the match. I tried to get it again but was not successful. </p><p>Watch the full early access conan video here <a href="https://t.co/WpKeQFKB5C" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/WpKeQFKB5C</a> <a href="https://t.co/LqfFOyK2ZL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LqfFOyK2ZL</a></p></div>‚Äî Super (@lSuper_) <a href="https://twitter.com/lSuper_/status/1880317510081536378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it‚Äôs quite possible there <em>is </em>no secret Pink Floyd fight to activate, and this Floyd tease is just that: a tease. Boon is known for trolling Mortal Kombat fans, and the series is packed with pop culture references and in-jokes that go nowhere. You‚Äôd expect dataminers like TheThiny will work it if anything related to Floyd has changed when the Conan update kicks in, but players will still have to discover the activation, if it even exists.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">More details about the secret Floyd Fight:<br>The Floyd Easter egg triggers randomly at any stage. Once the icon pops up it plays a Guitar Riff (Pink Floyd reference?).<br>I believe you have to do a certain action / challenge at that time.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/bFGzCcbWp3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/bFGzCcbWp3</a></p>‚Äî thethiny üê∞üçâ (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1880448153931116719?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Conan the Barbarian, due out January 21 as part of the standard DLC early access period for Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns Expansion owners before wide availability a week later, features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger, who famously played Conan in the cult classic 1982 film, but does not feature his voice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and the aforementioned Conan the Barbarian. NetherRealm is yet to announce a third set of DLc characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/lSuper_/status/1880317510081536378" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Super / X</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyclopean-the-great-abyss">Cyclopean: The Great Abyss</a> appears to have glorious dungeon graphics but I can't say for sure because I can't get torches to work. I think your character is supposed to kindle them automatically when you venture into a dungeon - at which point the view switches, classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a>-style, from top-down into first-person. My character never deigns to light a torch, however. Possibly this is because, no matter how many torches I loot or buy from the underworld's infrequent traders, my character page always tells me I have none. Is my character eating them? Are they too afraid to light them and expose what those dungeons contain? Do I need to read the manual properly? Or is it just a bug?
</p><!--more-->
<p>

For now, I must wander the catacombs in pitch blackness, navigating by way of the minimap and the sound of my character walking into walls. Sometimes I walk into a ghast, Dark Sentinel, or other Lovecraftian hoodlum. I'm sure the monsters are hideous but again, I can't see them, and the turn-based combat sound effects are oddly cartoonish - generally, it sounds like I'm punching a snowman. I realise "never show the monster" is a cardinal rule of horror, but I think you're allowed a peek when the creature is munching on your face.
</p>
<p>
Oh how I wish I could see the monsters of Cyclopean: The Great Abyss, because this feels like a promising cosmic horror game, not least because it's also a minimalist, mildly sandboxy exercise in retro RPG mechanics - hardly "cyclopean" at all, but certainly enticing.</p>
<p>It casts you as an English aristo of some kind who has dreamt their way into the Great Abyss, and must search for a way back to the Waking World. You begin by rolling your stats and equipment - a really rubbish dagger and some protective rags, in my experience. Then off you trot to get your soul sucked by a Moon Beast. The overworld appears to be fixed, but I've encountered different dungeon layouts when revisiting the site of my previous character's death. Beasties aside, there are doors with pickable locks, treasure chests and, best of all, spike traps. I have triggered many a trap in my time with the demo. Fortunately, you can't trigger them repeatedly.
</p><p>
Cyclopean came out in early access this month. The current build supports the core elements of combat, stealth and dialogue. It can be played from start to end with three potential endings. All going to plan, the 1.0 version will launch in six months and feature more elaborate quests, more elaborate NPC interactions, and a more elaborate sanity system. I haven't had a chance to see what happens when you go insane because I can't see anything and I keep stepping on spikes and I keep dying. It's hard to descend into madness when you have all the base survivability of a mosquito in a microwave.
</p>
<p>
Developers Schmidt Workshops are, in fact, a single person from Chicago, Illinois. Their past creations include Islands Of The Caliph, "an old-school inspired action RPG based on Middle Eastern folklore and Islamic spiritual tradition". Given that precedent, I'm curious about how they're going to navigate the usual problem here of Lovecraft being a big smelly racist. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958790/Cyclopean_The_Great_Abyss/">find the demo on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA and DICE have been accused of using photos from the war in Gaza in artwork for Battlefield 2025. </p>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/emadalden_/status/1881045891009929516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EmadAlden</a> spotted the similarity when looking at the promotional artwork. Another user, <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1881050549455659026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DANNYonPC</a>, made the claim that the company is using photos from attacks on Gaza in the imagery. </p>



<p>‚ÄúDamn, DICE is using pictures from attacks on Gaza in their BF2025 artwork,‚Äù the post reads. It then shows the photo in question from a bombing in Gaza dated May 12, 2021 taken by Reuters.</p>



<p>You can see the images yourself below for comparison.</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>While it‚Äôs unlikely it was done with intent or malice, it‚Äôs no question a decision that many could view as questionable. Insider Gaming has reached out to multiple contacts at EA for comment on the claims and the usage of real conflict for its artwork. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly. </p>

<p>Every new season of Diablo IV brings about monumental changes that completely alter the game‚Äôs meta. We usually wind up with colossal skill nerfs, pushing one class down the tier list and bumping another up. Well, the Season of Witchcraft proves no different, as we have class updates for each to contend with on release. It‚Äôs not all bad, though. My beloved Barbarian is getting a buff!</p>

            <p>An unannounced "PvE Action RPG" set in one of Games Workshop's fantasy properties was apparently in development until being cancelled late last year, according to a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/unannounced-warhammer-rpg-cancelled-games-workshop">mp1st</a>.</p>
<p>News of the project was pieced together by mp1st from several LinkedIn profiles belonging to former employees of studio Thought Pennies. Different sources alternately describe the project as a ‚Äúmultiplatform, social role-playing game" and a "fantasy live-service RPG", although it's possible these refer to different projects from the same time period.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The report speculates that the cancellation was due to Games Workshop themselves deciding to "withdraw funding", although to my knowledge GW don't fund games so much as rent out their license for residuals. The project's publisher isn't named in any of the materials shared, though CCO Daniel Erickson does mention another company's change of "strategic direction" in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/daniel-aidan-erickson_over-the-last-three-years-at-thought-pennies-activity-7264324075357941760-nQCJ/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn post</a> made last November in the wake of layoffs at the studio:</p>
<p>"Over the last three years at Thought Pennies we built something amazing. We never missed a milestone, our feedback was great, our partnerships strong. We went from two people and a PowerPoint to a team of almost sixty heavily-vetted, incredibly independent, passionate professionals," wrote Erickon. "Our publisher changed strategic direction, however, and our previous project is now without funding. Last week we had to shrink the size of the studio."</p><p>The "three years" Erickson mentions does line up with the resume dates from the report, two of which list 2022 start dates on the project. Here are the relevant bits from the report, which I've verified with my own RPS nose and eyes and fingers.</p>

<p>Exactly which of Games Workshop's universes the Warhammer game took place in is unclear. The 'fantasy' setting mentioned in one of the posts could suggest either Age Of Sigmar, or Warhammer Fantasy in either its classic or newer incarnation, The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-world">Old World</a>. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-company-looking-for-the-next-one-after-big-success-of-space-marine-2">a recent money-me-doo</a>, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree made it clear the company is "looking for the next one", "one" here referring to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. I love business, man. You can just get up in front of a bunch of people and tell them that your strategy is to find another thing that makes you a lot of money. There was a bit more, to be fair. "We recognize that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games," spoke big daddy plastic. "We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the final season, the show introduced a confusing parallel timeline where the stranded characters live normal lives, only to find out it wasn‚Äôt a parallel timeline but some sort of purgatory-like afterlife where they can all reunite. We never find out why all that weird stuff happens on the island, what the deal was with all of those numbers, or where Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) got the powers to grant immortality and leave whenever he wanted. </p><p>Erickson promises <em>Severance</em> won‚Äôt turn into <em>Lost</em>, but dances around fully committing to answering all of the show‚Äôs mysteries. ‚ÄúI promise the show will not literally turn into <em>Lost</em>.

No‚Äîwe‚Äôre very conscious of that fact that we need to know where we‚Äôre going, and we need to reward people‚Äôs patience and faith.‚Äù</p><p>That <em>Severance </em>fan theories multiplying quicker than Apple can pump out episodes almost guarantees there will be questions unanswered, mainly because they were questions Erickson never posed. The series can have a satisfying ending without explaining how many departments there are in the Lumon building that houses the main cast, or why there is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787">child working on the Severed Floor</a></span><em>. </em>Those mysteries are ancillary and not central to the drama of the show. But, there remain quite a few mysteries they‚Äôll need to clear up by the end of the series if they want to avoid <em>Lost</em> levels of ignominy. </p><p>We need to know what these severed workers are actually working on, and what Lumon‚Äôs ultimate plan is. The whereabouts of Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) seem to be a focal point of the current season, but we also need to know if and how Lumon faked her death given the facts Mark S (Adam Scott) says he identified her body. Under no circumstance can this series end without explaining what the fuck is the deal with the goats. </p><div><p>Those are just a few of the core mysteries that need to be resolved but the time the show wraps up. Lucky for us <em>Severance </em>fans, Erickson says Season 3 shouldn‚Äôt have the nearly three-year wait Season 2 had. Let‚Äôs just hope this whole series isn‚Äôt all just happening in Kier‚Äôs comatose mind in some Lumon nursing home. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I‚Äôm ready for a grind. I want to lose many hours this week, to forget about the winter storm and all of life‚Äôs other challenges rearing their ugly heads daily, and that grind comes from Diablo 4 for the foreseeable future.

You‚Äôll help them throughout the seasonal journey, earning new rewards and powers, like the four schools of Witchcraft: Eldritch, Psyche, Growth &amp; Decay, and Psyche.</p>

            <p>Concept art for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film has been released, revealing cut content and a look at secret characters from the post-credits scene.</p>
<p>The images are from Chinese designers at Tian He Yan Studio, shared earlier today on <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5124957166633153">Weibo</a> (some <strong>film spoilers ahead</strong>!).</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the images have been released a day before the film becomes available digitally, just a month after its release in cinemas.</p>

<p>"This time we are mainly responsible for the drawing of some keyframes and some character modeling," reads the post from Tian He Yan Studio. "The keyframe concept map helps to establish the tone style of the film, and can also assist in guiding the work of visual effects."</p>
<p>Most of the images depict key events from the film. There's Shadow and Maria meeting, Eggman watching a telenovela, Super Sonic and Super Shadow battling in space, and that adorable Chao Garden restaurant scene.</p>
<p>But there's more. Knuckles and Tails are seen riding a motorbike through the streets of London chased by a giant ball of debris, like something out of the Katamari games, in what I presume was a cut action sequence. Another image shows the three Sonic heroes in flight as they escape some sort of sand explosion, with Knuckles covered in scorpions.</p>

<p>Two images are most interesting of all, though, showing both Amy Rose and Metal Sonic. Both of these characters are teased in the film's post-credit scene - it's unclear from this artwork if they were originally intended for this film instead, or if this artwork was created solely for their reveals.</p><p>Either way, this could be an indication of what to expect in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">confirmed film sequel Sonic 4</a>. Amy, for instance, is seen standing over Sonic just as she does in her reveal, though there's a large destroyed robot that's not the Metal Sonic we see in Sonic 3.

<p>The other image shows Metal Sonic alongside Eggman wearing some sort of elaborate emperor garb, a cyberpunk-esque metropolis in the background. This was certainly not part of Sonic 3, with fans suggesting it could be some sort of bad future. If true, it would line up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">theories the next film will be inspired by the time-travelling Sonic CD</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dino-horror-code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-due-to-vulgar-mod-fears.1087011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>TeamKill Media, the developer of upcoming dino horror game <i>Code Violet</i>, has revealed that the game won't be coming to PC, and it's all to do with what the studio thinks modders will do with its characters.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the studio confirms that its game, which looks rather like a mixture of Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>and EA's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, will remain a console exclusive because it doesn't want modders creating "vulgar versions of the main character" or any other characters.</p>

<p>TeamKill goes on to say it holds its "voice actresses and actors with high regard", as well as its "artistic vision for the game and story", and that modders creating "sexual mods" would make "a joke out of [the studio's] art" and possibly tarnish&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>'s actors' "reputation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-dino-chase.jpg?itok=kx07jV1m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/code-violet-not-coming-to-pc-dino-chase.jpg?itok=CdJo8erV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>isn't coming to PC anytime soon.</figcaption></figure><p>When asked whether the game will be coming to Xbox or not, TeamKill <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880816290572718525" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it will "be exclusive to PS5", and in response to a suggestion that&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>is Sony-funded, the developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1881075725786394847" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">clarifies</a>&nbsp;it is "100% independent" and has "no investment or support from anyone but ourselves".</p>

<p>The game apparently won't be coming to Xbox because TeamKill doesn't "have the time or expertise" to devote to creating an Xbox port, and that doing so would "need additional manpower".</p>

<p>Given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-xbox-port-series-s" rel="nofollow">how difficult an Xbox port would apparently have been</a> for&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, another PlayStation 5 exclusive, perhaps TeamKill is right not to commit to leaving the PS5 exclusivity den anytime soon.</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (rather enigmatic) debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Code Violet</em>&nbsp;right here.</p>




<p>Given that Capcom doesn't seem immediately interested in reviving&nbsp;<em>Dino Crisis&nbsp;</em>(and that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shinji-mikami-dino-crisis-monster-hunter-comments" rel="nofollow">original creator Shinji Mikami certainly isn't</a>),&nbsp;<em>Code Violet&nbsp;</em>might be the best you'll get on that front, so it's a bit of a shame it won't be coming to PC.</p>

What happens when supernatural and unstoppable forces take over the place that is meant to be your sanctuary? How can you escape when this is where you are meant to stay? These spectres‚Äìoften ghosts or something demonic‚Äîare mostly unseen, appearing only when they need to drive others out, typically seeking revenge. </p><p>Horror movies tap into the unsettling idea that something evil can lurk within our walls.They turn everyday objects and environments, like creaking floorboards or long hallways, into sources of fear. Any tragic events that occur within these confines can have ripple effects on all future residents. Let‚Äôs step inside some of the best haunted houses ever to be put on screen.</p></div></div><div><p>The visionary Guillermo del Toro helms this sumptuous Gothic melodrama with haunted house themes. The newly wed Edith Cushing moves into her husband Sir Thomas Sharpe‚Äôs mammoth yet crumbling estate, Allerdale Hall, along with his sister, Lucille. Edith warily navigates the mansion, drenched in midnight blues, where the only light comes from flickering candelabras. As she moves through the hallways, she searches for the source of the unsettling whispers and creaking floors. The ghosts are unlike any you‚Äôve seen before‚Äîspindly creatures with red skin stretched taut over their bones, bent limbs, and dark, hollow eyes. The slow-moving, moaning creatures hold the key to the nefarious Sharpe family history. </p></div><div><p>At first, <em>Insidious </em>feels familiar, another story about a married couple (Rose Byrne and scream king Patrick Wilson) and their young children moving into a new home, only to experience unusual, supernatural occurrences‚Äîrandomly blaring alarms, bloody handprints on the children‚Äôs bed, and eerie noises. James Wan meticulously crafts his horror scenes with subtlety. In one memorable scene, the camera follows Renai as she goes about the house doing mundane chores, like taking out the garbage, while the unsettling children‚Äôs song ‚ÄúTiptoe Through the Tulips‚Äù warbles on a record player. </p><p>Through the window from a distance, she catches a barely noticeable shadow of a little boy in period clothing, dancing to the song. It‚Äôs little moments like these that make <em>Insidious </em>so frightening. There‚Äôs plenty of jump scares, as well, like the sudden appearance of a red-faced demon that will leave your heart in your throat. The most inventive and chilling part of <em>Insidious </em>is The Further, a dark, foggy dimension where lost souls and demonic entities wait for the living. </p></div><div><p>While director Takashi Shimizu‚Äôs Japanese original is arguably superior, he also directs the American version of <em>The Grudge</em>, and both are well worth watching. The English version follows Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse who encounters a haunted house in Tokyo. The way Japanese horror depicts ghosts gives you goosebumps‚Äîlong-haired, pale figures with wide, black eyes that stare at you with a laser focus, appearing out of nowhere. </p><p>One of the scariest scenes is when a ghost crawls down the stairs, its limbs contorted into jagged angles and making a god-awful croaking noise. Another appears directly on top of someone beneath the covers. <em>The Grudge</em> transforms the emotional pain of a person‚Äôs life on Earth into a curse that claims all those who enter the space where these traumas occurred‚Äîcreating an endless cycle of torment.</p></div><div><p>There‚Äôs some 1970s-era cheese in <em>The Amityville Horror</em>, but it‚Äôs still one of the OG haunted house movies and a must-see. Based on a true story, the Lutz family moves into a New York home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. slaughtered his entire family. The famous arched windows truly look like eyes, as if the house is sizing up its next victims. </p><p>Satanic occurrences plague the new residents, such as being swarmed by flies, waking up at the same early hour that the DeFeos were murdered, and seeing the piercing eyes of a pig outside the second-story window. <em>The Amityville Horror</em> makes the menacing assertion that the dark events tied to the land where our homes are built, as well as the history within a house‚Äôs walls, can manifest in evil ways.</p></div><div><p>Despite being championed by Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as one of the scariest movies of all time, <em>The Haunting</em> doesn‚Äôt rely on jump scares or terrifying monster reveals, unlike the hokey 1999 remake. Instead, Robert Wise‚Äôs film takes its time and revels in ambiguity, never allowing the viewer to truly know what‚Äôs behind the swaying chandeliers, the loud banging, or the sounds of a girl crying. We learn that the stately mansion does have a tragic backstory when a group is brought there for a paranormal study, including a psychic (Claire Bloom) and a lonely woman who claims to have personal experience with the supernatural (Julie Harris). </p><p>What<em> The Haunting </em>lacks in traditional frights makes up for in atmosphere: ominous low angles, a sharp monochromatic palette, and the ornate Gothic surroundings of the sprawling manor. The camera itself has a ghostly presence, observing the characters from afar with a curious tension, using widescreen to capture the lopsided rooms, always leaving us uncertain whether something strange will appear.</p></div><div><p><em>Paranormal Activity </em>became a cinematic sensation thanks to its viral marketing that included trailers with night vision clips of terrified audience members and a campaign urging people to demand the film be shown in their theaters. Similar to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, the identities of the actors were kept hidden, making it feel as though this footage was truly found. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>is one of the best haunted house movies because of its simplicity; most of the film is observing the couple Katie and Micah (Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat) sleeping in their new home, unaware that an invisible demonic presence is also watching them and waiting to strike. </p><p>It makes you wonder what happens in your own home while you‚Äôre fast asleep. We are filled with dread every time the video camera time clock reaches 3AM, when the vengeful supernatural forces pull comforters, slam doors, or drag someone into a pitch-black hallway. The lo-fi aesthetic and practical special effects make the scares feel more personal and tangible, culminating in a cruel and devastating ending. </p></div><div><p>Nicole Kidman delivers yet another arresting performance as Grace, a buttoned-up, devout mother who will do anything to protect her pale, delicate children with a rare condition that makes exposure to the sunlight painful. This means that the inside of the stately Gothic estate on the English countryside is cloaked in shadow and lit by candlelight throughout the film, which only heightens the tension of the ghostly happenings such as a piano playing by itself or doorknobs randomly jiggling. </p><p>One of the most terrifying scenes is when Grace finds an elderly woman wearing her daughter‚Äôs communion dress and playing with puppets but speaking in her little voice. There‚Äôs an antiquated eeriness to <em>The Others</em> in the depictions of seances and nineteenth-century photographs of corpses, all building to a surprising twist ending that completely turns the haunted house genre on its head.</p></div><div><p>Tobe Hooper, who directed the grimy <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, and producer Steven Spielberg, the king of suspenseful blockbusters, join forces for Poltergeist, which follows the Freeling family living in a suburban California home. The film is filled with bold and unforgettable visuals: a knotted tree that comes to life and bursts into a child‚Äôs bedroom, a creepy clown doll, a face melting into bone, a little girl sucked into a television set, and a pool filled with skeletons. </p><p>The family enlists a team of paranormal experts, including a psychic, to try to rescue Carol Anne (Heather O‚ÄôRourke) and exorcise the sinister and restless spirits that haunt their home. They eventually discover a macabre truth about the land their home was built on. While <em>Poltergeist </em>is certainly scary, it also has a playful side, offering a thrill ride that gleefully drags its characters through a chaotic, rollercoaster-like experience.</p></div><div><p><em>The Orphanage</em> blends a traditional haunted house ghost story with a missing persons thriller, set in a decaying estate that was once an orphanage. After living there as a child, Laura Rodr√≠guez (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bel√©n Rueda</a></span>) returns to the orphanage with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their seven-year-old son Sim√≥n (Roger Princep), planning to transform it into a haven for children with disabilities. </p><p>Soon, Sim√≥n claims to have befriended a boy named Tom√°s, who wears a disturbing sack with a painted-on smile. Laura also sees him appear throughout the grounds. Shot in muted colors, <em>The Orphanage</em> carries a deep sense of melancholy. After Sim√≥n mysteriously goes missing, the film moves toward a tragic and shocking ending that reveals the creepy children clich√© is more than it seems. </p></div><div><p>James Wan is a master of horror because he knows exactly how to carefully and slowly form heart-jumping, inventive scares with haunting images. They often strike you when you least expect it, like the sudden appearance of a foot dangling from a ghastly pale body hanging from a tree, or a craggy, snarling witch perched on top of a dresser. <em>The Conjuring</em> is one of his best films, based on the true story of the Perron family, who move into a house where strange occurrences begin‚Äîwaking up at 3:07AM every morning, bruises appearing on the mother Carolyn‚Äôs (Lili Taylor) body, and an unseen figure lurking in a pitch-black bedroom corner. </p><p>The way Wan reveals the ghosts‚Äîslow and steady, yet quick and lacerating‚Äîis truly terrifying. <em>The Conjuring</em> also turns the real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also worked on the Amityville Horror case, into compelling protagonists with a romantic love story. It also gives them a connection to the film‚Äôs surprisingly moving themes of motherhood. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A reliable leaker has claimed that Xbox is working on a Red Cipher Wireless Controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-nouvelle-manette-xbox-en-edition-speciale-bientot-disponible-59870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, Xbox‚Äôs next wireless controller is the Red Cipher, the latest instalment to the Cipher series. Previously, the manufacturers released the Sky Cipher and Ghost Cipher controllers. The Red Cipher announcement is expected to be announced in January 2025 and will be available only through the Microsoft store.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-red-cipher-controller-price-nbsp">Xbox Red Cipher Controller Price&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The exact release date for the Xbox Red Cipher controller is currently unknown. However, the pricing details have been revealed. The upcoming controller is expected to cost the same as the other controllers in the series, ‚Ç¨69.99 / $69.99 / GBP 64.99.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the pricing, we also know the colour palette for the Xbox Red Cipher Controller. The controller will feature a translucent design, similar to the Sky and Ghost instalments. The buttons will be bright red, and the back will be garnet red.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from the red controller, the report also mentioned the Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sebile</a> controller, which was leaked through FTC documents some time ago. The controller is said to feature haptic feedback tech similar to Sony‚Äôs DualSense controllers, and <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> recently spotted a patent for it. However, no new information has been revealed about the Sebile controller.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-6-xbox-series-s-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ESRB rating suggests</a> that Resident Evil 6 is coming to Xbox Series X/S.

            <p>TeamKill Media is resisting calls to release its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a>-like Code Violet on PC as it doesn't want anyone modding "vulgar versions" of its characters.</p>
<p>Addressing players on social media, the team said it held its voice actresses and actors "with high regard" and "making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make".</p>

<p>Code Violet is expected to release in July 2025, exclusively on PS5.</p>
<p>TeamKill's statement is reminiscent of Koei Tecmo's position, which recently revealed it had taken "strict action" against thousands of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/koei-tecmos-protective-about-its-dead-or-alive-ip-because-the-characters-are-like-daughters">provocative Dead or Alive fanart images because the characters are "like daughters" to their creators</a>.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo's legal affairs lead, Tomotoshi Nishimura, recently addressed a copyright conference in which he revealed that whilst the company was pragmatic and even supportive of "<a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/otaku">otaku</a>" fan culture, it had no choice but to issue copyright strikes against amateur images that are created for, uh, "adult purposes".</p>
<p>Naoki Hamaguchi, the director of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-asks-pc-players-to-avoid-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods">also recently asked PC players not to install any "offensive or inappropriate" mods</a> once the game is released.</p>
<p>Conversely, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian Studios <em>loves</em> mods. After recently revealing over 100m mods have been downloaded, it gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Baldur's Gate 3's Withers a pair of "big naturals"</a>...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/malediction-preview-mtg-meets-warhammer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After checking out the upcoming <i>Malediction</i> at <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-new-games-at-pax-unplugged-2024" rel="nofollow">PAX Unplugged this winter</a>, creators of the game Loot Studios sent us home with some starter sets to check out ahead of the game‚Äôs launch on <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/loot-studios/malediction" rel="nofollow">GameFound</a>. Now that we‚Äôve played a suite of matches, we‚Äôve got first impression thoughts!</p>

<h2><i>Malediction - What Is It?</i></h2>

<p><i>Malediction</i> is a unique blend of a few different genres of tabletop gaming. It takes the skirmish tabletop warfare of a Games Workshop <i>Warhammer</i> game like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-warcry-guide" rel="nofollow"><i>Warcry</i></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-brutal-and-cunning-review" rel="nofollow"><i>Kill Team</i></a> but adds a unique card draw element.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-combat-on-blood-pool.jpeg?itok=aYw14SyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-combat-on-blood-pool.jpeg?itok=1owfaJ0o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When I met with the team at PAX Unplugged, their one sentence elevator pitch put it succinctly: it‚Äôs like Commander<i> </i>meets <i>Warhammer</i>. After having played a few test games of <i>Malediction</i>, I have to agree!</p>

<p>Want to try the game out for yourself? They‚Äôve got <a href="https://malediction.gg/print-and-play/" rel="nofollow">a free print-and-play version of the game</a> ready to download now!</p>

<h2>Building A Deck And Army In <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>In <i>Malediction</i>, when you construct your force, you‚Äôre not just going to bring together a collection of miniatures. You‚Äôll also be building a deck of cards centered around a leader. Choosing cards within that leader‚Äôs faction, you‚Äôll build a deck that includes unit cards, gear, slower channel spells, and quick swift spells.</p>

<p>This is one of my favorite twists on the wargaming genre. To bring a miniature out onto the battlefield, you have to play the card from your hand and spend Echo (your mana-like resource in the game) to put it on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Spells you have in hand may let you spend Echo to heal a unit, perform an extra attack, move for free, and myriad other special abilities. In this way, you‚Äôre customizing both your forces and the ways you can upgrade or augment them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-cards.jpeg?itok=ixzVLmPU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-cards.jpeg?itok=_kViWyu3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Gameplay Is Fast In <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>One of the things I liked most about my playthroughs of <i>Malediction</i> is just how quickly the game goes. We tried it with two players and as a free-for-all three person game (which the rules don‚Äôt account for so we homebrewed a little bit), and both where snappy - finishing up in less than an hour.</p>

<p>Part of this comes from what it takes to win the game. It‚Äôs a rush to a set amount of victory points - in our games we played to 25. You gain victory points equal to the cost of enemies you defeat, <i>and</i> you get points for securing powerful artifacts strewn about the board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-combat-moment.jpeg?itok=pEjXAraD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-combat-moment.jpeg?itok=C_G-v2y1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat here clustered around a Husk (black-based miniature toward the back) where a powerful artifact waits to be claimed!</figcaption></figure><p>The other reason this game zips along is the way you field units. At the start of the game, you can field units from the corner of your battlefield. But after that, you can bring a unit in next to a unit of yours already on the board - no matter where they are - provided you‚Äôre not engaged with an enemy unit. This removes the slog of having to slowly advance your models across the battlefield.</p>

<h2>The Forces of <i>Malediction </i>All Feel <i>Very</i> Different</h2>

<p>We were sent home with copies of all four of the forces made for the premiere of the game - Primal Blood, Order of the Shattered Throne, Legion of the Fallen, and&nbsp; and each has its own distinct play style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Primal Blood faction is all about aggression - they willing sacrifice both accuracy and health to gain bonuses to attack, and many of their units can make reckless charges and extra moves across the battlefield.</p>

<p>The Order of the Shattered Throne are angelic guardians, who guard each other well. Many of the figures in this faction can absorb damage intended for nearby enemies, and their spell cards involve a lot of healing and damage negation.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-soulwhisperer-by-guilherme-motta-large.jpeg?itok=16EQH8aV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-soulwhisperer-by-guilherme-motta-large.jpeg?itok=Kf2Iotr1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Soulwhisperer, a unit in the Legion of the Fallen, shows off the macabre aesthetic of the faction. Art by Guilherme Motta. Image: Loot Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The Legion of the Fallen are comprised of the walking dead (or nearly dead) in many iterations, and focus on damage through swarming enemies with low cost minions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there‚Äôs the Conclave of the Spheres faction, who dabble most heavily in magic and are willing to sacrifice their minions to achieve their goals.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/malediction-units-and-cards.jpeg?itok=nUKm8hV5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/malediction-units-and-cards.jpeg?itok=erqUXfd7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Units from the Order of the Shattered Throne (Gold bases) and Primal Blood (Red Base) with their unit cards.</figcaption></figure><p>It‚Äôs easiest, perhaps, to think of these four factions as colors on the <i>Magic: The Gathering </i>wheel. Primal Blood is like Red cards with their aggression, Order of the Shattered Throne, with its life gain and defense, is like White cards. Legion of the Fallen, full of undead and devastatingly deadly, is like Black MTG cards. And Conclave of the Spheres, with its mana-manipulation and spell-focused trickery, is very MTG Blue.</p>

<h2>STL Files in <i>Malediction</i></h2>

<p>In closing, one of the more interesting aspects to this skirmish wargame is the fact that the box itself contains no plastic miniatures. Instead, you‚Äôll receive cardboard standees (as pictured throughout) to represent your models and the terrain. But when you crowdfund the game, you‚Äôll receive the STL files to print their gorgeous 3D minis.</p>

<p>If you don‚Äôt have a 3D printer of your own, they have a list of recommended 3D print-on-demand vendors they‚Äôll recommend.</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of the more unique approaches to tabletop wargaming I‚Äôve played in a long time. You‚Äôll need some table space - but no more than a normal wargame would expect from you - and there are elements here that are direct references to other games (you ‚Äúexhaust‚Äù or tap your models‚Äô cards once they‚Äôve activated, you can cast spells ala <i>MTG</i> with sorcery or instants), but the culmination of how <i>Malediction </i>brings it all together is pretty incredible.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-12-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Infold Games has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.2, which will bring new outfits, new activities and minigames, and much more later this week.</p>

<p>The official release date for Version 1.2 is January 23rd, which means that&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>will have to compete with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct</a> for your time. I'm sure you've already figured out which of the two you'll be checking out come Thursday, though.</p>

<p>Following on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1" rel="nofollow">excitement of Version 1.1</a>, Version 1.2 - also known as "Firework Season" - will introduce the Firework Isles. There, you'll find the "stunning" Songbreeze Highland, the "serene" Crescent Shoal, and the "lively" Camp Kaboom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.2-firework-season.jpg?itok=Ea-HO4LH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.2-firework-season.jpg?itok=jFuFqwuF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s next update brings new areas, new activities, and, of course, beautiful fireworks.</figcaption></figure><p>New story content will take Nikki and Momo to the Firework Isles in order to prepare for an event called the Carnival of Fireworks. Of course, complications quickly arise, and before long, Nikki and Momo will be facing off against a new boss known as The Dark Bouquet.</p>

<p>The new update will also bring "an array of dazzling new outfits", just as you'd expect from an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, as well as new activities and minigames.</p>

<p>You'll get the chance to enjoy the New Bloom Festival, which will bring a "festive celebration full of music, lanterns, and even firecrackers". What's more, you can participate in a range of events to win rewards including free pulls, Diamonds, and "two exclusive outfits".</p>

<p>If you've been clamoring to listen to&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>'s music, then you'll be pleased to know the game's soundtrack will soon launch on "all major music platforms" and will include tracks like "Find My Way" and "Nikki Nikki", as well as many other pieces.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Nikki&nbsp;</em>series. It's a cozy open-world adventure that emphasizes platforming, minigames, and collecting outfits over traditional combat (although it does have that too, albeit in its own rather quirky way).</p>

<p>Released in December, the free-to-play game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">quickly notched up 10 million downloads</a>, and according to a press release, it's now passed the 20 million mark as well. Impressive stuff!</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>. Version 1.2 launches on January 23rd, and Firework Season runs until February 25th.</p>

This minimum requirement is also detailed as requiring an internal resolution of 720p, and upscaling the graphics using DLSS or FSR using the ‚Äúlowest‚Äù graphics setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds‚Äô recommended settings also target 1080p and 60 FPS with upscaling and Frame Generation technologies enabled, using the examples of an RTX 2070 Super, RTX 4060, or AMD RX 6700 XT.  Out of the three, only the RTX 4060 supports Nvidia Frame Generation, with the 2070 Super and 6700 XT instead having to rely on FSR 3 (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ggyejd/monster_hunter_wilds_fsr3_frame_gen_needs_work/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>which had ghosting artifacts in the previous Monster Hunter Wilds beta</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Targeting 60 FPS with Frame Generation enabled isn‚Äôt the ideal use of the technology, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68oI_tkJEoc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry recommending a baseline of 40 FPS</u></a> in third-person titles. If a game runs at under 60 FPS with upscaling enabled, it may result in a much less responsive or tactile feeling due to latency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test, PC players with lower-end hardware struggled, even with mid-range graphics cards <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-monster-hunter-wilds-beta-isnt-looking-so-hot-but-capcom-says-the-full-game-is-already-in-a-more-improved-state/#:~:text=Monster%20Hunter%20Wilds-,The%20Monster%20Hunter%20Wilds%20beta%20isn't%20looking%20so%20hot,in%20a%20more%20improved%20state'&amp;text=My%20Palico%20shouldn't%20have%20to%20see%20this.&amp;text=As%20a%20card%2Dcarrying%20MonHun,well%20for%20a%20smooth%20launch." data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>like the RTX 3060</u></a>. In particular, players experienced a low-LOD bug where the game did not load the fully detailed textures of characters or monsters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is built on the RE Engine, which first debuted in 2017‚Äôs Resident Evil 7. The engine was used in games like Devil May Cry 5, Monster Hunter Rise, and Street Fighter 6, with slick performance across all platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, all that glitters is not gold for the RE Engine, as bigger open-world titles with more NPCs and enemies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragons-dogma-ii">Dragon‚Äôs Dogma 2</a> have suffered from performance woes on consoles and PC, setting a worrying portent for Monster Hunter Wilds. With the clock ticking towards an early February open beta and late February launch, Capcom‚Äôs claim of attempting to reduce GPU requirements could be key for the title‚Äôs success on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sayem is a freelancer based in the UK, covering tech &amp; hardware.
