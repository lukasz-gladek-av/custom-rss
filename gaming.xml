			<p>It was just yesterday that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> in an official capacity that the Nintendo Switch 2 had sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days. That was already billed as the fastest-selling Nintendo console ever, but now IGN has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> with the Japanese manufacturer that the new hardware is selling twice as fast as the original Switch when considering the same timeframe (the first four days on the market). The Switch had sold 2.7 million units in nearly a month since launching in stores.</p>
<p>So far, analyst estimates have been fully confirmed. Shortly after the console's public reveal in early April, DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it would be a 'resounding success'&nbsp;<span>with 15 million sold by the end of 2025. Last month, they&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also provided</a> a long-term outlook</span>. Calling it the most important console launch ever, they shared the estimate that the Nintendo Switch 2 could sell as many as a hundred million units by the end of 2029.</p>
<p>Wccftech friend Rhys Elliott, who recently moved from MIDiA Research to Alynea Analytics, was a bit more tentative when outlining his outlook. In a LinkedIn post, he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_switch2-nintendo-pokaezmon-activity-7338479592954884096-8k0A/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that this year's holiday season will be crucial for the console's momentum:</p>
<p><em>I was certain the Switch 2 would initially outsell the original. The OG was heavily supply-constrained and was held back at launch (although the FOMO almost certainly added to demand). This time, Nintendo knew what to expect, so it got all its logistical and inventory ducks in a row. The real question is whether Nintendo can continue this momentum once it has reached all the diehards. I reckon it will keep selling well, but there's caveats.</em></p>
<p><em>The comparison with the Switch 1 is challenging. The original was many consumers' gateway to games when we were all stuck at home during the pandemic. Cozy gamers will mobilize in full force when the next Animal Crossing hits, but it likely won't be a success on the level of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/animal-crossing-new-horizons-essential-social-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</a></em></p>
<p><em>The big litmus test for the Switch 2's long-term success will be calendar Q4 this year. On the road to the holiday season, Nintendo needs a strong content cadence and to fine-tune its marketing for casual audiences. Nintendo's dev teams have been quiet, so I'm expecting a Nintendo Direct soon to begin drumming hype. There's a little uncertainty still, but I'm optimistic about the Switch 2's long-term potential. If Nintendo nails the holiday season this year, it'll probably nail the whole generation.</em></p>

            <p>
Despite having received a plethora of updates, bits of DLC, and expansion packs over the course of the past 11 years, there are still things that featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 3 that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is yet to receive. Seriously, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> has been supported for twice the length of time The Sims 3 was, and yet it's only this year that it's getting a pack that features fairies. They'll be coming in the just announced Enchanted by Nature pack, which includes a bit more than just a new supernatural designation for your Sims.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The biggest thing is the fairies though, so let's start with that. Thanks to literal Mother Nature, you'll be able to turn any of your Sims into fairies, with a couple of different paths laid out before them. You can either turn them into a Harmonious Fairy, a "benevolent winged helper who wants to aide other living things find health and balance," or a Discordant Fairy, a "flying mischief-maker that enjoys stirring up a little chaos and making everyday life harder for the Sims around them."

<p>
Fairies also come with some unique abilities like being able to nurture plants or change other Sims' moods. Sounds a bit manipulative if you ask me, but The Sims is all about the drama really isn't it? You can customise the fairy version of your Sims too, from wings, to ears, to glowing tattoos and beyond. I'd also like to point out that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/maxis">Maxis</a> shared fairies can "even use their Fairy charm to deliver a special WooHoo!" They somewhat know their audience, at least.
</p>
<p>
There's a new area coming with this expansion too, Innisgreen, which looks like something out of the dreams of a 2020-era cottagecore TikToker. This one's made up of three neighbourhoods, a seaside village, a towny sort of area with shops and houses to live in, and a magical forest. There's a bevy of whimsical looking items to build up new homes with too.
</p>
<p>
It seems that your Sims can also get imbalanced when they lose control of their life a bit, which can make them learn skills a bit slower than normal. This can lead to ailments, which actually have both pros and cons, but you can fix these by making cures and elixirs on the new apothecary table. You can read all of this in more detail over in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/enchanted-by-nature-expansion-pack">blog post from EA</a>.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and you've not got long to wait for this one either, as it's currently due out next month, July 10th.

The monster will spawn in the Iceshard Cliffs and Wounded Hollow after you’ve defeated it. Keep leveling up your Hunter Rank, and you’ll soon find its tempered version in the same locations as well as the Ruins of Wyveria.</p><p>Saving Gore Magala investigations is ideal if you’re looking to farm the monster’s parts. This will cost fewer Guild Points than repeatedly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-rest-plenty-fallow-inclemency-1851776094">resting in your tent</a></span> to force a spawn. More importantly, you’ll end up with multiple chances in case you fail an attempt.</p><h2 id="h414290"><a id="2"></a>How Gore Magala’s Frenzy Virus works</h2><figure id="" data-id="2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-recommend-id="image://2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hunter Ailments screen, highlighting how Frenzy works." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Hunter Ailments screen, highlighting how Frenzy works." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-recommend-id="image://2e23bc82549f048bd6f0b6b9bf8e4ec0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Hunter Ailments screen, highlighting how Frenzy works." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The strongest monsters always have the most distinctive gimmicks, and that’s certainly the case here. <strong>Many of Gore Magala’s attacks will disperse purple clouds that can afflict your hunter with the two-phased Frenzy Virus.</strong> Phase one is all about battling your exposure to it, while the second phase is dependent on whether you cured it or not. Here’s a handy breakdown:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Phase 1 (Exposure):</strong> Presented as a tiny purple gauge among the other status icons above your health bar. It slowly fills up on its own, although taking more Frenzy attacks will accelerate the progress. Eating a Nulberry can lower the gauge, but the only way to cure it is to land multiple hits on a monster.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Infected):</strong> Presented as a swirling red cloud among your status icons. Failing to stop the exposure gauge from filling up results in a temporary halt to your natural health recovery and an increase in damage taken.</li><li><strong>Phase 2 (Cured):</strong> Presented as a swirling blue cloud among your status icons. Landing enough attacks will cure you of the Frenzy Virus and provide a temporary increase to your Affinity.</li></ul><p><strong>Antivirus is a fantastic skill to bring to this fight</strong>. It makes curing the virus a lot easier and provides an increased Affinity bonus for doing so. The one catch is that aside from the Sane Jewel decoration and Sanity Charm talismans, this skill is only available with some of the Gore Magala forged armor pieces. Said armor also has a Set Bonus Skill to self-inflict the Frenzy Virus while fighting any monster, so more confident hunters can use it to their advantage. I’d suggest avoiding the virus altogether if you have trouble dealing with it.</p><h2 id="h414291"><a id="3"></a>Gore Magala’s weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-recommend-id="image://aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-recommend-id="image://aac87e2aa9d3f09c3d22c7dc5cf287bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy tab for Gore Magala, showing its break points and weaknesses." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a lot to keep track of when hunting Gore Magala, and that’s made much harder when it dictates the pacing of the hunt. Utilize the following weaknesses against it to slow the fight down and provide the openings you need:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Elemental Weaknesses:</strong> Fire</li><li><strong>Weapon Type Weaknesses:</strong> Cut, Blunt</li><li><strong>Breakable Parts:</strong> Antenna, Tail (can also be severed), Wings x2</li><li><strong>Susceptible Status Ailments:</strong> Blastblight (most effective), Exhaust (most effective), Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, Stun</li><li><strong>Items and Traps:</strong> Shock Trap, Pitfall Trap</li></ul><h2 id="h414292"><a id="4"></a>How to beat Gore Magala</h2><p>It’s time to put everything into practice. <strong>Gore Magala’s biggest blind spot is right underneath it.</strong> The big monster will likely need to reposition or use an attack with a sizable wind-up to reach you. This is the best place to be without worrying about any long combos locking you into a dangerous situation.</p><p>The camera, of course, will present an issue. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> will prioritize visibility for your character, so the giant Gore Magala might turn invisible when you’re under it. Do your best not to lose track of your target. Trust me that you do not want to randomly get hit by an air dive or any Frenzy-related attack.</p><p>Speaking of, <strong>you may notice the wings begin to glow purple throughout the hunt. This is a sign that Gore Magala is about to enter the unique Frenzy State</strong>. You’ll know this state is fully active once two horn-like antennas emerge from its head. Expect a lot more movement and much more aggressive attacks when this happens. Dealing enough damage to the head is the best way to end this state, but you might need to use some traps to keep it in place. Saving your opportunity to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mount</a></span> will also come in handy at this moment.</p><p>I’d be remiss not to highlight the importance of your environment. Both the Ice Shard Cliffs and Ruins of Wyveria have narrow areas that can make this an even bigger pain. Lure the monster to larger areas, or better yet, towards other monsters. Let them fight while you recover and sharpen your weapons. Don’t forget about triggering falling debris whenever possible as well. Any knockdown is a welcome knockdown. </p><p>There honestly isn’t much more to this hunt. Gore Magala simply hits hard and then hits a lot harder while in the Frenzy State and when you’re infected with the Frenzy Virus. Always prioritize not getting infected and ending the Frenzy State as soon as possible. If you’re struggling and not aiming for a particular carving reward, remember that you can always capture the monster once it’s weak enough. That’s a lot easier than finishing the hunt by slaying it.</p><p>Everything above will also apply to its tempered version, but you should expect a much more difficult fight. Tempered Gore Magala is relentless in its attacks and will enter the Frenzy State a lot faster. Seeing huge chunks of your health disappear is a common occurrence. Be prepared with high defense and preferably a level-three Antivirus skill. If you typically use a weapon that can guard, consider switching out to something different. I’ve found dodging is overall more helpful than guarding due to the high amount of chip damage you can take.</p><h2 id="h414293"><a id="5"></a>Gore Magala’s drops</h2><figure id="" data-id="8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-recommend-id="image://8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-recommend-id="image://8e48d22ae56637656098192d5a78cc13" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Large Monster Field Guide screen, showing Gore Magala’s different material drops." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After victory comes the hard-earned spoils.

<p>The nsOne project joins a growing community of homebrew PlayStation 1 hardware developments. Other recent projects include <a href="https://github.com/picostation/picostation">Picostation</a>, a Raspberry Pi Pico-based optical disc emulator (ODE) that allows PlayStation 1 consoles to load games from SD cards instead of physical discs. Other ODEs like <a href="https://shop.terraonion.com/shop/product/terraonion-mode-dreamcast-saturn-ode-ps1-install-kit-pu-18-boards/view">MODE</a> and <a href="https://psio.cybdyn-systems.com.au/">PSIO</a> have also become popular solutions for retrogaming collectors who play games on original hardware as optical drives age and fail.</p>
<h2>From repair job to reverse-engineering project</h2>
<p>To understand the classic console's physical architecture, Brodesco physically sanded down an original motherboard to expose its internal layers, then cross-referenced the exposed traces with component datasheets and service manuals.</p>
<p>"I realized that detailed documentation on the original motherboard was either incomplete or entirely unavailable," Brodesco explained in his Kickstarter campaign. This discovery launched what would become a comprehensive documentation effort, including tracing every connection on the board and creating multi-layer graphic representations of the circuitry.</p>

<p>Using optical scanning and manual net-by-net reverse-engineering, Brodesco recreated the PlayStation 1's schematic in modern PCB design software. This process involved creating component symbols with accurate pin mappings and identifying—or in some cases creating—the correct footprints for each proprietary component that Sony had never publicly documented.</p>
<p>Brodesco also identified what he calls the "minimum architecture" required to boot the console without BIOS modifications, streamlining the design process while maintaining full compatibility.</p>
<p>The mock-up board shown in photos validates the footprints of chips and connectors, all redrawn from scratch. According to Brodesco, a fully routed version with complete multilayer routing and final layout is already in development.</p>

<p>As Brodesco noted on Kickstarter, his project's goal is to "create comprehensive documentation, design files, and production-ready blueprints for manufacturing fully functional motherboards."</p>
<p>Beyond repairs, the documentation and design files Brodesco is creating would preserve the PlayStation 1's hardware architecture for future generations: "It's a tribute to the PS1, to retro hardware, and to the belief that one person really can build the impossible."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hong-kong-bans-mobile-game-reversed-front-bonfire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hong Kong is warning its citizens to not download or play <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em>, a Taiwan-made video game police accuse of promoting “secessionist agendas.” It’s likely the first time Hong Kong has used a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/03/19/1239403058/hong-kong-new-article-23-national-security-legislation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national security law</a> implemented in 2020 to block users from a video game, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/hong-kong-bans-video-game-in-further-national-security-push" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyone who has the game downloaded on their phone risks an offense, and players who have made in-app purchases could face punishment for providing funding to developer ESC Taiwan, <a href="https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202506/10/P2025061000697.htm?fontSize=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to a notice from Hong Kong police</a>. The game has since been removed from Apple and Android’s app stores in Hong Kong. It remains available in the U.S. via Apple’s App Store, and also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197370/Reversed_Front/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently has a Steam page</a>. As of Thursday morning, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reversed+front+google+play+store&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1165US1165&amp;oq=reversed+front+google+play+store&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQ2MzNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath was not able to access the game on the US Google Play Store</a>; according to Bloomberg, it was removed from the Google Play Store in May for issues unrelated to the current ban. We’ve reached out to Google for comment.</p><figure><figcaption><span>ESC Taiwan</span></figcaption></figure><p>“NSD again reminds that acts or activities endangering national security are extremely serious offences. Police will ensure that the law is observed and strictly enforced, and will take resolute actions to bring offenders to account,” Hong Kong police wrote. “Members of the public should not download the application or provide funding by any means to the relevant developer. Those who have downloaded the application should uninstall it immediately and must not attempt to defy the law.”</p><p><em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em>, which released in April, has the player “pledge allegiance to Taiwan, Hong Kong, Mongolia, Tibet, Kazakhs, Uyghur, Manchuria or the Rebel Alliance of Cathaysian and Southeast Asia to overthrow the Communist regime,” <a href="https://www.reversedfront.tw/pages/en_pv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according the game’s website</a>. Or, players can choose to lead the Chinese Communist Party. This plays out in visual novel-esque storylines dispersed between simple, turn-based battle segments. Characters with different abilities and skills are unlocked with gacha mechanics.&nbsp;</p><p>An ESC Taiwan representative told Aftermath via email, “The content of <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em> includes various political propositions existing in East Asia today, not only self-determination and separatism but also the ideology of the Chinese Communist Party. We allow supporters of the Chinese Communist Party to defend their political views in the game, resulting in two different storylines.”</p><p>They continued, “The fact remains that while we dare to let the Chinese Communist Party express itself in the game, the Party doesn’t allow dissidents to speak out.”</p><figure></figure><p>A ESC Taiwan representative told Aftermath that they’re made up of&nbsp; Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and Chinese people who are based in Taiwan, and originally formed as a way of “connecting with anti-government individuals and groups from various parts of China, including organizations advocating for the independence of East Turkestan and Tibet.” To fund that mission, they started to make games. The game development team is “less than 10 people,” but the group overall is around 50, “most of whom are volunteers without salaries.”</p><p>The removal of the game in Hong Kong isn’t surprising to the ESC Taiwan team: “True autonomy no longer exists in Hong Kong,” they said.</p><p>Hong Kong’s removal of the game from app stores has been a boon for <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em>, the representative said. “The Hong Kong government's ban on <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em> indeed made millions of people, who previously didn’t know about the game, aware of its existence.” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5430295/hong-kong-police-video-game-sedition-china" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NPR reported that</a>, as of Wednesday, the game had fewer than 360 ratings on both the Apple and Android app stores combined. (On Thursday, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reversed-front-bonfire/id6475160606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the U.S. App Store</a>, <em>Reversed Front: Bonfire</em> was ranked 45th in the adventure game category, with 35 ratings. The game has <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=reversed+front+google+play+store&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1165US1165&amp;oq=reversed+front+google+play+store&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQ2MzNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">328 ratings on the Google Play store</a>.)&nbsp;</p><p>Maya Wang, Human Rights Watch’s associate China director, told NPR that it’s no surprise that Hong Kong would make a statement about the game. "Hong Kong authorities must constantly keep finding something and someone to target in order to signal to Beijing that it is diligent and that it is taking ‘national security’ very seriously," Wang said.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo"><h3>Dispatch Is A Superhero Logistics Game</h3></a><p>All the paperwork bits instead of the pew-pew bits</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But with the Switch 2's launch lineup being somewhat sparse, Sega (and Nintendo, which has timed exclusivity on this edition) are likely hoping players want to complement their Mario Karting, Cyberpunk 2077ing, and Street Fighting with a hard-hitting open-world adventure. But is it worth it? It really depends.</p><p dir="ltr">At $50, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is cheaper than many of the other Switch 2 launch games, and there's a lot to do here between the lengthy, dual-protagonist narrative and the surprisingly involving minigames. You can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and that's not even taking into account the new content.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Switch 2's Yakuza 0 Director's Cut Is An Upgraded Version Aimed At Old And New Fans</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major difference is the addition of new voice and subtitle tracks. Your choice of voice actors is down to personal preference, but for me, the Japanese ones are too iconic to switch away from. Chinese and English voice tracks have been recorded for the entire game. If you're a series veteran, you'll also notice that the demo cinematic features the Japanese rock song "Bubble" by Shounan no Kaze--a song featured in the original Yakuza 0's Japanese release but excised overseas. It's back, it's rockin', and it sets the stage for a grand old time in 1988 Bubble Era Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">At the title screen, there's a mode selectable right off the bat: Red Light Raid, which has you and up to four online or offline companions beating up waves of hooligans for fun and profit. I was intrigued by this mode, hoping it might serve as a callback to classic multiplayer arcade brawlers--some of which were made by Sega itself. What I actually got was somewhat underwhelming: You pick a character out of a massive roster (many of which require a good amount of in-game cash to unlock) and take them into battle with up to four player- or CPU-controlled companions. You'll pick a challenge, fight wave after wave of enemies, sometimes encountering a boss fight, before dealing with a final boss. Finishing a challenge run earns you lots of sweet, sweet yen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751" data-ratio="0.56246961594555" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut looks on par with the original game on PS4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can do all the fun head-cracking, chest-smashing moves here as you can in the base game (though both Kiryu and Majima require you to pick one fighting style and stick with it). It's a way to play as characters who are otherwise uncontrollable in the base game, which is nice. But overall it feels undercooked: Characters vary wildly in usefulness, and the sessions can devolve into messy chaos, especially in dark settings and on the Switch 2's handheld mode. It's obvious this game's combat, which frequently takes place in narrow streets, corridors, and cluttered rooms, wasn't built for multiplayer originally—and it frequently feels crowded and hard to get your bearings even on more open arenas. There’s a mix of character models and moves mostly mashed together from this game and others in the series, including a lot of barely-seen NPCs. Still, if you can get your friend group together in a GameChat channel as you play, you'll have some fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphically, I didn't notice any major changes or upgrades compared to the PS4 original--the textures look mostly identical and the character models seem to be a 1:1 port, though the Switch 2 version does include 4K support.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752" data-ratio="0.56149732620321" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut adds five brand-new cutscenes to the game's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger selling points has been the addition of five brand-new cutscenes--almost a half-hour's worth. I got the impression that these new scenes were meant to give some additional screen time to characters who fell by the wayside in the original, along with additional screentime for the Kiryu and Nishikiyama duo. They’re certainly a nice addition, though how much you’ll get from them depends on how invested in the cast you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade--but the biggest elephant in the room is that the original Yakuza 0 has <em>frequently</em> gone on very deep discount on Steam and elsewhere; during some sales, you could pick this saga up for well under $10. Even at a lower-than-average price of $50, this poses the question: Do the additional cutscenes, voice/subtitle languages, and other extra content in Director's Cut make up for that big price hike? For me, no--I like this series a lot, but I'm not hungry enough for new Yakuza to want to pay a huge premium for some extras that ultimately don't add all <em>that</em> much. But if you can't get enough of that crime drama, English isn't your first language, or you just have to have an English or Chinese voice track, then go ahead and grab it--it's a fantastic time.</p>

                <p>Though Microsoft never announced an official Xbox handheld device, there were rumors about how such a device <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">might factor into the company's next-gen console plans</a>. Those plans are continuing to evolve, it seems, as a new report said Microsoft's own Xbox handheld is "essentially canceled."</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, citing insiders, said such a device is no longer going forward. This follows on from a report at the end of May that suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-pauses-development-on-xbox-handheld/1100-6531934/" data-ref-id="1100-6531934">plans for an Xbox handheld were sidelined.</a></p><p>The Verge's report added that Microsoft remains bullish on the idea of making "next-gen Xbox hardware," but perhaps not in the way people think. "We'll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SOKm9dDOSC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer alluded to a closer collaboration between PC and console in a recent <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox podcast interview.</a> "This is the tightest collaboration I've seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company," he said. Spencer also mentioned how Windows PC is an open platform and that he believes, if managed properly, a PC can be considered "as a game console."</p><p>While Microsoft may not develop its own dedicated gaming handheld device, the company is working with third-party devices like the recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Rog Ally handhelds from Asus.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on the company's plans for handheld devices going forward.</p><p>In February 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p>The new Xbox Rog Ally devices launch this holiday, but there is no word on pricing as of yet. The systems can play all types of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-pc-games-run-on-the-new-xbox-handheld/1100-6532289/" data-ref-id="1100-6532289">including PlayStation PC titles.</a></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is striding purposefully into the verdant splendour of summer with a new nature-loving expansion, which also happens to mark the return of fairies as a playable Sim-type.
</p>
<p>
In fact, for all its talk of the natural world, EA's Enchanted by Nature expansion reveal suggests fairies - last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>'s 2012 Supernatural expansion - are very much the focus this time around. Mother Nature, it seems, is recruiting Sims to swell her fairy ranks, and players that opt to heed her call will find their Sims graced with abilities enabling them to nurture plants, manipulate objects, change the moods of others, and more.
</p>
<p>
A wide range of wings, skin tones, ears, teeth, head accessories, glowing tattoos, and more are promised so players can create the fairy that suits their whims, and once that's taken care of, they've the option of following two distinct fairy paths. Harmonious Fairies are all about helping others find health and balance, while Discordant Fairy are the chaos gremlins of the fairy world, flitting around and making life just a little more more difficult for other Sims with their mischief.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>The Sims 4 Enchanted by Nature reveal trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D-WpFCmvRA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Regardless of the path they choose, players will need to be mindful of their fairy Sim's specific needs: rather than food, fairies are sustained on the emotions of others, so you'll be hoovering up all sorts of feelings to avoid Emotional Starvation. On the upside, you get a special fairy WooHoo to impress the neighbours with, so there's that.
</p>
<p>
And speaking of neighbours, The Sims 4's Enchanted by Nature expansion features a new world in the form of Innisgreen, split into three distinct districts. The Coast of Adhmor is a peaceful seaside village, while Sprucederry Grove promises a "vibrant blend of friendly shops, cosy homes, and draping ivy that blur the line between civilisation and the natural world". Fairy focused players, meanwhile, will be wanting to make a beeline for the enchanted woodland sprawl of Everdew. One word of warning: luck is its own force in Innisgreen, and Sims choosing to live here will experience good, bad, and ordinary luck, impacting their career, love life, and more - so luck-modifying charms may come in handy.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, there's talk of new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic in the form of balance. Sim that fail to stay emotionally grounded will gradually grown imbalanced, which can make life a little trickier. They might, for instance, learn skills more slowly, and if their balance continues to deteriorate, they'll enter 'very imbalanced' territory, at which point they'll start developing Ailments like Emotional Void, Simoleon Fever, Sonic Sinuses, and Greenie Meanie - which makes them a better gardener, but really, really angry at the same time.
</p>
<p>
Sims struck with Ailments can get respite by crafting cures and elixirs using the new Apothecary Table. By foraging and gardening for new ingredients, players can follow treatment recipes producing "fantastical effects", and all this ties into the new Elixir Enthusiast Aspiration, and the Naturopath profession, enabling Sims to monetise their newfound Apothecary skills.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything EA has revealed so far. The Sims 4's Enchanted by Nature expansion launches for all platforms on 10th July, and costs £34.99/$39.99 USD. Players who purchase the expansion before 21st August get a couple of additional items, including the Lofty Leaf Pond, the glowing Mycena Lantern, and the Disguised Dwelling Fairy Home.

But, like, <em>how much</em> bigger?</p><p>Okay, sure, we can check <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch%2Ftech-specs" rel="sponsored">the</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Ftech-specs" rel="sponsored">specs</a> and see that the Switch 2 is half an inch (12.7mm) taller and 1.2 inches (30.48mm) wider than the original — and it’s 0.22 pounds (99.79 grams) heavier. But don’t just bark numbers at me! Nah, man, get that nerd math out of here. </p><p>What about vibes-wise? How much bigger does it <em>feel</em>?</p><p>We already know the Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2#:~:text=Only%20one%20color%20option%3F">a whole lot less colorful</a> and fun-looking than the original, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682075/verge-staffers-react-nintendo-switch-2#:~:text=Krales%20/%20The%20Verge-,Ergonomics,-The%20original%20Switch">definitely not any more comfortable to use</a>, either. So how does it compare to the more lively-looking Switches that came before it? And how about other boring black boxes that have brought us years of joyous games? Well, to show you, I got my Switch 2 out along with its direct progenitors and some of its other ilk from the world of video games, and I took a bunch of pictures.</p><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-switch-oled-vs-original-switch"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Switch OLED vs. original Switch</strong></h2></p></div><p>First up, the most obvious comparison: the Switch 2, its Joy-Con 2 controllers, and its new dock versus its last-gen counterparts. Any Switch may seem compact compared to various PC handhelds flooding the market these days, especially a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339992/acer-nitro-blaze-11-gaming-handheld-steam-deck-size-comparison">surfboard-like one</a> that still hasn’t come out yet, but seeing the Switch 2 next to an original launch-day Switch from 2017 makes me wonder how we ever got on with that dainty original. The OLED edition may not have been any more powerful, but its slightly larger screen did make a huge difference. And now, the Switch 2 is even bigger than that. Despite not being all that comfortable in handheld mode, this feels like the <em>right</em> size for a Switch.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->20</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Switch 2 flanked by the original launch Switch (right) and Switch OLED (left).</em></figcaption></span></p></section><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-other-handhelds"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. other handhelds</strong></h2></p></div><p>The Switch 2’s new stature may be a marked improvement, but Valve’s Steam Deck was bigger and comfier right out of the gate. It’s definitely not as travel-friendly as a Switch, but ultra-portability is for the Analogue Pockets and Anbernics of the world — which you can also get a small glimpse of here in these photos.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7</strong><span><figcaption><em>Switch 2 vs. Steam Deck (LCD).</em></figcaption></span></p></section><div><p id="nintendo-switch-2-vs-full-size-consoles-new-and-old"><h2><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 vs. full-size consoles (new and old)</strong></h2></p></div><p>Long before the Switch 2, there was another console to bear the “2” sequel moniker — a console with a design that still sits comfortably in the S-tier of my own personal list of video game industrial design. So how does the Switch 2 compare to the PlayStation 2?</p><p>You’re also wondering <em>why</em> compare the Switch 2 to the PS2? Well, why not? </p><p>But, for good measure, I’ve also put the new Nintendo console up against the PS3, PS4, PS5, Xbox 360, Xbox Series X, and GameCube.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->15</strong><span><figcaption><em>Switch 2 vs. PlayStation 2 (vertical).

The loss of talented people – like lead writer Trick Weekes, who has been a staple in modern BioWare since the beginning of <em>Mass Effect</em>, or Mary Kirby, who wrote characters like Varric, whose story is the biggest throughline through the <em>Dragon Age </em>series – doesn’t inspire confidence that EA understands the lifeblood of the studio it acquired in 2007. <em>The Veilguard </em>has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">a divisive game</a></span> for both entirely legitimate reasons and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gay-trans-non-binary-romance-1851690152&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gay-trans-non-binary-romance-1851690152">the most bad-faith ones</a></span> you could imagine, but my hope is that history will be kinder to it as time goes on. </p><p>A <em>Kotaku </em>reader reached out to me after the news of BioWare’s layoffs broke to ask if they should still play <em>The Veilguard </em>after everything that happened.

As a long-time player, I’m glad <em>The Veilguard </em>solidifies the connective tissue between what sometimes felt like a world of isolated cultures, lacking throughlines that’d otherwise make it feel more whole.

Perhaps BioWare learned a hard lesson by leaving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-the-kotaku-review-1659833205"><em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em></a></span> on a cliffhanger and didn’t want to repeat the same restriction. But <em>The Veilguard </em>doesn’t just wrap up its own story; it concludes several major threads dating back to <em>Origins</em>, which feels calculated and deliberate. If BioWare’s goal with <em>The Veilguard </em>was to bring almost everything to a definitive end, the thematic note on which it leaves this world acts as a closing graf concluding the series’ overarching thesis.</p><p>Ignoring the bigotry that has followed <em>The Veilguard </em>like a starving rat digging through trash, one of the most common criticisms I heard directed toward the game was that it lacked a certain thorny disposition that was prevalent in the first three games. Everyone in the titular party generally seems to like each other, there aren’t real ethical and philosophical conflicts between the group, and the spats that do arise are more akin to the arguments you probably get into with your best friends. It’s a new dynamic for the series. The Veilguard doesn’t feel like coworkers as the Inquisition did, nor the disparate group who barely tolerated each other that we followed in <em>Dragon Age II</em>. They’re friends who, despite coming from different backgrounds, factions, and places, are pretty much on the same page about what the world should be. They’re united by a common goal, sure, but at the core of each of their lived experiences is a desire for the world to be better. </p><figure id="" data-id="9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-recommend-id="image://9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-recommend-id="image://9b92f5d41be4bf64692c264c062b5702" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Morrigan talk outside the Lighthouse." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This rose-colored view of leftism doesn’t work for everyone. At its worst, <em>The Veilguard </em>can be so saccharine it’d cause a cavity, which is far from what people have come to expect from a series in which the mage-hating elf Fenris and pro-mage radical Anders didn’t care if the other lived or died. It also bleeds into a perceived softening of the universe. Factions like the Antivan Crows have essentially become the Bat Family from DC Comics, with no mention of the whole child slavery thing that was our first introduction to them back in <em>Origins</em>. The Lords of Fortune, a new pirate faction, go to great lengths to make sure you know that they’re not like the other pirates who steal from other cultures, among other things. I joked to a friend once that <em>The Veilguard </em>is a game terrified of getting canceled, and as such, a lot of the grit and grime has been washed off for something shiny and polished. </p><p>That is the more critical lens through which to view the way <em>The Veilguard</em>’s sanitation of Thedas. To an extent, I agree. We learned so much about how the enigmatic country of the Tevinter Imperium was a place built upon slavery and blood sacrifice, only for us to conveniently hang out in the common poverty-stricken areas that are affected by the corrupt politics we only hear about in sidequests and codex entries. But decisions like setting <em>The Veilguard</em>’s Tevinter stories in the slums of Dogtown give the game and its writers a place to make a more definitive statement, rather than existing in the often frustrating centrism <em>Dragon Age</em> loved to tout for three games.</p><p>I have a lot of pain points I can shout out in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but I don’t think anything has stuck in my craw more than the way the end of Anders’ antagonistic “Rivalry” relationship goes down in <em>Dragon Age II </em>if you don’t support his crusade to emancipate the mages from their captivity in the Circle of Magi. This is a tortured radical mage who is willing to give his life to fight for the freedom of those who have been born into a corrupt system led by the policing Templars. And yet, if you’ve followed his rivalry path, Anders will turn against the mages he, not five minutes ago, did some light terrorism trying to free. In <em>Inquisition</em>, this conflict of ideals and traditions comes to a head, but you’re able to essentially sweep it all under the rug as you absorb one faction or the other into your forces. So often, <em>Dragon Age </em>treats its conflicts and worldviews as toys for the player to slam against one another, shaping the world as they see fit, and bending even the most fiercely devoted radical to their whims. And yes, there are some notable exceptions to this rule, but when it came to world-shifting moments of change, <em>Dragon Age</em> always seemed scared to assert that the player might be wrong. Mages and Templars, oppressed and oppressors, were the same in the eyes of the game, each worthy of the same level of scrutiny.</p><figure id="" data-id="e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-recommend-id="image://e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-recommend-id="image://e314b3b75c433b93d25bb1f7f304b910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neve and Rook eat fish together." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before <em>The Veilguard</em>, I often felt <em>Dragon Age </em>didn’t actually believe in anything. Its characters did, but as a text, <em>Dragon Age </em>often felt so preoccupied with empowering the player’s decisions that it felt like Thedas would never actually get better, no matter how much you fought for it. While it may lack the same prickly dynamics and the grey morality that became synonymous with the series, <em>The Veilguard</em> doesn’t just believe that the world is full of greys and let you pick which shade you’re more comfortable with. Of the entire series, it’s the most whole-hearted, full-throated declaration that the world of Thedas can be better than it was before.</p><p>Essentially retconning the Antivan Crows to a family of superheroes is taking a hammer to the problem, whereas characters like Neve Gallus, a mage private eye with a duty-bound love for her city and its people, are the scalpel with which BioWare carves its vision of how the world of Thedas can change. Taash explores their identity through the lens of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s longstanding Qunari culture, known for its rigidness in the face of an ever-changing world, and comes out the other end a new person, defined entirely by their own views and defying others. Harding discovers the truth behind how the dwarves were severed from magic, and still remembers that she believes in the good in people. The heroes of <em>The Veilguard </em>have seen the corruption win out, and yet never stop believing that something greater is possible. It’s not even an option in <em>The Veilguard</em>’s eyes. The downtrodden <em>will</em> be protected, the oppressed <em>will</em> live proudly, and those who have been wronged <em>will</em> find new life.</p><p>That belief is what makes <em>The Veilguard </em>a frustrating RPG, to some. It’s so unyielding in its belief that Thedas and everyone who inhabits it can be better that it doesn’t entertain your choices complicating the narrative. Depending on how you play, Rook can come from plenty of different backgrounds, make decisions that will affect thousands of people, but they can never really be an evil bastard. If they did, it would fundamentally undermine one of the game’s most pivotal moments. In the eleventh hour, <em>Dragon Age </em>mainstay Varric Tethras is revealed to have died in the opening hour, and essentially leaves all his hopes and dreams on the shoulders of Rook. After our hero is banished to the Fade and forced to confront their regrets in a mission gone south, Varric’s spirit sends Rook on their way to save the day one last time. He does so with a hearty chuckle, saying he doesn’t need to wish you good luck because “you already have everything you need.” He is, of course, referring to the friends you have calling to you from beyond the Fade. </p><figure id="" data-id="2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-recommend-id="image://2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-recommend-id="image://2b1e01cdd4e73e06282d8db3597b5274" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook and Varric walk up stairs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Varric, the narrator of <em>Dragon Age,</em> uses his final word to declare a belief that things will be okay. This isn’t because Rook is the chosen one, destined to save the world, but because they have found people who are unified by one thing: a need to fight for a better world. That declaration concluding what’s possibly <em>Dragon Age</em>’s final<em> </em>game is what makes it compelling. Reaching the end of a universe’s arc and being wholly uninterested in leaving it desecrated by hubris or prejudice is a bold claim on BioWare’s part. It takes some authorship away from the player, but in return, it leaves the world of Thedas in a better place than we found it.</p><p><em>The Veilguard </em>is an idealistic game, but it’s one that BioWare has earned the right to make. <em>Dragon Age</em>’s legacy has been one of constantly shifting identity, at least two counts of development hell, and a desire to give players a sandbox to roleplay in. Perhaps, as <em>Dragon Age </em>likely comes to a close, it’s better to leave the series with a game as optimistic as the people who made it. I can’t think of a more appropriate finale than one that represents the world its creators hope to see, even as the world we live in now gives us every reason to fall into despair.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954?_gl=1*1qxy3gl*_ga*MTMxODc3NjkwMi4xNzI1Njc2NzM3*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDk3NDk3MDkkbzI2OSRnMSR0MTc0OTc0OTc1NiRqMTMkbDAkaDA.">my review of <em>The Veilguard</em></a></span>,<em> </em>I signed off expressing hope for BioWare’s future that feels a bit naive in retrospect. Would a divisive but undeniably polished RPG that felt true to the studio’s history be enough when, after 10 years of development, c-suite suits were probably looking for a decisive cultural moment? That optimism was just about a video game. Having lived through the past 32 years, looking back, most of the optimism I’ve ever held feels naive. I think I’m losing hope that the world will get any better. But even if we haven’t reached <em>The Veilguard</em>’s idealized vision, I’ll take some comfort in knowing someone previously at BioWare still believes it’s possible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

and Xbox Series X|S. This means that the next mainline entry is making a proper leap over to current-gen systems, leaving last-gen consoles behind.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_story">Resident Evil: Requiem story</h2><p>Requiem stars a new character in the form of FBI technical analyst Grace Ashcroft--the daughter of Resident Evil Outbreak's Alyssa Ashcroft--who is tasked with exploring a series of recent murders that were committed at the Wrenwood Hotel. Ashcroft has a personal connection to this location as this is the site where her mother was murdered, and Capcom says that players can expect "a new era of survival-horror," amplified by technological advancements in the RE Engine that powers the game.</p><p>The interesting thing about Resident Evil Outbreak was that the playable characters had been infected with one of Umbrella Corporation's viruses, making the experience that much more challenging in this 2003 multiplayer co-op game. Alyssa appears to have survived the events of the game--some of her journalistic work was referenced in later Resident Evil games--and it'll be interesting to see if Requiem links back to Outbreak.</p><p>For the first time in a <em>long </em>time, Resident Evil is also returning to Raccoon City. The iconic city was leveled with an experimental thermobaric missile strike toward the end of Resident Evil 2, and since then, it has been a desolate crater that has remained unexplored in other Resident Evil sequels. The reveal trailer for the game teased a few familiar locations, like the police department that is barely standing amidst the charred ruins of the devastated city.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_gameplay">Resident Evil: Requiem gameplay</h2><p>Your average Resident Evil protagonist knows how to handle a firearm, but in comparison, Grace isn't as skilled. While she's still capable of defending herself, Capcom's description for the game suggests that fleeing from danger is the best path forward. The game combines "deeply terrifying aspects of psychological horror with pulse-pounding action that franchise fans know and love," Capcom says.</p><p>One other interesting tidbit is that you can choose to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-will-terrify-from-multiple-camera-angles/1100-6532355/">play Requiem from multiple angles</a>. The game will feature both first-person and third-person camera angles, allowing you to experience the story from either a traditional Resident Evil perspective or a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">first-person viewpoint that has defined modern entries in the series</a>.</p><h2 id="Resident_Evil__Requiem_screens">Resident Evil: Requiem screens</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512634-re9_sgfss1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512634" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512634-re9_sgfss1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512634"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512634-re9_sgfss1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512635-re9_sgfss2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512636-re9_sgfss3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512637-re9_sgfss4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512638-re9_sgfss5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512639-re9_sgfss6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512640-re9_sgfss7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512641-re9_sgfss8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512635,1300-4512636,1300-4512637,1300-4512638,1300-4512639,1300-4512640,1300-4512641" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512635-re9_sgfss2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512636-re9_sgfss3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512637-re9_sgfss4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512638-re9_sgfss5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512639-re9_sgfss6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512640-re9_sgfss7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4512641-re9_sgfss8.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512635-re9_sgfss2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512636-re9_sgfss3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512637-re9_sgfss4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512638-re9_sgfss5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512639-re9_sgfss6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512640-re9_sgfss7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4512641-re9_sgfss8.jpg"></figure>

Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, for example.</p><p>Along with current first-party PlayStation and Xbox controllers, the adapter supports legacy Nintendo and PlayStation controllers, including the Wii Remote, Wii U Pro Controller, DualShock 4, and DualShock 3. If the controller supports vibration and/or motion controls, it typically supports those features when synced to the adapter. It's also compatible with all 8BitDo Bluetooth controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Arcade-Stick-Switch-Windows-nintendo/dp/B08GJC5WSS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch/PC Arcade Stick</a>, which has yet to receive an official Switch 2 update.</p><p>You can use your PS5's controller settings or the Xbox/PC accessories app to remap inputs, but 8BitDo's Ultimate Software offers support for Microsoft's first-party controllers, DualSense, DualShock 4, and Switch Pro Controllers.

The latest update adds Nintendo Switch 2 support. After completing the update, which only takes a few seconds, you can connect it to one of the free USB-A ports on the Switch 2 dock.</p><p>Before you can sync a controller to the adapter, you need to enable support for 2.4GHz Wireless and wired controllers. In System Settings on your console, find Controllers &amp; Accessories, and make sure the box for Pro Controller Wired Communication is checked.</p><p>To establish a wireless connection, press the pairing button on the top of the adapter and enter pairing mode on your controller.</p><p>The 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 is a handy little device for platforms beyond Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-7-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Focus Entertainment proudly <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1933192827170627788" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has surpassed the enviable milestone of seven million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Saber Interactive's third-person shooter game launched on September 9, 2024, and immediately became a hit. The following day, Focus Home <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that two million copies had already been sold. Those <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-5-million-units-will-get-dlss-fsr-frame-generation-with-next-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became</a> five million units near the end of November.</p>
<p>A sequel was already inevitable at that point, though we weren't expecting an announcement anytime soon. Instead, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 3 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-in-development-will-offer-even-more-spectacular-large-scale-battles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to be in development as early as this March, promising even larger battles.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean support for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 is ending anytime soon. In fact, at the recent 2025 Skulls event, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-games-roundup-from-2025-skulls-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-updates-for-darktide-and-space-marine-2-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Siege Mode is being added to the game in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's a detailed overview of Siege Mode provided by Saber Interactive:</p>
<p><em>The battle unfolds within a fortified Imperial stronghold on Kadaku, relentlessly attacked by endless waves of Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies. The fortress has three rotating sectors: Defensive Positions, the Arsenal, and the Control Room. In each sector, you will face five waves of enemies before your squad advances to the next sector, ultimately cycling back to reinforce earlier positions.</em></p>
<p><em>Face increasingly challenging enemy waves, with direct assaults from Tyranids and cunning sabotage by Chaos forces. Brief (1 minute) intermissions between waves offer strategic opportunities, clearly indicated through UI notifications. Dynamic tasks such as capturing strategic points or retrieving Data-slates from fallen allies deepen tactical gameplay and supply critical resources essential for continued survival.</em></p>
<p><em>Earn Siege Mode resources through successful combat and Side Objective completion. You can spend these resources at the fortress Shop. You can:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Buy ammunition, medicae stimms, equipment, armour boosts, guardian relic (these items have the same exact behaviour as in Operations Mode).</li>
<li><em>Summon specialized Space Marines providing targeted support and bonuses. Each player can have only one summoned Space Marine.</em></li>
<li><em>Deploy Cadian Troopers to provide additional firepower.</em></li>
<li><em>Collectively pool your resources to unleash the devastating power of a Dreadnought.</em></li>
</ul>

There are two reasons you shouldn't watch the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep's</a> just announced DLC Siren's Rest. The first is that, well, it'll probably spoil at least some of the events of the base game given that the expansion is set more than a decade on. The other is for the subset of you that have just the worst case of submechanophobia, because the trailer is absolutely full of man-made objects under water. You've been warned, don't come crying to me if you don't heed me, I'll just say I told you so.

So! Where the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game takes place on an oil rig in 1975, Siren's Rest stays in the same location but moves forward an entire 11 years. With a new cast, you'll be sent to the North Sea to see what's become of the Beira D, using tools like a cutting torch, crowbar, and camera to try and figure out what happened to the crew that manned it. "But beware," a press release teases, "there are things lurking in the depths that even the sea cannot claim." Scary!

Previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> narrative designer Sagar Beroshi has penned Siren's Rest, with Lois Chimimba (Doctor Who) coming aboard as its protagonist Mhairi. She's joined by Lorn Macdonald (Bridgerton) and David Menkin (Final Fantasy 16, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>) in as of yet unnamed roles.

It's also out really soon! In less than a week in fact, as it's due to be released June 18th, next Wednesday. Doesn't sound too bad for something that essentially sounds like a mini sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-first-hands-on-preview-twin-stick-hades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Had I not known in advance that I was going to be playing Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree at Play Days last weekend, I might have overlooked its trailer during Summer Game Fest. The announcement itself was less than two minutes long, and what we saw mostly looked like Hades, but with character selection. However, after playing 15 minutes of the game at Play Days, I'm far more interested than I initially expected to be in Towa's take on the roguelite genre...though I'm going to need waaay more than 15 minutes to get good at it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree stars Towa, the guardian of Shinju Village and a child of the gods. When a dark god begins consuming the land around Shinju with an evil miasma, Towa rallies eight villagers to fight back. These "Prayer Children" head out into the field, two at a time, to fight against the minions of darkness, with one taking on the role of "Tsurugi", or sword, and the other taking on the supportive staff role, or "Kagura."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the start of each run, you pick which of the eight characters you want in each role, with all characters having different abilities depending on which role they took on. In my preview, I selected the solumn Rekka as my sword, who attacks with short, quick slashes and a lingering spin attack. My staff was Nishiki, a Koi-inspired fish person who can summon lightning orbs to surround the player and shoot a wave of water in any direction.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At the start of each run, you pick which of the eight characters you want in each role.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Immediately, I struggled a bit to adapt to the twin-stick controls. Nishiki automatically followed Rekka, who I controlled with the left stick, but it was clear that for optimal play I needed to break Nishiki free of Rekka and run him around with the right stick simultaneously as I fought enemies. Easier said than done. I think this is a really interesting twist on what I'm used to for top-down games, almost reminiscent of the original The World Ends With You having you control two characters on two different screens. But I do think I needed more than 15 minutes in a demo to get used to it. Apparently, you can also play Towa in co-op, with one person controlling each character, and that's an appealing prospect, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A second unique element that I really, really wanted more time to master was Quick Draw. In Towa, your sword wielder carries not one, but two swords, but only has one equipped at a time. Each sword has a different ability, with Rekka having her short slashes attached to one and her chargeable spin attack on the other. As you use one sword, it begins to dull until it's unusable, and you have to use a Quick Draw ability to swap to the other one so the first can recharge. Successful combat in Towa revolves around smoothly swapping between the two swords so you're never caught in a situation where you need one attack ready, but have a dull blade and are stuck with an inefficient ability. It's a cool system in principle, certainly a unique one, and I'm curious as to how it will play out at higher skill levels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Everything else I saw in Towa will be familiar to your average Hades-lover.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Everything else I saw in Towa will be familiar to your average Hades-lover. You'll clear all the monsters in a room, and get a choice of a "Grace". Graces enhance your power in all sorts of ways, from straight power increases to changing how different abilities work and interact with one another. Doors to the next room may denote enemies or shopkeepers or other room types, and you'll smash stuff as you go to collect currency for upgrades at shops and special ore that can be enhance your characters' abilities when you take it back to the village.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My time with Towa was cut short just as I walked into a boss battle, so unfortunately I can't speak to how that would have played out. But this preview absolutely succeeded in making me want to play <em>more</em>. I want to muck around with the different character configurations and see what other upgrades are available, and I want to practice my twin-stick game so my staff user doesn't die on me before I even hit the halfway point (oops). I don't know if Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree can live up to the lofty legacy of Hades necessarily, but I do think it has the potential to carve out a space in the roguelite genre all its own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/renown-has-medieval-survival-promise-but-has-a-lot-of-work-left-to-do.1216944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/renown-has-medieval-survival-promise-but-has-a-lot-of-work-left-to-do<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">No one will claim that Renown, the Medieval European-flavored base-building survival game, is bringing brand new ideas to the genre. If you’ve played anything like it, from its primary inspiration, Rust, to more modern iterations like Runescape: Dragonwilds, you have a good idea of what you’re in for when you drop into a server to start your journey from humble homesteader to lord of the realm. My brief hands-on time with it was fun, but also raises and doesn’t clearly answer an important question: if you currently have a favorite survival game, is it worth making the switch right now?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My crash course started with a tour of some aspirational structures that were all built with in-game resources. Some of them, like a huge castle complete with a small village lingering in its shadow, were things the team taking me on the tour, lead by Game Director Jesse Jacobsen,  didn’t expect to see players to ever be able to make without concerted team efforts. But the ones that were within reasonable player reach were cool in their own rights. Tall sturdy stone walls with mighty working gates to keep enemies out and winding halls and spiraling stairs is a step above what is often just square rooms with storage stuffed in them. The couple I walked through myself came with a significant investment of time and in-game gold, and was positioned as the form your typical endgame stronghold would want to look like before the regular server resets.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Renown Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's only right that we spent the first bit of our session tearing one of them up in a raid, right? After taking a quick spin on a catapult, a few of the devs entrenched themselves inside a nearby fort, while my group attempted to conquer it. We left the siege machine behind and opted for something more mobile: hammers and door-breaching petards to turn them into splinters. When inside, we ran through the halls and stairways looking for fights, eventually culminating into a sprawling skirmish up on the battlements. After putting down the foes, we took the castle’s banner, and claimed it for ourselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Renown is heavily skewed towards players who would rather raise a sword to fight versus a hammer to build.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">These fun scenarios make up the bulk of Renown, which is heavily skewed towards players who would rather raise a sword to fight versus a hammer to build. This is reinforced by its mechanically nuanced melee system that takes cues from games like Chivalry, Mordhau, or Kingdom Come: Deliverance. Swinging your weapon at various angles creates different offensive maneuvers which can be useful for getting around shields, the safest and most reliable defense you’ll encounter. For the bolder player, a parry exists that, when timed right, can be followed up with a fast attack that helps poke holes in stubborn defenders. In one-on-one duels, all of this nuance shines and creates a tense back and forth that you won’t find in simpler melee systems. It’s not quite realism, but the lethality of every strike mixed with the motion captured HEMA animations really elevates swordplay in the moment. In multiplayer brawls, I relied very little on these tools, opting to just gang up on whoever my squad was bullying to overwhelm them with blows they couldn’t possibly deflect. Maybe it's pretty realistic after all. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting the combat right was the driving force behind Jesse and Executive Producer Charlie Ettershank’s need to make Renown a reality. “Ever since me and Charlie met, we would spend most nights after school discussing how cool it would be for Chivalry combat to be in a survival game.” Jesse told me. They played games like Realm of Kings and Rust and would love everything about it except the melee combat, and took it upon themselves to create the thing they wanted to see in the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You of course can’t become a badass knight decked out head-to-toe in plate armor without first knocking trees over with a stick in order to build the workbench that will produce all you need for your empire. The gathering process in survival games like this is never one that I would confidently call “engaging,” but Renown’s is especially boring in comparison to its peers. Some parts of the process are streamlined – you still need to build individual fixtures to craft specific things like a tailor’s bench to make leather armor and a stone furnace to smelt metals – but all the crafting can be done in your inventory menu so you don’t have to stop at every little building to make and receive stuff. But gathering materials felt like more of a chore than ever. Things are pretty expensive, so you'll need a good amount of wood and stone to get the basics. At least they’re easy to find. I spent 10 minutes walking around in search of animals to hunt for hide and fat, essential for moving through the tech tree, and couldn’t find any. I imagine all of this plays differently with a server full of other players who can potentially harass you during your gathering and construction campaigns, but in this leisurely environment, I found it tough to stay motivated to grind. The “survival” part of Renown is also exclusively a PVP thing, as there isn’t much to manage as far as keeping yourself alive if there are no enemy arrows to dodge. Without genre staples like hunger meters or day/night cycles I was free to exist completely at my pace. These mechanics are often nags but without them there’s uncomfortably little push back when playing alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are quite a few steps between crafting your first workstation and creating a sword, steps that can be bypassed if you're willing to venture out into the wilderness to find loot. I did not get to experience this part of Renown in any meaningful way, but I was told that prebuilt points of interest, like the aforementioned grand castle, double as hot spots full of gear and trinkets that could be an instant upgrade to a players kit or at least worth lots of in game gold. I can only speculate that in a PVP environment, this kind of skulking around presents the same dangers as other popular survival games, but I couldn’t speak on how this flows with Renown’s heavy focus on intimate close quarters combat. There were a lot of features that sound great but either I didn’t experience them directly, or they weren’t available yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This biggest feature coming that I think will be a pivotal one for Renown’s success long-term are server events. As it stands pre-early access, the 8000 or so playtesters in the alpha right now are tasked to find their own fun, with the construction and combat systems both being toys in an open sandbox of possibilities without any explicit direction from the game itself. Right now, a solid contingent of players collaborate to build strongholds and siege weapons and march on enemy camps without much prompting, but even the RDBK team admits that some guided play would bring some necessary balance. One event they’ve been prototyping would turn an NPC settlement into a claimable fortress when signaled, driving all of the disparate bands of warriors on the server to join one another in chaotic combat over it. Other ideas are based in similar form as this, with caches of loot spawning in specific locations on the map to be claimed by whoever can secure it first. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There were a lot of features that sound great but either I didn’t experience them directly, or they weren’t available yet.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But Jesse really emphasized how important, and frankly proud, he is of being a facilitator of the sandbox for individual communities to flourish in. His team has even reached out and recruited almost all of the official Rust server hosts to run Renown servers. “That’s mostly because we’ve provided them the tools… to make that an easy process.” Jesse assured, as well as providing financial compensation for the effort. The goal being that they can use their particular expertise to help modify and regulate game tools and create server climates that can cater to all sorts of players. Maybe I'm not the only one who thinks the grind speed is slow, as there could be a server that picks up the pace or starts players off with kits of goods to get off of the blocks faster. Servers wipe weekly to keep player progress from being insurmountable, but a server can exist where those wipes happen less often, if at all. The Renown team want as close to infinite player adaptability as possible, and they want to be as involved as a server host needs them to be to make it happen. “We think we have a good idea of what makes the most enjoyable gameplay aspect, but we're not going to kid ourselves and think that no one else could think of something better inside of this sandbox, ya know?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot of the ruggedness of Renown’s alpha state is manageable, and is probably even great when you have a dedicated community to play it with. But there are a few pain points that are going to make it a tough sell for people not already bought in for the long haul. I had quite a bit of performance issues when playing – both with the devs and on my own. Framerates jolted and lag really did its best to undermine me when I needed the stability most. The current UI and menus are rough around the edges and inconsistent throughout, some tooltips are arrayed across selection wheels while others sit in lists that are difficult to navigate while in the thick of the action. All of these things are on the list to reform and fix as the development team expands, hopefully before its slated Q3 2025 Early Access launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Renown’s crunchy combat has a lot of potential in a genre not known for making close combat an elaborate affair. The basic and sometimes mundane gathering and building game that you have to trudge through to get to cool stuff is very raw and still has a ways to go to meet the quality standard of the games it hopes to compete with. While its dearth of content, stability issues, and ragged UI are strictly RDBK Studios’ responsibility, the community is poised to have a lot of control over the day-to-day experience. Time will tell if the former can come together quickly enough to nurture the latter.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/looks-like-classic-puzzler-boulder-dash-is-getting-a-40th-anniversary-re-release">We reported back last year</a> on the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/boulder_dash_40th_anniversary">Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary</a>, and now we know that the game will launch on <strong>July 24th</strong> for Switch, and it'll only set you back £19.99/$19.99. Heck, this time you can even have a gander at how it all looks in motion in the above gameplay vid. Result!</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/boulder_dash">Boulder Dash</a>, which was first released all the way back in 1984 (when this writer was already busting heads in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/bruce_lee_return_of_the_legend">Bruce Lee</a> game on his trusty C64), has seen a few re-releases before, including on its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/boulder_dash_30th_anniversary">30th anniversary</a>, but this time it seems there are a few more changes to the classic formula, including a level editor for sharing your own creations online.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>According to the game's official press release, this new effort features "Brand New Levels, New Design, New Challenges, New Worlds, Plus More!" That does sound exciting, to be fair.</p>
<p>With 180 levels to blast through in total, and with Rockford returning to his role as chief...eh...smasher of rocks (alongside what appears to be a few other selectable characters) this certainly looks the business, and although the art style is almost alarmingly crisp, it <em>does</em> harken back to the OG, and it looks as th</p>

<p>It seems as though the devs have been more than diligent too, with Boulder Dash world champions invited to play the game and Boulder Dashes 1, 2 and 3 all in the mix within this one revamp, as BBG explains;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We pursued two goals: Firstly, we wanted to bring the first three parts Boulder Dash I, II and III to life as faithfully as possible on current machines. Secondly, we wanted to spice up the classic gameplay with contemporary visuals and suitable new ideas such as growing walls, slime, an enemy generator, eggs and other things.<br>
<em>On top we have integrated a level editor which allows the users to create, play and share all these levels to Boulder Dash players worldwide</em>..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the OG Boulder Dash games, as is the case here, your task is to open the exit on each screen, which sounds simple but is in fact an engrossing mix of puzzling, dodging and timing your moves to deal with foes. It was a revelation back in the day and, with the right treatment, the gameplay here should stand the test of time well.</p>

<p>Otherwise, leave you with a "fact's attack" from the press release and some screens to satiate long-time Boulder Dash fans in the meantime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 6 new, never-before-seen worlds<br>
- 3 new worlds created by hardcore the fans<br>
- 180 completely new, balanced, and refined levels<br>
- Variety of new and unique items, including growing walls, slime, enemy generator, eggs, plus more<br>
- Construction kit to create, share, or download other players’ levels<br>
- Distinctive visual style that aims to blend original color schemes with contemporary themes<br>
- Option to select and play for one of the three main heroes, each crafted in line with the game’s original vision<br>
- Music and sounds composed by Germany’s most famous video game musician Chris Huelsbeck (Giana Sisters, Turrican, Star Wars Rogue Squadron, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate and many more).</p>

			<p>The launch for Build A Rocket Boy's debut game, MindsEye, hasn't exactly gone the way the studio would have hoped. The simple fact that PlayStation, a company that very rarely gives players refunds for purchases on the PS Store, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">is giving players refunds for their purchases of MindsEye</a>&nbsp;says a lot about how things are going on its own.</p>
<p>Shortly after players started to publicly announce they had gotten refunds from PlayStation, and as more videos of bugs and long statements from players appear on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/">Reddit,</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy released a <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933167455238594939">statement to the game's official X account</a>, saying that the team is "<em>heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also pinned the issues the game is having on a memory leak, claiming that "<em>roughly 1 in 10 of our players</em>" were impacted by this issue, and that a hotfix has been made to fix the problem. That fix, along with a few more that Build A Rocket Boy detailed in its statement, will be pushed to players starting tomorrow, with more fixes to come throughout the weekend, continuing on through next week, and basically through the rest of the month.</p>
<p>"<em>We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates</em>," the studio continued in its statement. "<em>We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback. Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support - it truly means the world to us. We're grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us</em>."</p>
<p>For this weekend, Build A Rocket Boy says the first hotfix for MindsEye will include:</p>

As part of its <a href="https://youtu.be/NXaDgU72gRI?feature=shared">Press Start online presentation on Thursday</a>, Konami announced that it’s remaking the original <em>Silent Hill</em> in partnership with Bloober Team, the studio that developed last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/26/24279276/survival-horror-silent-hill-2-fear-the-spotlight">well-received <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</a>. Konami didn’t share any more details beyond that the game is in development; the presentation didn’t include any footage, screenshots, or even an estimated release date.</p><p>The presentation also included a segment about <em>Silent Hill F</em>, the new entry in the series that’s launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/sony-playstation/679960/f-is-for-freaky">on September 25th</a>. <em>Silent Hill F</em> is the first title in the series set in Japan, and during the segment, the game’s developers talked about how they designed the game and some of their inspirations. It all looks pretty frightening.</p><p>Konami kicked off the show with a segment on <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, the upcoming remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>. Part of the segment included footage of the <em>Ape Escape</em>-themed “Snake vs. Monkey” mode, available on PS5 and Steam, the <em>Bomberman</em>-themed “Snake vs. Bomberman” mode that you can play on Xbox Series X / S, and a new “Fox Hunt” online multiplayer mode. <em>Delta</em> is set to release on August 28th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I feel like a broken record, but I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>. Now, I think Microsoft just teased its next-gen Xbox plans while announcing its partnership with Asus to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two Xbox Ally handhelds</a> to the market later this year.</p><p>The Xbox Ally handhelds run Windows, but the Xbox team has worked with Windows engineers to boot these PC handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">into a full-screen Xbox UI</a>. The Windows desktop doesn’t even fully load, and you use the Xbox app UI as a launcher to get to all your games (even Steam titles) and apps like Discord.</p><p>While the combination of Windows and Xbox here is intriguing, it’s the way that Microsoft is positioning these devices that really caught my attention. “This is an Xbox,” said Microsoft during the reveal, clearly expanding its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing push</a> beyond a single console to every screen and device.</p><p>It all felt like a true Xbox handheld reveal. There was even an 11-minute-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">behind-the-scenes video</a> on the Xbox Ally handhelds, filmed in a similar style to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dRgWpGePs">“Project Scorpio” Xbox One X reveal</a> from nearly nine years ago. “This is a breakthrough moment for Xbox,” <strong>Carl Ledbetter</strong>, a 30-year Microsoft design veteran, says in the video. Ledbetter helped design the original IntelliMouse, the Xbox 360 Slim, the Xbox One X, and plenty of other Microsoft devices. When Ledbetter is involved, you know it’s more than just a simple partner project with Asus.</p><p>“For the first time, a player is going to be able to hold the power of the Xbox experience in their hand, and take it with them anywhere they want to go,” says Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong>, in the same video. Microsoft thinks of the Xbox Ally handhelds as Xbox consoles with the freedom of Windows, and I think the next-gen Xbox is going to look very similar as a result.</p><p>Microsoft’s own Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization">was reportedly</a> “sidelined” recently, and I’ve heard from insiders that it’s essentially canceled as the company focuses on Xbox’s new software platform. I still think we’ll see next-gen Xbox hardware from Microsoft, but I also strongly believe we’ll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles.</p><p>That’s because the next-gen Xbox platform is being built in the open, with devices like the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. These handhelds seem like a market test for where Microsoft goes next with the combination of Windows and Xbox, and the company’s goal to turn any screen into an Xbox.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> made it clear in an <a href="https://youtu.be/mw26FdfkUDM">Xbox podcast</a> earlier this week that the Windows and Xbox teams are working more closely than ever. He also revealed this is to make the PC gaming experience more console-like:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>This is the tightest collaboration I’ve seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company. For 25 years, almost, we’ve been working on a console experience where you turn it on and it works and your games are there, and how do we bring that to the Windows ecosystem so you get the freedom of Windows to use the storefronts and the apps you want to use, but it feels like a device that’s purpose-built.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>There are plenty of technical challenges on the Windows side to fix, but these new Xbox Ally handheld devices also demonstrate a challenge for Microsoft: it’s about to sell an “Xbox handheld” that won’t run most Xbox console games natively. I’ve seen plenty of hands-on YouTube videos claiming this is a true “Xbox handheld,” but very few make it clear that it’s actually only natively running PC games.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox Play Anywhere effort lets you buy an Xbox game and get the PC version, but only a small amount of Xbox games and publishers are currently part of this. This isn’t an issue for Microsoft’s own first-party Xbox games, as they’ve been publishing to PC for years now, but upcoming games like <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> won’t run on these Xbox handhelds. You’ll have to stream <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> instead, until the PC version, which hasn’t been announced yet, is released.</p><p>I think most consumers won’t even realize this is the case as Microsoft is already heavily marketing these handhelds as Xboxes. Xbox fans were going wild <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLEflHcy8bU">during a watch party</a>, but as soon as the ROG logo appeared the room got a lot more subdued. This highlights Microsoft’s brand challenges here and why Xbox fans are cautious when it comes to the complexity of a PC and the future of their game library. Either way, the real benefit of Microsoft’s approach is access to Steam PC games and even PlayStation PC titles on “Xbox handhelds,” so Microsoft should lean into that selling point initially.</p><p>Over the long term, I think Microsoft will eventually solve this challenge through emulation. Bond created a new team focused on game preservation and forward compatibility in early 2024, but there are technical and licensing hurdles to overcome before original Xbox, Xbox 360, and modern Xbox games can run emulated on a PC.</p><p>Until Microsoft is ready with emulation, it’s filling the gaps with Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming instead. Microsoft’s Xbox app on PC will simply show your recently played games, and then you can just play them — whether it’s natively or streaming through the cloud. Microsoft has already done all the important work for cloud saves, so this makes the experience a lot more seamless.</p><p>All of this work is moving in a direction that Microsoft keeps talking about: choice. Instead of buying one Xbox console from Microsoft, what if you could buy Xbox consoles from lots of PC makers without ever having to see the complexity of Windows?</p><p>Microsoft is going to change the next generation of game consoles if it can pull this off. The company is already opening up its Xbox PC app to list Steam games, so having the ability to run <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">Steam games on next-gen Xbox</a> consoles doesn’t feel all that far-fetched anymore. </p><p>I don’t think Microsoft is doing a bunch of Windows and Xbox work just to have this software running on handhelds. I think this work will give Microsoft the ability to control the console-like experience and UI on a variety of hardware, in a way where it can upsell Game Pass, its own Xbox PC games, and more. Microsoft is already in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221036/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-valve-steamos">handheld gaming PC race</a> against Valve and SteamOS, but that’s a smaller battle in the war to define the next generation of video game consoles. </p><p>As I’ve written plenty of times before, the key to this next-gen Xbox platform will be Microsoft’s execution. It has everything it needs to make this approach a success, but Microsoft’s focus on gaming on Windows has been disastrous in the past. With the Windows and Xbox teams now working together more closely than ever before, it’s make or break time for a new Xbox platform that looks like it’s going to extend far beyond the confines of a handheld PC.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>You can now try Microsoft’s new Start menu for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft is now allowing Windows 11 testers to try out a new, larger Start menu that includes a scrollable interface, new views, and more customization. The best thing about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/683818/microsoft-windows-11-new-start-menu-testing-dev-channel">this refreshed Start menu</a> is that you can now disable the recommended section and see a lot more of your own apps. Microsoft has also made the Start menu larger based on the screen size of your device or monitor. I’d still like to see a bigger overhaul to the Start menu, but having two new category and grid views certainly helps.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is moving its Build conference out of Seattle for 2026. </strong>Microsoft isn’t planning to host its Build developer conference in its home city of Seattle next year. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684313/microsoft-build-conference-2026-location">The conference is being relocated</a>, and Microsoft isn’t saying where it will host Build next, after holding it in Seattle since 2017. One report suggests that the move out of Seattle could have been related to attendee experiences in downtown Seattle. An email is making the rounds locally in Seattle that claims Build attendees had “cited the general uncleanliness of the streets, visible drug use, and the presence of unhoused individuals.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge is getting an AI-powered browser history that works with typos. </strong>Microsoft has started testing a new feature for its Edge browser that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/684195/microsoft-edge-ai-browser-history-search-feature">adds an AI-powered search to browsing history</a>. This new “enhanced search” feature lets you find websites in your browser history even if you use a phrase, synonym, or even a typo that’s similar to the site you actually want to find. This feature is opt-in and uses an on-device model to train on browsing history data “which never leaves your device and is never sent to Microsoft.” This seems like less of a privacy risk than Microsoft’s Recall feature, and you don’t have to worry about snapshots of your screen being stored in a local database, either.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ two new Xbox Ally handhelds are coming later this year</strong>. We don’t have pricing for either device yet, but we do have specs for the new Xbox Ally handhelds. The white ROG Xbox Ally is designed for 720p gaming, and the more powerful black ROG Xbox Ally X targets 900p to 1080p gaming on the go. You can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">read all about the devices here</a> and a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">Windows and Xbox changes here</a>.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11 gets an important update to fix system crashes when launching games. </strong>If you use any games with Easy Anti-Cheat, then <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/windows-11-gets-important-update-to-fix-system-crashes-when-launching-games/">Microsoft just issued</a> a surprise out-of-band update to fix problems with its latest June security update for Windows 11. Some games were making Windows BSOD, but Microsoft notes that its June update wasn’t available for PCs with Easy Anti-Cheat installed, so only a small number of people will have installed the update and then installed an incompatible game afterward. Either way, it’s all fixed now with an additional update.</span></li><li><span><strong>Did Microsoft just tease a Halo CE remaster? </strong>Regular Notepad readers will know I teased a <em>Halo CE</em> remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">last year</a>, and Xbox chief Phil Spencer appears to have confirmed that it’s on the way. At the end of the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682493/did-microsoft-just-tease-a-halo-ce-remaster">Spencer casually revealed</a> that “the next <em>Forza</em>” is coming next year, along with “the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” <em>Halo CE</em> was the launch title for the original Xbox, which turns 25 years old in 2026.</span></li><li><span><strong>Gears of War: E-Day is coming in 2026</strong>. Microsoft also confirmed this week that <em>E-Day</em> won’t be launching in 2025 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682283/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-2026">will debut in 2026 instead</a>. The latest entry in the sci-fi shooter series will be released in the year that marks the 20th anniversary of the original <em>Gears of War</em> game debuting on the Xbox 360. It also means that Xbox’s 25-year milestone will include new <em>Halo</em>, <em>Forza</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Gears </em>games.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge’s picture-in-picture mode is getting better controls. </strong>The picture-in-picture window in Edge is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681499/microsoft-edges-picture-in-picture-mode-is-getting-better-controls">getting the ability</a> to easily pause, play, and skip forward or backward. The UI looks a lot like the Windows Media Player, and it’s part of a new media control center for the Edge browser.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is just leaving some Liquid Glass here. </strong>Who did the glass-like design first? Was it Apple with its Aqua transparency effects in 2000 or Microsoft with its Aero Glass theme in Windows Vista in 2007? Either way, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@windows/video/7514445758280551722?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121503376%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.theverge.com%2Fnews%2F685325%2Fmicrosoft-is-just-leaving-some-liquid-glass-here&amp;referer_video_id=7514445758280551722">released a TikTok video</a> that makes it clear what the company thinks of Apple’s new Liquid Glass design. </span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft CEO says OpenAI alliance is changing but remains strong</strong>. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s <strong>Emily Chang</strong>, Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> has admitted that the company’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-05/microsoft-ceo-says-openai-alliance-changing-but-remains-strong">OpenAI relationship is changing</a>. “Any company that has gone from being a research lab to one of the most successful product companies of this age — obviously things have to change for them and for us and in the context of the partnership,” Nadella says. Microsoft is increasingly focused on diversifying its AI model usage, instead of relying solely on OpenAI’s latest advancements.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new Copilot Vision can “see” your apps on Windows. </strong>Microsoft is launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685963/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-launch">Copilot Vision for Windows today</a>, an extension of its AI assistant that lets you share your screen or apps so that Copilot can do things like coach you through using Adobe Photoshop features or analyze the photos and webpages you’re looking at. I first tried this during the 50th anniversary event in April, and I was surprised to see it could guide me through playing Minecraft or using some Windows apps. It’s launching for Windows users in the US today.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.
