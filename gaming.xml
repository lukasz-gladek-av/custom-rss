<p>As well as a release date reveal, the Direct show also contained lots of other information about the upcoming <em>Tomodachi Life </em>sequel.</p><p>Let's get one thing out of the way now: yes, it's possible to date characters with the same sex or gender as your Mii, and you can also specify a romantic preference for nonbinary characters if you want to.</p><p>This course correction on Nintendo's behalf is part of an attempt to make <em>Living the Dream </em>a more inclusive experience, after criticism of the original <em>Tomodachi Life</em>'s <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/nintendo-apologizes-omitting-gay-marriage-tomodachi-life-n101861" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">omission</a> of gay romance.</p><p>Much like in <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, your island in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>can be customized extensively, giving your Miis the opportunity to discover the village you've built for them and to create a life for themselves within.</p>
<p>If you don't have enough Miis to populate your island, don't worry; <em>Living the Dream </em>will let you create some from within the game itself as well as importing the ones that are already on your Switch.</p><p>Much like the original <em>Tomodachi Life</em>, the fun in this followup revolves around watching your Miis interact with one another and steering those interactions; it's essentially <em>The Sims</em>, but with Miis (and a heck of a lot more weirdness).</p><p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream </em>launches for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Tomodachi-Life-Living-the-Dream-2786386.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> on April 16th.

            <p>
One of the nicer Industry Trends of the past few years has been the rise and rise and rise of climbing sims. It turns out climbing is a source of many emotions, from the melancholy wonder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> through the savage loneliness of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorns-lure">Lorn's Lure</a> to the slapstick camaraderie of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> and the agony of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creator-of-a-game-about-eternal-punishment-and-frustration-is-tired-of-playtesting-it">various Sisyphus sims</a>. Also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. And I guess we should mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a> here? See, it's an absolute avalanche.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is on the somber side. Created by The Game Bakers, it's about a woman with bandaged legs and a scuttling robo buddy. She's trying to reach the top of a mysterious mountain, with a selection of routes to choose from and a backpack inventory to manage. I get the sense that there's more up there than goats, snow and the tents of fellow climbers. We will find out shortly, for Cairn is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">on sale now on Steam</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Nic (RPS in peace) was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-play-the-demo-for-heavy-breathing-open-world-mountain-climber-cairn-now">impressed by the Cairn demo</a> back in December 2024, even though the leg animations gave him funny emotions. Fortunately, Nic's funny emotions make for entertaining reading.
</p>
<p>
"No graceful, contextual, restrictive animations for Cairn," he wrote. "No sirree! You'll also be carefully balancing your supplies, and using pitons as quick checkpoints as you make your ascent. You'll be thinking about things like posture, effort and balance while climbing. 'Each wall feels like a boss fight,' says Steam. Do...the mountains do the spinny FromSoft thing? I'd love that."
</p><p>
I do wonder how much of today's flourishing climbing genre is a delayed reaction against the success of Assassin's Creed - the game that 'fixed' videogame climbing back in the noughties by transforming it into a fluid spectacle of semi-automated ledge grabs and cornering. Remember videogame climbing before Assassin's Creed? It was all vikings doing pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake at murky vine textures. Still, there's only so many synchronisation towers you can auto-parkour before you want to get your fingertips dusty again.
</p>
<p>
Cairn is another change of tune for The Game Bakers, hitherto known for the nimble RPG snogging of Haven and the gimlet-eyed boss-rushing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a>. Also the *squints* cephalopoddy eco activism of Squids Odyssey. What will they bake for us next? A martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant? It's a martial arts romcom set in an alpine seafood restaurant, isn't it. I am giving The Game Bakers 24 hours to deny this, before I write it up as a news story.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Is Going To Make It Really Hard To Share Screenshots In Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-image-sharing-screenshot-block-2000664167</link>
            <guid>1419910</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier today, Nintendo revealed a lot about the upcoming<a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-nintendo-2000664120"><em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em></a> The cute life-sim sequel is set to arrive in April on Switch and Switch 2. But when it arrives, be prepared to take photos of your screen using your phone if you want to share anything online, as Nintendo is locking down screenshot sharing in the game.</p> <p>On January 29, shortly after posting a new Nintendo Direct all about <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, people noticed new information about the upcoming game on the company’s official support site. Specifically, as shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media, people discovered that the life-sim sequel, which lets you create characters and get them into wild situations involving other NPCs, will make it difficult to easily share screenshots of all the silliness online on both Switch and Switch 2.</p>

 <p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/">In a post on its support page for the game,</a> Nintendo says <em>Tomodachi Life</em> offers plenty of “freedom” that can sometimes lead to “unpredictable moments.” And that’s a problem.</p> <p>“While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed,” said Nintendo. “Nintendo is committed to creating experiences that are welcoming and enjoyable for everyone. To support this commitment, and in consideration of the unique gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>, we have decided to place restrictions on certain image-sharing features.”</p>

 <h2>Which image-sharing features are blocked in <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2> <p>While support page doesn’t go into specific detail about what these restrictions are, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1">but if you visit the official Japanese website for the game</a>, you can find this notice:</p> <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">The console’s functions for transferring images to smartphones, posting directly to social media, and </span><span dir="auto">automatically uploading images (Nintendo Switch 2 only) will not be available.</span></p></blockquote> <p>The notice does confirm that Switch 2 players will still be able to use Game Chat to share gameplay of<em> Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream.</em> Still, it is annoying that Nintendo is placing such restrictions on the game, especially when you consider that anyone can just grab their phone and take a screenshot of the game and post it. Which people are going to do. So this won’t really stop people from sharing silly images of characters kissing or whatever Nintendo is afraid is going to happen in April.</p>

 <p>It should also be noted that Nintendo is, at least from what we can tell, not blocking screenshots entirely, just the ability to share them easily online with others.</p> <p>“We understand that some players may find these restrictions limiting,” said Nintendo on its support page. “However, they reflect Nintendo’s ongoing philosophy of creating experiences that bring smiles to everyone who plays.”</p> <p>Some reacted to this news by suggesting that this is likely Nintendo trying to avoid another “Swapnote incident,” but that seems like a very different situation that involved people directly messaging young kids for nefarious reasons using Nintendo software. Taking a screenshot of something silly or weird in your game and then instantly sharing it online using a console’s built-in screenshot button and sharing options is such a great feature in most modern consoles. Nintendo trying to make that harder is odd and also ignores that, once again, everyone has phones and will share whatever they want online. I also can’t help but notice this is happening with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomodachi-life-gay-nonbinary-nintendo-switch-2000664147">first Nintendo game to officially feature gay and non-binary Miis. Hmm…</a></p>

 <p><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em> arrives on Switch and Switch 2 on April 16. Don’t you dare share a screenshot of something weird happening, or a Nintendo lawyer will get you.</p>

Shortly thereafter, Nintendo found itself embroiled in a major controversy after Japanese fans alleged that Nintendo had initially developed, then removed, same-sex relationship options for in-game characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/05/nintendo-on-gay-marriage-and-tomodachi-life">Nintendo's Bill Trinen commented on the issue to IGN at the time</a>, and stated that while Nintendo had indeed updated the game, the update's intent had been to fix a data leak issue when importing characters from a previous game. Separate to this fact, Trinen said, some players had been using the same feature to import male Mii characters that could then be designated female, allowing for the appearance of two Mii characters of the same sex to marry and have a baby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Nintendo never intended to make any form of social commentary with the launch of Tomodachi Life," <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/nintendo-virtual-equality-life-game-23620844?singlePage=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo then said in a statement</a>, which did little to stop the growing backlash. "The relationship options in the game represent a playful alternate world rather than a real-life simulation. We hope that all of our fans will see that Tomodachi Life was intended to be a whimsical and quirky game, and that we were absolutely not trying to provide social commentary."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As fan complaints grew, a fan petition for "<a href="https://miiquality.tumblr.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miiquality</a>" was launched, and the situation caught mainstream attention — including a high-profile skit by late night TV host John Oliver, who broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5w8OFrm6U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a skit featuring Mario and Link snogging</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo then issued a further statement with an apology for "disappointing many people" — and it was here that the company made a "pledge" to make a title that "better represents all players" should it release another Tomodachi title in future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We apologize for disappointing many people by failing to include same-sex relationships in Tomodachi Life," Nintendo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/09/nintendo-next-installment-of-tomodachi-life-will-be-more-inclusive">said at the time</a>. "Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to change this game’s design, and such a significant development change can’t be accomplished with a post-ship patch. At Nintendo, dedication has always meant going beyond the games to promote a sense of community, and to share a spirit of fun and joy. We are committed to advancing our longtime company values of fun and entertainment for everyone. We pledge that if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream allows players to create Mii versions of themselves, their friends, fictional characters and love interests and get them to all interact on a fantasy island. Clearly aware of some of the potential uses of this, Nintendo followed up today's Direct broadcast with a vague <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/a-decade-after-nintendos-same-sex-relationship-controversy-tomodachi-life-finally-delivers-on-promise-to-make-series-more-inclusive">statement</a> that said it would "place restrictions on certain image sharing features" for the game. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/blfga/index.html?modal=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese support website</a> states that this relates to the ability to share images directly to a smartphone or social media, though sharing via Game Chat is still possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-announced-in-the-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct">everything announced at the Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Crimson Desert just a handful of weeks from release, developer Pearl Abyss has released a 15-minute video showing everything from the story to the open world, alongside fresh gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This video shows main character Kliff and the continent of Pywel, which promises to be a seamless open world. Expect “sprawling wilderness, bustling cities, ancient ruins, and diverse regions, all set against a backdrop of escalating conflict and supernatural danger,” Pearl Abyss said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kliff is a warrior of the Greymanes, a faction from the northern region of Pailune. The story begins in the aftermath of a peace being shattered, and Kliff must reunite the Greymanes and reclaim their homeland. You end up discovering that the entire continent is involved.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The threat comes from the Abyss, a mysterious realm that’s sending fragments crashing into Pywel. Some want to exploit these fragments. You’re trying to restore balance to the Abyss and stop those who are exploiting it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Crimson Desert’s huge open world has been a topic of debate recently. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand; Pailune; Demeniss; Delesyia; and the Crimson Desert itself. The main quest revolves around Kliff’s journey, but you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pearl Abyss confirmed that as the story progresses, two additional playable characters become available, each with unique combat styles, skills and weapons. Exploration is a big part of the game — you travel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances, and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. Pearl Abyss said the world is filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest “designed to reward curiosity and discovery.” As for combat, expect to face enemy soldiers, sorcerers, beasts and machines.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-open-world-is-at-least-twice-as-big-as-skyrims-and-larger-than-the-red-dead-redemption-2-map"><u>Pearl Abyss called Crimson Desert’s open world “absolutely massive,”</u></a> bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ Will Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world won’t determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption 2, in Crimson Desert you can fly around on a dragon, so despite the size of its world, you’ll be able to get about quickly. And don’t expect RPG elements in terms of decision-making and choice and consequence as it relates to your character, either. The sheer amount of things to do in the world will facilitate the role-playing part of Crimson Desert, which players will form through “head canon.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You choose the type of character you want to play as in terms of your progression within the systems in the game,” Powers explained. “And then through head canon you’re having this very different experience than other players because of the scope and scale of the game. You’ll be distracted by something, you’ll go on this quest line, you’ll have an experience that’ll be radically different than someone else, even though they’re playing the same game and the same canonical storyline that you both are going through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-locks-in-march-release-date-as-dev-acknowledges-strong-anticipation"><u>Crimson Desert</u> has gone gold</a>, locking in its global release date of March 19, 2026. That’s across PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and Mac.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

Within the first few minutes, Nintendo answered one of fans' big questions of the game: whether it would cater to same-sex relationships, following a previous controversy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo makes good on promise for Tomodachi Life to become more "inclusive"</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will be able to set their Mii character's "dating preferences" with a combination of three options: Male, Female and Non-binary. The game notes that players "can pick one, more than one, or none." Your character's gender can also be set with the same three options, and there are a series of options and sliders to customize your Mii's voice, based on its speed, pitch and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Memorably, the series' previous game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a> experienced a backlash over its lack of same-sex relationships, something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/08/nintendo-strikes-down-gay-marriage-requests-for-tomodachi-life">Nintendo was forced to comment on</a> after rumors spread online that they had been cut from the game, prompting commentary from late night TV host John Oliver — who broadcast <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XV5w8OFrm6U" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> a skit featuring Mario and Link snogging</a>. Notably, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/09/nintendo-next-installment-of-tomodachi-life-will-be-more-inclusive">Nintendo then promised that if it did make another Tomodachi Life game</a>, it would make it "more inclusive, and [something that] better represents all players."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/29/1-tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-direct-29012026-00-31-37-1769695621396.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream's dating preferences screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's broadcast comes just days after a separate <a href="https://za.ign.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/224335/news/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-everything-announced" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Direct focused on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> that debuted our first look at Yoshi, Birdo and more.

Luckily, it also features plenty of customization options for your characters, islanders and the island itself. Characters don't even need to be human, either — teddy bears and aliens also feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this feels like a version of The Sims mixed with Animal Crossing, with the ability to mould your fellow islanders into friends or love interests, introduce other characters to each other, and sit back to watch bizarre storylines play out as your various inhabitants interact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mii characters have a range of traits and mannerisms, and when interacting can prompt some truly odd vignettes. Sometimes your fellow islanders will come to you with requests, and you'll also be able to keep them happy with dishes from the food mart, and fresh items of clothing. You can also use the Switch's touchscreen to draw new items, clothing and even pets for your character to interact with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Islands can be fully built and customised, meanwhile, with houses and items placed to grow your town into a sprawling settlement.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-review</link>
            <guid>1419883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1978, Reinhold Messner and Peter Habeler did something that both scientists and other mountaineers considered impossible: they climbed Mount Everest without the use of supplemental oxygen. After reaching the summit, they split up for the descent, and it took Messner nearly two hours to reach base camp. When he did arrive, he was suffering from snowblindness. Later, a reporter asked him why he went up there knowing he could have so easily died. “I didn’t go up there to die,” Messner, who would return to complete the first solo ascent (also without supplemental oxygen) of Everest two years later, responded. “I went up there to live.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sentiment that would resonate with Aava, the protagonist of Cairn. “All I ever wanted was to touch eternity for an instant,” she tells us at the outset, her eyes to the stars, “To reach one of those rare moments of bliss where everything seems in its place, and you feel you’re part of a whole.” But her mountain isn’t Everest; it’s Kami, a fictional peak no one has ever summited, and she is determined to be the first. Cairn is her story, and like both the mountain she is challenging and the climb itself, it is an incredible one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cairn Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cairn is a game about the climb, about choosing the right route up the mountain, finding the right handhold, taking a chance on the outcropping that seems slightly out of reach, pulling yourself up to a ledge just before your strength fails. Your path to Kami’s summit is up to you and you control each of Aava’s limbs independently (with some optional assistance on by default); each part of the climb is yours. The summit is the goal, but it is enough to make it to the next Bivouac, a tent in which you can sleep, to retape your fingers, cook food, and repair pitons damaged in the climb. There are meters in Cairn that track Aava’s temperature, hunger, hydration level, and overall health, and you’ll need to manage each if you want to survive. Cairn holds you accountable for your choices (if you don’t feed Aava, she will be weaker and climbing will be harder), but it’s rarely overly punishing, and managing your limited resources based on what Kami asks of you is both challenging and rewarding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What doesn’t have a meter is Aava’s stamina, how strong her grip is at the moment, or how well she is maintaining the position you’ve taken. For that, you’ll have to watch her: the way her arms and legs tremble on an unstable hold, the way she breathes, how she whimpers and winces as she’s about to lose her grip. These tells work great, but they can be subtle, especially at first, and you have to pay attention until you learn what to look for and how to position Aava properly as she moves up the mountain. Aava is incredibly strong, but she’s also human. She cannot hold onto smooth rock for long, nor scurry up a sheer cliff through sheer force of will. Shaking out a tired limb and refocusing while on a semi-stable hold will buy you more time, but you cannot scale all of Kami that way. </p><p>Cairn holds you accountable for your choices, but it’s rarely overly punishing.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Salvation, and progress, are found in the small divots she can grab onto, tiny ledges where her feet can find purchase, a crack on the cliff face she can wedge her toes into. Sometimes, there will be nothing, and you will have to take a risk, to brace Aava’s leg against a flat surface in the hope that she can pull herself up before her strength fails or sidle across a small ledge, her hands pressed against smooth stone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the rock is suitable, she can drive a piton into Kami and build a belay, clipping herself to a loop of rope in order to rest. If she falls and you’ve been smart about using pitons, her Climbot helper will catch her, and you can climb the rope back to the belay, or use it to rappel down to an area you might not otherwise reach. But even here, it’s possible to make a mistake and realize you need a belay before Aava has time to drive the piton home, or twist it as it’s going in, ensuring Climbot can only recover part of it rather than the whole thing the next time you’re on solid ground. If the stone is too dense, you’ll have to make the climb unaided. These are Cairn’s most memorable moments. You are going to fall. The only question is whether or not it will kill you, and how much time you’ll lose if the mountain claims you.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">You can pull the camera out for a bird’s eye view of your location at any time (and see the route you’ve taken to get there, including failed past attempts), which is crucial for planning the next leg of your ascent. There are no wrong answers. Sometimes, the route is clear, but slower; other times, it’s faster, but more difficult, and requires more risk. Often, it’s somewhere in between, and you’ll have to choose where and how the route challenges you rather than if it will. And then there are the times where you’ll think you’ve found a good route only to reach a section without a clear answer, then check the map again and see that there was another, easier path available. Sometimes, you can tough it out with smart choices, chalk (which increases your grip strength), and a few well-placed pitons. Other times, it’s best to adjust your path. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Climbing Kami is exhilarating, and I often found myself gazing up at the path before me wondering how I would manage it, only to look down and realize I had a short time later. There is joy in planning out a route, in securing a piton at the last second before Aava falls, in finding the right handhold or wedging Aava’s feet into a crevice that unlocks a path that seemed impassible, in chalking up and daring to persist a difficult section in the rain instead of waiting it out on a belay, in seeing the path you chart in your head becoming the route you’ve taken, in finally pulling yourself onto a ledge after a particularly difficult climb when the night is falling and your visibility is failing and Aava is dehydrated and hungry and tired, in beating the mountain through sheer, dogged determination. The act of climbing doesn’t change much throughout Cairn’s runtime (my playthrough took me 19 hours, but I was very thorough), and occasionally Ava’s limbs may spider in strange directions or she may fall through the mountain, but I was so invested it hardly mattered.</p><p>I will never summit Kami; my victory is inevitable.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I play, Kami exists as something without end, taller than I could possibly imagine, something I will never complete, and the mountain I am scaling, all at once. It is a remarkable balance, and something Cairn never loses. I will never summit Kami; my victory is inevitable. Each time I make it to a Bivouac (which doubles as a save point), I feel like I’ve done the impossible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But inside, there is always more to do. I need to tape Aava’s hands, scarred and covered in blood from the climb. I need Climbot to craft new pitons from the scraps I saved. I need to cook a meal, rehydrate. Aava brings supplies to the mountain, but her backpack can only hold so much. Each time I eat a chocolate bar or drink some milk or tape Aava’s hands, I know I am using up a resource I might not get back. Each time I sleep, I know she will wake up hungry. Kami forces me to make compromises. Climbing at sunset is dangerous because I can barely see; climbing at night is nearly impossible, something I only do if I have no other choice. Sometimes, I rest not because Aava physically needs to, but because there is no way to keep going until sunrise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is not all hardship. When I need something, Kami provides. In caves, on ledges, I find dandelions, perfect for tea. Raspberries. Fresh, clear water. Fish. I am always <em>teetering </em>on collapse, never there. There is always just enough, if I’m smart. Climbot recycles used plastic and bottles and makes chalk. Each part of my journey feeds the other.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I learn the mountain’s story. I find the remains of a cable car and its station, of smashed-open vending machines, flyers and advertisements. Tourists walked here, once. Companies offered anyone the chance to see the mountain until it wasn’t profitable anymore, until it failed, until the mountain pushed back. I find the remains of the troglodytes, a civilization built on Kami, beautiful cities carved into the mountain, great statues. I explore. I learn of their resentment of climbers like Aava, the way civilization came for them, encroached on them, eventually forced them down. The remains of what they built are marked by pitons and covered in climbing rope. “My mountain belongs to everyone,” Aava tells a goat that attacks her. But in climbing it, I realize it isn’t true. By being here, I am profaning something sacred. I am walking through the graveyard of a culture people like Aava helped kill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I am reminded of the cost of what I am attempting. Sometimes, the hints are subtle. Bear-proof boxes full of supplies. Abandoned backpacks. Other times, they are less so. Dead bodies. “Sometimes you come for the mountain,” Aava says gently, kneeling over someone who shared a dream with her. ‘Sometimes the mountain comes for you.” Abandoned campsites. I learn of a group tracking bears on the mountain, and I wonder what happened to them, and about what I might run into as I ascend. I find the corpse of one-half of a climbing team, two orphans who promised to conquer Kami together, and a letter saying the other has gone on in search of a mystical flower with healing properties, hoping to save his partner. I find markings and letters from a couple who scaled Kami together, getting a little higher each time they attempted it. A broken Climbot still receiving messages because maybe that means the climber it belonged to still is, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These stories, and others, recur and build on themselves as I climb, and I find them moving. I explore, go out of my way, to see them. Cairn is not just about Aava; it is about Kami, and everyone who has attempted to climb it. There seem to be two outcomes: either they turn back, or they die. Kami remains unconquered. The mountain always wins.</p><p>Stories recur and build on themselves as I climb, and I find them moving.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I ascend, I also learn about Aava, about the kind of person she is, about who someone driven to do something like this must be. Climbot relays messages she receives as she climbs. From her agent, Chris, who goes from begging her to send him photos to appease their sponsors to just begging her to let him know she’s all right. From her friends, who sing her happy birthday. From her partner, Noami, who does not understand why she is doing this, who reminds her of the cost of what she’s attempting. Aava mostly ignores them. Sometimes they make her smile, make her sad. Sometimes, she is angry with Climbot for playing them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">She meets other people on the mountain. A climber named Marco, who is a fan, grew up reading about her exploits. She is terse with him, occasionally unkind, though she does not mean to be. The quest for the summit may drive her, but she is running away from the world on the ground as much as she is climbing toward Kami’s peak. For everyone else, there is a life at the bottom of the mountain. All they have to do is give up and come down. For Avaa, the climb is all there is.</p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><div><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's favorite games where you mostly walk around</h3><p>Does what it says on the tin</p></div><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/edgarallanbro/lists/wills-favorite-games-where-you-mostly-walk-around" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Cairn never gives us the whole story; everything comes in pieces, in hints, in what’s left unsaid, and in small comments, like the one she makes to Marco when he mentions her father, himself a climber, who put Aava on her first climbing wall when she was three years old. “Great guy,” Marco says, impressed. “So they tell me,” she responds. Like the mountain itself, Aava is complicated, complex, imperfect. And like the mountain, she is incredible. How I felt about her changed as I climbed, but I always understood her. As long as she faced Kami, so would I.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of Cairn, Aava must make a choice about who she is, what she is willing to sacrifice, and how the experience of climbing Kami has changed her. It is a remarkable fusion of gameplay and storytelling, of everything you have seen and done on the mountain. Each choice leads to a different ending. Neither is wrong. I have seen both paths, and in either case, the last couple hours of Cairn are something I will remember for a very long time. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Cairn would mean nothing without the journey, without the climb, without the moments where I faced everything Kami had to throw at me, from sheer cliffs to bad weather to climbing at night. Each time I was close to the top, I discovered the peak was farther off. And each time, I would tape up Aava’s hands, cook whatever I had, and keep going. I knew what she could handle, what she needed, how strong her grip would be, where I could take my chances. My reward was always something wondrous, and by the end I was as attuned to Aava’s body as my own. But what I’ll remember is the story of the mountain and the people on it. I’ll remember the climb. I’ll remember Aava. Kami asks Aava two questions: “Who are you? Why are you here?” Her answers are simple: “I’m a climber. I came here to live.” And through her, so could I.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For those who have been hearing all about this little show called Fallout, but don't have an Amazon Prime account and therefore haven't been able to keep up with the various wasteland chaos, I have some good news for you:</p>
<p>Fallout season one is streaming for a limited time on YouTube.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>The first two episodes of season one - The End and The Target - are available now via Amazon's Prime YouTube channel, with the remaining episodes then releasing steadily over the coming days.</p>
<p>Here is the premier schedule for Fallout season one on YouTube:</p>
<ul>
<li>S1E1 - 28th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E2 - 28th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E3 - 29th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E4 - 29th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E5 - 30th January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E6 - 30th January, 6pm PT</li>
<li>S1E7 - 31st January, 5pm PT</li>
<li>S1E8 - 31st January, 6pm PT</li>
</ul>
<p>For those in the UK, 5pm PT is 1am the following day, and so of course 6pm PT is 2am.</p>
<p>This means, if this is your thing, you could probably squeeze episodes three and four into your morning routine before heading off to work tomorrow (though I am not sure Fallout gore and breakfast are the best combination, but who am I to say what works for you).</p>
<p>As per Prime's YouTube description, these episodes will expire on 11th February, at 11:59 pm PT. Will you be giving season one a watch?</p>

		<p>Nintendo had another Direct stream for one of their early 2026 games, putting the weird and wonderful world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream">Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream</a>, which is now set to launch for Nintendo Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/Nintendo-Switch-2">Switch 2</a> on 16th April 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct – 29/01/2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNtYngxAs1k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The weird, waking dream cousin to the comparatively sensible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing</a>, Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream gives you an island for you to populate with Mii characters and then act as their caretaker. There’s an element of The Sims where they will be able to wander around and find their own things to do and have their own desires, but it’s much less hands on.</p>
<p>It will start with creating your main character and other island residents, with the Mii character creator having been expanded for this game with new options such as face paint, eye-lights and more. You can also set each character’s dating preferences, and then determine some of their base personality. The intention is to create family and friends, but you can also fiddle with these options enough to create a teddy bear, for example.</p>
<p>With people on your island, they’ll sort of do their own thing, but you can prod and push them in a direction. Get two people to meet by picking one up and moving them nearby, and they’ll strike up conversation and probably friendship. &nbsp;They’ll also have desires, so you can hand them food when they’re hungry, give them new outfits and more. Over time, you can mould the characters by giving them quirks, like&nbsp;funny walks, floating, signature greetings, different eating styles, catchphrases.</p>

<p>But then they can have suggestions for people who should meet and give an introduction, or they might develop a crush, fall in love after a typically silly meet cute, and then get rejected. Or confess their love in a situation that you give helpful suggestions for – obviously do it when you’re on a romantic ferris wheel, right? – and suddenly rivals show up for the character to choose between! Drama!</p>
<p>If you get characters to live together, you’ll get to check in on their lives and see how they’re hanging out, their personalities clashing and vibing. Maybe they fight over the TV remote, help each other cooking, or have house meetings.</p>
<p>The island will come to have a bunch of shops for helping you customise, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Supermarket</strong> – With daily rotating food, like escargot</li>
<li><strong>Clothes Shop</strong> – Featuring day-to-day clothing and sillier fancy dress</li>
<li><strong>News Station</strong> – The home of MiiNews with bizarre Mii character insert stories</li>
<li><strong>Renovation Centre</strong> – &nbsp;Choose room interiors such as modern minimalist, football stadium, or a fantasy forest</li>
<li><strong>Market Stall</strong> – Get great deals on items, or grab a mystery bag…</li>
<li><strong>Photo Studio</strong> – Pick your background and scene, choose the Miis to fill the spots and snap photos!</li>
<li><strong>Island Design Centre</strong> – Buy benches, flower pots, and much more to decorate your island. You can also expand the island and use this as a way to create a big metropolis, multiple joined land patches, and even giant portraits.</li>
<li><strong>Studio Workshop</strong> – Create pixel art patterns that can become item inserts for characters, from drawing a pet to latte art, TV backgrounds, clothes patterns, ground tiles, house exteriors and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>After the original game on DS, Tomodachi Life was an off-beat hit for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013. There were other Mii-based spin-offs like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitomo">Miitomo</a> on mobile and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/miitopia">Miitopia</a>, but the main Tomodachi Life experience is now being revived after well over a decade, and on everything we saw in this Direct, it could be pretty darned great!</p>

Along with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">a release date</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>, Nintendo has confirm that players will be able to create non-binary Miis in the new game <em>and</em> that they'll be able to select dating preferences for their characters.</p>
<p>This was all confirmed in today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Nintendo Direct</a>, and in a game where customisation and creation is off-the-charts, more gender and relationship options should be a given. It <em>should've</em> been a given in 2013, but Nintendo is making up for it this time around.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067msyvwi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, when creating your Mii, you'll be able to select from three genders: Male, Female, and Non-binary. And you can also select your Mii's dating preferences, again between the three gender options. You can select one, more than one, or none of them. Essentially, you can date whoever you want — or no one at all.</p>

<p>This is a <em>huge</em> win for many fans of Tomodachi Life on the 3DS, which drew criticism back when it released in Japan in 2013. Initially, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/tomodachi_collection_new_life_features_same_sex_marriage_for_men_but_not_women">a bug appeared to allow same-sex relationships in-game</a>, which Nintendo later patched out. Nintendo followed up the patch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/04/nintendo_provides_some_context_to_2013s_tomodachi_life_same_sex_marriage_controversy">with some clarifications</a>, but fans were understandably still unhappy that the option to date whoever they wanted wasn't available.</p>
<p>This prompted the 'Miiquality' social media campaign ahead of the game's Western release, with Nintendo of America addressing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/05/tomodachi_collection_new_life_features_same_sex_marriage_for_men_but_not_women">the controversy shortly after</a>. Then, two days later, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2014/05/nintendo_apologises_for_disappointing_many_people_over_tomodachi_life_same_sex_marriage_issue">the company issued an apology</a>, stating "if we create a next installment in the Tomodachi series, we will strive to design a game-play experience from the ground up that is more inclusive, and better represents all players."</p>
<p>And, given today's Nintendo Direct, it seems like the developers have stuck to their promise, which is fantastic to see. Now we can all spend time with Hugh Morris however we want, romantically or not.</p>

			<p>Although one, if not the <strong>most iconic sequence</strong> in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> has already been recreated in<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, there are still a lot of beautiful moments left to recreate in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em>. One of these moments, which takes place near the end of the original, was one the series director was looking forward to recreating, and he believes the team did <strong>full justice to it.</strong></p>



<p>As reported in a recent <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">livestream</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VinesauceTheExtraSauce"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Vinesauce</strong></a> had the chance to participate in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a casual gathering </strong>which took place after a promotional event for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S release of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</em></strong></a><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> </strong>with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in New York City earlier this month. Unsurprisingly, the<strong> third part of the remake trilogy</strong> was briefly mentioned when Hamaguchi-san revealed which <strong>part of the story yet to be remade he was more looking forward to.</strong></p>



<p>Through an interpreter, Hamaguchi-san said that the moment he was looking forward to recreating the most was <em>"Cloud finding himself with the help of Tifa,</em>" which is one of the <strong>most intense and emotional parts of the Final Fantasy VII story</strong>. While he did not discuss much about how the scene was recreated in <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3</em>, Hamaguchi-san stated that <em>"they nailed it,"</em> a strong statement that is sure to make every fan of the game quite excited about what is in store for the conclusion of the trilogy.</p>

<p>Besides seeing the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">emotional impact</strong> this particular moment will have with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">current-generation graphics</strong> and with the<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> superb voice acting</strong> that Cody Christian and Britt Bratton already delivered for Cloud and Tifa in the first two entries in the series, it will be very interesting to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how much the scene will have been changed</strong>, with Tifa's brief first venture in the Lifestream in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which doesn't happen in the original, and Cloud's already being partially aware of his past and the truth behind the Nibelheim incident. No matter what, I know I am really looking forward to it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Gamers Are Not Actually Opposed to AI, But Rather People Exploitation and Slop”, Says Dev Behind AI-Powered Game Bobium Brawlers]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/</link>
            <guid>1419847</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Game developer <strong>Studio Atelico</strong> is announcing its AI-powered debut game, <strong>Bobium Brawlers</strong>, today. It's a turn-based card and dice creature battler game currently targeting mobile platforms (iOS to start, where it's set to launch later this year) with a specific twist: players can create the creatures that will be in their deck simply by describing them to the so-called Studio Atelico AI Engine. </p>



<p>Crucially, the AI engine will run on-device, ensuring privacy, low latency, and no additional costs. Because of this, Bobium Brawlers will only run on models equipped with relatively recent versions of the <strong>Neural Engine</strong>, probably from <strong>iPhone 13</strong> onward. Of course, the developers also created many decks and cards to train the engine to follow those examples when creating new cards.</p>



<p>In a remote presentation attended by Wccftech, Art Director <strong>Mollie Boorman</strong> explained that <strong>Studio Atelico employs a team of human artists who have created extensive training assets</strong>. These images were paired with descriptions to train the model. She clarified that <strong>this game simply could not have been made without AI</strong>, as it allows players to create unique artwork in minutes. However, they are not using AI for everything.</p>



<p>Moreover, the studio paid artists to develop the visual style and to create the bulk of the non-creature art featured in Bobium Brawlers, and <strong>continues to pay them for the styles they created, including royalties for creatures generated in-game using their training assets</strong>. Their ethical approach was described as distinctly pro-artist, pro-player, and pro-human, <a href="https://atelico.studio/blog/game-ai-art-without-losing-your-soul" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in a blog post on their website a few months ago</a>.</p>



<p>After the presentation, given the strong anti-AI stance of many hardcore gamers (<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as seen recently with the debacle surrounding <strong>Larian</strong> and their upcoming <strong>Divinity</strong> game</a>), it's no wonder that the very first question in the roundtable interview addressed the elephant in the room: is the studio ready to face backlash?</p>



<p>Studio Atelico CEO and co-founder <strong>Piero Molino</strong> explained that he sympathizes with the profound reasons behind this growing sentiment among gamers, but also clarified that he doesn't believe gamers are actually anti-AI; rather, they are opposed to "slop" and the exploitation of humans that is sometimes associated with it.</p>



<p><em>I understand that stance for two reasons. One, because of how most tech companies are adopting this technology without providing for the people who made it possible, which are, in the case of image generators, the artists whose images the generators have been trained on. It makes total sense why there is this kind of pushback; I totally understand that. We are approaching it from a different point of view: paying artists and giving them royalties on what is being generated. </em></p>



<p><em>We do not want to exploit anyone; we want to use that technology to create new mechanics that were not possible before. <strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and "slop." These are both things that we are trying very strongly to avoid</strong>. We are supporting the people who make it possible to create these models and we are not creating slop. We are trying to have a specific art style that is tailored to our specific game, thanks to the work our artists are doing. We hope to disentangle the general sentiment towards AI and show what is possible when you use it in a very positive way.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Later in the interview, Molino added that in the very first version of Bobium Brawlers, <strong>some parts of the AI Engine will run in the cloud, but only a very small amount</strong>, and the studio plans to move those on-device as well in the future. Because they are just small parts, the cost for Studio Atelico is very low: less than one cent per creature creation overall. Molino reckons bringing the cost of AI engines in games to zero or close to it is crucial for the technology to actually spread in more titles.</p>



<p>When it comes to the game mechanics, the duels will be quick 1v1 battles that blend card mechanics with dice-rolling action. Players will be able to use clever combos and tactical improvisation, rather than grinding or chasing the meta, to win matches.</p>



<p>The bigger question, though, is whether you agree with the studio's approach and the CEO's view on why gamers are so vehemently anti-AI. Let us know in the poll and comments below!</p>

			<p><strong>DayZ</strong> creator <strong>Dean Hall</strong> and <strong>Rocketwerkz's</strong> PvE sci-fi survival game <strong>ICARUS</strong> makes its console debut next month, on <strong>February 26, 2026,</strong> publisher <strong>GRIP Studios</strong> has announced. This comes after it was revealed in October 2025 that the game would be making its way to consoles at some point in the first quarter of 2026.</p>



<p>The console version will include the base game and the <strong>New Frontiers</strong> expansion, and the <strong>Pet Companion Pack</strong>, which includes eleven additional animals between three new cats, five new dogs and three new horses, each with their own levels, talent tree, and requirements to help them survive alongside you.</p>



<p>The game's arrival on console comes five years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-the-co-op-survival-game-from-dean-hall-just-got-delayed-to-november/">it first launched on PC back in 2021</a>. While the game didn't arrive in the best shape, in the last six years, Rocketwerkz has consistently updated and improved the game and has been rewarded with a dedicated player base.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ICARUS: Console Edition Launches 26.02.26 | Pre-order Bonus Revealed" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5GTFL29dXa4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>With the New Frontiers expansion adding the alien region of <strong>Prometheus</strong>, players jumping into ICARUS for the first time will have <strong>128km2</strong> of ground to cover and conquer as they try to survive the hostile world around them.</p>



<p>When GRIP Studios announced ICARUS would be coming to consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/icarus-qa-dayz-creator-talks-console-edition-support-survival-genre-evolution/">Wccftech had the chance to speak to the game's creator, Dean Hall,</a> who confirmed a few bits of info worth remembering as we approach its console release date.</p>



<p>Firstly, there is no crossplay between PC and console players, nor is there crossplay between PS5 and Xbox Series X/S console players. If you want to play with your friends, you'll all have to be on one platform.</p>



<p>Of course, that could change with GRIP Studios continuing to work towards adding crossplay support, but there's no guarantee it'll happen. The same goes for a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> edition, something that GRIP Studios won't necessarily focus on until after the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S editions are out the door.</p>

<p>What's more, if you pre-order <em>Icarus </em>on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, you'll get access to the Pet Companions Pack DLC, which, as the name suggests, adds a number of adorable animals to pet and look after.</p><p>News of <em>Icarus</em>' console release date comes just a couple of weeks after Rocketwerkz and founder Dean Hall announced that the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/icarus-sales-1m-steam-winter-sale" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c279503c-13a7-4443-b2c6-79704af33562" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rack up almost a million sales for itself</a> during the most recent winter Steam Sale.</p><p>Hall also said that <em>Icarus </em>had managed to shift just shy of 250,000 "DLC units", although since the game has a number of smaller packs available in addition to its major expansion, that could just mean a whole bunch of what are effectively microtransaction purchases.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar, <em>Icarus </em>is a survival game created by Dean Hall, one of the key players behind zombie sandbox <em>DayZ</em>. It's a PvE-focused affair that sees you (and, optionally, your squad) heading down to a planet on which terraforming has gone wrong and trying to survive its dangers.</p>

              <p>A smattering of classic<em> Final Fantasy</em> games are now available to buy and play via Good Old Games. It’s the first time any games from Square Enix’s popular RPG franchise have been made available on GOG, and to celebrate, the newly added titles are currently on sale.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/news/four_iconic_final_fantasy_titles_are_here">GOG announced</a> that <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/final_fantasy">four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games were now available on the PC gaming storefront</a>. If you were expecting the first four entries into the series to be the first ones to arrive on GOG, you’ll be in for a surprise when you look below to check out the list of FF games added today.</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Final Fantasy III (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IV (3D Remake)</em> – $6.40 ($16)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy VIII – Remastered</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Final Fantasy IX </em>– $8.40 ($21)</li> </ul> <p>GOG says these entries “represent different eras of the series” which might help explain the scattershot release. But I guess you gotta start somewhere? All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> RPGs on GOG are also part of the store’s fantastic <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">Good Old Game preservation program</a>, ensuring they will work on modern PCs for years to come, even if Square Enix removes them from sale or doesn’t want to update them in the future, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-warcraft-1-2-classic-remaster-drm-preservation-1851711097">something that has happened before</a>.</p> <p>“Few video game series have shaped the medium quite like <em>Final Fantasy,”</em> said GOG in a news post on Thursday. “For decades, it has defined storytelling in games, pushed technical and artistic boundaries, and created worlds and characters that resonate far beyond the screen. Today, we’re proud to announce that four landmark entries in the franchise are coming to GOG!”</p>

 <p>All four <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are available now. I expect more will be added in the future. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-caught-using-ai-generated-artwork-2000663836">Now, go tell GOG to stop using gross AI art for banners</a>.</p>

Discover new maps, missions, creatures, and rewards.</p><p><strong>A Planet That Fights Back</strong></p><p>Icarus resists your presence; poisoned air, lightning storms that tear apart structures, wildfires that spread unchecked, and predators that stalk in the shadows.

Terraforming failed here completely, leaving raw alien landscapes intact but warped. This expansion expands Icarus far beyond its original borders:</p><ul><li><strong>New Map and Biomes</strong> – Alien grasslands, volcanic wastelands of molten lava, and dangerous swamplands.</li><li><strong>Six Narrative Missions</strong> – A chained story across Prometheus as you pursue a mysterious whistleblower for the UDA.</li><li><strong>New <a title="Companies > Creature [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a>s</strong> – Face Needlers, Dracs, Dreadwings, and other mutated apex predators, evolved to dominate these zones.</li><li><strong>New Exotics</strong> – Discover a volatile new exotic with unique effects on the flora, plus new exotic plants and over 30 additional workshop items.</li><li><strong>New Items and Resources</strong> – Mine obsidian, clay, scoria, crystallised miasma, and super-cooled ice; craft 100+ new items including weapons, food, recipes, and building tiers.</li></ul><p><strong>Three Ways to Survive</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Open World</strong> – Establish permanent bases and explore freely.</li><li><strong>Missions</strong> – Timed contracts where extraction is everything.</li><li><strong>Outposts</strong> – Low-pressure zones for creative building and experimentation.</li></ul><p><strong>Progression and Reward</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Tech Tree and Talents</strong> – Advance from primitive tools to advanced tech.</li><li><strong>Specialization</strong> – Focus as a hunter, builder, or survivalist.</li><li><strong>Orbital Workshop</strong> – Trade exotic matter for permanent upgrades and equipment. Exotic matter remains the ultimate prize; rare, unstable, and deadly to pursue.</li></ul><p><strong>Solo or Cooperative Play</strong></p><p>Up to four players can share each drop, combining skills and resources to endure.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/theres-a-fresh-demo-for-nioh-3-with-a-week-to-go-before-launch/</link>
            <guid>1419796</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>WIth the launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> next week on 6th February, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja have released a new demo for the game, letting you explore early areas on both PS5 and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>The new demo will let players create their custom character and make a start on the game by exploring the Warring States period and battling through to the Jakotsu-baba boss, with save data able to carry over to the full game. This can all be played solo, of course, but there’s also support for up to three players in online multiplayer, so your buddies can come give you a hand.</p>


<p>Beating the demo by 15th February will then reward you with the Twin-Snake Helmet for the full version of the game – this bonus cannot be earned by those who’s already obtained it through the PS5 alpha demo, though.</p>
<p>Nioh 3 casts you as Tokugawa Takechiyo who has been forced from the shogunate throne by his rebellious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, and must face him and his army of demons in battle for the ages.</p>

<p>New for this game is a quick switch to a second combat style, transforming from Samurai to Ninja in a flash. You’ll make the most of these with the yokai that you battle in the new ‘open field’ setting that greatly broadens the level style.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/21/nioh-3-preview-bakumatsu-kyoto-ninja-gameplay/">hands on with Nioh 3 last year</a>, experiencing both this new combat style shifting and open field design. I said, “It’s undeniably fun to switch back and forth between Samurai and Ninja, or just stick with the faster, nippier Ninja in general. No doubt, this is one for fans of the series and the wider genre to pay attention to when it launches in February 2026.”</p>

            <p>After years worth of all of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-will-release-in-march-2026-according-to-the-latest-whispers">that</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-rated-by-pegi-as-the-siren-song-of-remake-sea-shanties-grows-deafening">the other thing</a>, they've just randomly decided now's the time to acknowledge it. Via a Tweeter reply containing that GTA: San Andreas meme no less. I may be a weathered old sailor with cannon fuses tied into my beard and more trips up the rigging than I can count to my name, but I didn't foresee this being how Ubisoft finally acknowledged that Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's what they've done, though. Years of silence, and then like a well-timed broadside, boom:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Why now, in response to a seemingly random bloke selling an Edward Kenway-shaped plastic trinket on Vinted? Well, a man of the sea can only assume the publishers' recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">raft of cancellations and delays</a>, which reportedly included the Black Flag remake being pushed back into the financial year ending March 2027, factor in.</p>
<p>Those have been quickly followed by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">redundancy plans</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">unions calling strike action</a> against Ubisoft, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-designer-claims-ubisoft-have-suspended-him-for-alleged-breach-of-the-duty-of-loyalty-over-new-rto-policy">real</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-just-as-if-it-never-existed-following-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-remake-cancellation-actor-discusses-losing-three-years-worth-of-work">toll</a> taken on folks lives rightly taking precedence over chatter about a pirate game.</p>
<p>Perhaps this just the way things have to go these days. The sobering reality of workers being chucked into the sun punching you right in face. Then, when you open your eyes again, the surreal sight of a corporate social media account finally tipping its cap to a long-rumoured remake's existence ages after it'd have made sense to do so is there. Immense and unforgiveable brutality, intercut with the promise of goods people might treasure conveyed in a manner so strange you can scarcely believe. Yo-ho. A pirate's life indeed, I guess.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-goes-all-in-on-portable-power-station-clearance-river-2-pro-generator-drops-40-with-a-5-year-warranty-2000663939</link>
            <guid>1419784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Investing in a power station can be a smart decision if you’re often out and about or want to have a backup option during outages. The best options out there offer multiple ports and a reliable battery life, but they often don’t come cheap. That, however, is changing today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Right now, you can snag the EF Ecoflow River 2 Pro portable power station for just $315 at Amazon, after the retailer knocked 40% off its usual $529 price tag.</a> The offer is open to all shoppers, but it ends soon. Grab yours now, before Amazon decides to shoot the price back up (which can be any moment now).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for a Wide Range of Devices</h2>
<p>The River 2 Pro weighs just 17.2 lbs and features a built-in handle, both of which make it easy to carry the power station around. You’re getting a total of 11 ports, including four AC outlets, one USB-C port, three USB-A ports, two DC outlets, and one car outlet. That’s more than enough to keep all your important devices powered in cases of emergency. Think plugging your smartphone, laptop, an electric blanket, a coffee machine, and lights – all at the same time, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>The output of up to 1600W makes the thing perfectly capable of running around 80% off all your appliances, even high-wattage ones. It can recharge your phone from 0 to 100% 57 times on a single charge, and your laptop for over 10. When at home, it keeps your electric blanket powered for 12 hours, your refrigerator for five, and even your PC for over an hour. That means you can rely on it to get work done during an unexpected outage, plus keep other essentials running for extended periods.</p>



<p>When it comes to recharging the power bank itself, that doesn’t take forever either. You can power it back up via an AC outlet, a solar panel, a Type-C cable, or your car. Using an AC outlet is the fastest option, juicing it back to 100% in just 70 minutes. A 220w solar panel will take around 3.5 hours, while plugging it into a 12v/24v 8A car outlet gets the job done in about nine hours. This flexibility comes in handy when you’re camping in the wild, traveling, or dealing with electricity supply issues at home. Additionally, the LFP battery cells are long-lasting, letting you recharge the River 2 Pro more than 3000 times before dropping to 80% capacity. For reference, that’s nearly 10 years of regular use. What’s more, the power station includes advanced BMS protection that monitors voltage, current, and temperature to ensure longevity. Basically, it’s made to support all your power needs for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6489/">Included in the box are the power station itself, an AC charging cable, a user manual, and a 5-year service for added peace of mind</a>. Altogether, the EcoFlow River 2 Pro portable power station is great for anyone looking to invest in a reliable power solution without putting a dent in their wallet. This deal makes the upgrade easier than ever. Just make sure you grab the offer before it’s too late.</p>

<p>The Split Fiction game director has revealed that he has received the first draft of the upcoming adaptation’s script. </p>



<p>The movie adaptation of Split Fiction was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-movie-confirmed-with-sydney-sweeney-taking-a-lead-role/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed in April 2025</a>, less than 2 months after the game’s release. It has some big names attached to it, with Sydney Sweeney taking one of the lead roles and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick writing the script. </p>







<h2 id="h-split-fiction-director-has-met-sydney-sweeney">Split Fiction Director Has Met Sydney Sweeney  </h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/split-fiction-game-director-exciting-update-sydney-sweeney-movie-3311457/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> report, news that the first script for the Split Fiction movie has reached the game’s director comes from an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTw4CbhDZZT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> by Moviezine. The post features a video in which Josef Fares states that he has received the “first version of the script.” However, he added that he will believe it when he sees it, due to “so much talk in Hollywood”. Fares also said that he had a conversation with the Euphoria star, and “she seems pretty chill” and “hyped for the movie”. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Split Fiction is a co-op title from the creators of It Takes Two, Hazelight Studios. It features the tale of two writers who are trapped in the adventures of each other’s stories. One of the writers specialises in fantasy stories and the other in sci-fi, and they have been hooked into a machine that steals their ideas. The game features a variety of abilities and several challenges that blend sci-fi and fantasy into a unique perspective. </p>

Then we added a massive arsenal, cybernetic upgrades that reshape your playstyle, and wrapped it in a roguelite loop. The result is something we hope captures the badass spirit of 80s cinema while giving you a reason to keep hunting run after run.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Coffee Stain Publishing:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Corporations turned <a title="Companies > crim [24 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>e-infested streets into profit margins for bounty hunters and John Sawyer is going to make a killing. Hunt, die, upgrade, repeat in this explosive roguelite prequel where every strategic upgrade strips away more flesh and builds a cybernetic fighter one chrome limb at a time.</p><p><strong>Combat and Runs: Die Hard, Hunt Harder</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Fast, violent run-and-gun action ripped straight from VHS-era blockbusters. Tight controls meet brutal firefights in a roguelite loop designed for pure adrenaline. Collect bounties and survive as long as you can. When you finally go down, Tony drags you back to his operating table and rebuilds you stronger.</p><p>Every run pushes you deeper into dangerous gang turf—from neon-soaked city streets to desolate wastelands. Choose your path, lock in on your targets, and adapt on the fly. Each death teaches you the patterns, each resurrection makes you deadlier. This is John Sawyer’s origin story: the transformation from man to cybernetic legend.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1022452"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Weapons and Upgrades: Build the Perfect Killer</strong></p><p>Crank up the heat with a powerful arsenal of firearms, melee weapons and tactical gear. And if heat isn’t your thing, go for a cryomod and let an electric baton do the rest.</p><p>Discover cybernetic upgrades and weapon licenses buried in enemy territory. Make your upgrades permanent by unlocking them between runs and reshape how Sawyer fights. Reinforced limbs and experimental combat mods—hundreds of combinations to forge Sawyer into the killing machine that fits your style.</p><p>Each run offers fresh opportunities. Bank your earnings, invest in permanent enhancements, then jump back in with new capabilities. Adapt your approach: go loud with heavy firepower or slice through with bladed brutality. The city’s scum won’t know what hit them.</p><p><strong>Handcrafted Pixel Art Visuals</strong></p><p>Meticulous pixel art meets modern lighting in a stunning collision of retro craft and contemporary technique. This is pure early-80s B-movie aesthetics—bold reds on deep black and explosive contrasts. No pretty neon nostalgia, just VHS-era swagger.</p><p>Welcome to the grindhouse.
