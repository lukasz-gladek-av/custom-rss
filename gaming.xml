<p>Decor Pikmin! Photo Mode!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Well, we weren't expecting this!</p>
<p>Nintendo has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> is receiving a free update next month, adding in adorably unique 'Decor Pikmin' for your squad, a photo mode, and new modes adjusting the overall aggression of in-game creatures.</p>
<p>There's no firm release date just yet, but Nintendo has also confirmed that an updated demo will also be released on the same day.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at the new features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Decor Pikmin</strong>: Originally seen in the <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id%3Dsmartlink%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.pikminbloom.com%252F%26esheet%3D54343309%26newsitemid%3D20251022648787%26lan%3Den-US%26anchor%3DPikmin%2BBloom%26index%3D4%26md5%3D74e57c1af2194e027495504ed7860345&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1761225063211000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yLvAAUb9qdTg_c-UvNF35" href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pikminbloom.com%2F&amp;esheet=54343309&amp;newsitemid=20251022648787&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Pikmin+Bloom&amp;index=4&amp;md5=74e57c1af2194e027495504ed7860345" rel="nofollow" shape="rect"><em>Pikmin Bloom</em></a><sup>1</sup> smart-device app, these curious Pikmin are marching their way to <em>Pikmin 4</em>. Decor Pikmin (like the name implies) are Pikmin that don some form of decoration found in the world – you may see them wearing something like a wind-up toy, a doughnut, a snow hat and much more. Decor Pikmin you gather in the new <em>Pikmin 4</em> update can also be transferred to your squad in <em>Pikmin Bloom</em>, including some that are completely new!</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>- Field Camera</strong>: Take stylish photos of your character, your squad and whatever you like with this new feature. Set the scene with various angles, hide characters, and decorate your pics with filters, frames and stamps. The camera may even be the key to adding Decor Pikmin to your crew …</p>
<p><strong>- New Creature Activity Levels</strong>: Move at your own pace and enjoy the new Relaxed mode, where creatures won’t attack unless you attack them, or kick things up a notch in the fiery Fierce mode. These modes can be selected when starting a new game or changed at any point after from the game’s settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also been announced that Pikmin Bloom will receive a new update to add in Ice Pikmin, marking the variant's first ever appearance in the game. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aMlv5rEu2I">A new trailer</a> has also been uploaded to mark this announcment.</p>
<p>We wondered if perhaps the recent 'Close to You' Pikmin videos would perhaps lead to something more, and it sure did! Okay, it's not quite the 'Nintendo Switch 2 Edition' we'd love to see, but hey, we'll take it.</p>

<p>Hello Games is back with yet another update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a>, and this one feels suitably spooky — 'tis the season, after all.</p>
<p>The big addition in today's 'Breach' update is a series of space wrecks that pop up across the universe, all of which are fully explorable. Using the newly added space walking abilities, you'll be able to dive into these wrecks and salvage parts for your ship, which, let's not forget, can now be customised thanks to the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-lets-you-design-and-build-your-own-spaceship">'Voyagers' update</a>.</p>
<p>There's also a new expedition launching alongside this update, which will have you playing space Sherlock to work out what happened to a mysterious wreck. This mission will lead you to the edge of space, to rare purple-star solar systems, to... more ship parts, probably.</p>
<p>For a taster of what you can expect, here are some screenshots from Hello Games:</p>

<p>It sounds like another solid addition to an already jam-packed game, and a prime jumping-in point for those who haven't checked out the Switch 2 version yet — which we described as "an almost perfect port of an almighty behemoth of a game" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/luigis-mansion-nintendo-switch-online</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spooky-gamecube-classic-luigis-mansion-hits-nintendo-switch-online-this-month.1331461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the latest GameCube game to join the Nintendo Switch Online library, and just in time for Halloween, it's spooky horror classic&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion</em>'s turn in the spotlight.</p>

<p>Alright, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>isn't the scariest game in the GameCube's lineup; that honor arguably goes to Silicon Knights' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/horror-gaming-obscura-eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem" rel="nofollow">excellent&nbsp;<em>Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</em></a>, which remains unavailable on Switch Online for some baffling reason.</p>

<p>Still, if you want a survival horror-tinged game the whole family can gather around the Switch 2 to play, then&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>is a very solid choice. It's landing on Switch Online on October 30th, although you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">going to need a Switch 2</a> to play it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-luigis-mansion-gameplay.jpg?itok=T-dUiGLF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-luigis-mansion-gameplay.jpg?itok=BdmOz_4b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Nintendo Switch Online. Hooray!</figcaption></figure><p>This is the original&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>release, rather than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2018-luigis-mansion-remake" rel="nofollow">Nintendo 3DS remake</a> that launched back in 2018. Like pretty much all games that originated on the 3DS, that remake isn't playable on modern hardware (through conventional methods, at least).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion</em>, it's essentially a sort of Nintendo-ified take on the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>formula. Luigi has inherited a mansion in a competition he doesn't remember entering, and he must explore said mansion in order to uncover its mysteries and find out what's happened to his brother Mario.</p>

<p>To do so, he'll have to battle ghosts using his iconic Poltergust 3000, a vacuum cleaner that's been specially tuned to hoover up spirits (although it'll also deal with various other items in Luigi's environment).</p>

<p><em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>also features a somewhat similar structure to&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, with Luigi hunting for keys around the mansion and periodically battling boss ghosts to progress through the game's story.</p>




<p>This re-release means that all three&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>games are now available to play on Switch or Switch 2 hardware; a remake of sequel&nbsp;<em>Dark Moon</em>&nbsp;is available now on Switch, as is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/luigis-mansion-3" rel="nofollow">third mainline entry in the series</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion&nbsp;</em>via Switch Online starting from October 30th, but you'll need a subscription and the Expansion Pack addon to do so.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-with-immediate-effect.1331458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy CEO Tero Virtala is to step down with immediate effect, and the&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Control&nbsp;</i>studio hasn't found itself a permanent replacement for him yet.</p>

<p>That's according to a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official Remedy website, in which the studio reveals that Virtala will be stepping down and that his interim replacement will be&nbsp;Markus Mäki, who previously served as Remedy's Chairman of the Board.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;Mäki will be vacating that role in order to serve as interim CEO. He'll be replaced as Chairman by&nbsp;Henri Österlund, who's served on Remedy's board for eight years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-control.jpg?itok=IQyx8ZZL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-control.jpg?itok=7iChKOL1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tero Virtala, CEO of&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>studio Remedy, is stepping down.</figcaption></figure><p>Remedy says it's initiating its search for a new CEO "immediately", and that Virtala will remain in his position in order to assist with handover once a permanent replacement is found.</p>

<p>No reason for Virtala's departure was given, but it's been a rough year or two for Remedy, to say the least. Back in August, the studio admitted that sales of its latest release, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">multiplayer shooter</a>&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-financials" rel="nofollow">had been unsatisfying</a>.</p>

<p>A major update for the game, Breakpoint, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update" rel="nofollow">released back in September</a>, and while it briefly injected a little life back into&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, it hasn't been enough to sustain player interest, if <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#3m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB's numbers</a> are anything to go by.</p>

<p>It hasn't all been dire for Virtala and Remedy over the last twelve months or so, though; back in February, Remedy announced that survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-profitable-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">was finally profitable</a>, having hit the two million sales mark around that time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-ceo-steps-down.jpg?itok=didfl9OL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-ceo-steps-down.jpg?itok=gaDT1WZv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>proved profitable for Remedy, but it seems&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>has not.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to Remedy's future, the company is currently working on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">alongside publisher Annapurna</a>, and remakes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy" rel="nofollow">first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>series</a> are also on the way.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Virtala stepping down will affect Remedy's future plans in any way, but I'd imagine the studio will think twice before greenlighting a project like&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>again. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/803399/metroid-prime-visual-retrospective-art-book-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-metroid-prime-art-book-offers-rare-insight-into-nintendo%E2%80%99s-design-process.1331455/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Metroid Prime 1–3: A Visual Retrospective </em>is a fabulous resource for learning more than I ever thought I’d be privy to about Nintendo and Retro Studios’ ambitious first-person adventure series. The 210-page hardcover book launches on October 28th, weeks before the series makes its long-awaited return with <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777056/metroid-prime-4-release-date-nintend-direct-september-2025">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em> on the Switch and Switch 2. It’s the perfect $50 gift for someone who’s pored over video essays about the trilogy’s design, and who’s always wanted to get a behind-the-scenes look at how the games were made. There’s a 35-page free sample available through <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fmetroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-artbook-arrives-on-oct-28%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo</a> if you want a hi-res taste.</p><p>Most of the book consists of detailed concept art of environments, common enemies, bosses, and Samus Aran herself. It’s awesome to see it all, including assets that didn’t end up making the cut in the games, preserved in this book. The book goes from game to game, from the GameCube to the Wii, ending with a brief dive into <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> on the Nintendo Switch, a remake that apparently took about four years to make. As for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, it’s not mentioned — a whole new book might be necessary to detail that title’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date">tumultuous development</a> alone.</p><p>My favorite part is the many notes in the margins from series producer Kensuke Tanabe, a veteran Nintendo designer with credits dating back to <em>Super Mario Bros. 2</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. These producer notes are made possible in part by Nintendo’s and Retro’s apparent knack for detailed note-taking; candid design-related squabbles and struggles made over 20 years ago are recalled with decisive clarity. It’s entertaining when Tanabe notes that he and Nintendo sometimes pulled rank to ensure that <em>Metroid Prime </em>possessed certain qualities. “[...] the game we’re making now is a Nintendo game, and this is Retro’s first time working on one. I’ve been working on Nintendo games my entire career, so I believe I have the most experience in making Nintendo games. So please trust me first.”</p><p>He also frequently heaps praise on the team at Retro, like when it convinced Nintendo that morph ball half-pipes were a good idea, for example. “Initially, Nintendo was skeptical,” said Tanabe. “However, Retro responded ‘Please try it out first before deciding,’ and submitted a prototype. I vividly remember that when we finally tested it, it turned out to be incredibly satisfying and engaging.” By the end of the book, it’s clear that Retro left a huge mark on each of the games.</p><p>Some seldom-discussed aspects of the series — and of Nintendo’s game development process in general — are shared in these producer quotes. Tanabe speaks to Retro’s burnout following the launch of <em>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</em>, saying that the team expressed interest in making a <em>Donkey Kong</em> game to boost morale “after having to work on two consecutive games within the same IP under tight schedules and without much of a break.” (That ended up happening in 2010 with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, after <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption.</em>)</p><p>Tanabe also speaks to lackluster sales of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em>, which had motivated Retro to propose a sequel that appealed to a wider audience. However, Nintendo vetoed its proposals because they were built on existing game mechanics (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metroid-prime-producer-reveals-axed-open-world-game-plans/">an interview</a> from an ex-Retro Studios employee mentions an open-world design), instead opting to take advantage of the Wii’s motion controls and lean further into the lingering threat of Dark Samus.</p><p>This retrospective is a stunning tome to have on a shelf, with a red embossed outline of Samus Aran. But the real treasures are inside of its stitched covers, in terms of both the art and official commentary detailing Nintendo’s secretive game development process. It’s easy to see how book publisher Piggyback’s format could work with any of Nintendo’s franchises (especially since the company has retained some of its key designers for decades). But for now, I’m just happy that this one exists.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/803399/metroid-prime-visual-retrospective-art-book-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Earlier this year, I was interviewing the creators of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-balls-monster-catchin-musical-professor-oak-2000617768"><i><span>BALLS: The Monster-Catchin’ Musical Comédy</span></i></a><span> about the parody show’s spoofing of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. We talked about how, in the ‘90s, Game Freak probably wasn’t designing the world of its monster-taming RPGs to be interrogated, or expecting the core concept of capturing magical monsters in balls to become the source of a heated moral quandary. Established norms like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-starters-chikorita-tepig-totodile-2000637637"><span>dumping your unused Pokémon in a PC box</span></a><span> were probably not meant to make a kid think about the existential dread their seventh-favorite monster might experience in captivity, where they had to put it because they could only hold six Poké Balls on their belt at a time. The </span><i><span>BALLS</span></i><span> writers, however, extrapolated this rote procedure into a scene in which its legally distinct “Collectabuddies” are going mad from being stranded in storage for so long. It’s a dark, disturbing fate that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>hasn’t explored, and in the decades since </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, the dissonance between </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s need to maintain an upbeat depiction of its world’s monster-catching status quo and its exploration of a world in which Pokémon and humanity co-exist peacefully as equals has only become louder and harder to ignore, especially as stories like </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>have put these dynamics under a microscope.</span></p> <p><span>Enter </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, a sequel to the 3DS games </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, set entirely in the Paris-inspired metropolis of Lumiose City. After the near-apocalyptic events that occurred the last time we were in the Kalos region, the people of Lumiose are undergoing an urban redevelopment plan to make it an accommodating home for both humans and wild Pokémon. This ranges from the cutest Pikachu to the most dangerous dragon, like Salamence. Certain areas of the city are designated “Wild Zones” where these untamed monsters live, and humans are free to explore them and battle the wildlife, or catch them, add them to their party, and have them take part in battles in the local competitive scene. That…doesn’t sound like the sort of equal co-existence Lumiose is touting. If the relationship between humans and Pokémon has only changed in terms of proximity, what is their shared city aspiring to that is actually moving the needle of progress?</span></p>

 <p><span>Interestingly enough, </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>seems unsatisfied with its own answer. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series has been gesturing at this issue for over a decade, with </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>(</span><a href="https://jakesteinberg.substack.com/p/pokemon-black-and-white-is-a-reddit"><span>ineloquently</span></a><span>) introducing a villainous team whose entire goal was to free these creatures from their spherical prisons, only to dial that all back by the end. The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-detective-pikachu-returns-live-action-movie-1850907630"><span>live-action film</span></a><span> take place in Ryme City, a place where Pokémon battling is outlawed, and there, these critters have day jobs like any other human. As a result, that subseries still offers the most revolutionary vision of a world where man and ‘mon walk side by side.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, the core verbs are still “catch” and “battle,” and the game has more questions than answers about what the dynamic between the human and Pokémon citizens of its new city even looks like. Lumiose’s redevelopment feels like a half-step toward a new ideal, but the game’s sense of hope for a brighter future in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world primarily manifests elsewhere, both in the story it tells and in the new ways it illustrates the bond between Pokémon and trainer when you’re in the thick of battle. Like most things it has going for it, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s vision of the Pokémon universe is experimental, testing the waters for a future it’s not quite ready to boldly walk into, held back by expectations of what it’s supposed to be. But what’s here still manages to solidify the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>subseries as the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games to watch, ones that appeal to the diehard lore enthusiasts, the casuals who are tired of repeating the same format, and the ones who have felt burned by the technical fumbles of recent years.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637722"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637722">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Welcome back to Lumiose City</b></h2> <p><span>When I first began my vacation to Lumiose City, I was greeted by Taunie, a sprightly leader of Team MZ, a group of youngsters operating out of a mostly unremarkable hotel to handle a much more remarkable problem. As the city is undergoing its redevelopment, some of the wild Pokémon who are migrating to the Wild Zones are undergoing a painful, forced Mega Evolution in the city streets. These usually temporary transformations are supposed to be activated by a trainer, but the wild Pokémon are undergoing Mega Evolution against their will and need to be pacified so they can return to their original state, as I’m told, these Rogue Mega Evolutions threaten the stability of the entire redevelopment plan.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The existence of that supposed stability, however, is debatable. As I weave through the scaffolding of unfinished construction work, hop across the rooftops, and insert myself into the citizens’ business with my Raichu by my side, almost all I hear from residents is dissatisfaction with the entire project. People love their partner Pokémon, but they’re unsure if Lumiose’s redevelopment plan is as righteous as it sounds on paper. Some folks are concerned about what happens if a powerful Pokémon gets out of the Wild Zones, and others find all the construction and noise of the late-night Z-A Royale tournament battles in the street an annoying distraction in their already hectic city life. Still others claim that sequestering these monsters into their own designated spaces isn’t actually solving anything. But no one seems to agree on how to truly integrate Pokémon and humanity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In its own way, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> underlines how the more you think about it, the more it becomes clear that this entire world is kind of fundamentally broken. Pokémon are friends, but they are dangerous. Humans want to co-exist with them as equals, but still get to capture them in Poké Balls. I don’t think this is some pretentious CinemaSins “gotcha” moment; I think it’s a sign of a world that has, as time has gone on, started to reckon with itself, but is still struggling to find the happy medium between the central monster-catching premise people know and love and the monster-loving world it wants to depict. I would have been floored if </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>had completely upended everything the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise has ever been, but I think I find its honest admission that it doesn’t know what the answer is to be just as compelling. Yeah, you can point to all the external factors of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> being a worldwide phenomenon of multimedia, merchandising, and moneymaking as the reason that nothing truly revolutionary comes out of Lumiose City, but given that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>will continue long after </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i></a><span>, I think I like the idea of watching a world slowly inching toward a new historical era. Progress is often slow, and maybe I’m intrigued by watching the series grapple with questions about how to move forward, rather than finding an easy answer and solving the universe’s problems in 30 hours.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637724">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It might not be quite as idyllic as its leaders want it to be, but Lumiose houses one of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s most memorable casts, full of characters who have a vested interest in helping it get there. Game Freak has always excelled at creating memorable trainers, but the series is typically so transient that most of the characters you meet only get a bit of time to shine before you head to the next town. </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> is set entirely in Lumiose, however, so as I work my way up the ranks of the Z-A Royale and save Rogue Mega Pokémon, I’m meeting what feels like a real assortment of unlikely friends bonded by proximity and a sense of home. Lumiose is still reeling from the events of </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, and after a near-cataclysmic event, you’d think most people would be looking to put some distance between themselves and the Prism Tower at the city’s center. And to be fair, several of them have. While there are a few returning characters from previous games, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s cast</span> <span>is mostly made up of fresh faces, with a lot of the old Kalos region staples having moved on and just being referenced with a wink in passing dialogue. Those who are still here from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>are usually a somber echo of who they once were, lingering because they have nowhere else to go. The people who are left cleaning up the wreckage do so because this city is their home, and they’ll stand by it even as dubious corporate interests flock to it.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I’m just a sentimental fool who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791"><span>only recently moved to a big city</span></a><span>, but seeing </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s cast of proud Lumiose residents come together to protect their city and its population hit me like a truck. One endgame sequence resonated with me so deeply, I just put my Joy-Cons down and stared at the ceiling, realizing that living in New York City for almost three years elicits a similar feeling of unity and camaraderie with my people here. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has always been about the power of friendship, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>but those bonds are also the foundation of community</span></a><span>, and </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s cast is one of the series’ best examples of it. Seeing folks in different industries, with different Pokémon training skills, and from different walks of life come together in service of the people is pretty inspiring, even when the individual stepping up is someone whose Pokémon’s attacks I’d been on the wrong side of hours prior. Lumiose and its citizens are still figuring things out, but when I see people like Corbeau, the pseudo mob boss of the city, working alongside local celebrities like the streamer Canari, in service of a place and of people they’ve grown to care for, I can’t help but believe they might find a way to make the city the best version of itself eventually.</span></p> <p><span>There’s been much debate about the size of Lumiose City </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>as an open-world video game space</span></a><span>, but I really don’t mind a walkable city that doesn’t require me to hop on a Pokémon steed to get from one side to the other. I’ve never been a player who finds the act of getting to a destination as interesting as whatever it is I’m actually going there to do, and </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has plenty to do between filling up your Pokédex with monsters in the Wild Zones, battling in the Z-A Royale, doing (sometimes menial) side quests, dressing up and taking cute pics with your Pokémon, and eavesdropping on some of the </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-secret-npc-dialogue-sinister/"><span>batshit things</span></a><span> citizens have to say. It’s a small map, sure, and as they often do, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans and haters alike are combing through it and noting the lack of environmental details. Windows </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trees-have-become-the-pokemon-fandoms-ultimate-brain-wo-1847541501"><span>are the new trees</span></a><span>, as these fixtures appear to be a texture plastered on the sides of buildings rather than actually rendered. Maybe it was helpful that I played the game on Switch 2 and had a smooth ride, but this is the first time I’ve played a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game since the jump to 3D that didn’t make me grimace at moments of ugliness. Yeah, it’s not going to win any awards for its graphics, and there are </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hessianlobo.bsky.social/post/3m3pp3pwfdc2e"><span>plenty of bugs that people will clip</span></a><span>, but it’s a far cry from the technical and visual mess of </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, and when it wants to flex, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s more visually striking moments really pop on Switch 2.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite my smooth ride, I’m seeing players talk about what sounds like a completely different game than I’ve experienced. To some, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> is a technical mess on the same scale that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-bugs-performance-paldea-nintendo-1849798801"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> were at their horrendous 2022 launch</span></a><span>, and yet, I’ve experienced almost none of the issues they’re reporting. Even with </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, my playthrough wasn’t buggy; it was just ugly and ran like shit. Video game bugs are a dice roll, as they’re often born of very specific scenarios that a developer might not see in testing, and if neither I nor a QA worker saw it, that doesn’t mean it’s not happening to someone else. But if I’m evaluating </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>based on my own experience playing it on Switch 2, all I can tell you is that I have no technical complaints. In fact, it ran so smoothly on the device that it was actually jarring after having spent over 160 hours enduring </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s jank.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000637726" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637726"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637726">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Get in the ring, trainer</b></h2> <p><span>That buttery smooth performance allowed me to get the most out of </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s new real-time battle system. While Lumiose is struggling to come up with a more groundbreaking solution to its city infrastructure, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s battle system is one of the most inspired changes Game Freak has ever put onto a cartridge. Rather than the turn-based battles fans know from previous games, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has you issuing commands to your Pokémon in real-time, cycling through cooldowns, focusing on positioning, and making quick, reflex-based plays on top of all the usual strategic elemental strategizing. As you tell your Pokémon what attacks to use, you’re also running around the battlefield alongside them. In a way, the co-existence </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> aspires to is best encapsulated in putting trainers in the thick of the scrap, and I loved how cooperative it felt to dodge and reposition as I quickly thought on my feet about what moves to use.</span></p>

 <p><span>This shift fundamentally changes the way you have to think about your Pokémon’s movesets and how they interact with others on the field. For example, I taught my Raichu attacks that would allow him to move throughout the battlefield at a quick pace. If an enemy got too close, I’d have him use Volt Switch, which would shock an opponent and allow him to quickly teleport to my side. I usually kept my distance from other trainers’ Pokémon, so this was a guaranteed escape for him if he got overwhelmed by an enemy. If I needed him to close the distance, I’d have him use Play Rough and slap enemies around, then use Volt Switch again to return to safety, then throw a long-range Thunderbolt at a foe for good measure. I created builds that were about more than just type coverage, but instead formed archetypes like Raichu’s “hit-and-run” attacker or my “keep away” Starmie, whose entire moveset kept it at a distance to accommodate its slow movement. The result is that fights are frantic, exhilarating, and sometimes over much sooner than I’d like them to be.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"We built this city on Mega Rocks and Roll."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Game Freak</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Monster-taming RPG with a new, real-time battle system.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Battle system is a challenging and rewarding spin on an old formula, memorable cast, compelling follow-up on the fallout from X and Y.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Focus on Mega Evolution makes party choices more restrictive, not all Mega designs are made equal, Lumiose is a more compelling stage for thematic exploration than a video game map for literal exploration.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date:</p>                 <p>October 16, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~30 hours to hit credits</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Where the system really shines is in the Rogue Mega Evolution fights, which are longer battles against one large, superpowered Mega Evolved Pokémon that usually requires multiple trainers to take down. These guys will often focus fire on you, so you’re constantly on the move, dodging powerful attacks while also trying to give orders to your Pokémon so they can dish out damage. That’s hard for most Pokémon, though, as Rogues have heightened defenses that are only easily broken by other Mega-evolved Pokémon. Unlike in </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, Mega Evolution is not a one-and-done mechanic you can only use once per battle. Instead, </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>makes Mega Evolution a gauge you fill up and deplete multiple times throughout a fight, allowing you to transform multiple Pokémon into these beefed-up forms in one battle.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Because of this, </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>encourages you to have multiple Mega Evolution-capable Pokémon in your team. The game has almost every Mega Evolution in its roster, with a few notable exceptions like legendary Pokémon Mewtwo and Rayquaza. With </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s addition of another couple dozen new forms, there are around 70 available to you throughout the game, but that does mean that a lot of the Pokémon end up either fairly useless or at least suboptimal in major boss fights. Non-Mega Pokémon are given the ability to use the Mega gauge to power up their moves to try and break through the ceiling, but it’s a far more limited resource compared to transforming one of your other monsters into a powerful version of themselves to make every attack they use stronger.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>My party ended up being five Mega Evolution Pokémon and my Raichu, who, yes, will get to join their ranks in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, but when I went several story battles without using him, it felt like my choices were more restricted than in previous games. There are a lot of Pokémon in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> who can’t pull off these transformations, and it means they all inherently fall behind. I appreciate how these mechanics gel in some truly spectacular fights, but it does come at the cost of some of that freedom to define your party. Unless you like banging your head against a hard wall until it breaks.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000637725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637725"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637725">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This focus on Mega Evolution also sticks in my craw when, frankly, a lot of the new Mega forms are duds. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>Mega Starmie’s human-like arms and legs</span></a><span> are an abomination, even though its quick movement does make up for Starmie’s biggest weakness. Mega Feraligatr’s toilet-seat-like helmet only looks interesting when it’s closed. And who even asked for a Mega Eelektross? There are some bangers, though. Hawlucha’s upgraded luchadore outfit makes him look like a real pro wrestler, Dragonite’s head wings help bridge the gap between it and its gorgeous pre-evolutions, and Falinks making all of its interlocked bodies into a sword-and-shield-wielding soldier is such a cool riff on its concept. Looking back at the original Megas from Generation VI, their designs were also filled with peaks and valleys, but maybe it’s </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>’s lopsided focus on the goofiest transformations Game Freak could think of that has me feeling colder. Hopefully, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s additions help diversify the roster. Mega Raichu X and Y are already a pretty promising start.</span></p> <p><span>I can’t talk about the battling without also diving into the Z-A Royale, the game’s substitute for the usual gym leader run in most games. This tournament has competitors fighting over a lettered ranking to determine the top-standing trainers in Lumiose. You start at Z and make your way to A at the top. Each ranking jump requires you to earn enough points by battling randos in the Battle Zones that pop up every night, then face a more powerful trainer who holds a letter ranking higher than you. Battle Zones are limited-time pop-ups that will disappear when the sun rises, so it’s an exciting challenge to have to accumulate enough points each night in hopes that you won’t have to come back tomorrow to make up the difference.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> helps you earn more points by pulling off specific challenges, such as using particular elemental attacks, ambushing enemies through stealth, or defeating foes with Mega Evolved Pokémon. I love taking part in these races against time that require me to use my whole team, rather than just one or two aces, and the progression system is immensely satisfying…at first. One of the most deflating moments in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> is when, for plot reasons, you skip several Z-A Royale rankings to jump right to rank F. This is because </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>only has five more major characters for you to face, and when all of these trainers are lined up next to each other for you to count, you realize there are about as many of them as there are gym leaders in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game. For all the posturing of its new ideas, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> can’t help but fall back on old reliables, and it’s a real bummer when you realize the entire progression system is mostly a facade.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637723"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637723">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>We’re now two </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games in, and it’s not entirely clear what it means for a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game to be part of this subseries. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>was set in the past and maintained turn-based battles, but had a fluid, action-based capture and traversal system. </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>moves the timeline forward and has much more restricted traversal, but also an excellent real-time battle system, unlike anything the series has done before. Perhaps the </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>moniker just ends up being a name that differentiates these games from the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games everyone expects. They’re experimental, show us new sides of places we’ve already been to before, and dive deep into the world in a way the usual Pokémon League run doesn’t typically allow. </span></p> <p><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>is a game of trying new things and hoping for the best. Not everyone agrees on what the best course of action is, but nevertheless, Lumiose City has to move forward and carve out a future for itself, much like the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise has been trying to do in recent years. It has started abandoning long-held traditions, both in the games and elsewhere, in the hopes that it can be something greater than </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-van-gogh-go-remote-raids-1851128900"><span>the corporate machine has forced it to be for so long</span></a><span>. Maybe not every change is going to work for everyone, and it will take time for a series that was stuck in its ways for so long to find its footing. But at least the people of Lumiose are trying, and so is Game Freak.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Modern homes never seem to have enough outlets and dragging around multiple chargers for your laptop, phone, and tablet turns every trip into a cable management nightmare. The Anker 735 charger solves this frustration by <strong>consolidating everything into a single 65-watt, three-port wall charger</strong> that’s compact enough to toss in your bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">just dropped it to an all-time low of $25 (down from $39)</a>, and at this price, you can finally retire that collection of mismatched charging bricks cluttering your nightstand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Three Ports and 65 Watts Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The 65-watt output makes the difference because it’s the optimal level for powering current laptops full-speed. A MacBook Pro 13-inch takes just 61 watts for best-possible charging speed and this charger provides it with headroom to go around when you’re only using a single outlet. Most cell phone chargers only go 20 watts and lower-end multi-port chargers frequently only go 30-45 total watts which makes you decide between <strong>charging your laptop fast and powering other devices.</strong></p>
<p>When you plug three devices at once, the <strong>power distribution system of the charger automatically distributes wattage intelligently</strong> according to the requirement of each device. Plug in your laptop, smartphone, and tablet, and the charger automatically varies the output of each port, favoring the device capable of accepting the highest power but still making the rest charge at decent rates.</p>



<p>Addition of PPS support is just one of the technical features that significantly boosts charging efficiency and compatibility. PPS enables the charger to exchange information directly with your device and make real-time adjustments to voltage as opposed to fixed voltage steps. This translates into fewer heat emissions, higher charging speeds and better long-term battery life. Devices such as Galaxy smartphones and the latest iPhones fully benefit from PPS to reach their claimed fast-charging speeds, and you would be limited to lower charging rates even with the higher-wattage charger without it.</p>
<p>GaN II technology is what allows this <strong>charger to pack 65 watts into a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case</strong>. Traditional silicon-based chargers require much larger components to handle high wattage without overheating. Gallium nitride operates at higher frequencies and temperatures with better efficiency, meaning the components can be smaller and packed more densely without thermal issues. The second generation of GaN technology in this charger improves upon the original by increasing operating frequency by 100%.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration <strong>includes two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> and covers both newer and legacy devices. Most modern laptops, tablets, and phones use USB-C, but plenty of accessories like wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and older devices still rely on USB-A. Having that USB-A port available means you don’t need to carry adapters or separate chargers for those holdout devices that haven’t made the USB-C transition yet.</p>
<p>At $25, this charger is cheaper than purchasing two standard phone chargers individually, but it replaces your laptop charger, phone charger, and tablet charger with the same device.</p>

              <p>Gaming with a headset is my preferred way to play. Sure, when playing in a squad where communication is key you’re going to want to have a headset. Though even when I’m hitting solo queues or playing through a single player game, I’m usually reaching for my headphones. The more intimate audio allows me to immerse myself more easily into the game, plus you can get a better sense of your in-game surroundings than when using your TV’s built-in speakers. You can even get yourself a solid pair without breaking the bank. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4921/">Amazon happens to have the Acer wireless gaming headsets for PlayStation consoles, PC, and Nintendo Switch discounted by nearly 50% off for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>These wireless gaming headphones with mic come in a handful of colors too. Most of the options are predominately black with variations in their highlight color. You can get the headset in black with an accent of either red, pink, blue, green, or orange. Additionally, there is an option for solid pink and and option for solid white. The discounts vary a little bit between the different color options, but none of them are more expensive than $32 during this sale. The lowest price right now is for the black with the red accent, currently listed at $27. They’re normally sitting at $50 so that’s quite the jump down.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4921/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Connect Multiple Ways</h2>
<p>The Acer wireless gaming headset gives you a few options for how to connect to your games audio. The headset can be paired to your console or PC over Bluetooth, or you can plug in the USB-A dongle which pairs with your headset over 2.4GHz wireless. Then, of course, we’ve got ol’ reliable — the AUX cord.</p>
<p>The headset is able to deliver exceptional sound over its 50mm drivers. You’ll hear your teammates and have them hear you with a a low latency of 20ms.</p>



<p>The earpads and head bar are designed for all day comfort so you can keep them on as you work or game without even noticing they are there. They’re designed with a soft leather texture and memory foam cushioning which also helps with soundproofing.</p>
<p>You’ll be able to listen all day too and then some. T<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4921/">he Acer wireless gaming headset has a battery life that will take you up to 100 hours of game time (or 100 hours of music time).</a> When battery is approaching low levels of under 3%, it will play a voice alert so you can find a plug or make accommodations before they die on you. When you do find them without charge, you can bring them back up to full in around four to six hours.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Remedy Entertainment’s CEO is stepping down with immediate effect, having held the position since August 2016. </p>



<p>Things have not been looking very good for Remedy recently, primarily due to the FBC: Firebreak’s lacklustre launch. Remedy’s now former CEO provided a statement on this topic a little over a week ago, revealing that the game<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-remedy-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has not met internal sales targets</a>. Now, the latest update from the company shows that the CEO is stepping down. </p>







<p>According to a new <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Remedy Entertainment, Tero Virtala, the company’s CEO, and the board of directors have mutually decided that Virtala will step down from his position “with immediate effect.” The search process for a new CEO will start immediately, and “Virtala will continue at the service of the company during an agreed transition period to support the handover of CEO duties.”</p>



<p>A new interim CEO has been appointed from Remedy’s Board of Directors. Markus Mäki, one of the founders of the company, a member of the board since 1995, and the Chairman of the Board, will be appointed as the interim CEO, effective as of October 22, 2025. Mäki is also “a member of the company’s core management team responsible for production.” Mäki will step down as Chairman of the Board, and Henri Österlund will take his place. </p>



<p><strong>Here’s what Remedy’s Interim CEO, Markus Mäki, had to say about Tero Virtala: </strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.”</p>
</blockquote>

There are outposts to pillage, ruins to explore, giant worms to admire, and suspiciously large amounts of leather clothing to wonder about. Oh, and don’t forget that mysterious vault door… What could be behind it?

        <p>The jewel in the crown of these wreckages is the Fireship Arcadia, the fate of which you will learn as you venture through Breach.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lumo-2</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-lumo-2-switch-a-delightful-celebration-of-british-retro-gaming.1331404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Sitting down to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumo_2">Lumo 2</a>, as a gamer of a certain vintage, I fully expected to be treated to a few touching moments as developer Triple Eh? transported me back to the sweet innocence (and unbelievable stupidity) of my gaming childhood. A few nostalgia button pushes and I'd be happy enough. Sit that alongside some decent gameplay, and we could be onto a winner.</p>
<p>Just as was the case in 2016's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lumo">Lumo</a>, the point here is to give you short bursts of action-styles from classic adventures resurrected from the depths of computer game history. You know the sorts of things; in the first Lumo you had stuff like <strong>Knight Lore</strong>, <strong>Equinox</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/head_over_heels">Head Over Heels</a>, whilst this sequel serves up...well...to list them all would be spoiling things, but let's just saying kicking off your game with a delightfully spot-on homage to Dennis Caswell's 1984 classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/c64/impossible_mission">Impossible Mission</a>, is one way to get me fully onboard <em>very</em> quickly.</p>
<p>As soon as I started tumbling (awkwardly slowly) over robotic enemies and waiting impatiently for trundling lifts to move up and down, I knew I was in dream town. And I'm not even being sarcastic. This plays exactly how I remember the game it's aping, and whilst Lumo 2 does have some presentation issues on Switch - it's a little blurry at times - the selection of game tributes it presents, as your huge-hatted protagonist bounds through and snaps up a series of satisfyingly tricky collectibles, are all on-point mechanically. Hooray!</p>
<p>Depending on who you are, though, it may be sort of a half-hooray. The homages are <em>so</em> on-point that they're going to alienate some by their very nature. They're tough, and this isometric malarkey is no joke — believe me, I fought in the original Isometric Wars. Lumo 2, just as was the case with the first, sticks to all the retro trappings. Your avatar is slow and cumbersome; that's intentional. Deaths come thick and fast, sometimes because of the camera angle being tricky to judge at points; that's also meant to be the case.</p>
<p>I think it's great, but you see the potential issue! It's not a game for everyone, by any means. You'll also be losing out by not getting all the references, cameos, little nods and jokes along the way as you play through a generous helping of around 100 retro-inspired levels.</p>
<p>However, if, like me, you love a bit of the rough and tumble of proper old-school isometric stuff; stuff like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/marble_madness">Marble Madness</a> or <strong>Ant Attack</strong>, whilst also getting blasted with the occasional side-scrolling/3D surprise, and with plenty of tricky rubber duckie collectibles and in-game achievements to tick off as you go, I'd say Lumo 2 is a return that gives us more of the very-satisfying same. Oh, and you can play it Welsh, so bonus points all round!</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lumo 2, just like its predecessor, does a great job of reintroducing players to a whole bunch of retro delights from the 1980s, and in small enough servings that they don't outstay their welcome. There's an impressive array of tricky isometric levels to get stuck into besting here, plenty of collectibles and achievements to tick off, some nice side-scrolling surprises along the way, and a general retro-british vibe that you can't help but love infusing the entire thing. Whilst it may not meaningfully evolve its predecessor, Lumo 2 is yet more of the good stuff.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Less than two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-rebuilds-ship-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyagers update</a>, Hello Games is launching BREACH, a new free update for No Man's Sky. The British indie developer said Voyagers was a huge success, with the highest player numbers ever recorded in the game. </p>



<p>Naturally, they hope to continue this streak with BREACH, which introduces space wrecks for players to explore. This allows them to experience the thrill of spacewalking in No Man's Sky. Salvaging these wrecks will unlock a wide range of new ship-building parts, which fans have regularly requested for some time. Hello Games also improved and expanded the ship-building feature after seeing players spend so much time designing their dream ships in the game's workshop.</p>



<p>BREACH also adds a new Expedition where players traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and discover what happened to a mysterious wreck. To salvage from the wreckage of the ill-fated ship and add unique parts and modules to your ship-building workshop, they will have no choice but to voyage to the very edge of space.</p>



<p>Such space shipwrecks have begun to appear throughout the far reaches of space, and the bravest Travellers who are prepared to scavenge from them will be rewarded with new parts, including new vertical and structural ones, which will enable the creation of colossal ships, as well as rare, glowing, Atlas-themed wings, engines, and features.</p>



<p>The BREACH Expedition also brings No Man's Sky players together to explore strange, purple-star solar systems. The developers reckon the planets in these systems are particularly enjoyable to explore due to their deep oceans, incredible terrain, and volatile gas giants. The Expedition also features a spooky story, and it's the perfect time for it with Halloween coming up next week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-1800w-anker-power-station-with-200w-solar-panel-drops-50-off-say-goodbye-to-winter-outages-2000638147</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1800w-anker-power-station-with-200w-solar-panel-drops-50-off-say-goodbye-to-winter-outages.1331395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms, ice buildup and grid overload during cold snaps can knock out power for hours or even days and leave you scrambling for ways to keep essential devices running. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> portable power station bundled with a 200W solar panel tackles this exact problem and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4924/">Amazon just slashed it to an all-time low of $671, down from $1,299)</a>. This combo gives you 1,056 watt-hours of backup capacity with the <strong>ability to recharge from the sun</strong>, which means you can keep your furnace controls, internet router, medical devices or space heaters running during an outage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4924/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Solution During Wintertime Disasters</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,800-watt continuous power through SurgePad technology</strong> (which peaks to 2,400 watts) covers almost all appliances you would have to power through the duration of a blackout. That surge ability accommodates power startup demands of refrigerators or battery-powered heaters which frequently have 2-3 times their operating wattage for 1-2 seconds the moment they are switched on.</p>
<p>The 1,056 watt-hour LiFePO4 battery has a rating of well over 3,000 charge cycles before the battery falls to 80% capacity. In practical terms, if you discharge and charge this station once each week, you’ll have spirited performance well into the 10-year term. LiFePO4 chemistry has far better stability than typical lithium-ion, owing to increased cold-temperature handling and far lower propensity toward thermal runaway.</p>



<p>UltraFast mode charges the station to 80% capacity in 43 minutes and <strong>full power in 58 minutes</strong> on the connection of AC power and by the activation of the Anker app. That gives you the ability to recharge fast whenever there are fleeting interludes of power availability and the next blackout approaches. Normal power stations take 6-8 hours to be fully charged, and this does not help much where the grid power remains unstable.</p>
<p>This <strong>200W solar panel included makes this truly an off-grid solution</strong>: Monocrystalline cells of 23% efficiency draw significantly more power from ambient sun than older polycrystalline panels, which rarely achieve higher than 15-17% efficiency. You have four adjustable pitch angles of 30, 40, 50, and 80 degrees, allowing you to dial in the best position relative to the sun’s arc throughout the day and throughout the seasons.</p>



<p><strong>IP67 weatherproof grading</strong> of the panel means it won’t fail because of snow, rain, or dust. You’ll be able to leave it outdoors even for charging periods should the weather shift, but you’ll still have to cover the power station unit itself, which lacks a rating for direct exposure.</p>
<p>With <strong>11 total ports including six AC outlets</strong>, you can run multiple devices simultaneously without needing power strips or prioritizing what stays on. During a winter outage, this means keeping your router and modem online for communication, charging phones and laptops, running a CPAP machine overnight and powering a small space heater in one room, all from the same unit. The variety of ports <strong>(AC, USB-A, USB-C, car outlet)</strong> accommodates everything from full-size appliances down to small electronics without adapters.</p>
<p>At $671 for both the power station and solar panel, you’re looking at less than half the original $1,299 price. Comparable systems with similar capacity and solar charging capability typically run $900-1,200 even on sale.</p>

<p>Kenny Sun’s genius Ball X Pit is a fresh take on the roguelike genre with block-busting and ball-bouncing mechanics. Funnily enough, the Ball X Pit trophy list is sure to have you bouncing from wall to wall to clear out its exhausting list of accomplishments.</p>



<p>Each game’s trophy list ranges from story-related trophies to wacky out out-there tasks you’d never even think to do. We’d argue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-reaches-a-major-sales-milestone-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>‘s trophy list is a long but simple one—you need to grind more than if you played every Tony Hawk’s game back to back.</p>



<p>It’s to be expected with roguelikes, so let’s take a deeper dive into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>‘s trophy list and achievements.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-ball-x-pit-trophies-amp-achievements">All Ball X Pit Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>

<p>Adjust your eyes when reading this list, as the onslaught of caps might make your eyes sore. But once you start dissecting the entire Ball X Pit trophy list, you’ll see the achievements and trophies are very attainable.</p>



<p>But completing all areas with different characters and collecting resources for the game’s construction aspect is likely to set you back a lot of hours.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ballxpit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ball X Pit</a> trophy list in full.</p>

<p>The latest United States (US) video game hardware sales data for September 2025 has been released, and the Nintendo Switch 2 continues its impressive run since launch.</p>



<p>According to industry firm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmuvpws25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, the Switch 2 has led the hardware sales to jump 24% to $324 million year over year in September. In terms of year-to-date numbers, hardware sales are up 20% to $3.18 billion.</p>



<p>The continued success of the Switch 2 should come as no surprise. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-production-pipeline-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> has even suggested that Nintendo has requested an increase in console production to 25 million units over the next six months. </p>



<p>The next official update on Switch 2 unit sales is expected to come during the company’s upcoming earnings call on November 4.</p>



<p>Away from Nintendo, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) maintained its second spot in terms of both units and dollars sold. The Xbox Series, as expected, finished third. Those systems, however, have seen “double-digit year-on-year percentage declines”.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, those fell by 10% year-over-year to $197 million. Year to date has sales are down 6% to $1.83 billion. Looking at specific hardware, the midnight black PS5 DualSense wireless controller was the best-selling accessory for September, while the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro remains the best-selling accessory for the year. </p>

                <p>A veteran high-ranking game developer has sounded off on the use of artificial intelligence systems in gaming, saying developers who fail to adopt the technology run the risk of selling themselves short. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN</a>, former Sony Santa Monica director of product development Meghan Morgan Juinio said AI is a "tool" and "something that will augment" human creators, not replace them.</p><p>"At least for right now, that's how I see it. It's going to evolve whether you're on board with it or not, so I want to be at the forefront of helping to guide how that goes and how we use it," Juinio said.</p><p>She added: "I think if we don't embrace it, I think we're selling ourselves short."</p><p>Juinio went on to say that developers in the video game industry have been using forms of generative AI for decades already, singling out the SpeedTree tool that was used all the way back in 2006 to help populate the foliage in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Developers have used procedurally generated and handcrafted assets in development processes for a long time already and generative AI could be the next evolution of that, she said.</p><p>Just because a developer can use generative AI doesn't necessarily mean they should, however, Juinio said.</p><p>"I think as leaders in the video game industry it is on us to figure out not just <em>can </em>we do it with AI, but <em>should </em>we? And it's a case-by-case type of decision making process and what's true for game X might not be true next year for game Y," she explained.</p><p>Finally, Juinio said games today absolutely need human developers to form the ideas of a given project, mentioning that God of War's story is a "human story that is based on human experiences."</p><p>Juinio is not the only prominent game developer to believe that adopting AI can help the video game industry. Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p>

                <p>With the PS5 turning five years old in November, discussion about its successor has begun to intensify. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/">Sony and AMD recently spoke about new technological breakthroughs</a> that it was pioneering, and former SIE Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">rumored PS6</a> and how Sony needs to do more than just chase graphics for its next-generation console.</p><p>Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/bs7KLs8krho?t=4033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Yoshida explained how the graphical capabilities of current-gen hardware were starting to hit a wall and that the company needs to start thinking beyond pure graphical power to attract a wide audience. "PlayStation--in my mind--they can't do the same thing they have been doing, increasing the graphics power and providing the high-end experiences," Yoshida said. "They might just do that, but still, that feels like a niche audience right now."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs7KLs8krho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bs7KLs8krho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Yoshida doesn't know what he'd do to make the PS6 stand out if he were still at PlayStation, he did stress that he was confident that the current leadership of the company--led by CEO Hideaki Nishino--is capable of bringing something "disruptive" to the industry, thanks to them being relatively young in comparison to the previous management generation.</p><p>What the proposed PS6 will eventually look like remains to be seen, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/" data-ref-id="1100-6534538">but it has been reported that Sony is considering</a> a detachable disc drive option for it, similar to the one that can be attached to the current PS5 Pro Digital Edition and PS5 Pro consoles. One area where Sony is also looking to keep things old school is the "local execution" of games that comes from a physical disc or having the software for it installed on the SSD. Sony says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">will continue to rely on hardware over cloud technology</a> in this area of console design.</p><p>Sony's rival, Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/">is banking on a powerful next-generation Xbox</a> to win fans over, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/">Xbox President Sarah Bond teased</a> a "high-end curated experience" for users.</p>

            <p>It's been a big old year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, but developer Hello Games isn't done yet. Today brings space wreck salvaging and more to the exploratory space sim as part of its new Breach update.</p>
<p>Breach builds upon the space-walking feature introduced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">August's massive Voyagers update</a>, introducing huge wrecks adrift among the stars for players to orbit in search of valuable salvage. In turn, salvage is used to unlock a "huge array" of new ship building components - including vertical and structural elements, and rare, glowing Atlas-themed parts - which arrive alongside improved and expanded ship building options.</p>
<p>Breach also marks the start of a brand-new limited-time Expedition, featuring a variety of new cosmetic rewards. This time, players are set loose in an abandoned universe, full of rare purple-star solar systems, in search of a mysterious wreck. Expect gas giants, ocean planets, and a spooky, seasonally appropriate story. You'll find <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">full patch notes</a> on Hello Games' website.</p>

<p>All this follows a 2025 that's brought some major additions to No Man's Sky, including those aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-storm-ravaged-gas-giants-and-trillions-of-new-planets-in-another-major-overhaul">purple-star systems</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-you-dig-for-prehistoric-bones-and-assemble-them-into-weird-skeletal-displays">palaeontology</a>, a <a href="https://eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-getting-a-free-switch-2-launch-day-update-adding-fancier-visuals-multiplayer-and-more">massive Switch 2 release</a>, and customisable Corvette ships - the latter update helping propel the space sim to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-boss-so-happy-as-sim-celebrates-highest-steam-player-count-since-launch-and-fans-go-wild-with-new-ship-customisation">highest Steam player count since launch</a>.</p><p>"It has been a crazy year for the No Man's Sky team and we're so proud and pleased to be able to continue working on this game we all love so much nine years after launch," Hello Games's boss Sean Murray said as part of today's Breach announcement. "Seeing so many folks enjoying Voyagers has really inspired us, and we can't wait for you to see what we have in store in future."</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/random-pokemon-legends-z-a-player-uses-3d-printer-to-grind-for-a-shiny-charm</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've seen countless methods over the years in which players have made wild contraptions to help grind battles and progression, and this latest from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorRex">Professor Rex</a> is pretty elaborate.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-player-grinds-shiny-charms-1000-battle-requirement-using-3d-printer-contraption/">Automaton</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> players will need to complete 1,000 battles as part of the requirements for the coveted Shiny Charm. So, rather than just play the game like normal, Professor Rex has instead utilised a 3D printer to complete the battles automatically.</p>
<p>So essentially, they've got a controller with 'A' set to Turbo, meaning holding it down will result in continuous inputs. This is placed in a makeshift holder to keep the button pressed down, while a Prusa Mach 4 3D printer is able to periodically press the 'ZL' button.</p>
<p>This translates into the game pretty well, allowing the protagonist to immediately lock-on to enemy Pokémon with 'ZL' while attacking automatically with 'A'.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea..? Well, look, it's a <em>clever</em> idea, at least. We're not altogether convinced that it's the best use of someone's time, though. We understand the lure of shiny Pokémon, but goodness, you're potentially missing out on so much gameplay if you just let a machine do the job for you.</p>
<p>Different strokes though, eh?</p>
