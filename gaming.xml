<p>February? Say it ain't so!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="861b0e4e49fc1"><a title="Nintendo Direct 9.12.2025 screenshot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/861b0e4e49fc1/nintendo-direct-9-12-2025-screenshot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>New year, new Nintendo Direct rumours — Nintendo usually likes to hold a big presentation every February, and it appears that it's continuing that trend in 2026, as a proper Nintendo Direct (not focused on the <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a>) could be coming as soon as next week.</p>
<p>This rumour comes from prominent podcaster and YouTuber Nate the Hate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">on his podcast</a> (via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qnigei/natethehate_the_first_nintendo_direct_of_the_year/">GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit</a>), who says he has heard from his sources that a Nintendo Direct will be airing "in the opening week of February", potentially <strong>Thursday 5th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited, Nate does stress that he hasn't been able to confirm this with his best sources, but given Nintendo's history, we'd be extremely surprised if we didn't get a Direct --either a big one or a Partner Showcase — sometime next month.</p>
<p>We will say as we always do with stories like this, take this with a pinch of salt. Nothing is official until Nintendo says anything, so for now, we can just speculate on <em>what</em> exactly Nintendo might bring to the table.</p>

<p>2025 was obviously an outlier in terms of February Directs as the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal came in January. 2024's big February showcase was actually a Partner Direct. Prior to last year, the Japanese gaming giant hasn't missed a February since 2018.</p>
<p>Of course, we're getting some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-announced-for-thursday-29th-january">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream later this week</a> thanks to a specific Direct, but Nintendo has a busy slate for 2026. Y<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">oshi and the Mysterious Book</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> are just some of the titles we know about.</p>
<p>We've also got indies such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a> awaiting brand new release dates after they were delayed out of 2026. Plus, there may well be a bunch of third-party port announcements for Switch 2 on the horizon. We'll see!</p>

It’s an all-AMD, liquid-cooled machine built into Asus’ ROG GM700 case, and includes the Ryzen 9 9950X3D — the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/626820/amd-ryzen-9-9950x3d-review-cpu-processor-benchmark-test">best desktop processor of 2025</a> — along with AMD’s Radeon 9070 XT graphics card (also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">very good</a>!), 32GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, plus a wired keyboard and mouse. Buying each of these components piecemeal would likely send you sailing over the $2,000 mark, with the CPU and GPU accounting for well over half the cost.</p><p>Obviously, two grand is still a lot of money, but I’ve compared prices for other configurations and it seems like the best value by a long shot.

The game costs $44.99 (usually $59.99), and if you have a Switch 2 and want the system-exclusive features that boost performance and add Joy-Con mouse controls for home decorating, that upgrade will cost you just $4.99 extra via the eShop. Woot will ship the international version and it might have Spanish on the packaging.

For context, Ubisoft has </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-passed-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills-and-most-importantly-38-million-animals-petted-which-to-ubisoft-has-delivered-on-expectations/"><span>previously stated</span></a><span> that </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></i><span> “performed within expectations,” and, as of July 2025, had amassed over 5 million players.</span></p>

 <p>Ever since <em>Shadows</em> dared include an African samurai as one of its two protagonists, it’s been the target of anti-woke attacks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">including from Elon Musk</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span>(who was later ratio’d by whoever runs the official </span></a><a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904648274675445938?s=20"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span> X account)</span></a><span>.</span>&nbsp;Some of those same people have now been saying the company’s financial fallout vindicates their attacks on diversity and inclusion in gaming.</p> <p><span>Shimoda, who worked for the publisher from 2021 to 2024, stated “unequivocally” that Ubisoft’s DEI initiatives “didn’t wield that much influence” and were, in fact, “actually beneficial” in helping them expand in South America and the Middle Eastern territories.</span></p>

 <p><span>His comments regarding Ubisoft’s “excessively low turnover rate” and “lack of senior/lead-level staff with experience” imply that Shimoda lays the blame squarely at the feet of the publisher’s upper management, especially when paired with his “Big Business Syndrome” remark.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.omron.com/global/en/about/corporate/history/founder/06/"><span>Big Business Syndrome</span></a><span> is a term coined by Kazuma Tateisi, former president of Japanese electronic manufacturer OMRON, in 1987. In short, Tateisi believed that the profits of several prominent Japanese companies in the 80s began to fall once their leaders became too obsessed with maintaining the status quo. When stepping down as president in 1987, Tateisi warned OMRON employees that refusing to pursue the same riskier strategies that led to their initial success, yet continuing to expand in the process, would lead to them suffering the same fate as their contemporaries.</span></p> <p><span>Shimoda is arguing that Ubisoft has become a victim of the same mentality. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>On January 21</span></a><span>, the publisher announced a painful shakeup that included the cancellation of “4 unannounced titles, including 3 new IP’s” and the formation of “Five Creative Houses” that will solely focus on developing games for their pre-existing IPs. But some current employees feel like this latest reset is just history repeating itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/</link>
            <guid>1416388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Headwinds, the first major ARC Raiders update of 2026, is set to drop tomorrow. It’ll introduce a new matchmaking option, a fresh player project, some hot new cosmetics, <strong>and </strong>probably a few new quests. Earlier today, the trailer for that update was ‘leaked’ early, with a Japanese Embark Studios social profile posting the short video ahead of whatever the intended drop time was.</p>



<p>The trailer was taken down, but not before users managed to capture the footage and circulate it on social media. Above all else, it reveals that a bizarre new ‘solos vs squads’ matchmaking option is coming into effect with Headwinds.</p>







<h2 id="h-headwinds-will-be-here-in-24-hours">Headwinds Will Be Here in 24 Hours</h2>



<p>Headwinds is an all-new update coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title suffered a little over the festive break with stagnation and some issues with cheaters and exploits, but now it’s all systems go. The team recently published a roadmap that covers four months of content, including tomorrow’s Headwinds update.</p>



<p>We’re not getting a new ARC Raiders map or large-scale enemy until <strong>April</strong>, but there’s still plenty on the way.</p>



<p>Per the ‘leaked’ trailer, we know that Headwinds is set to include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solos vs Squads matchmaking mechanics</li>



<li>New map condition – Sandstorm</li>



<li>Project: ARC Trophy Display</li>



<li>New cosmetics: The Sandwalker set</li>
</ul>



<p>The first item on the list was previously known as the ‘LVL 40+ Matchmaking Option’, which left players wondering what that might look like. Nobody predicted it would be a solos vs squads mode, but it’s certainly a place for the most capable players to strut their stuff.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, we can imagine that Sandstorm will be an offensive map condition that forces players indoors, much like Cold Snap did, while the Sandwalker set will be themed very much <strong>on </strong>that condition.</p>



<p>The ARC Trophy Display project will give players something to aim for over the next few weeks. It’s likely a construct that pops up in your Raider Den that gives you the option to display literal trophies from the ARC enemies you slay outside Speranza.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has teased a selection of big reveals starting the 29th January, which will cover almost its entire repertoire of games, including World of Warcraft, Diablo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>In a short but fancy video laden with nostalgic props and retro PC set-ups, a history of big Blizzard moments are panned over. The purpose being to celebrate 35 years of Blizzard history, with four days dedicated to the next chapter of select games.</p>

<p>In the description of the teaser we can see the following game-specific showcases:</p>
<ul>
<li>World of Warcraft: 29th January 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm GMT / 6pm CEST</li>
<li>Overwatch: 4th February 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CEST</li>
<li>Hearthstone: 9th February 9:30am PT / 12:30pm ET / 5:30pm GMT / 6:30pm CEST</li>
<li>Diablo: 11th February 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CEST</li>
</ul>
<p>What's interesting is the teaser itself ends with a selection of logos placed under the words' Blizzard 35', including games not included in that list. This includes the logos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heroes-of-the-storm">Heroes of the Storm</a>, and Starcraft.</p>
<p>Starcraft itself is an interested absence from the list of showcase days, especially given the recent reports of <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661">an in-development Starcraft shooter</a>. However, how far through development this project is, or if it's even made it past the R&amp;D stage, has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>It's certainly a big year for Blizzard in terms of releases and major updates. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft is getting its Midnight expansion soon</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> Lord of Hatred update. But who knows? Maybe even bigger surprises are around the corner. World of Warcraft: Classic fans have been begging for an expanded version of the original MMO, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/did-blizzard-just-drop-another-hint-for-classic-379737">which is an idea the developers haven't crossed out</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The video game industry is still reeling from last week, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">it would undergo a <strong>"<em>major reset,"</em></strong></a> which saw the entire company get restructured into five new 'Creative Houses.' The reset created <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">new leadership roles </a>that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">pushed out Ubisoft veterans</a>, cancelled six projects (including the <strong>Sands of Time Remake</strong>), delayed seven more projects, and created four new ones - while also looking <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">to more layoffs and a return-to-office mandate</a> to try and help execute this plan.</p>



<p>Not only did this reset see the company's share price drop to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">its lowest point since <strong>2011 </strong>and mark a <strong>95% loss of total value</strong> <strong>in the last eight years</strong></a>, but it also sent employee morale to new lows and anger to new heights. French publication <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2026/01/23/how-ubisoft-the-french-video-game-giant-reached-breaking-point-after-years-of-turmoil_6749735_13.html">Le Monde</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) reports that the French video games industry union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong> has already organized <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/solinfonat.bsky.social/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z">a strike that took place this past Thursday, January 22, 2026,</a> outside of <strong>Ubisoft Paris</strong> as an "<em>initial answer to the absurdity of management's decisions.</em>"</p>



<p>According to Le Monde, the protest was attended by ten people, which directly called out Ubisoft's chief executive officer, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong><em>, </em>with the union bringing three core demands to this initial demonstration. An end to the cost-cutting program, maintaining and extending remote work policies, and "<em>decent pay raises</em>." In a quote given to GI.Biz from Solidaires Informatique union representative at Ubisoft Paris, <strong>Marc Rutschlé</strong>, he describes the internal state of Ubisoft as one where "<em><strong>anger and despair</strong></em><strong>"</strong> are <strong>"</strong><em><strong>reigning supreme</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>"<em>At this state, it seems clear to us that Yves Guillemot has no knowledge or understanding of his company or its employees</em>," said Rutschlé. "<em>The company is continuing its cost reduction and layoff plan. Our teams are already working under pressure, often understaffed. After several years without pay rises (or very small increases), we understand that once again, employees will not receive a raise this year. At the same time, the reorganization is creating a number of high-level positions with excessive salaries</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>From our union's point of view, this forced reversal is a disguised redundancy plan, aimed at pushing employees outside the company. The atmosphere within the studio is particularly deplorable, with anger and despair reigning supreme. Staff representatives have witnessed several breakdowns in tears; some colleagues have made suicidal comments. If Guillemot wanted to make people miserable, he couldn't have done better</em>."</p>



<p>In addition to this report, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/2014743495135596775">Insider-Gaming</a> adds that the internal communication channels in Ubisoft are "<em>full of employees shaming upper management and asking for change.</em>" Some have even <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/brucelowmtl_a-quick-update-and-some-clarification-the-activity-7420215251842797568-NxZW?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">taken to LinkedIn to make it publicly clear they are looking for other opportunities</a>, despite not having been laid off.</p>



<p>It's unclear how Ubisoft will weather this storm, or if it can weather it at all. Losing 95% of your company's total value in eight years is a pretty damning mark on the company's leadership, <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-and-ubisoft-respond-to-allegations-of-mistreament-and-misconduct/">not to mention the allegations of misconduct at Ubisoft</a> that reportedly went unchecked by leadership, and the countless layoffs that have taken place in that time.</p>



<p>If something doesn't change within the company's leadership, the global publisher and developer that we've known for over two decades might not make it another eight years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-leon-infection-dead-dies-theory-2000663084</link>
            <guid>1416331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">played about three hours of </a></span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270">Resident Evil Requiem</a> </span></i><span>earlier this month, and I could not shake the feeling that I know where the rest of the game is going to go when it launches next month. Though I have not seen enough of the ninth entry in Capcom’s long-running horror series to be sure, I’ve got a theory, and it’s one that some fans have independently come to as well after combing through the trailers. There’s nothing in the time I played that outright confirms this is the way things are going to go, but there are clues that I’ve started latching onto. If you don’t want your experience of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> to be influenced even by speculation about where the story </span><i><span>might </span></i><span>go, turn back now.</span></p>  <p><span>I think Leon Scott Kennedy, one of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s long-time protagonists, is going to be dead by the end of </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>. Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Capcom would never kill one of </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>’s recurring leads.” And yeah, we are in uncharted territory. Take my hand and follow me down this dark passageway toward the worst-case scenario.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In my time playing </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, I learned something that astute fans have already picked up on: Leon has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ResidentEvilCapcom/comments/1pmsq1z/leon_is_100_infected_in_this_game_leon_in_this/"><span>some kind of deadly infection</span></a><span>. He’s looking for a cure, which is why he ends up in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center where his </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> co-lead Grace Ashcroft has been taken. The infection manifests in a gnarly wound on his neck, but whatever’s going on, he still has time before he turns. How much time? That’s unclear right now. But that infection is only half the reason I think Leon is going to be pushing daisies by the end of </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The game’s name, </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>, has a few different meanings, both in and out of the context of the game. A requiem, </span><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/requiem"><span>as the dictionary describes it</span></a><span>, is a “mass for the dead,” or some kind of musical tribute to the dead. Yes, this could be in reference to Grace’s mother Alyssa Ashcroft, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547"><span>whose death is an inciting incident</span></a><span> in the story, but it also has a very specific meaning attached to it that links Leon and Grace. Early on in the section I played, Leon and Grace meet, and the ex-Raccoon City cop gives Grace a powerful revolver named Requiem. Though I only had one bullet for it in Grace’s resource-scarce segment, it did blow a hole right through a zombie’s head, so thank you, Leon, for saving my ass with your gift of foresight. However, this moment could also be seen as a literal passing of the torch (or gun) to a new generation of </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>heroes, and that’s something Capcom has been pretty upfront about in its marketing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two generations of survival. Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy face unimaginable terrors in Resident Evil Requiem.</p> <p>🌿<a href="https://t.co/JBHl3u25qT">https://t.co/JBHl3u25qT</a> <a href="https://t.co/NrcAVXDNTf">pic.twitter.com/NrcAVXDNTf</a></p> <p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1999317087034950074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Grace’s playstyle is defined by her inexperience. A gun that wrecks shop in Leon’s hand barely harms a zombie when Grace is using it. This is her origin story, and while she and Leon might be separated for large parts of the game, she has his gun, whose name literally means a tribute to the dead, on her at all times. From a thematic standpoint, Leon entrusts something to her, and parts from her fully realizing he may never see her or the revolver again. I would not be surprised if </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>ended with Leon doing something to save Grace, ensuring she gets out of this whole outbreak alive and earning himself a big goddamn hero’s sacrifice, knowing that he was on borrowed time anyway. Grace escapes, but still has the Requiem revolver in hand, and uses it as a tribute to her fallen comrade in future cases. See? It all comes full circle.</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s all speculation, but if </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>is really meant to be a generational shift for </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span>, it would make a lot of sense for Capcom to sell that in the most definitive way possible. But hey, characters like Leon, Chris, and Jill have gotten through worse, so I also wouldn’t be surprised if he manages to squeeze his way out of this problem, too. We’ll find out for sure when </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem </span></i><span>launches on February 27.</span></p>

<p>The first full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/nintendo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a> Direct of the year could be coming next week.</p>



<p>In his latest video on Monday, known insider NateTheHate spoke about when Nintendo fans should expect the first full Nintendo Direct showcase. </p>







<p><strong>“From what I have been told, the first Direct of 2026 will be held during the opening week of February,”</strong> he said. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">He then said</a> that the expectation is that the show will take place on Thursday, February 5.</p>



<p>While he mentions next week as being the time, NateTheHate did leave it a bit open. He said that that he had yet to confirm the information with his “best contacts just yet”. Should he have to give an update or amend anything, he says, he’ll do it on social media when he can. </p>







<p>He added that he didn’t know the type of Nintendo Direct it would be, nor did he mention any possible games. </p>



<p><strong>“While I hope it will be a general direct so Nintendo can really start the year with strong momentum—begin to detail some of those brand new first party games coming out in 2026, let us know what they have planned for The Legend of Zelda’s 40th anniversary—it could just as easily be a partner showcase,”</strong> he said.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this information on the Nintendo Direct with a grain of salt until it’s been independently verified by Insider Gaming or confirmed by Nintendo.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Nintendo isn’t leaving fans waiting too long for some news regarding its games. The company announced on Monday that it was holding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomodachi-life-nintendo-direct-arriving-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomodachi Life-specific Direct</a> on January 29.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is YAPYAP on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch? All Platforms, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-playstation-xbox-nintendo-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1416319</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re starting to get into the meat of 2026, and everyone is looking forward to seeing what games appear out of nowhere to suddenly steal hearts (and player counts from other games). YAPYAP could be that, and if you’re a console player desperate to play it, let’s check its PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo status for you.</p>



<p>Everything about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> screams success. One thing to shout home about is that it’s coming to Steam and PC, that’s almost a given. If you’re looking for clarification about its console platforms, then come quietly.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-yapyap-on-ps5-consoles">Can You Play YAPYAP On PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could appear, as if by magic. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>YAPYAP is not on the agenda for PlayStation 5 owners, nor any PS4 players who haven’t upgraded yet.</strong></p>



<p>It appears as if YAPYAP is staying the course on PC for now. The game can be purchased through Steam—more details about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-cost-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP’s price here</a>—and there will be no yelling down PS5 microphones for the time being.</p>



<p>As with all Steam games, if there’s a strong demand, it could come to PS5. It also depends on the developer and publisher, too. You only have to look at Content Warning as the perfect subject here.</p>



<p>Whereas games like Lethal Company and REPO—which are arguably more popular—have opted against a console release for the time being, Landfall is bringing Content Warning to console. It’s another of the recent ‘Friendslop’ trend, and should be a hit party game on console.</p>

<p><strong>There will be no Xbox Series X|S console launch for YAPYAP either.</strong></p>



<p>The Xbox and PC link has been a popular one for many years. However, there’s still an element of separation where certain game releases are concerned, in this case, low-budget indie Steam titles.</p>



<p>YAPYAP has plenty of appeal and could be perfect for Xbox owners. If you want to play it with your friends and use knock-off Wingardium Leviosa spells to annoy them, you need a PC and Steam.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo consoles commonly get a lot of low-key indie titles and third-party releases, but you won’t find YAPYAP on either the Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 anytime soon.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2’s stunning 4K, HDR, 120 FPS screen and setup won’t have you flying around YAPYAP. It’s a full-scale Steam release for YAPYAP, and there have been no messages or signals of intent to bring it to consoles yet.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for further updates, and keep checking back in case it does get a console port down the line.</p>

<p><em><strong>Game Informer's </strong></em><strong>Wesley LeBlanc: The first question I want to ask is about the chainsaw. Why now? Why is now the time to put a chainsaw in Leon's hands finally?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi via an interpreter: </strong>So the chainsaw – first off, if you've played previous Resident Evil games, you probably know chainsaws are a pretty symbolic weapon in a lot of different games. So whenever a new entry in the Resident Evil series, or whenever the developers are working on a new entry in the Resident Evil series, there's always a lot of thought put into how the chainsaw will be used in this game. So in this game, the zombies can actually use tools. They have retained some of their memory pre-turning into a zombie. And so yeah, being able to use tools is something the zombies can do here. And so with that being the case, it made sense for all the zombies to also be able to use a chainsaw. So, going from there, if one enemy with the chainsaw is defeated, it makes sense for the other zombies to pick it up and to be able to use it. And so from there, it went to, "Well, if that's the case, then of course, you as the player also want to use it." And so that's kind of how that line of thought naturally progressed and resulted in Leon being able to wield a chainsaw in Resident Evil Requiem.&nbsp;</p><p>Another driving force behind it is that by Resident Evil Requiem, Leon has a lot of experience under his belt at this point, so it felt like a good time for Leon to turn the tables a bit and use a chainsaw himself, since he's gone up against so many chainsaws previously.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And keeping up with the chainsaws, I noticed immediately in the Leon section that when it hits the ground, it's spinning. Zombies walked over it and it cut their legs off. I'm curious if there are any other kind of physics interactions like that in the game, or is that just a cool little one-off with the chainsaw?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi</strong>: Using enemy weapons is a pretty big feature of gameplay, so being able to use enemy weapons against them is also going to be something you'll see come up beyond the sections that you've played as well.</p>

<p><strong>I'm curious – you can switch perspectives between third-person and first-person. How did the team land on it defaulting to first-person for Grace and third-person for Leon?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi: </strong>So, actually, for the preview that you played, it doesn't start at the very beginning of the game. The story has progressed a bit. So actually, in the final version of the game, when you start the game, it's going to ask you, which do you prefer? It's up to the player, really, on what they want to use, and they can freely choose what they want to use when they start the game.</p><p><strong>Is the intention for Grace and Leon's varying gameplay experiences to speak to each other in terms of balancing tension?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi:&nbsp;</strong>It's exactly as you said – the idea there is to build tension with the very horror-focused sections with Grace; she doesn't have as many options for combat as Leon, as he's much more combat-focused. So yeah, exactly as you said, that's the intention behind the design of the two characters, to have that tension and release between the two. And so [I'm] really happy that you were able to pick that up from just playing the preview.</p><p><strong>What was the ethos behind designing the monsters and zombies in this game?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi: </strong>For Requiem, the main theme that ties basically all the enemies together is a virus. So obviously, the zombies are infected by a virus. There was not a whole lot shown in the preview, but there are other creatures as well who've been infected by the virus. So, it's kind of going back to that very central theme of Resident Evil, the enemies, basically, that that through line that goes through them all is centered around a virus.</p>

<p><strong>Something I really enjoyed in the preview is that it felt almost nostaglic, in the sense that the Grace section felt very Resident Evil 2 police station, and Leon felt like toward the end of the game, where you're just kicking butt. I'm curious – is that intentional to set up a surprise feel for later in the game, or is it just a greatest hits of Resident Evil?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi:&nbsp;</strong>Obviously, Capcom has a long history with the Resident Evil franchise. The idea was to present an evolved version of some of the gameplay you know and love. So, as you said, Grace, there's a strong feeling of RE2 to show an evolution of the zombies, again, an evolution of RE2's gameplay, and Leon as well. &nbsp;So yeah, you're right on the money there too.</p><p><strong>What is the design intention behind the blood synthesis system?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi: </strong>There are kind of two things that led to including that crafting system with blood in Requiem. So the first one is: in lots of RE games, there's always a lot of blood in the environment, right? There's always a lot of blood everywhere in different environments. So the first question that kind of led to that system was the dev team looking at that and saying, "Is there any way to implement that element into the actual gameplay?" So that was one of the first drivers behind it.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the intention behind that mechanic, it was to add another layer of player choice. So, for instance, yes, there's always the choice of running away or fighting the enemy, but knowing that you can possibly collect blood from the enemy gives you another incentive to defeat the enemy, like you were mentioning. So it just adds another layer of choice, and I guess risk and reward for players going through the game. Speaking about choice, I don't know if you utilized it or not, but there's an injector in the game that you can also craft that, if you sneak up, you can defeat an enemy with one hit. You'll notice that you can't collect their blood. So, yeah, again, it's really about, you know, adding player choice and giving different incentives for choosing different things.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think is the most defining aspect of these zombies versus others in the RE series?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Nakanishi: </strong>The thing that really sets these zombies apart, which we're sure you experienced when you played, is that the zombies actually retain some memory of their life before they turned into a zombie. So you can actually see that in their actions, as they're kind of focused on what they were doing or what they were responsible for before they turned into a zombie. So retaining a little bit of their past lives is something that's really new for the RE series here, and you'll actually, if you look closely, be able to utilize that stuff to your advantage.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><hr><p>Nakanishi closed out the interview by addressing rumors that Resident Evil Requiem is an open world game – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-director-sets-the-record-straight-this-isnt-an-open-world-game">it isn't, and here's what he had to say.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem launches February 27 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>For more about the game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/26/exciting-emulation">read my hands-on preview of Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/15/leon-kennedy-can-finally-use-a-chainsaw-in-resident-evil-requiem">check out the latest news from the Resident Evil showcase</a> that aired last month.

<p>In case you need a little reminder, Dynasty Warriors 3: Complete Edition Remastered is a complete rerelease of <strong>Dynasty Warriors 3</strong> and <strong>Dynasty Warriors 3: Xtreme Legends</strong>, which launched in 2001 and 2003 in North America on the PS2.</p>
<p>It was the first game in the series to sell over 1 million copies and introduced some of the series' most-famous features, including True Musou Attacks, two-player simultaneous play, and the officer development system.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can at least check out the recently-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> on Switch 2, which — in our eyes — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">is a fabulous game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/insignias-32-smart-fire-tv-is-nearly-50-off-before-the-super-bowl-now-cheaper-than-no-name-portable-monitors-2000662872</link>
            <guid>1416289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Entertainment upgrades can cost a pretty penny, whether you’re after a new screen or just want to add some nice speakers for fuller sound to your setup. That’s not the case today, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6881/">Right now, the 32-inch Insignia Class F20 Series smart Fire TV can be yours for just $70, after Amazon took a whopping 46% (or $60) off the usual price.</a> The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime shoppers. Delivery is free, too, so $70 is all you’ve got to pay. You might want to act fast, though. The retailer has marked this offer as a limited time one, so it’s likely going to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for Casual Viewing</h2>
<p>The 32-inch size isn’t huge, but it’s also not too small to make content feel cramped. It’s perfect for smaller living areas and also bedrooms if you want to catch up on shows in your cozy blanket. The modest 720p resolution offers bright, clear visuals for everything from shows to movies and games. Yes, it won’t match the level of Full HD or 4K picture quality, but it’s still better than standard definition, especially on a screen this size. Lower resolutions typically feel more noticeable on bigger screens, but it works just fine here. You’ll enjoy the latest TV shows, your all-time favorite movies, and even catch up with friends on video calls perfectly well!</p>
<p>Speaking of TV shows and movies, Fire TV integration offers instant access to thousands of popular streaming platforms, apps, and Alexa skills, including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, YouTube, Apple TV+, Disney+, ESPN+, Sling TV, Paramount+, and other services. That translates into over 1.5 million movies and episodes ready to be watched. Some platforms require a subscription to get started, but a few free, ad-supported options are included, too. Maybe start the night with a classic thriller on Netflix, and switch to Prime Video later for a quick episode of a comedy show; the possibilities are endless.</p>



<p>There’s DTS Virtual-X sound to match the visuals. It’s an immersive sound format that delivers a three-dimensional audio that surrounds you. Expect footsteps, dialogs, whispers, mumbles, and laughter to come through clearly. Additionally, Alexa Voice Remote makes it easy to control content, adjust volume, switch inputs, and search across apps using just your voice. Just press and hold the microphone button on the remote to activate the assistant. You can say something like, “Alexa, show me the latest crime thrillers on Netflix”, or “Alexa, switch to Disney+”, without fiddling with the remote in the dark or getting up from your couch.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include two HDMI ports, composite (AV) jacks, digital optical output, USB port, headphone jack, coaxial jack, and Wi-Fi. This wide range lets you easily connect your home theater components, such as a Blu-ray player, game console, speakers, and cable, to the screen without feeling limited.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this 32-inch Insignia Smart Fire TV. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6881/">It normally sits at $130, which is already affordable, considering all that the screen offers. However, the current discount lets you pick one for just $70.</a> Grab it fast before it’s too late!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-brutal-grace-weak/</link>
            <guid>1416283</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released in one month, and fans are <strong>excited</strong>. It’s a solid return to Raccoon City as <strong>both </strong>Leon Kennedy and Grace Ashcroft, and it’s a diverse title shot from two perspectives – first- and third-person. It also features the kind of dual story that has been seen in the series before, with Leon and Grace exploring the same locations at different times.</p>



<p>In a recent walkthrough by Xbox Wire, the nature of this duality is perfectly portrayed. While Leon Kennedy is a combat master and a powerhouse of the apocalypse, Grace Ashcroft is, by all accounts, demure and frightened – but <strong>willing to survive</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-leon-cracks-skulls-grace-kind-of-avoids-them">Leon Cracks Skulls, Grace Kind of Avoids Them</h2>



<p>The mixed perspective available in Resident Evil Requiem effectively makes this ‘two games’, as recently explained <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/26/resident-evil-requiem-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Xbox Wire</a>. Grace’s journey puts players in control of a timid, terrified individual with a tighter inventory, a lack of combat experience, and the clear inability to take down the game’s heftier enemies.</p>



<p>Leon, on the other hand, is blasting the undead and tearing enemies to shreds (even ones Grace can’t touch) while offering quips and one-liners.</p>



<p>When you assume control of Grace, you’re taking a more investigative approach, and combat is more of a last resort than a first approach. Leon flips that script and weilds chainsaws, a hatchet, and hands and feet that must be registered as lethal weapons somewhere to dispatch all comers.</p>



<p>Xbox Wire referred to Leon’s sections of the game as ‘big, loud, and dumb, and a relieving change of pace’ compared to Grace’s slower, methodical approach that orders you to think twice about every door you open and every corner you turn.</p>







<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on February 27. Let us know which character you’re most excited to control on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How Much Does YAPYAP Cost? Price, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-cost-price/</link>
            <guid>1416280</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>YAPYAP is talking aloud, as it could be a huge indie hit, and wants everyone’s attention. Its yapping is literal, but one thing it’s remained silent on is the pricier tag.</p>



<p>The genre of games that includes hit titles such as Lethal Company, REPO, and PEAK has lovingly been titled ‘Friendslop.’ Seen as cheap and easy-to-make indie titles with a pure multiplayer appeal, centered around bedlam and busy work. It’s harsh, but it doesn’t matter when the games are so much fun. Besides, plenty of people seem to like them! <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yapyap-official-release-date-countdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YAPYAP</a> looks to be the first of many ‘Friendslop’ games in 2026, and its concept means it could be the best.</p>



<p>However, a quick dive into YAPYAP’s price first is on the cards.</p>







<h2 id="h-do-we-know-yapyap-s-price">Do We Know YAPYAP’s Price?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It shouldn’t be too spooky. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>So far, Maison Bap has yet to reveal YAPYAP’s price across any of its social media, and Insider Gaming has also tried reaching out for an early sneak peek at the price, to no avail.</strong></p>



<p>Either Maison Bap is keeping its cards close to its chest until YAPYAP’s launch, or the developer simply sees no reason to let people know. There’s nothing wrong with this, and it’s something many indie games on Steam opt for.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will keep checking for price updates, so check back to this guide. If you hear or see nothing, it’s probably a case of waiting until release day to find out.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-yapyap-expected-to-cost">How Much Is YAPYAP Expected To Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A magical price tag surely awaits. Credit to Maison Bap</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A reasonable price tag of between $7.99 and $9.99 is expected for YAPYAP.</strong></p>



<p>There’s a similar trending price tag for these types of games, and based on YAPYAP’s first trailer and announcements, it’s safe to assume the game will go in a similar direction to those that have come before it.</p>



<p>For example, Lethal Company’s RRP on Steam is $9.99 or £8.50, PEAK is $7.99 or £6.39, and REPO has also opted for the $9.99 or £8.50 approach.</p>



<p>Unless there’s a staggering amount of work and production that has gone into YAPYAP, you should expect to pay no more than $9.99 for YAPYAP.</p>



<p>Never say never in this industry. How much do you think YAPYAP will end up costing? Drop your guesses via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem - The Final Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview</link>
            <guid>1416274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the triumphant return of Leon Kennedy, Resident Evil Requiem is forced to straddle an awkward line between all-out action and methodical survival horror. I’ll be honest, before getting my hands on the game and seeing the transition in action, I was extremely skeptical that Capcom would be able to create a coherent experience involving both Leon and Grace, the series’ latest, highly vulnerable protagonist. The switching between their polar opposite styles sounded jarring, which is almost never a good thing, and although it's been a while, it’s not like we haven’t been burned by Capcom’s desire to push the series towards action before. But I’m pleased to share that, from my all-too-brief three hours of hands-on time with Resident Evil Requiem, not only does this design really, really work, but there’s a lot more going on than just a merging of Resident Evil’s greatest hits.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My playtime started with a short test drive of Leon, and Resident Evil 4 muscle memory kicked in immediately. Make no mistake, this plays just like the recent remake, enhanced with some clever new additions suitable for a veteran badass. Leon is more handy than ever, with a deadly hatchet that he can swing mercilessly added to his regular arsenal. Leon can also heave axes found in the world, can perform new contextual finishing moves such as a handgun shot to the chin, and <em>finally</em> wield the violent chainsaw. There was once a time Leon feared the chainsaw, but now, Leon has become chainsaw, destroyer of ghouls. After a short 15 minutes, the gameplay shifted perspective to Grace Ashcroft, Requiem’s second protagonist, picking up her journey immediately after the events of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-hands-on-preview">previous demo I wrote about in August</a> last year. Grace and Leon are polar opposites. Gone were the tense gunfights and forward momentum of Resident Evil 4, as I was immediately thrust into what felt like a sterile, white, clean version of Resident Evil 7. For the next two hours, I explored the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center, a somewhat traditional Resident Evil mansion that contains much of what you might expect among its rooms and corridors, but with plenty of new surprises. Surprises that mostly arise thanks to Grace’s abilities, or rather, lack thereof. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like in the previous demo, Grace’s section was focused almost exclusively on survival horror. She<em> is</em> armed with small pistols she finds in the environment, but her firepower and combat skills are negligible compared to our favorite floppy-haired icon. Where Leon can round-house kick zombies in the face, Grace makes do with a clumsy push. Leon is all-out assault, but the best course of action for Grace is slow and deliberate stealth, because if you <em>do</em> try to take some of the new enemies head-on, you’re going to have a bad time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year’s demo revealed a new and much-celebrated stalker enemy, a towering, hunched, bug-eyed warden, but even within the span of my short three-hour session, I was introduced to another two, giving me the impression that Resident Evil Requiem won’t have one Mr. X or Nemesis-like persistent threat, but rather several smaller pursuers that seem to guard certain wings of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center. Most notable was a hulking mass of blubber called Chunk, who burst through the wall and into my heart as he very slowly, but surely, ground his way through halls, stairwells and doorways in pursuit of me. Uniquely, Chunk fills the space entirely, so your only chance of survival is to find and navigate the loops built into the level design in order to outmaneuver the walking lardarse. It’s a clever design that generates a (somewhat) living, breathing wall of terror, and one you can’t simply sidestep or combat roll away from.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like the stalker I escaped last year, Chunk is cleverly implemented in the context of traditional safe rooms. Where the room’s bright light caused the previous stalker pain, Chunk simply can’t physically squeeze his sheer mass through the door, making sure there’s a logical in-world justification for a room of respite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as Chunk, I also ran into a 7-foot-tall hulking unit masquerading as a chef, who, until he noticed me, was completely focused on his chopping chores. This soon-to-be stalker wasn’t yet in searching mode; rather, he was fulfilling, I assume, his pre-infection duties. This kind of behavior isn’t unique to the chef: It turns out in Resident Evil Requiem, the traditional zombie fodder is just as much the star of the show. You see, zombies not only talk now, but also have their own personalities.
</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem, aside from being packed with action and fear, is now also funny, something the series has never (at least intentionally) achieved before.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The undead are no longer unfortunate, generic lost souls, but rather husks that retain a smidge of living personalities, hanging out in the space they once occupied. There’s the lounge singing shrieker in the bar area, who, before being alerted, entertains herself by belting out a ditty. There are the zombies who were formerly patients in recovery that insist on wheeling around their drip stands, which are then, unsurprisingly, wielded as weapons when they’re aggro’d. Some zombies hate loud noises and will repeatedly yell at you if you even so much as smash a vase, and then there’s one that loves nothing more than turning lights on and off until you rudely interrupt him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If it’s not clear by now, Resident Evil Requiem, aside from being packed with action and fear, is now also funny, something the series has never (at least intentionally) achieved before. As Grace creeps around the hospital, there’s the continual threat that around every corner awaits horror, or laughter, or sometimes even both! When you can hear the undead nattering away in a room you know you have to enter to achieve your next objective, it’s hard to know whether to be scared or have a good chuckle. On paper, this sounds like it could be awful – I’m aware of that, but honestly, it’s so good! I laughed so hard when I caught one particularly dopey zombie red-handed (both literally and figuratively), lifting a large and, importantly, red canister to throw my way. I’m sure you can imagine what happened next.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>The zombie fodder isn’t just around to entertain and quickly be disposed of, though. As Grace, the undead are a significant threat, always moving a little faster than you anticipate. Their fallen corpses also pose a significant conundrum, as they have the ability to turn into “Blister Heads,” a reinvention of the Resident Evil remake’s Crimson Heads for a new generation that reanimate with a bulbous cranium and become significantly tougher to take down. Fortunately, Grace has a new tool at her disposal: a Hemolytic Injector that weaponises the buckets of blood lying around the place (seriously, it’s <em>everywhere</em>), creating a lethal injection that can be used as a preventive measure against Blister Heads when injected into fallen enemies, and as a stealth attack against anything moving.</p><p>Beyond the new enemy types, playing as Grace does feel very familiar if you’ve played either Resident Evil 7 or Resident Evil 2, although obviously it leans more towards the latter if you choose to play as Grace in third person. You’re exploring a huge mansion with locked doors, there are obtuse puzzles to solve, antique coins to find that can upgrade your equipment, Mr. Raccoons to shoot, safe rooms with a typewriter for saving and a storage box for inventory management, and so forth. Leon, however, can brute-force open certain doors that Grace can’t and is far more aggressive with combat compared to Grace’s methodical stealth. You <em>can</em> also choose to play as Leon in first person, though after a brief dabble, it felt very unnatural to do so. I can’t help but think Capcom built this game with Leon in third person and Grace in first person in mind, but it’s hard to complain about more choice, despite knowing deep down the development team surely has a preference.</p></div><p>To Grace, Chunk and his fellow creeps are stalkers; to Leon, they’re targets.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo ended with a second, all-too-short stint as Leon, which allowed me to revisit sections of the Care Center I’d previously experienced with Grace. Interestingly, this section demonstrated perhaps my favorite element of this hybrid experience. Leon is also exposed to some of the tougher combat encounters that I’d suffered through as Grace, although the perspective (much like my viewpoint of choice) is very different. When I met Chunk as Grace, I immediately retreated and was forced into a game of cat-and-mouse. The threat is intimidating and encourages you to tread lightly. As Leon, however, emboldened by my newly acquired shotgun, I felt instantly trigger-happy, unloading shells right up in Chunk’s face and launching hatchet attacks on his head as part of a fight that felt somewhat reminiscent of the El Gigante encounters of Resident Evil 4. To Grace, Chunk and his fellow creeps are stalkers; to Leon, they’re targets. This ethos was reaffirmed when taking on a wave of Blister Heads with Leon at the end of my play time. With Grace, I waited patiently for a stealth attack opportunity; with Leon, I was hurling hand grenades and throwing axes for fun.

Do you like tense survival horror? It’s here. Wanna go all guns blazing with intense action and a quip-obsessed hero? You get that too. Do you prefer playing RE games in first or third person? Doesn’t matter; you can do either. All these choices, along with my fears of a jarring play experience being mostly squashed, make it easy to believe that Capcom’s bold move to have its cake and eat it is going to pay off in a big way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Associate Director of Video Programming at IGN.

Its 3DS sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomodachi-life">Tomodachi Life</a>, was then released worldwide and went on to sell a very respectable 6.72 million units.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Memorably, Tomodachi Life experienced a backlash over its lack of same-sex relationships, something that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/08/nintendo-strikes-down-gay-marriage-requests-for-tomodachi-life">Nintendo found itself having to comment on</a> after rumors spread online that they were something that had been originally programmed into the game that was later removed.

Imamura himself departed Nintendo in 2021 to pursue his own projects, resulting in the Omega 6 manga and Switch game Omega 6: The Triangle Stars (he even wrote <a href="https://note.com/imamura_1966/n/n09b6dd5931a3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a blog post </u></a>on why he left). </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best Nintendo Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, it was revealed that another longtime Nintendo creator, Kensuke Tanabe, had recently retired, with Tanabe confirming that Metroid Prime 4 was his last game at Nintendo (as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/veteran-nintendo-producer-kensuke-tanabe-known-for-metroid-and-paper-mario-reportedly-confirms-retirement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Video Games Chronicle</u></a>). Many of the legendary game creators who shaped the NES and SNES eras are now in their 60s and 70s, including Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto (72). We will likely be seeing many more of these influential game designers departing Nintendo in the coming years, especially with the Switch 2 out the door.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Andreas Rentz/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
