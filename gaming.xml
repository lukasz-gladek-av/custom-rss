			<p>At The Game Awards 2024, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Crimson Desert would be released in Fall 2025 for PC and consoles. However, we still haven't heard any specific date.</p>
<p>That changed this morning when Korean website MTN <a href="https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025061710543196451" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an exclusive report revealing that Pearl Abyss is leaning toward a November 2 global launch. The game is said to be in the final stages of development, and provided that there are no unforeseen issues, this date should be confirmed in an official capacity soon. Needless to say, we've reached out to Pearl Abyss to check if they'd like to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiled</a> at G-Star 2019 alongside DokeV and PLAN 8. Back then, it was supposed to be not too dissimilar from the studio's flagship product, the MMORPG Black Desert. Over time, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> it to a single player action/adventure game with a heavy focus on narrative, which inevitably caused a significant delay (the game was initially slated to debut in Winter 2021).</p>
<p>In the game, players will become Kliff, captain of the Greymanes, a band of mercenaries. Alongside his comrades, Kliff embarks on a perilous journey to defend the continent of Pywel from the snow-capped mountains of Kweiden to the lush plains of Akapen and the lofty ridges dotting the titular Crimson Desert.</p>
<p>Throughout the adventure, players will encounter dependable allies and countless foes who will stop at nothing to see you fail. They'll have to overcome many challenges to unravel the mystery surrounding an impending catastrophe and restore peace to the continent.</p>
<p>Crimson Desert features a massive open world that takes full advantage of the BlackSpace Engine. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> at GDC 2025, the technology allows for accurate simulations of trees, grass, clothing, and hair, real-time physics and destructibility, volumetric fog, real-time lighting, detailed atmospheric scattering effects, dynamic weather, ray tracing, ocean and shallow water simulations, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/an-item-duplication-glitch-in-elden-ring-nightreign-makes-it-easier-to-share-the-wealth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has some pretty sick gear drops. And sometimes, you might even want to let other people try out that gear, even though you want to also use them. Well, a gear duplication glitch makes it easy to share the loot, for as long as it's around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first saw this thanks to the folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-has-a-new-exploit-which-allows-you-and-your-friends-to-duplicate-weapons-and-talismans-until-youre-just-as-godly-as-the-nightlords/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a>, who put together a quick guide on just how to tackle the duplication. It's actually fairly simple to execute; if two players try to pick up the same weapon, at the same time, they both pick it up. So now you have the original, and a duplicate. (Don't ask which is which, it'll freak everyone out.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this fairly simple, it's easy to repeat and there isn't really a downside to "failing" it. If the pick-up gets messed up, you can just try again. In fact, the only danger is that you're basically stopping in one place and coordinating this drop-and-pick-up strategy, and in Nightreign, standing still is rarely advisable. The brief respite between days, or the alabaster alcove before the big Nightlord showdown, is probably the best time to do this.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As PC Gamer noted though, they're not the first to stumble onto this trick. Various <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDUPxRrjWR0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTubers</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lbfy3z/duplicating_items/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> users have posted about the easy duplication, too. The proverbial lid is off on this particular exploit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether FromSoftware will take any aim at changing it is anyone's guess. It is somewhat niche-use. There's no voice chat or anything to coordinate with random players online, so it's not exactly feasible to start dropping your best equipment and hope everyone's on the same page.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even for teamed-up players using Discord or some other method to chat, you'd still want to have equipment that other characters would want. Not only is Elden Ring Nightreign fairly generous in drops, at least in my experience, but each character tends to have their own wants and needs for weaponry. Unless you're rolling three Ironeyes, I suppose. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The duplication glitch is nice for characters who want to double-up on specific weapons, like the Executor, but it's not some instant-win trick. For some fun and maybe sharing the wealth around if someone didn't manage to get any solid weapons by the final day, though, it might not be the worst trick to keep in your back pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The UK publisher, however, has worked on a range of successful titles including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Rise of the Golden Idol</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Abiotic Factor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cityscapes: Sim Builder</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elliott feels the only thing uniting the company's slate is the Playstack logo on the splash screen. "Other than that; they are totally unique," he says. "The games bring something new to their audiences and excite players in totally different ways."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diversity is key for the publisher, which according to Elliott receives thousands of pitches each year, and that means developers looking to pitch should consider what makes their title truly unique before reaching out. Johnson agrees, and emphasizes that developers must "understand the intention of their game and the space it resides in."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-interactive-extends-partnership-with-nba-nbpa-wnba-and-wnbpa" target="_self" data-discover="true">Take-Two Interactive extends partnership with NBA, NBPA, WNBA, and WNBPA</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also vital to know what will realistically constitute success in a specific market. "I don't particularly want to see </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTA V </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">cited as a competitor in a pitch for a third-person action game—what are some similarly sized games on Steam that you could hope to compete against?, asks Johnson. "What is the potential sales-unit ceiling for the genre space? We can obviously help figure these things out, but it's good to have a baseline understanding when pitching a publisher."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Playstack advises indies to keep budgets tight and champion their creativity">Playstack advises indies to keep budgets tight and champion their creativity</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That doesn't necessarily mean untangling all the knots before making an approach. Elliott says Playstack recognizes that developers need support to do their best work, but highlighting potential obstacles can make that process easier. "Our priority when green-lighting a project is figuring out how we may solve those challenges together. Is there a clear, shared vision for the game? Do we know why the team are confident that they can build this particular game? What gaps do we need to fill to help them succeed?," he says.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-studios-boss-confident-marathon-won-t-repeat-the-mistakes-of-concord" target="_self" data-discover="true">PlayStation Studios boss confident Marathon won't repeat the mistakes of Concord</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Honesty. That's the key word. Johnson says developers who are candid about their situation from the outset immediately stand out. "The biggest green flag is always transparency regarding what the game needs and when it needs it—having an honest, friendly relationship with each other is almost as important as having a quality game," Johnson continues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Amazing things happen when a publisher and developer trust each other fully. Confidence in the creative vision is also key from the developer’s side—we're not here to comment on, or change, that vision—but we are here to support the realization of it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, transparency goes both ways. Johnson adds that developers should be wary of publishers that refuse to share key information, obfuscate the truth, or make grandiose claims they struggle to substantiate. If it seems like a company has something to hide or makes statements that feel too good to be true—there's a good chance something is amiss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to narrowing down the selection process, Elliott explains Playstack tries to hone in on projects that will be commercially successful right from the off. The company isn't expecting every title to amass millions of sales overnight—though Elliott does notes that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> became profitable within its first hour on shelves—but it does want to set realistic expectations around budget and scope. Right now, Elliott suggests developers with smaller budgets are a safer bet.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-proposed-ai-protections-will-let-performers-send-their-digital-replicas-on-strike" target="_self" data-discover="true">SAG-AFTRA proposed AI protections will let performers send their digital replicas on strike</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a lot of costs involved in releasing a game, and we need to ensure that everyone earns a positive income from a successful release.&nbsp;Simply put, the higher the budget, the more the game has to sell just to earn a positive income," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We would guide indie games to pitch at sub $500k; and perhaps to have some choices that can reduce or extend from this budget. We run a comprehensive forecasting process for every title we sign; and we want to ensure that the cost of development is commensurate with the opportunity we identify. We are seeing budget asks into the millions—would we prefer to have four games at $300k; or one game at $1.2 million? It’s not impossible; but clearly the higher the ask, the more we have to weigh up with which games we move forward with."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Johnson doubles down on that assessment, but feels there's also another upside to working with devs at that scale: diversity of thought. We often hear that constraints breed creativity, and Johnson says there are generally more "interesting and unique" titles in the sub-$500,000 bracket.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Honest conversations are the key to success for Balatro publisher">Honest conversations are the key to success for Balatro publisher</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expectation management is a recurring theme throughout our exchange, and Elliott notes that Playstack attempts to clearly define the relationship between publisher and developer at a contractual level by defining milestones that will help build out the foundations of a title early on. The company also considers contract discussions an opportunity to align on marketing plans and release support.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[When it comes to contracts], a lot of people worry about the revenue share percentage; and of course it’s important—but actually there's a lot more in a publishing deal than the royalty at the end. Our publishing agreement is around 25 pages long; because it sets out how we intend for the partners to work together, what each of us are responsible for, and how we deal with some of the normal processes of development," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We think it's better to define as much as we can upfront to set clear expectations on what a partnership looks like and then put it in the drawer and get on with it. During the contract phase we get to learn what it's like to work with each other on paperwork; but we really want to work together on a game, and getting into a more natural rhythm."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, Elliott feels a publisher's role is to help a developer "engineer a hit." It's a take that chimes with a sentiment shared by Playstack communications director Wout van Halderen during a conversation with Game Developer at GDC 2025, where he explained that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro's</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> apparent overnight success was actually the result of a carefully crafted marketing plan. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-methodical-marketing-beats-behind-overnight-success-balatro">More on that here</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We liked Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma a lot. So much <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/09/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-review/">so that Miguel said</a>,”It reinvigorates the Rune Factory formula on every level”. I also like it a lot, but I’ve been checking it out on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, where it’s joined the launch lineup in addition to the release on original Switch and PC. It’s not an exclusive, then, but it is important for a number of reasons. Firstly, it’s a brand-new title, launching almost simultaneously with the other platforms, and in a launch lineup without a whole heap of new things; that’s an important shot in the arm. Secondly, this is a game that’s relatively taxing on the original Switch, pushing it to its limit, but makes clear use of all that extra headroom on Switch 2. There’s also a small number of Switch 2-specific improvements that might just make this the best version of the game to own.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma – Launch Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRb4MwoDOWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rune Factory 5 Guardians of Azuma drops you into the shoes of an amnesiac Earth Dancer – an individual capable of wielding mystical weaponry and reviving the land. You first arrive in Spring Village after falling off your dragon – hence the amnesia – and it soon becomes apparent that the village has suffered some form of calamity, it’s local deity having gone missing leading to the trees and blossoms all wilting away. Because you’re a helpful sort, you are tasked with reviving the village, releasing the deity, and clearing the village of blight. You do that through crafting, collecting materials and turning them into new buildings, farming, and through hacking monsters into little pieces. It’s a brilliant mix, and one which you’ll be glued to.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 version then is a great performer, but the handheld experience is not as strong as you might expect. The key upgrades are a higher resolution, improved framerates, and the ability to use the Joy Con 2’s mouse abilities, each of those features making it a clear jump above the Switch 1 edition.</p>
<p>If you bought the original Switch version of Guardians of Azuma, you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version for the £10 difference in price – it’s £60 on Switch 2 instead of £50 on Switch or PC. That’s a bit rich for us in the UK, as they’re making £10 equal to $10 and €10, so this upgrade fee is pricier for us than the £7.99 Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition, but then there’s also Fantasy Life i, where that game’s upgrade upgrade from Switch to Switch 2 is just $2.59 / £2.04. Your save from the original Switch will carry over, so if you’re holding off for the new console, you can carry your adventure over when you’re ready.</p>


<p>When playing docked, the Switch 2 version of Guardians of Azuma looks crisp and clear, though not potentially as crisp as you might hope. That’s the same story when playing handheld, with a further reduced resolution clearly helping performance, but impacting on image quality. It’s not as blatant as we’ve seen on original Switch over the years, or of the Switch 1 version of this game, but there’s a fuzziness that we’d hoped could be relegated by the new hardware.</p>
<p>Performance when docked is fantastic though, and feels incredibly smooth, especially when you’re out in the expanded worlds, fighting off the different monsters. The art direction and design is great here, particularly for the engrossing characters, and all in all, this is an attractive game that looks and performs great on Switch 2 when docked.</p>

<p>That’s a slightly different story in handheld mode. Combat and exploration are very smooth and respnsive, but there are points where you can make the game work a little too hard for the Switch 2’s lower power mode. Frame rates will drop, either when using fast travel to go to a new area, or when you’ve built up a very complicated village with lots of buildings and decorations. It’s still very playable, happening at slower points in the action, but as a showcase for the new console, I was just hoping for a little more.</p>
<p>Some of the best moments in Guardians of Azuma are when you’re customising and crafting your village, and it’s here that Maximum have added some mouse functionality, allowing you to place items or get your farming done just that little bit easier.</p>
<p>It feels mildly tacked on, but there are times where the development zone action is frustrating with a pad, because you want a level of precision that the controller can’t quite give you. That’s completely solved here, letting you place multiple tiles down, water your fields and sow your seeds with unrivalled speed; it’s a true proof of concept and I hope more games make some use of the feature. It’s a real shame it’s limited to this area though, as you can play through the game focusing on ranged weaponry, and being able to use the mouse would make life easier when aiming.</p>
<p>So, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma is a great game, and an amazing experience if you’re playing on Switch 2, but it isn’t <em>quite</em> perfect. Hopefully, a few patches will iron out the issues completely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hdr-calibration-settings-are-slammed-even-further-by-expert/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We were fairly surprised when we learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 would feature HDR support, both built-in for the handheld screen and for the docked mode. However, its implementation is suboptimal, to say the least, and this is sadly not all that surprising.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> shortly after the console's launch, the edge-lit LCD display has just about mediocre HDR capabilities due to low peak brightness (around 450 nits). Furthermore, since it's not an OLED screen, it cannot benefit from that technology's intrinsic infinite contrast, which is always a boon for HDR presentation.</p>
<p>Docked mode doesn't have the same issues since it relies on an external display. However, it has other issues related to its calibration settings. We have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-nintendo-switch-2-setting-can-improve-hdr-in-tv-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> this topic following a report from YouTuber My Life in Gaming, but now, the most renowned display expert on YouTube has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X84e14oe6gs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> his own video to dive into the issue of Nintendo Switch 2 HDR calibration.</p>
<p>I'm referring to Vincent Teoh of HDTVTest, widely regarded as the best YouTube channel when it comes to TV and display analysis. Teoh found several problems with HDR calibration on the new Nintendo console:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effective HDR calibration depends greatly on whether the user's TV supports HGIG or source-based tone mapping. The test pattern adjustment for max TML (tonemap luminance) reliably works only on HGIG-enabled displays.</li>
<li>The adjustment steps are just too many when compared to other console HDR calibration menus, such as the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, and there's no numeric indicator to help.</li>
<li>The Nintendo Switch 2's default paper white setting is brighter than the reference white level of 203 nits recommended by the ITU-R BT.2408, the standard for 1000 nits HDR10 content. This results in a perceptually flatter image where midtones are pushed too high, reducing dynamic range and leaving insufficient headroom for specular highlights, translating into a less impactful HDR presentation.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, the adjustment steps for the paper white setting change based on the max TML previously set, further complicating accurate HDR tweaking.</li>
</ul>
<p><iframe title="I Measured Nintendo Switch 2's HDR Settings - No Wonder Most Games Look Awful. Here's The Fix." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X84e14oe6gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>How can the Nintendo Switch 2 HDR presentation be improved in light of all these issues? First, you should get an HGIG-compatible display, as that greatly affects how accurate HDR content viewing will be. If you must stick to a display that does not support HGIG, the best compromise is to set&nbsp;the max TML at 1000 nits and paper white around 200 nits to minimize clipping while preserving contrast.</p>
<p>Beyond that, there are a few settings to tweak. Switching the Nintendo Switch 2 console to dark theme mode reduces the influence of Automatic Brightness Limiter (ABL) when using OLED displays, preserving more consistent brightness and contrast. It's also important to set HDR output to “compatible software only” to avoid forcing HDR on SDR content. Lastly, the screen burn-in protection feature is redundant on modern OLED displays and useless on non-OLED displays, so it should be disabled.</p>

<figure><a title="CTR Nitro-Fueled" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/781aa44b97f7a/ctr-nitro-fueled.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Activision</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_team_racing_nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> has sold a whopping <strong>10 million copies</strong> since its launch back in 2019, Activision <a href="https://x.com/CrashBandicoot/status/1934657226846724255">has announced</a>.</p>
<p>The game, which serves as a complete remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/crash_team_racing">1999 PS1 original</a>, was developed by Beenox, a studio that has since been gobbled up by the <strong>Call of Duty</strong> conveyor belt. That said, Nitro-Fueled was well-received upon launch for its faithfulness to the original, but also got quite a bit of heat for its micro-transactions.</p>

<p>Activision has since released the incredible <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a> and the rather middling <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/crash_team_rumble">Crash Team Rumble</a>, both developed by the now-independent studio Toys for Bob. As the series now sits with Xbox, speculation is swirling that the team may have been commissioned to work on something Crash-related for the future, though this is unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>It's a great result for Nitro-Fueled though, and we're hopeful that the Crash Bandicoot series continues to thrive going forward. We wouldn't say no to a cheeky Switch 2 performance update, too. How about it, Beenox?</p><p><figure data-videoid="h4CCwRn9Ca8" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4CCwRn9Ca8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h4CCwRn9Ca8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h4CCwRn9Ca8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed40239egtnimk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4CCwRn9Ca8">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

            <p>Beta test site and small game curator Alpha Beta Gamer have put out their Games To Get Excited About 2025 showcase, and (salt to taste, granted) it's exactly what it says on the tin. 110 curated trailers in an hour and five minutes, organised and timestamped by genre, with no paid adverts and no teeth-grindingly awful skits. They've also made a point to not include any cinematic trailers, although I haven't watched the whole thing yet. They might be liars. Are you liars, Alpha Beta Gamer? Wait, don't answer that.

<p>Being a jiving hepcat iconoclast trailblazer, I immediately scrubbed through to the 'weird games' category, which reminded me how obscenely gorgeous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-living-things-is-a-stop-motion-artbook-puzzle-game-based-on-a-600-year-old-alchemical-manuscript">All Living Things </a>is, and also introduced me to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/troleu">Troleu</a>, in which you punch people for refusing to pay the fare on your trolleybus. The FPS section opened with <a href="https://rowye.itch.io/darkenstein-3-d">Darkenstein 3D</a>, which looks a bit like classic Medal Of Honor but with nazi-hunting and dog rescuing. And I also learned that speculative biology tale <a href="https://nomarsh.itch.io/scrimshaw">South Scrimshaw</a> is getting a second part. This was all through some very casual browsing, mind. I feel I should also point out that at no point was I assaulted by a.) a muppet, b.) a pair of shit shoes, or c.) Hideo Kojima.</p>
<p>"It’s a streamlined experience created to counteract the bloat of the mainstream Summer showcases," says ABG. And yeah, can't fault them on that at all. Do let me know if you spot anything especially groovy, or perhaps even the coveted double-groovy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Vasudeva-Barkdull says the idea came about when Blizzard's Rod Fergusson implored executives, in the wake of layoffs, to "be empathetic...these people aren't knobs and dials". It made Vasudeva-Barkdull wonder, he says, "what kinds of knobs and dials the executives of these companies actually have, and whether there could be game design that actually shapes your actions towards greed and callousness".</p>
<p>"My first instinct was that if a player were given a literal knob or slider to hire and fire people, along with an ever-increasing profit goal to meet, they would have no choice but to do evil things like mass layoffs in service of the bottom line," says Vasudeva-Barkdull.  "The design of the system wouldn't have it any other way. And that, I believe, is the core truth of simulating the corporate world. Any option which does not bring profit to the shareholders simply does not exist - in the simulation or in reality".</p>
<p>Incentivising player callousness by marrying it to efficiency or other incentives isn't a new idea, of course. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/papers-please">Papers Please</a> etc. But I do think there's something interesting in stripping away the narra-framing and telling a story <em>about</em> a system, albeit with some heightened surreality and a bit of silliness.</p>
<p>As for the demo itself? It made me grin like a guilty pickpocket roleplaying as a guilt-agnostic pickpocket, yeah. You fire people ten at a time. Hiring interns is abstracted as a buff where you "select five employees to receive minus 100% salary", itself very funny and horrible wording, but it feels especially nasty when you go to use it and actually have to click five employees with names and jobs shuffling their way around the studio. The interface and music are pretty charming, too. It all feels very cartridge-coded - much lighter and livelier than you'd probably expect from a business tycoon or management <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a>. The full thing is out September if you fancy it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They said that the transfer "went fine", with every other Pokémon game retaining their respective saves, but the file from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet</a> had disappeared.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, the Pokémon games are part of just a small handful of Switch titles that aren't compatible with the cloud save functionality offered by Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>The alternative is to use <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_home">Pokémon HOME</a> to save the creatures that you deem to be of utmost value. Some Reddit commenters, including IAmTheWire, noted that the original poster should have considered this before performing the Switch 2 system transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ngl the fact that you didn't transfer all of your important Pokémon to Home first is on you. We've known that this is the only way to preserve your Pokémon for sure in this kind of circumstance or if your old Switch broke, otherwise they’d be gone forever. I'd have done it just to be safe if nothing else since it's so obvious and easy to transfer them back if something was to go wrong."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others, however, have been a bit more empathetic, with Grouchy-Cress-215 stating that "tears were shed" when the same thing happened to them.</p>
<p>It's not known exactly what happened with the save file in this instance. This writer booted up their own copy of Scarlet on the Switch 2 and picked up right where they left off on the OLED, but it seems that fate did not have the same plan for ThatOtaku26.</p>
<p>Take this as a lesson though, folks. If you've built up a collection of Pokémon dating back generations, then do consider using Pokémon HOME to keep the lovable critters safe in the (unlikely) event something like this occurs.</p>

			<p>Tetsuya Mizuguchi's signature games blend synesthesia through art in a playable medium. From Rez to Child of Eden and the cult classic <a href="https://wccftech.com/interview-tetsuya-mizuguchi-synesthesia-tetris-effect-rez-lumines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tetris Effect</a>, the rhythm and visuals work in tandem to create an experience unlike anything else. While this isn't the first Lumines title, it is the first to build on the creative framework of Tetris Effect: Connected, both in terms of audio and visuals. Hands down, this was by far the one demo from Summer Game Fest 2025's Play Days that I kept coming back to and thinking about long after my thirty minutes were up.</p>
<p>True to the long-running puzzle rhythm series, Lumines Arise focuses on the gameplay of dropping 2x2 squares built from two different colors and linking together matching colors in various squares. Both dropping the squares and linking them together result in musical notes and beats, letting the player remix tracks on the fly as they reach that puzzling nirvana. Each track has its own layers of color palettes and music, and, while the transitions aren't as smooth as in earlier games, they blend from one song into the next once you clear a certain number of boxes.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games in the Lumines series, Lumines Arise is focused on the musical styling of a single artist: Hydelic, who longtime Enhance fans would recognize as the composer of Tetris Effect: Connected's soundtrack as well. Speaking with one of the onsite devs, there aren't currently any plans to bring in licensed artists like Mondo Grosso (who was the backdrop for one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_xNTvN03TU">most memorable Lumines</a> stages of all time). This gives Lumines Arise more of a criterion collection focused on a single composer who has a knack for nailing a wide variety of genres. While I don't know the name of the track quite yet, one of the final demo tracks with a pair of chameleons headbanging to the bass drops had the best overall vibes of the whole session, with an energetic beat that gets elevated when you achieve a solid combo chain or Burst.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, Lumines Arise plays out similarly to earlier titles. To assist players with chaining together squares and creating flashy combos, Lumines traditionally has a single upgrade when dropped, will link and destroy every block of matching color that's linked up and touched. This simple upgrade helps clear away trash and let a single matching color fall into place to hopefully create a chain of squares, but this is largely dependent upon the player's skill to have that foresight to link blocks together beforehand.</p>
<p>New to Lumines Arise is the Burst mechanic, a new twist that allows players to build up a meter over time and unleash a powerful Burst that essentially locks a square into place, permitting players to build on it and chain together larger and larger combos. As Bursts can be triggered any time once the bar is at least partially filled, it becomes a delicate balance between wanting to use the mechanic as often as possible versus saving it for a clutch moment when you want to skyrocket your combo count and potentially skip through a majority of a track you might not want to listen to (which in Hydelic's defense, I couldn't find a single track in my modest demo session that I wouldn't mind hearing again and again).</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise PS5 Preview Gameplay from SGF 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cjc9NUgbqv0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lumines Arise is one of those demos that kept lingering in the back of my head with the musical styling of Hydelic running through my thoughts with a few different renditions from the number of times I kept coming back whenever I had gaps in my schedule to get another run through the demo. In fact, my first playthrough of Lumines Arise's hands-on demo finished in roughly seven minutes with an S rank, although I didn't have the foresight to set up my capture card and record the run, so instead readers will have to settle for a not-so-smooth run captured below.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is currently on track for a Fall 2025 release across PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR 2, and PC, with a free demo available later this Summer.</p>

<p>A Switch 2 release is also on the way</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex Trilogy</a> is now officially available on Nintendo's Switch and this happy throwback is already preparing a new update.</p>
<p>As teased online, the publisher Limited Run Games is excited for "European GEX fans" to be able to relive the second and third games as they remember – with the "PAL versions" and the addition of the "voices of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s been in the works for a while and we’re finally able to announce that the PAL versions of GEX 2 &amp; GEX 3, featuring the [GEX] voices of Leslie Philips and Danny John-Jules, respectively, will be added in an update!"</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This update is now live on Steam (PC) and will follow on other platforms when the patch has been certified. Here's a little bit more about it from the Steam community page, which notes how "save data is not transferable" between each regional version.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Once the update is downloaded and applied, you will be able to select the PAL versions on the menu by changing the regional flag to your preference before starting the game. Due to the fact that the NTSC and PAL versions of the game are completely separate game builds, please be aware that save data is not transferable between regional versions of the same game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you haven't already read our Gex Trilogy review on Nintendo Life, the missing voices were actually one of our 'cons' and no doubt disappointed some returning fans, so it's nice to see this will be patched.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"One major downside is that this trilogy doesn’t offer alternate soundtracks, since Gould was actually replaced by different comics in the PAL market, including Leslie Phillips and Red Dwarf’s Danny John-Jules for the third game. It would have been nice to have had the regional options in this respect. And, since the original games had a single file that contained each region's audio files — meaning it's easily flipped between — we're not sure why the accuracy of the Carbon Engine didn't rise to the occasion."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you're wondering, the Gex Trilogy currently isn't playable on Switch 2 via backwards compatibility, but a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/clock-tower-rewind-to-receive-switch-2-exclusive-features-says-limited-run">patch has been submitted</a>. Limited Run has also been experiencing some issues with the Carbon Engine on Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the dates for this year's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day sales event</a>. The 2025 iteration of the massive sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime members</a> kicks off July 8 and runs through July 11. The four-day window makes it the longest Prime Day sale yet. As the name suggests, Prime Day debuted as a 24-hour flash sale in 2015 before moving to a two-day structure in 2019. And now the sales event has doubled in size once again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a>.</p><h2>Amazon Prime Day 2025 Start/End Times</h2><p>Amazon Prime Day 2025 officially begins on Tuesday, July 8, at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. The sales event will run for a full 96 hours, ending on July 12 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET.</p><p>That said, Amazon offers early Prime Day deals in the lead-up to Prime Day every year. And depending on sale plans from other retailers, Prime Day-esque deals will likely be available on Monday, July 7, or even the weekend prior to the event. Amazon has a tendency to match competitors in the gaming, tech, and entertainment spaces.</p><hr><h2>Prime Day 2025 Deals: What to Expect</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463"></a><figcaption>Amazon Prime Day 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg"></figure><p>So, Prime Day 2025 is twice as long, does that mean twice as many deals? Probably not, no. It's more likely that the lengthened window just gives customers more time to shop. It also formalizes what has, in practice, been true for years at this point: Amazon Prime Day was already a week-long sales event.</p><p>Not officially, but with the plethora of early deals and so-called "anti-Prime Day" sales from competing retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, the annual summer sale has become Black Friday in July over the past few years.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime Day 2025 Early Deals</a></h2><p>Amazon has already started offering some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">early deals for Prime members</a>. Official early Prime Day deals, just like deals during the event, are exclusive to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime members</a>. Amazon Prime costs $15/month or $139 per year. New subscribers can get a 30-day trial that can be canceled at any time.

Amazon's early deals frequently include these devices and others.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Much like previous anthology books, <em>Dragon Delves</em> is set up to be a series of one to two session adventures. Perfect for those times between campaigns, when players need to reschedule and you want to quickly spin up a one-shot, or if you're just a group that plays intermittently.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Setting Off On An Adventure</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A brief summary of each of the adventures and the dragon they involve is below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Death At Sunset (Green Dragon) -</strong> Level 1 &amp; 2 adventure where players are asked to investigate the cause of corruption in a sacred forest.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Baker's Doesn't (Gold Dragon) -</strong> Level 3 adventure where players try to track down a confectionary arsonist by following literal breadcrumbs</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>The Will of Orcus (Silver Dragon) -</strong> Level 4 adventure investigating the strange activities of a cult in a demonic temple</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>For Whom the Void Calls (Brass Dragon) -</strong> Level 5 adventure where the party is called to the aid of a sentient Bag of Holding in a dragon's horde</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>The Dragon of Najkit (Bronze Dragon) -</strong> Level 7 adventure where the party investigates the source of shipwrecks heading to and from an island monastery</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>The Forbidden Vale (Red Dragon) -</strong> Level 9 adventure that sees the party investigating the motives of a Red Dragon starting wildfires</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Before the Storm (Black Dragon) - </strong>Level 10 adventure set in a seaside town where pirates are attacking</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Shivering Death (White Dragon) -</strong> Level 11 adventure where the party needs to recover the only known record of a ritual from the corpse of a frost giant to break an oncoming heat wave</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A Copper for a Song (Copper Dragon) -</strong> Level 12 adventure where you'll visit the lair of a dragon to recover a magical song to save the surrounding villages and farmland</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li aria-level="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Dragons of the Sandstone City (Blue Dragon) -</strong> Level 12 adventure where you need to escort a good Dragon egg into the lair of an evil Blue Dragon that took over a region.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is so much variety in these adventures that not only makes it more interesting and unique if you're moving through the adventures in order, but it also allows for one of these adventures to appear nearly anywhere your current party might be if you plan to add these to the mix.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-covers.jpg?itok=6YH_h7fS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-covers.jpg?itok=-MeWi91B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For the most part, the tone of the adventures is consistent, though the level 3 adventure is an interesting tonal shift. Sandwiched between a Green Dragon poisoning a sacred grove, and a Silver Dragon conflicting with a cult, there's a small adventure about a confectioner whose home is set on fire by a Gold Dragon named Briochebane.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It's a funny little Pixar adventure between high-fantasy that, as a one-shot, especially for younger players, could be a happy romp through adventure. For the party planning on going start to finish, it might be worth noting that one of these adventures has a tone a bit different from the rest. Even the artwork included is reminiscent of some of the concept art/2D assets you might have seen from Pixar titles.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Each Adventure Comes With A Resume</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>An incredible quality of life improvement for an anthology series like this is that each Adventure has one page at the start that summarizes pretty much everything a DM might want to know about if it's the kind of adventure they want to run. It almost feels like reading a resume.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>You have a clear indication of the level, how long it will take (normally just one to two sessions), where it could take place in your world, a very brief overview of the two-three key plot points, what monsters and other prep work should be gathered, and a list of key NPCs.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Key NPCs don't just list their name and species, but also what stat block is going to be used for them, and where you'll encounter them. This information kept close will allow you to keep an eye out for when they'll show up.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-adventure-summary-page.jpg?itok=0dnFBbTO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-delves-adventure-summary-page.jpg?itok=f9tSZddm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I love this idea, allowing a DM to cut down on certain prep work so that they can focus on the larger aspects of the game like familiarizing themselves with roleplay elements or the flow of the adventure.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For someone getting into playing <em>D&amp;D</em>, I couldn't recommend the Level 7 adventure, The Dragon of Najkit, more. The benefit of an adventure where you're on an island creates an adventure that's entirely contained. Navigating between the roleplay of monks and the dragon along with free exploration elements and a nice dungeon dive this is a fantastic all-rounder adventure.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The book describes ways that you can link each of the adventures together with the standard 'mysterious patron' option, but more enjoyable than that there's a way that is described to allow for the Egg that you'd obtain in the final adventure to be gifted early on and a goal of the adventure is to power it up by bringing it to a horde of every type of dragon before reaching the Blue Dragon's Lair.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A powerful MacGuffin that fuels the adventure and keeps the tone firmly rooted in dragons and magic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dd-dragon-dragon-art.jpg?itok=r9gc1zbu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dd-dragon-dragon-art.jpg?itok=0XyKYs-L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>Solo Adventuring</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>An interesting mechanic in <em>Dragon Delves</em> is that three of these adventures—Baker's Doesn't, The Dragon of Najkit, and A Copper for a Song—have also been provided with additional rules to allow it to be completed by a party of one. This format allows for one DM and one player.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Each of these adventures will recommend a set of stats that it's recommended that the player should have proficiency with and also indicate that the character should have the Blessing of the Lone Champion.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Blessing of the Lone Champion</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span><span><span>You gain the following benefits:</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Heroic Inspiration.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> You gain Heroic Inspiration when you finish a Short or Long Rest and whenever the DM has you roll Initiative.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Temporary Hit Points.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span> You gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 10 times your level when you gain this blessing and when you gain a level.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>How well this works is a different story. Depending on the abilities available to your character having additional HP might be of great use, but the usability of a Wizard with the same number of spell slots and 30 more HP is very different from the usability of a Barbarian with 30 more HP.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>I imagine if you're wanting to try this there might also be something valuable about bumping up the uses of 'x per Short/Long Rest' abilities too.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>History Of Dragons Through The Ages</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>A fun intermission between each of these adventures is the History of Dragons section. Leading into each adventure, there are 3-5 pages worth of images showing the history of how these kinds of dragons were depicted in the 50-year history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>This mixture of art and reference material over the years does a lot to prompt with different ideas of what a dragon could look like. Not wholly unlike the kinds of options that were provided to players in <em>The Practically Complete Guide To Dragons</em>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span>What Is Missing?</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It also might just be me wondering what happened, but for a Dragon-centric anthology book, the absence of Gem Dragonborn seems a little bit odd. They were included in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="728df0b1-b3fa-4f90-8845-ea6b9e8b9411" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-fizbans-treasury-of-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Fizban's Treasury of Dragons</em></a> and while I've expected their lore to be expanded upon, we've now had a number of dragon-centric books that don't mention them. I guess at this point I should just not expect them to show up?</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>It's also important to note that while this book contains a large quantity of adventures it's only going to be adventures found in this book. If you're looking for Dragon-themed feats, magical items, spells, or sub-classes then you won't find any of that in here.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span><span><span><span><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dragon Delves</em> Review | Final Thoughts</span></span></span></span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>As we step into the 51st year of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and the first full year since the release of the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="56eebec3-a321-4403-b71c-54e4edf91d0c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow">new Core Rulebooks</a> it's great to see that Wizards of the Coast is still doing a lot to add more Dragons into <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Like with all of the other anthology books, these are good for idea prompts, for quick sessions you can spin up, or for a somewhat patchwork campaign with a number of missions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Normally, it can be a bit difficult to say whether an anthology book should be added to your bookshelf but as this book is just adventures, and no additional mechanical elements have been added, I'd say if you're interested in running the adventures, then of course pick it up. If the adventures don't sound like something for you and your table, then this will be an easy book to pass on.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Users have noticed the system's back panel "slightly bulging"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Some would argue the real tests can only begin when a product is in the hands of consumers and while Nintendo likely ran every scenario it possibly could with the Switch 2 during in-house tests, certain issues are reportedly surfacing now that it's out in the wild.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/a-couple-of-switch-2-owners-are-already-reporting-expanded-back-panels-nintendo-investigates-possible-causes/">reported by Automaton</a>, some Switch 2 owners have noticed "slightly bulging" back panels on their new units. One individual on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l4oilq/switch_2_swollen_battery_check_the_backs_of_your/">Nintendo Switch subreddit known as 'tombyt3'</a> explains their own experience and how Nintendo is already supposedly investigating the case. Perhaps, unsurprisingly, it's believed to be linked to a possible "swollen battery" in the unit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just got my brand new Switch 2 delivered today and noticed the back panel was slightly bulging. Contacted Nintendo and they've confirmed it looks like swollen battery and have raised an investigative case into it.</p>
<p>I appreciate it's hard to see in the photo, but in person it's easily visible and running your hand over the back makes it even more obvious.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share in case anyone else is experiencing similar issues or has a buldge on the back and not sure if to return it or not - I've been advised by them to turn it off, put it back in the box and return to them ASAP as it could be a fire risk if left unnoticed.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is just a one off, but check yours if you haven't!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As mentioned by the source, "swelling" of lithium-ion batteries in these types of devices has happened before. It should be pretty easy to detect on your unit, as you'll be able to see a slight bulge on the back end of the system. Fortunately, this does not appear to be a widespread issue and is just a "couple" of cases right now (which Nintendo should be able to resolve), but it won't hurt to check if you're one of the millions of people who have already bought the system.</p>
<p>Our friends at Time Extension <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/have-you-checked-on-your-wii-u-gamepad-battery-recently">recently reported a similar situation playing out</a> with the batteries in older devices like Wii U GamePads, and it's occurred in the past with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/psa-check-your-psp-battery-right-now">other units such as Sony's PSP</a> and can be a "fire risk" as noted above.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo also released guides for Switch 2 users experiencing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/psa-if-you-have-a-switch-2-battery-charge-display-issue-heres-how-to-fix-it">"battery charge" display issues</a>, with step-by-step instructions on how to resolve the problem.</p>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ece3c903b0abf/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>In case you somehow missed it, Mario got a new voice actor alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a> in 2023 and he's a huge fan of the character.</p>
<p>Kevin Afghani has now returned to the iconic role once again in the new Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/KevinAfghani/status/1934736758157218002">he's taken to social media</a> to mention how it's been a "truly unbelievable experience" as the Mario Kart series was an "absolute pillar" of his childhood:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hearing myself in Mario Kart is truly an unbelievable experience. Mario Kart was an absolute pillar of my childhood. I cannot believe how lucky of a person I am to be able to be a part of games that mean so much to me."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He also hopes fans are having an "incredible time" with the new entry in the long-running kart racing series.</p>
<p>Afghani shared a similar comment when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> was released on the Switch last October, but has kept a relatively low profile since taking on the role. Kevin voices multiple other characters in the Mario universe including Luigi, Wario and Waluigi.</p>
<p>In some other Mario Kart news, the voice of Princess Peach has been replaced after an 18 year run.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/k-foodie-meets-j-foodie-tv-food-netflix-show-yutaka-matsushige-sung-si-kyung<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I feel like a lot of people's daily lives could be made better by sitting down and watching a new season of my favourite show on Netflix, <em>K-Foodie Meets J-Foodie</em>.</p><p>The name is the only thing terrible about it. A series originally made for Korean TV, it stars Yutaka Matsushige (<em>Solitary Gourmet</em>) and crooner Sung Si-kyung, with every episode following largely the same format: these two guys go to a restaurant (usually one they're a fan of or have some kind of history with), eat some food, talk about the food (and the culture surrounding it), knock back a beer or two and just...hang out.</p><p>As pedestrian as that sounds, it is <em>great</em>. The show doesn't care about production values or fancy graphics or expensive restaurants (though its HD close-ups of steaming ramen are mouth-watering). Its only focus is on these two bros talking about food in a very normal, albeit very enthusiastic way. Despite the pair's culinary credentials--<em>Solitary Gourmet</em> is a long-running food show and Sung has a whole YouTube channel devoted just to eating food--it's all very down-to-Earth, the series preferring to show you a graphic close-up of a man slurping soup followed by his moans of delight, than try to artfully describe the flavour like a professional critic.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="『隣の国のグルメイト』 予告編 - Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ccp2m0R9Nx8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I am not denigrating food critics here, just saying that this casual approach matches the show's style and its hosts perfectly. Outside of the spotlight they're just...two guys. They've got eccentricities, favourite foods, one drinks and the other doesn't, one goes silent eating yakiniku and the other hates it when he does that. It might use the word "foodie" twice in the title, but this is a show defined by a blossoming friendship, a cultural exchange between two men and two nations so close and yet in many ways far enough apart that a series like this constantly contrasting the two makes for such interesting television.</p><p>Where a lot of reality TV treats its stars as attractions in a human zoo, this show feels more like an invitation to a lovely day out, the camera often set so close to these men that you hear their slurps and feel them shifting in their seats. In a way that I think falls just on the healthy side of parasocial, <em>K-Foodie Meets J-Foodie</em> makes you the third cast member on the show, privy to every little secret and conversation, no matter how mundane.</p><p>Another cool thing about <em>K-Foodie Meets J-Foodie</em> is that, a few tourist traps aside, most of the places the pair visit aren't Michelin-starred or global names you might have seen on an Instagram reel; they're just cool little noodle places or BBQ joints they've been fans of, grew up with, lived near or heard about from friends. The series does not care one bit for our modern obsession with virality and THE BEST, instead falling back on older vibes--again, to match the hosts perfectly--like simply checking a place out because you heard it was good.</p><p>It's just such lovely, simple, feelgood television. There's no marketing here, no ads, no agendas, no grabs for attention or desperate claims of greatness. It's a show about nothing but friendship and food, two of the best things on the planet.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mindseye-rocket-boy-impressions-review-pc"><h3>MindsEye Fuckin’ Sucks, Man</h3></a><p>'It looks like a parody Game Awards trailer.

<p>A recent firmware update made the carts compatible</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/10d03a3e8abec/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo cracked down on piracy in all sorts of ways during the Switch generation and it's now reportedly taking action on the Switch 2.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nintendo-mig-ban-roms-mario-kart-1851784610">highlighted by Kotaku</a>, Nintendo is seemingly banning anyone found using the MIG Switch cartridge on its new hybrid system.</p>
<p>This flash cartridge (which allows users to load "backed up" or "pirated" games) recently received a firmware update – allowing it to load Switch games onto the Switch 2 via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-updates-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list">backwards compatibility</a> feature.</p>
<p>Some photos doing the rounds on Reddit and social media show <strong>Error Code: 2124-4508</strong> which apparently pops up after using this card when connected to the internet. It mentions how "the use of online services" has been "restricted by Nintendo".</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xyhlzs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1934637497985769875">"Legal dumps" with this specific card</a> are also claimed to be under fire:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My Switch 2 test has been banned, after using the MIG Switch [card] with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something. Similar reports on reddit are starting to come in."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although Nintendo seems to be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2hacks/comments/1lcv0wy/mig_flash_ban/">banning users from "online services"</a>, it does not appear to be taking the "nuclear option" according to the source.</p>

<p>"My Switch 2 was banned but my main Nintendo account is not banned. But I wouldn’t hold my breath. Just waiting at this point for Nintendo to drop the ban hammer on my account."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some users in the same threads responded to these accounts – mentioning how a ban shouldn't come as a surprise at this stage if you take your machine "online" with one of these cards.</p>
<p>News about this particular flash card <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/01/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-says-hes-not-involved-with-new-switch-flash-cart">surfaced in January of last year</a>. You can find out more in our previous coverage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-where-to-buy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Will you spend $70 or more?</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The price of Borderlands 4 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">officially confirmed this morning</a> as preorder listings for the upcoming game went live for the Standard, Deluxe Edition, and Super Deluxe Edition. The initial wave of preorders only included digital versions of the game, but Amazon has jumped in late in the day with the first round of physical copies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These new Amazon listings are currently only for the PS5 and Xbox versions of the game and only two editions are currently up for preorder: Standard and Super Deluxe. You can check out the preorder pages at the links below. The current release date is set for September 12, 2025 for the console and PC versions of the game. We do not yet have a release date for the Switch 2 version, but <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/faq/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it is coming</a> sometime in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Borderlands 4 - Physical Copies</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Standard Edition - $69.99</h3><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223086"><div id="223086" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard edition of the game is exactly what it sounds like, but you do get a preorder bonus if you make your purchase before the game releases. Alongside the game itself you'll receive the Gilded Glory Pack that features a Vault Hunter Skin, a Weapon Skin, and an Echo-4 Drone Skin. The only other bonus you get is Amazon's preorder price guarantee, which is only useful if Amazon ever drops the price before the game ships.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Super Deluxe Edition - $129.99</h3></div><div catalogid="28a64a86-ee8f-4f65-82e1-797e39965a10" id="223087"><div id="223087" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The super deluxe edition of the game includes the same Gilded Glory Pack as a preorder bonus. In addition to that you'll get the special edition game case and some other additional extra content included. Here's a quick rundown of what you'll get that's different from the standard edition:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin</li><li>Bounty Pack Bundle</li><li>Ornate Order Pack</li><li>Vault Hunter Pack</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">The Art of Borderlands 4 Is Also Up for Preorder</h3></div><div catalogid="fb8ef5f1-c9e0-48f9-bf13-2cc15119b5e0" id="223041"><div id="223041" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Art of Borderlands 4</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the two versions of the game you can now preorder on Amazon, there's also a pretty cool <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/art-of-borderlands-4-book-release-date-where-to-buy">art book that is set to release later</a> in September as well. The Art of Borderlands 4 is currently set to release on September 30, 2025 for $55. The book will feature 224 pages about the art and development of the upcoming game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Amazon's Preorder Price Guarantee?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've never actually preordered anything from Amazon before, it's worth noting that if you purchase this art book ahead of the release date, it includes Amazon's preorder price guarantee. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G4BRP7LCB9DSDNCR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon's own help page</a>, this means that if the price decreases between now and when the item ships, you'll pay the lowest price. So in this case, if any of these editions of the game get a discount before they actually start shipping then you'll pay whatever it dropped to rather than the full price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although not every preorder gets discounted, physical editions of games especially seem to rarely drop in price compared to other product categories.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 16, 2025 11:09 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-could-set-a-new-standard-for-fighting-game-collections<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest problems in fighting games is preservation. It doesn’t matter how good the game is, or how influential it was, or whether it’s a beloved classic or a flash in the pan or anything in-between. It’s just hard to play old fighting games on modern hardware. If you want to play any Tekken earlier than 7, you’d better have an old console hooked up. SoulCalibur? I hope you have a Switch 2 and/or the delisted re-releases or physical discs. The best version of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike? Still trapped on the Xbox 360 and PS3. And on and on and on it goes. Some have done better than others (Capcom, SNK, Arc System Works), but the reality is that a lot of the best, most important fighting games of yesteryear are lost to time or trapped on old hardware or saddled with bad ports that make them essentially unplayable at worst and deeply flawed at best. And that’s the best-case scenario. The ones that burned out or faded away? You probably can’t legally play them at all. Rest in peace, Masters of Teras Kasi fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the situation Digital Eclipse is stepping into with Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, a compilation of Mortal Kombat’s glory days from the early days. If Digital Eclipse seems like the right studio for this type of thing, it’s probably because they have a lot of history doing it, having made Tetris Forever, Atari 50: The Anniversary Collection, and, my personal favorite, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection, among many, many others. They know what they’re doing here; the only question will be execution.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The most important things, of course, are the games themselves. The classics are all here: Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat 3, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, Mortal Kombat 4. But it’s not just the arcade games. The console and handheld versions are here, too. If you prefer the sweaty SNES release of the original Mortal Kombat, it’s there for you. If you’re more into the gory Genesis game, that’s here, too. Me, I’m an arcade purist, but it’s nice that there are options here for people who aren’t, or who’d just like to see the different versions of each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The weird stuff is here, too. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But we’re not limited to the klassic (sorry) versions that everybody and their mama played. The weird stuff is here, too. That means the Game Boy Advance version of Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance is included, plus things like the 32X version of Mortal Kombat II and the Game Boy and Game Gear versions of the original Mortal Kombat. I didn’t even know they <em>made</em> a Game Boy version of the original Mortal Kombat, but it’s here for you if you want it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, every game in the Legacy Kollection will support online multiplayer with rollback netcode powered by GGPO, one of the best rollback solutions in the business. This release will mark the first time most of the games in this collection have online play. That’s meant a lot of extra work for Digital Eclipse (adding online play to fighting games that don’t already have it is a notoriously difficult undertaking), but if they can get it right, it’ll be an enormous accomplishment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Online play isn’t the only new deal in this package, though. Digital Eclipse is letting you unlock every secret with the touch of a button. That means characters, game settings, hidden developer menus, the whole enchilada. If you’d rather do things like unlock Reptile normally (seriously, go look up the process for that in the original MK just to remember how wild some of MK’s arcade secrets were), you can do that. But if you don’t want the hassle, every secret is at your fingertips.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I’m most looking forward to, however, is Digital Eclipse’s propensity for archival work, which will appear in the Legacy Kollection. That means interviews with the likes of Ed Boon, John Tobias, Dan Forden, John Vogel, and many, many more – but also archival stuff, like footage of the actors that was scanned into the game and the Mortal Kombat prequel comic book, written and illustrated by Tobias himself, that you could send away for by mail and is, like all collectors items, now prohibitively expensive to acquire. Throw in a timeline of the series that traces each character’s history and the story of MK’s various realms, and it sounds like the Legacy Kollection will have everything an oldhead MK fan (and young guns looking to learn the series history) could want. And as someone who grew up in the arcade with those games, I’m glad that they’ll be available for everyone. I’ll see you online in UMK3.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
