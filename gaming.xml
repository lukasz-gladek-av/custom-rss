            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24206836/arranger-puzzle-game-review-netflix-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>I first encountered <a href="https://arranger.quest/"><em>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</em></a> at the Netflix booth during Summer Game Fest. Within moments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">of settling in with the demo</a>, I was struck by the game’s clarity of conceit and purpose. You’re a little girl named Jemma, who, as she moves across a tiled world of columns and rows, moves objects with her. Puzzle shenanigans involving&nbsp;— if you’ll pardon the pun — <em>arranging</em> objects will undoubtedly ensue.</p><p><em>Arranger </em>is an “Oh... <em>oh</em>!” kind of puzzle game. It is deceptively simple, with clear objectives no more complicated than “use the pressure switch to unlock the door.” But the game’s simplicity of presentation obscures cleverly designed puzzles that tested my spatial awareness to its absolute limit, and I <em>loved</em> every second of it.&nbsp;</p><div><p>That spark of recognition, that eureka moment, is a priceless jolt of excitement that happens early and often</p></div><p>Early in the game, I was in an empty room with a pressure plate and a blocked door. Standing on the plate naturally unblocked the door, but when I moved off the plate, it slammed shut in my face. I tried every which way of <em>arranging</em> (sorry, this is gonna happen a lot) myself, thinking I could quickly hop off the plate and into the open door before it shut —but to no avail. Frustrated, I went back out the way I came thinking I’d missed some key item from an NPC, and by the doorway… there were two potted plants.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh!</em></p><p>Before I entered that room, those potted plants were a throwaway decoration. Coming out, I immediately gleaned their purpose. Playing <em>Arranger</em> feels like the first time a baby discovers that the square block goes into the square hole. That’s not to say the game is too easy; rather, it’s like you can feel yourself learning a new thing in real time. That spark of recognition, that eureka moment, is a priceless jolt of excitement that happens early and often.</p><p>When I’m playing, the click of the tiles as Jemma moves gets slower as I mutter “I think I got this” the closer I get to the objective. I know what has to happen. To beat this centipede boss, I must shove its spiky tail into its eye, but for every tile the tail gets closer, the eye moves a tile away like in a game of <em>Snake.</em> But there are stones in the boss arena, and I can wedge the centipede around the stones and...</p><p>Oh... <em>oh!</em></p><p>As rewarding as those moments are, though, they also work in reverse. The game’s antagonist is an affliction called “the static.” Objects affected by it essentially act as barriers. Jemma can’t move them the way she can other things, so if they’re in her way, she has to figure out a way to go around them. The static also spawns path-blocking monsters that can only be defeated if you push a sword into its space. A lot of <em>Arranger</em>’s puzzles involve moving a sword, Jemma, or mission-critical items around “static’d” objects.</p><div><figcaption><em>Combat in </em>Arranger<em> involves moving swords around and pushing them into enemies.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Furniture &amp; Mattress</cite></p></div><p>In one puzzle, I had to reassemble the pieces of a broken record, rotating the record around and filling each hole. Seemed easy enough. But when Jemma moves, every movable object on the same axis moves with her. So when I pushed in the last piece, another piece on the opposite side popped right out.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh! Shit.</em></p><p>A lot of the game’s puzzles start off just like that, easy right up until the end, when the curveball comes out of nowhere. But believe it or not, those moments felt good, too. With the record puzzle, once I saw that piece pop out, I started giggling. It was a feeling akin to putting your Crocs in “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/crocs-in-sport-mode">sport mode</a>.” This puzzle was harder than I expected, time to lock in. (And don’t worry, there are settings that let you skip puzzles if they’re too hard, settings to make puzzles harder, and a multiplayer mode that lets a friend move stuff, too.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Locked doors mean nothing to Jemma.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Furniture &amp; Mattress</cite></p></div><p>Though <em>Arranger</em> is a puzzle game, it effectively uses its mechanics to build an interesting world and tell a sweet story. Jemma’s movement ability makes her unique, and she goes on an adventure to find others like her, using her powers for good along the way. When Jemma reaches the end of a row or column, she warps around to the other end. She uses that feature to bust out a teenager trapped in their locked room by strict parents by simply pushing them into the opposite wall. In another area, she saves a town whose inhabitants have become moribund in their homes because they relied too much on communicating via blue mechanical birds.</p><p>Oh... <em>oh! Ha!</em></p><p><em>Arranger</em> is the video game equivalent of a book you’d take with you on a beach vacation — perfect for your Switch, Steam Deck, or tablet. It’s pleasantly short — I’m in the final area, and I’ve played around four to five hours total. If you’re adventurous, you can extend that playtime by completing the optional puzzles scattered throughout. I love this little game unlike anything I’ve played recently.</p><p>To really drive home how charmingly seductive <em>Arranger</em> is, let me leave you with a short story. It was 11PM on a weekday night. I decided to play some <em>Arranger</em> before heading to bed — nothing more than 30–45 minutes tops. When I put down my Switch to check the time, it was 1:51AM. <em>Two hours</em> had passed and I didn’t even feel it. Moreover, I didn’t care. A game hasn’t done that to me, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom">even ones I’ve adored</a>, in recent or distant memory. I felt like a kid again. Give <em>Arranger</em> the chance to do that to you.</p><p><small>Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure is out now on Switch, PlayStation, PC, and mobile via Netflix.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Remnant II’s Final DLC Is Coming In September]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/remnant-ii-final-dlc-the-dark-horizon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remnant-ii%E2%80%99s-final-dlc-is-coming-in-september.937929/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/remnant-ii-final-dlc-the-dark-horizon/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been an entire year since Remnant II was released, launching worldwide to a fairly positive reception and decent reviews. It’s a great game if you want to experience some mindless, visceral action, facing off against immense and at times grotesque bosses either alone or with friends. There’s also a decent story sitting at the heart of the game, along with some RPG elements and a pretty good loot loop to pursue.</p>



<p>Now that the game’s first anniversary has rolled around, the team at Gunfire Games has announced the impending arrival of the title’s third and final DLC: The Dark Horizon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expansive-dlc">‘The Most Expansive DLC’</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been a bad run for Remnant II, and a year is long enough for players to have soaked up everything the game has to offer. In September 2024, the game’s final DLC will be deployed – The Dark Horizon. It has been penned as the largest DLC the team has created thus far, but Gunfire Games admitted that it has been delayed by a few weeks. The original intention was to have all three DLCs released <strong>inside </strong>of one year.</p>



<p>Here’s what the team said in a statement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4364635226638976270" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on Steam</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our goal is for The Dark Horizon to be the most expansive DLC for Remnant II. Not only have we packed this DLC full of even more of the Remnant greatness you’ve come to expect, we’re also hard at work on a brand-new game mode that will be free for everyone that we’ll reveal soon along with a new progression system.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘brand-new game mode’ is being kept under wraps for now, but it’s likely the most considerable addition to the game that’ll be ushered in with The Dark Horizon. The team didn’t confirm a date for the release of The Dark Horizon, but given that the window is September, there won’t be all that long to wait.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">We are currently enjoying a golden age of fighting games. The latest in long-running series like Street Fighter, Tekken, and Guilty Gear are fantastic. Both newer (Dragon Ball FighterZ) and older games (Street Fighter 3rd Strike, Guilty Gear +R) are getting updates that add rollback netcode, enabling fans to enjoy the best player-to-player connections possible. And many new games are also being ported to nearly every platform, so it's easier than ever to play what you want, with who you want, when you want.</p><p dir="ltr">Some games have long been neglected and rendered unplayable on modern hardware, causing members of the fighting game community to call for developers to re-release or update them to be more accessible. Streamer Maximilian Dood's #FreeMVC2 movement is perhaps the most notable of these and, thankfully, this particular situation is about to be rectified. Marvel Vs. Capcom 2: New Age Of Heroes is coming back, ensuring the granddaddy of tag fighters will find a place in the hearts of brand-new fighting game players, not just the old heads.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics - Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The game is being released as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade/" data-ref-id="5000-632916">Marvel Vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>, which also includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter, Marvel Vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, and The Punisher.</p><p dir="ltr">I dabbled in MvC3 and have played thousands of hours of Dragon Ball FighterZ, a spiritual successor to MvC, but growing up, none of my local arcades (or friends' houses) had Marvel Vs. Capcom, so my access was limited. I was curious to see how these older games held up for someone like me, who has little nostalgia for them, but my fears were laid to rest when I started playing through each one. I spoke to MvC Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics producer Shuhei Matsumoto after playing, and he confirmed that newer players like me are a key part of the collection's target audience.</p><p dir="ltr">The preview build I played at Evo granted access to three games from the collection; X-Men: Children of the Atom, X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, and Marvel Vs. Capcom 2. So how do these games from 1994 to 2000 hold up? Quite well it seems. These games don't have the level of polish when it comes to balance in comparison to newer games, where players can expect most of the roster to be competitively viable and roughly equivalent in power, but the MvC games themselves have character and style in spades, and are still incredibly fun to play. And that sense of wildly unbalanced gameplay is part of its charm.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341209-ss_c8996e68f4bcbf5862e6dbad3bd7040d3e336b3d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341209" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341209-ss_c8996e68f4bcbf5862e6dbad3bd7040d3e336b3d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341209"></a><figcaption>All the games in the collection are faithful recreations of the original arcade games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341209-ss_c8996e68f4bcbf5862e6dbad3bd7040d3e336b3d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Fluid and responsive controls match the gorgeous sprite-based graphics in MvC2, and it's fast and easy to jump from one part of the collection to another. Games like X-Men: Children of the Atom and X-Men Vs. Street Fighter are slightly less chaotic, but attacks are still chunky and fun and movement is pretty dynamic. Characters are diverse in how they play, which is appropriate given the varied powers of the X-Men characters, and the fighting styles of the Street Fighter roster.</p><p dir="ltr">I played Iceman in Children of the Atom, and it was a blast calling down massive boulders of ice on opponents. Cyclops can shoot his optic blasts across the screen, and Storm can summon small whirlwinds and lightning, keeping enemies on their toes. Street Fighter characters generally play similarly to their Street Fighter 3 versions, with some notable differences. Ken's grounded fireball doesn't go fullscreen in every game, but much like Akuma in the mainline games, X:Men Vs. Street Fighter's Ken and Ryu can throw fireballs in the air, with Ryu's going straight ahead, and Ken's moving downwards at an angle.</p><p dir="ltr">For newer players, I recommend starting with X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, and Matsumoto-san recommends jumping into the similar Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter, or MvC2. Marvel Vs. Street Fighter is more focused, with a smaller roster and fewer things to think about, so players who have never tried any fighting games but the 1v1 ones (Street Fighter, Tekken, most Mortal Kombat games, etc.) would likely do better starting there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341211-ss_e5dfe2c49a8be44182906dc3065e6afb3b6eaa74.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341211-ss_e5dfe2c49a8be44182906dc3065e6afb3b6eaa74.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341211"></a><figcaption>You can't go wrong with Spider-Man.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341211-ss_e5dfe2c49a8be44182906dc3065e6afb3b6eaa74.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although the collection is releasing this year, Matsumoto-san said the team has been working with Marvel for three or four years to figure out when a collection like this could be released for modern platforms to bring it to new audiences. As the collection's title suggests, each game is a port of its arcade version. Matsumoto-san said the team thought very carefully about which versions to include, focusing on ones that were the most beloved by fans. I'm also pleased to say that, instead of being a simple port, this collection is robust and the team has included quite a few quality of life improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">Each game has a special menu you can access before you launch, for example, letting you adjust settings on everything from arcade screen scan lines to aspect ratios, and use or hide different sidebar art. Accessibility options have been added, too, including single player difficulties, flashing light reduction, the ability to change which coin mode you use, secret character and hidden color toggles. One-button supers are also available for people who want to jump in and start beating up their friends without learning standard inputs, or lack the physical dexterity to do so. Quick save and quick load functions also mean you can stop playing and pick back up where you left off.</p><p dir="ltr">A training mode is also available, and while it isn't as robust as the one in Street Fighter 6 (a high bar to clear, to be sure), it does have startup information for moves, hitboxes, hurtboxes, and input readouts, making it much easier to get started and work out new combos and situations. You can also go into training mode with two players, which is nice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341212-ss_c64a74a048b4d304df78f9e7e2630c9f71cde666.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341212-ss_c64a74a048b4d304df78f9e7e2630c9f71cde666.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341212"></a><figcaption>Years later, it's still funny seeing Hulk get tossed around like a rag doll.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341212-ss_c64a74a048b4d304df78f9e7e2630c9f71cde666.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Some other changes have been made to better align the content of the game with modern day standards. Matsumoto-san said the team modified certain parts of the game which would impact the rating, such as altering "expressions or content that may not be appropriate for modern times." But game balance and gameplay elements are "faithfully reproduced for modern platforms."</p><p dir="ltr">Much like other Capcom collections, (such as the Mega Man Legacy Collection) Matsumoto-san confirmed the Marvel Vs. Capcom Collection includes "a gallery where you can check out some of the design documentation from when those original games were being made, past promotional illustrations and music." A music player will allow players to listen to the soundtrack of each of the games, and legacy art and assets are included, too.</p><p dir="ltr">I wasn't able to try out the online play, so I can't say how the netcode will stand up yet, but if Capcom's previous work on Street Fighter 6 is any indication, we're in for a buttery smooth online experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341213-ss_f3d158a9107b645e32db9245ebcd12ee7fa8e8bf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341213-ss_f3d158a9107b645e32db9245ebcd12ee7fa8e8bf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4341213"></a><figcaption>So many of the mechanics and features that are popular in tag-team fighters today were popularized in MvC games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4341213-ss_f3d158a9107b645e32db9245ebcd12ee7fa8e8bf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So what does this collection mean for the future of Marvel Vs. Capcom? Well, if the collection sells well, we may see another new Marvel Vs. Capcom game. I asked Matsumoto-san what he would do with that opportunity, whether he had an idea for what new characters he would want to include, and which gameplay elements they would add or subtract from previous entries. He said, "The hardest thing to decide on would definitely be the character choice, because you look at Marvel's roster now and there's a lot more characters now than there were back 20, 30 years ago. My impression of these MvC-type games is that it's almost like… ‘have fun, [be] cheerful, almost like a party,' with all these different characters and personalities and I think that aspect is something that's important to the series, and should be maintained."</p><p dir="ltr">"It also has to be fun for kids," he continued. "Kids gravitate towards their favorite superheroes, and they want to play with those superheroes. So given that opportunity, it's important to the series." This was certainly true for me. The first character I put on my MvC2 team was Spider-Man, my second favorite superhero ever. Coincidentally, the shirt I wore to the interview bore the symbol of my #1 superhero, Superman. Matsumoto-san laughed about it when I told him, saying "We probably wouldn't be able to include him," before going on to joke, "Guest character!" While we may never get Marvel Vs. Capcom Vs. DC (or Marvel Vs. Capcom Vs. DC Vs. Dragon Ball, as we joked about afterwards), the future's looking bright for this crossover fighting game series.</p><p dir="ltr">Player love for Marvel Vs/ Capcom has been strong for a long time, and lines were long to play the collection on the Evo show floor, showing the enthusiasm is still there. From my preview time, that love is shared by Capcom, which is putting a good foot forward with this (so far) high quality collection. With that in mind, I asked Matsumoto-san what he thought about the current state of fighting games, particularly considering newer games--like 2XKO and Dragon Ball FighterZ--clearly draw some inspiration from what Capcom had previously done with MvC. When I told him I felt we are in a new golden age, he said, "I definitely agree with your own impression" and that, with HunterXHunter and 2XKO, he hopes to see more people become interested in fighting games.</p><p dir="ltr">As far as I'm concerned, Matsumoto and the team at Capcom are doing their part by putting out this collection. I'm looking forward to playing more (and trying to convince all my friends to join me online) when it comes out later this year.</p>

			<p>Koei Tecmo has officially announced the first story line details for their new <a href="https://wccftech.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-brings-back-1v1k-action-in-2025/">upcoming action game</a> Dynasty Warriors: Origins. This game is slated for release in 2025 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Koei Tecmo has promised that this game will be the most jam-packed and intense action game out of any of the Warriors games already available on the market. Players engage in a 1 vs 1,000 action set in 183 AD.</p>
<p>This game introduces you to a heroic warrior who has to fight off waves of enemies on the battlefields of the ancient Three Kingdoms. The story takes place one year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion, where players are introduced to the protagonist suffering from amnesia and heading to a village suffering from famine.</p>
<p>In the village, the protagonist meets a man called Zhang Jiao, who is offering a helping hand to the people, and Guan Yu, who is denouncing the government officials. As a trio, they fight against the forces of corrupt powers, where the officials raise taxes, commit embezzlement, and find many ways to inflict suffering on the people in the villages.</p>
<p>This game features the largest number of soldiers in the series to date, with enemy soldiers attacking in cooperation to make a formidable opponent, give players a real sense of challenge, and force them to make tactical decisions to beat their opponent. While you control one person, you are responsible for an entire army, and you'll have to fight against thousands of enemies on the battlefield while utilizing your skills.</p>
<p>Certain battles will require you to meet specific conditions. While working on completing them, you can temporarily take control of Guan Yu and other companions that will accompany you on the battlefield. Players are given free roam in the game and the choice of where they want to go. They can choose which battlefield they want to go to next.</p>
<p>So that fans can see what to expect from Dynasty Warriors: Origins, the general producer Akihiro Suzuki has collaborated with producer Tomohiko Sho to produce a video that outlines their expectations for Dynasty Warriors: Origins, which can be watched<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPpGffZEkgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> on YouTube</a>. However, the YouTube video is in Japanese, and no captions or translations are available. Although many people won't be able to understand what is being said in the video, the video does showcase some of the gameplay that players can expect to see in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>

Which means you still have a great excuse to stay indoors where it’s cool and dark, and where electricity abundantly flows for us to power our gaming machines. </p><p>This weekend we’re taking a look at a few games that have come out in recent years, as well as a few more recent ones too. Whether you’re looking to jump into a colossal new galaxy, an epic Japanese gangster saga, or a DOS-game classic, we think these picks are well worth your time. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-recommend-id="image://f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-recommend-id="image://f50a6f089df15e5e6bee8a8bf7a963a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kiryu punches a guy while money flies on screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Windows (Steam Deck: OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Not burning myself out on it</p><p>I’ve <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-friction-new-game-features-mechanics-1851602899">finally picked up <em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span><em> </em>and I don’t want to put it down, but I’ve been forcing myself to. As enthralling as it is, and as much fun as I’m having in 1980s Japan, these games are far too easy to burn out on, and I think that’s why I’m always hesitant to go all in on them. I first played <em>Judgment </em>after a bad breakup, and proceeded to devote every mind-numbing minute of the next few weeks to that game. I was physically exhausted from planting my ass on the couch for hours on end. <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon </em>came out two months later, and I played it till I felt empty inside and couldn’t stomach it anymore. To this day, I still haven’t beaten it.</p><p>I wound up reviewing both <em>Like a Dragon Gaiden </em>and <em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em>, and while the former was a much more relaxed (and thankfully brief experience) the latter nearly burnt me out at the very start of the year. These games are immense and all-consuming, which is both great and terrifying depending on the light in which you’re looking at it. Despite it all, I love this series and I want to experience the rest of Kiryu’s story from the beginning, so here we are. I’m a few chapters in, and enjoying the meticulous pace at which I’m absorbing the game. It’s like tuning in for a new episode of my favorite show every few nights. Given that it’s the weekend though, I’m planning on marathoning a few more installments than usual, while trying to make sure it doesn’t do too much psychic damage, or deprive me of water, food, some sunlight, and time with friends. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-recommend-id="image://4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Sun</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-recommend-id="image://4aeb102447bae001b4d193a48e696445" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand at the ready on a castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Complete the existing campaign </p><p>I’ve had a hard time putting <em>Cataclismo</em> down and even when I do I’m still thinking about it.

It’s in Early Access and rough around the edges still—lots of missing quality of life features and some annoying bugs—but the bones are there and fantastic. You build towering defenses during the day and survive onslaughts of horrors at night. The aesthetic feels a bit like water color <em>Gormenghast</em> fan art, and the mood is post-apocalyptic gothic punk. One of the nicest features is that there are automatic time anchors at regular intervals. If you lose, the game makes it easy to navigate back to previous points in a match to fix your mistakes and chart a different course. It’s not quite save-scumming and it’s a big time saver. If you like building thick stone walls and ridiculously precarious medieval shanty towns, this is the game for you. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-recommend-id="image://6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-recommend-id="image://6e8871bd5577aad2e378709ab5741e82" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character shoots aggressive enemies with a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Get past the fourth stage</p><p>When <em>Void Bastards</em> came out in 2019, I was super excited to play it, and then for reasons I’m not quite clear on, bounced off hard. However, this week I was playing a preview build of its spiritual successor, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, and went back to the first to see how much overlap there is between the two roguelite shooters.</p><p>It turns out, apart from the wonderfully distinctive art-style, not a huge number. Both are games where you need to progress along <em>Slay The Spire</em>-style pathways, completing FPS challenges and gathering resources. But after that, they really have a distinct feel. <em>Void Bastards</em> is about exploring spaceships to steal useful items, and shoot the violent residents, desperately trying to return to your airlock before you run out of air or blood.</p><p>Replaying it this time, however, I’m totally in love. I accidentally stayed up playing until 1am last night. I’m planning to play it this weekend too.

That’s as good as a reason as any to go play one of the best tactical RPGs ever made. If you’ve played it before or if you’ve never touched a<em> Fire Emblem</em> game in your life, you should still probably play some of <em>Three Houses</em> this weekend in celebration. </p><p><br><em>Three Houses</em> puts you in the shoes of a professor at the Garreg Mach Monastery officer’s school, and gives you the choice of which of the titular three houses to control. Each house has a charismatic leader and a loveable cast of students.

The tactical combat also delivers. It’s pretty standard tactical fare but it’s executed well—it’s never overtly punishing or too easy.

And this year, it wasn’t Steam’s legendary summer sale that had me lusting to expand my library, but the one over at GOG.com. For whatever reason, lately I’ve been feeling the itch to experience older PC classics I missed out on when they first released, or to return to ones I never finished, and so this summer saw my GOG library expand to the tune of dozens of games, all picked up on the cheap. </p><p>And right now, the game in my GOG library that’s calling to me like no other is <em>Ultima Underworld</em>, the absolutely remarkable 1992 first-person role-playing game that made you feel immersed in its environments like no game had before. Considered by some the first example of an immersive sim, <em>Ultima Underworld </em>has had a level of influence and impact on the medium that few games can match. And although, of course, by today’s standards it all looks and feels pretty basic, for me there’s something really compelling about it all—the charm of its interface, with that gargoyle sneering over the gameplay window; the way the jagged, pixel-y graphics just make the stones of the dungeon look that more rough-hewn; the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sound Blaster</a></span>-ass music, which adapts on the fly to the kind of situation you’re in.

Though I appreciated and didn’t mind the state the game shipped in in 2016, a busy life kept me from sinking any meaningfully sustained time into this near-endless virtual galaxy.

It’s wonderful. The scale of this world also just makes me feel so small (especially in VR) and instills that joyous sense of wonder that I get from watching vintage <em>Cosmos</em> while, um, well. Under the influence of. Uh. stuff. And though I do wish the graphics were a touch more photorealistic, I’ve learned to love <em>NMS</em>’ cartoony, overly colorful look, especially on a vibrant screen where the very red grass of the planet I’ve been covering every inch of just pops with life. </p><p><br>Does the game still feel a little hollow in some ways? Sure. Could it have More To Do™, sure. (Past Expeditions, actually, <em>should</em> still be available to play). But ya’ll, just vibing in digital spaces is a valid way to enjoy one’s time. I don’t need to be chewing through content all the goddamn time. I like that <em>NMS</em> exists as a refuge for that. — Claire Jackson  </p><hr><p>And that wraps up our picks for this weekend.

<p>The game features 100 dateable everyday objects, each of which are brought to life by a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">(human) voice actor</a>. The voice cast includes quite a few well-known names, including Johnny Young Bosch, Felicia Day, Grey DeLisle, and more. Each romance has three different outcomes--the player can become the object's lover, their friend, or even their mortal enemy.</p><p dir="ltr">The 3D overworld changes as the game progresses, and according to Sassy Chap devs, these changes are based on the player's in-game decisions, suggesting some objects may not be so eager to serve their original purpose if the player burns them romantically. It's not hard to imagine the intense (and incredibly inconvenient) consequences of experiencing a bitter breakup with your refrigerator, and it's likely that hell hath no fury like a toaster scorned.</p><p dir="ltr">Date Everything also features:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Over four hours of original music, with each dateable item featuring a unique musical theme</li><li dir="ltr">1.2 million words and 70,000 lines of voiced dialogue</li><li dir="ltr">Over 11,000 hand-drawn images</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sassy Chap Games has yet to announce a release date for the game, but we do know that upon release, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/07/26/netflixs-bioshock-film-now-has-a-smaller-scope-due-to-budget-cuts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Netflix’s upcoming film adaptation of Bioshock is still happening, but it won’t be as grand as originally planned. During a panel at the San Diego Comic-Con yesterday, the film’s director and producer revealed the movie now has a reduced scope due to budget cuts.</p>

<p>As reported by <em><a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/bioshock-movie-scaled-down-netflix-more-personal-1236085711/">Variety</a></em>, producer Roy Lee (<em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em>, <em>The Lego Movie</em>) revealed during Collider’s Producers on Producers panel that since the film’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/15/netflix-partnering-with-take-two-on-a-bioshock-film">announcement</a> in February 2022, a regime change at Netflix has affected the project. Netflix’s film chief at that time, Scott Stuber, has since been replaced by Dan Lin. While Stuber emphasized large spending for an expansive film slate, Lin has scaled back to a more modest strategy. This means the Bioshock film’s budget has been reduced, with director Francis Lawrence (<em>I Am Legend</em>, <em>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire</em>) stating its been reworked as a “more personal film”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Roy Lee said. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. … It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p>

<p>A partnership between Netflix, Bioshock publisher Take-Two Interactive, and Vertigo Entertainment is bringing the Bioshock film to life.&nbsp;In addition to Lawrence and Lee serving as director and producer, respectively, Michael Green (<em>Loga</em>, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, <em>American Gods</em>) was announced as its writer in <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2022/08/25/netflix-has-found-a-director-and-writer-for-its-bioshock-movie">August 2022</a>.</p>

At tier five, weapons require Special Plastics and Automatic Parts—two rare resources that will be the bane of your gameplay until you learn the farming methods for each.</p><p>On top of weapon crafting, you’ll also need Automatic Parts for weapon calibration, which takes your weapons and improves upon them. By spending resources to calibrate your favorite weapons, you’ll increase their power level to a maximum of four, increasing the overall damage and occasionally adding attributes to your firearms.</p><h2 id="h15915"><a id="find"></a>Where to find Automatic Parts in <em>Once Human</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-recommend-id="image://8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Grass grows on the street of an abandoned city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grass grows on the street of an abandoned city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-recommend-id="image://8ba2451b0ffa634fb656b33aebfcee34" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Grass grows on the street of an abandoned city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can find Automatic Parts in <em>Once Human</em> from high-level zones, such as:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Blackfell Fallen Zone - Red Sands (Level 41)</li><li>Blackfell Oil Fields - Red Sands (Level 43)</li><li>Fort Eyrie - Red Sands (Level 45)</li><li>Forsaken Monolith Danger Zone - Red Sands (Level 50)</li></ul><p>Are you noticing a trend?

<p>The open beta for Valorant on Xbox Series  X|S is now available. Microsoft and Riot Games <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/26/valorant-console-open-beta-xbox-series-x-s/">confirmed the release</a> via a post on Xbox Wire Friday morning.</p>



<p>In the post announcing the beta’s launch, it was discussed why the game’s move to console was “no simple port”.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="VALORANT CONSOLE ANNOUNCE // Gameplay Trailer - VALORANT" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAkFklRvhjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“Riot is sparing no effort in bringing the title to Xbox,” Xbox’s Evan Shamoon says. <br>“Primarily, that comes through reproducing the finely-tuned balance that’s made the PC title such a hit – the team went through many iterations of translating the original mouse-and-keyboard controls to gamepad input.”</p>



<p>“We’re getting to the starting line as we like to say,” executive producer Andy Ho told Shamoon. “This is a game that we don’t have an end date in mind for. We want to invest in it on an infinite horizon, so that players feel like their investment into the game is always going to be worth it.”</p>



<p>Valorant has already had a beta on PlayStation 5 back in June, and it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/VALORANT/comments/1djfqps/console_beta_is_too_fire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">received positive reviews</a> from players. Once the Xbox beta is complete, there should be more of an idea as to when the full release of Valorant on consoles will come.</p>



<p>If you do play in the Xbox beta and are a Xbox Game Pass subscriber, you will have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-members-get-extra-valorant-perks-riot-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">access to all agents</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cambridge-dictionary%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-words-are-kind-of-a-mess.937824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-gaming-words<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Cambridge Dictionary has shared a list of over 3000 words it's added to its dictionary this year, and the new words under the gaming category are...questionable, to say the least.</p>
<p>In a post on its website, the Cambridge Dictionary runs down some of the new words it's added to its ranks so far in 2024, with categories like "slang and informal language", "music", and "modern life" all getting new additions.</p>
<p>Of course, "gaming" is also one of the categories, and new words that have been added to the dictionary in this vein this year include "MMORPG", "PvP", and "speedrun", to name but a few.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-cambridge-dictionary-mmorpg.jpg?itok=q6nIM3RZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-cambridge-dictionary-mmorpg.jpg?itok=E0XzzYDi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"MMORPG" is one of the Cambridge Dictionary's new words.</figcaption></figure><p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines "speedrun" as completing a game "as quickly as possible, especially by taking advantage of any glitches", which is mostly fine.</p>
<p>"Side quest", meanwhile, is defined as "a part of a computer game that hs its own aim and story but is not part of the main game". I guess we can let that one slide, although there are plenty of pedantic things we could say about it.</p>
<p>Things get a little weird, though, when we look at the Dictionary's definition for "PvP". The definition itself is a touch wobbly, referring to a game in which "there are many players who are each other's opponents", which feels a bit off. Is&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>not a PvP game when played offline?</p>
<p>The example, though, is where things break down a little. The Dictionary's example reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don’t enjoy PvP, how about PvE, or “player versus engine”?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Obviously, that's not what PvE stands for, but the strange thing is that the Cambridge Dictionary does get this right on the <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pve" rel="noopener" target="_blank">actual definition page for PvE</a>, referring to "player versus environment". How strange!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-cambridge-dictionary.jpg?itok=pl0Cv8yQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-cambridge-dictionary.jpg?itok=GY5Rnn2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>might struggle to qualify as a PvP game under the Cambridge Dictionary's definition.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not all, though. The Cambridge Dictionary lists "backread" as one of its online gaming-related words, but the definition of backread simply relates to scrolling through a backlog of group messages to catch up with the latest info.</p>
<p>"Backread" doesn't feel like an explicitly gaming-related word, which is probably why it also appears in the "internet" category, but "review bomb", which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic">almost inarguably</a> applies to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-review-bomb-privacy-netease-response">games as well</a>, seems absent from the gaming word group. Hmm.</p>
<p>I'm just ribbing the Cambridge Dictionary, but its list of new words is genuinely fascinating, so make sure to check out <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/news-and-insights/news/cambridge-dictionary-new-words-2024#group-section-Gaming-Ph8PE2Sagz" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the blog post</a> for a few more, including amusing entries like "chef's kiss", "porch piracy", and "microsleep".</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/26/24206529/intel-13th-14th-gen-crashing-instability-cpu-voltage-q-a<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Monday, it initially seemed like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24203959/intel-core-13th-14th-gen-cpu-crash-update-patch">beginning of the end for Intel’s desktop CPU instability woes</a> — the company confirmed a patch is coming in mid-August that should address the “root cause” of exposure to elevated voltage. But if your 13th or 14th Gen Intel Core processor is already crashing, that patch apparently won’t fix it. </p><p>Citing unnamed sources,<em> </em><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-finally-announces-a-solution-for-cpu-crashing-errors-claims-elevated-voltages-are-the-root-cause-fix-coming-by-mid-august"><em>Tom’s Hardware </em>reports</a> that any degradation of the processor is irreversible, and an Intel spokesperson did not deny that when we asked. Intel is “confident” the patch will keep it from happening in the first place. (As another preventative measure, you should update your motherboard BIOS ASAP.) But if your defective CPU has been damaged, your best option is to replace it instead of tweaking BIOS settings to try and alleviate the problems. </p><p>And, Intel confirms, too-high voltages aren’t the only reason some of these chips are failing. Intel spokesperson Thomas Hannaford confirms it’s <em>a</em> primary cause, but the company is still investigating. Intel community manager Lex Hoyos also revealed some instability reports can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1e9mf04/comment/lefz09c/">traced back to an oxidization manufacturing issue</a> that was fixed at an unspecified date last year.</p><p>This raises lots of questions. Will Intel recall these chips? Extend their warranty? Replace them no questions asked? Pause sales <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205416/amd-zen-5-ryzen-9000-desktop-delay">like AMD just did</a> with its Ryzen 9000? Identify faulty batches with the manufacturing defect?   </p><p>We asked Intel these questions, and I’m not sure you’re going to like the answers. </p><div><p>Why are these still on sale without so much as an extended warranty?</p></div><p>Intel has not halted sales or clawed back any inventory. It will not do a recall, period. The company is not currently commenting on whether or how it might extend its warranty. It would not share estimates with <em>The Verge</em> of how many chips are likely to be irreversibly impacted, and it did not explain why it’s continuing to sell these chips ahead of any fix. </p><p>Intel’s not yet telling us how warranty replacements will work beyond trying customer support again if you’ve previously been rejected. It did not explain how it will contact customers with these chips to warn them about the issue.</p><p>But Intel <em>does</em> tell us it’s “confident” that you don’t need to worry about invisible degradation. If you’re not currently experiencing issues, the patch “will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service.” (If you don’t know if you’re experiencing issues, Intel currently suggests <a href="https://youtu.be/wkrOYfmXhIc?si=XzCym6UjLcF3_yW2&amp;t=497">the Robeytech test</a>.)</p><p>And, perhaps for the first time, Intel has confirmed just how broad this issue could possibly be. The elevated voltages could potentially affect any 13th or 14th Gen desktop processor that consumes 65W or more power, not just the highest i9-series chips that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation">initially seemed to be experiencing the issue</a>.</p><p>Here are the questions we asked Intel and the answers we’ve received by email from Intel’s Hannaford:</p><p><strong>How many chips does&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;estimate are likely to be irreversibly impacted by these issues?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;Core 13th and 14th Generation desktop processors with 65W or higher base power – including K/KF/KS and 65W non-K variants – could be affected by the elevated voltages issue. However, this does not mean that all processors listed are (or will be) impacted by the elevated voltages issue.</p><p>Intel&nbsp;continues validation to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;regarding its Core 13th and 14th Gen desktop processors are addressed.</p><p>For customers who are or have been experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors,&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;continues advising them to reach out to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Customer Support for further assistance. Additionally, if customers have experienced these instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors but had RMA [return merchandise authorization] requests rejected we ask that they reach out to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Customer Support for further assistance and remediation.</p><p><strong>Will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;issue a recall?</strong></p><p>No.</p><p><strong>Will Intel proactively warn buyers of these chips about the warning signs or that this update is required? If so, how will it warn them?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;targets to release a production microcode update to OEM/ODM customers by mid-August or sooner and will share additional details on the microcode patch at that time.</p><p>Intel&nbsp;is investigating options to easily identify affected processors on end user systems. In the interim, as a general best practice&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;recommends that users adhere to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Default Settings on their desktop processors, along with ensuring their BIOS is up to date.</p><p><strong>Has&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;halted sales and / or performed any channel inventory recalls while it validates the update?</strong></p><p>No.</p><p><strong>Does&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;anticipate the fix will be effective for chips that have already been in service but are not yet experiencing symptoms (i.e., invisible degradation)? Are those CPUs just living on borrowed time?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;is confident that the microcode patch will be an effective preventative solution for processors already in service, though validation continues to ensure that scenarios of instability reported to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;regarding its Core 13th/14th Gen desktop processors are addressed.</p><p>Intel&nbsp;is investigating options to easily identify affected or at-risk processors on end user systems.</p><p>It is&nbsp;<em>possible</em>&nbsp;the patch will provide some instability improvements to currently impacted processors; however customers experiencing instability on their 13th or 14th Generation desktop processor-based systems should contact&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;customer support for further assistance.</p><p><strong>Will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;extend its warranty on these 13th Gen and 14th Gen parts, and for how long?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>[No answer yet.]</p><p><strong>Given how difficult this issue was for&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;to pin down, what&nbsp;proof will customers need to share to obtain an RMA?&nbsp;(How lenient will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;be?)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>[No answer yet.]</p><p><strong>What will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;do for 13th Gen buyers after supply of 13th Gen parts runs out? Final shipments were set to end last month,&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-axes-13th-gen-core-i5-i7-i9-k-series-cpus-lineup-will-be-discontinued-by-may-24th-2024"><strong>I’m reading</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;is committed to making sure all customers who have or are currently experiencing instability symptoms on their 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors are supported in the exchange process. This includes working with&nbsp;Intel’s retail and channel customers to ensure end users are taken care of regarding instability symptoms with their&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Core 13th and/or 14th Gen desktop processors.</p><p><strong>What will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;do for 14th Gen buyers after supply of 14th Gen parts run out?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Same as above.</p><p><strong>Will replacement / RMA’d chips ship with the microcode update preapplied beginning in August? Is&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;still shipping replacement chips ahead of that update?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;will be applying to microcode to 13th/14th Gen desktop processors that are not yet shipped once the production patch is released to OEM/ODM partners (targeting mid-August or sooner). For 13th /14th Gen desktop processors already in service, users will need to apply the patch via BIOS update once available.</p><p><strong>What, if anything, can customers do to slow or stop degradation&nbsp;ahead of the microcode update?</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;recommends that users adhere to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Default Settings on their desktop processors, along with ensuring their BIOS is up to date. Once the microcode patch is released to&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;partners, we advise users check for the relevant BIOS updates.</p><p><strong>Will&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;share specific manufacturing dates and serial number ranges for the oxidized processors so mission-critical businesses can selectively rip and replace?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Intel&nbsp;will continue working with its customers on Via Oxidation-related reports and ensure that they are fully supported in the exchange process.</p><div><p><strong>Why does&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;believe the instability issues </strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/intel/comments/1e9mf04/comment/lekoj61/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><strong>do not affect mobile laptop chips</strong></a><strong>?&nbsp;</strong></p></div><p>Intel&nbsp;is continuing its investigation to ensure that reported instability scenarios on&nbsp;Intel&nbsp;Core 13th/14th Gen processors are properly addressed.</p><p>This includes ongoing analysis to confirm the primary factors preventing 13th / 14th Gen mobile processor exposure to the same instability issue as the 13th/14th Gen desktop processors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That’s all we’ve heard from Intel so far, though Hannaford assured us more answers are on the way and that the company is working on remedies. </p><p>Again, if your CPU is already damaged, you need to get Intel to replace it, and if Intel won’t do so, please let us know. In the meanwhile, you’ll want to update your BIOS as soon as possible because your processor could potentially be invisibly damaging itself — and if you know your way around a BIOS, you may want to adjust your motherboard to Intel’s default performance profiles, too.</p><p>Lastly, here is that Robeytech video that Intel is recommending to Redditors to potentially help them identify if their chip has an issue. Intel says it’s looking into other ways to identify that, too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-update-to-morrowind-like-rpg-dread-delusion-adds-a-big-nautilus-with-a-town-built-inside-its-shell<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>In a recent interview, the director of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> said that if you made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a> today, it would struggle to find an audience. "If you play that right now," he said, "there is no compass, no map, literally the quests are like 'go to the third tree on the right and walk 50 paces west'... And if you did that now, no one would play it. Very few people would play it." Well sir, have you heard of a little open world RPG called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>? It's pretty good. And what's more, it has just added a whole new area with - let me see - a giant floating squid creature with an entire town of citizens living inside its shell. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This "final content update" will add the Cephalok, "a magical creature filled with rare materials, where legends tell of some Wikkans who built a castle inside of its shell." To get inside the floating beast you'll need to have unlocked the airship. Naturally, there'll be some new enemies to deal with, but also "powerful, late-game items" like weapons and equipment, plus "new airship components to further customize your flying vessel".</p>
<p>There's also a "hard mode" included in the update, which will see your attacks and spells costing more stamina and mana to perform, while enemies will also hit harder and attack in groups. Items and ingredients will also be rarer, say developers Lovely Hellplace, which presumably means you'll have to be more judicious about healing and such. All this comes after last week's big performance patch, which fixed a lot of smaller things like FPS drops when entering new regions.</p>
<p>I admit picking on TESO director Matt Firor's quote from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-the-checklist-conquered-the-open-world-from-morrowind-to-skyrim">Edwin's recent musings on the open world genre</a> is not entirely fair. For one thing, there is a map <em>and</em> a compass in Dread Delusion. It's not a particularly clear map (a big ongoing quest involves finding the landmarks required to fill in all the blank spaces for the cartographer's guild). But it is one concession to players keen to experience the Morrowindy RPG without getting hopelessly lost. That aside, Dread Delusion is a game that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/who-needs-a-morrowind-remake-when-you-can-explore-the-beautiful-nightmare-of-dread-delusion">trusts the player to discover the weirdness of its world</a> at their own pace. It takes an old-school approach that modern open world games (like those from Bethesda) don't follow because, as Firor's words suggest, they are often preoccupied with selling to a broad audience. </p>
<p>Dread Delusion doesn't want a broad audience. It wants the kind of people who think mushrooms ought to be twelve feet tall and luminous. It wants an audience of sickos who will pledge allegiance to a moaning god suspended from the rafters of an abandoned house like a sac of spider eggs. It desires a player who will see a giant nautilus floating in the sky and think: "I bet there's something weird inside that big lad."</p>

And not long thereafter, the entire development staff of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> formed the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/over-500-blizzard-entertainment-workers-form-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft Game Makers Guild</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at Blizzard Entertainment, another Microsoft-owned company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about the organization movement sweeping our industry, Game Developer Senior Editor Bryant Francis spoke to Emma Kinema of the Communications Workers of America, which spearheaded both of this week’s accomplishments, as well as Autumn Mitchell and Chris Lusco of Bethesda Softworks, to get the inside perspective on why unions are useful, how they function, the deal with all those bad unions you keep hearing about, and a lot more. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Produced by Jordan Mallory and with music by Mike Meehan, this is episode 45 of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Every conversation about unions (video game or otherwise) comes with its own complementary elephant in the room: Aren’t unions bad, actually? Don’t they just make it harder to do your job? Well according to Kinema, a union is only as good as the people at the helm, just like any other democratic institution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unions are only as good as the people at the helm, as with most organizations">Unions are only as good as the people at the helm, as with most organizations</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There's an argument to be said that the democratic functions [of a union] can be taken over for bad means—it's true,” Kinema said. “And there is a rich history of labor organizing, especially dating far back into like the twenties through the sixties, where there were issues with, for instance, the mafia getting involved with the teamsters.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But such instances are often the result of institutional and exterior influence, according to Kinema. “Often that was the police working with the mafia to infiltrate and take over leadership of those unions, and usually that followed when there was previous progressive or socialist leadership of those unions who then got purged because of government regulations [and] ‘red scare’ type stuff.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“So you have to understand that history,” she said. “When you purge progressive leadership from the union movement, what follows is reactionary leadership in the union movement, right?”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unions can lead to meaningful change">Unions can lead to meaningful change</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell argues that in the right hands, a union can not only affect meaningful change in an individual’s workplace, but also for everyone else working in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Unions are huge for pushing workers’ rights to legislation,” she said. “Workers unions are why we have ‘eight hours a day, five days a week,’ they're why we have child labor laws, they're why we have sick leave, paternity leave, maternity leave.”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it has to be a concerted effort, she adds. “It's not like one little union from a Kentucky coal mine decided ‘Hey, I only want to do eight hours a day.’ That took way more, they had to get together. They all had to work together to accomplish that and to achieve that and to push for legislation for that to become reality.”</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I get it. This isn’t what most <em>Gran Turismo</em> players want. Fine. But I’d argue these flying cars are very funny and have made me more interested in playing <em>Gran Turismo </em>7. So I’d suggest the devs make this bug a feature that you can turn on in a special mode, so players can take a break from all the realistic driving and watch vans float about and shoot off into the sun.<br> .</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
