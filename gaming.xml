            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major has already proven to be an energetic event loaded with drama and breakout performances, and the third stage is adding spice to that mix now that high-tier eliminations are taking place. In a decisive clash, FaZe Clan pushed 3DMAX off the board with a 2-0 sweep, fighting to keep their playoff dream alive.</p>



<p>FaZe walked into the series under some intense pressure, given their performance thus far, which has resulted in losses against both Team Spirit and The MongolZ.</p>



<p>What will happen next for FaZe Clan? Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>

<h2 id="h-faze-clan-remains-firm-for-now">FaZe Clan Remains Firm For Now</h2>



<p>The earlier losses for FaZe Clan at the Budapest Major raised questions about the roster’s cohesion and ability to adapt, but coming out against the underdog squad 3DMAX, the team looked somewhat revitalized. Going forward, FaZe Clan will need to hammer home the point against Passion UA to break a 2-2 lock for both squads.</p>



<p>For 3DMAX, the StarLadder Budapest Major marks the end of their 2025 sprint. The squad did well to reach this far, but they scraped through the second stage and failed to make waves in the third. It was a tough ask, though. The team was pitted against the likes of FaZe, Vitality, and paiN during the awkward run, which is a huge hill to overcome for any squad.</p>



<p>During the short-lived series, FaZe Clan barely gave 3DMAX a chance for respite. The first map, played out on Dust2, was a wash, and FaZe Clan’s Jakub ‘jcobbb’ Pietruszewski wasted no time showing why he was a valuable new signing with a stunning quad kill. The end scoreline was 13-6, setting the tone perfectly.</p>



<p>The second round was even more dominant, with jcobbb showing up again and the FaZe squad managing to secure a 15-5 finish to push 3DMAX from the tournament.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s final match in this stage will be against Passion UA, while six other teams will also look to break the 2-2 deadlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>B8</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>



<li>Natus Vincere</li>



<li>Passion UA</li>
</ul>

<p>Are you a fan of the ultra-popular Japanese anime series Pokémon? If so, you need to stop what you’re doing and check out Catch A Monster on Roblox immediately. Catch A Monster can be considered the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-crash-bots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> version of the various Pokémon games that have been released over the years. Players have to catch a variety of creatures and train them by fighting both trainers as well as other creatures. Each player will have a limited party of monsters they can have at any time, so picking the right ones is of crucial importance.&nbsp;</p>







<p>By training these creatures, players can increase their level and make them stronger, thereby allowing them to defeat harder and more powerful enemies. Players start the game on a basic island and have to work their way up the ladder, while also hatching eggs to gain pets. Bosses spawn at predetermined locations every 15 minutes in Catch A Monster, offering guaranteed drops and rewards. With plenty of things to do and a large open world to explore, fans of the popular Japanese series will surely enjoy their time in Catch A Monster.</p>

<p>Redeeming codes in Catch A Monster is a simple process that doesn’t require players to complete any steps in advance. Input any of the active codes into the correct text box after navigating through the game’s menus to claim your rewards. If you’re new to the Roblox environment, however, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide that will make redeeming codes a walk in the park:</p>



<ol>
<li>Open Roblox and launch Catch A Monster.</li>



<li>Click on the Gift icon on the right side of the screen.</li>



<li>input one of the active codes listed above into the text box.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to claim your rewards.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-catch-a-monster-codes">How To Get More Catch A Monster Codes</h2>



<p>Catch A Monster codes are usually released either through the game’s official channels or on the developers’ socials. Keeping track of all of these though, can be a hassle, especially because players are not notified when any of the existing codes expire. This is why we encourage all players to keep this page bookmarked, as we update it with new codes as soon as they release, while expired codes are also moved to their corresponding section.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release date for Phantom Blade Zero will be revealed during The Game Awards 2025. It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-reveal-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced in August</a> that the Wuxia-inspired title will have its launch date shown before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero follows an elite assassin finding the killer of The Order’s patriarch. With a mix of Soulslike gameplay and RPG staples, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zeros-boss-ai-uses-popular-fighting-game-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its intricate combat system</a> has been a highlight for fans. Earlier this year at the Future Games Show @ Gamescom, director Soulframe Liang stated that the game’s release date would be announced before 2025 ends. While many expected it to be at The Game Awards, it’s now been confirmed to be shown during the event.</p>







<h2 id="h-world-premiere-of-phantom-blade-zero-release-date-to-come-at-the-game-awards-2025">World Premiere of Phantom Blade Zero Release Date to Come at The Game Awards 2025</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997456018897297841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards, a short video reveals that Phantom Blade Zero’s release date will be unveiled at the event.  The video shows the protagonist painting a Chinese dragon, which goes berserk at the end of the clip. While no gameplay is shown in the short clip, it’s likely fans will see more at the world premiere.</p>



<p>Dated for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-the-game-awards-2025-full-start-date-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 11th</a>, The Game Awards are already stacked with reveals. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and Devil May Cry, there’s much to look forward to. Plus, with the mysterious statue that many are still figuring out, it’s sure to be one to watch. Now, Phantom Blade Zero joins the roster, with at least something certain being shown: the release date. 2026 is already a packed year with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and 007 First Light, but S-GAME’s action title is definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rhythm Doctor Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/rhythm-doctor-review</link>
            <guid>1375444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When you sit down with a game, you make a pact with it: you’ll push the buttons, and it will show you what happens when you do. A lot of games don’t really care to interrogate what that means, to use the physical realities of the medium to tell a story. Remember having to plug your controller into the second port of your PlayStation to fight Psycho Mantis? That’s rare. Instead, many of them are content to be films where you control the action. Rhythm Doctor is not one of those games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the eight or so hours I spent seeing its 1.0 version through to completion, Rhythm Doctor frustrated me, earned some laughs, made me tear up, and used this medium to tell a story in ways I’ve never seen a game do before. It is one of the most difficult rhythm games I’ve ever played, and one I couldn’t put down. Near the end, I felt like I might need a little rhythm therapy myself, a shock to the heart to keep me going. But I wanted to live in that world a little longer, listen to these songs a little more, spend a little more time with these characters. It was worth it. Rhythm Doctor drove me crazy, and I loved it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rhythm Doctor Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In Rhythm Doctor, you are an intern assigned to Middlesea Hospital. You work remotely, so you sit behind a screen and watch what’s happening through the hospital’s cameras. The doctors and patients speak to you, but you cannot respond to them. Well, you can, but they can’t hear the intern. Like you as a player, the intern is part of this world but not of it. A participant, but not a resident. When you see yourself on screen, it is as a long arm hovering over a button. The patients sometimes jokingly call you Doctor Finger. It’s a brilliant bit of “player-as-character” that Rhythm Doctor makes the most of throughout its runtime. That this story features some absolutely gorgeous pixel art spritework is just a bonus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The simple but extremely effective gimmick here is that Middlesea is experimenting with a new treatment that promotes healing by defibrillating patients’ hearts in time with their heartbeats. Your job is to press the button on the defibrillator in sync with the beat of their heart. That’s it. There is only one button. Press it every 7th beat in time with the patient’s heart. Line the beats up properly, and you’ll cure what ails them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That might not sound hard, and it isn’t. At least at first. One, two, three, four, five, six, <em>press</em> is easy enough. But then you’ll get to polyrhythms, hemiolas, irregular time signatures, silent beats, the works. Again, all you have to do is press your button on every seventh beat. But it gets challenging quickly. I used to think I was good at rhythm games. I played Guitar Hero and Rock Band on Expert. I used to play a couple different instruments. After playing Rhythm Doctor, I no longer think that. Few games have challenged me like this did.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’ll have to keep pace yourself, and overcoming initially brutal levels was a thrill.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sometimes you’ll be treating multiple patients at once, each with their own rhythm, and you’ll have to keep track of them simultaneously. Some may drop in and drop out. The excellent songs their hearts are beating to will abruptly change pace. You may have to hit notes in rapid succession or hold them or match a tempo you’ll hear and then have to reproduce. There is a visual indicator here, but it’s not going to hold your hand or tell you exactly when to press your lone button. You’ll have to keep pace yourself, and overcoming initially brutal levels was a thrill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Doctor will help you out – most levels feature a dedicated tutorial teaching you new concepts, certain beats are often preceded by unique sound effects to let you know they’re coming, and a nice nurse will often call out timing changes with a “Get Set Go!” in time to the beat before the change occurs, but visual prompts are limited. There’s no “fit the note into this handy-dandy slot it's barreling towards” in Rhythm Doctor. <em>You </em>have to keep time. I often found myself tapping my other hand against my thigh, silently counting to seven, or moving my head from side to side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you’ll need to, because Rhythm Doctor likes to mess with you, to use the idea that you’re a guy behind a screen pressing buttons to tell its story. If you’re treating a patient while a virus is messing with your connection, you’ll feel it. There will be static, the beat will be thrown off, and things will pop up or fade out. At one point, a bunch of pop-ups saying “DISTRACTION!” overwhelm your screen. As a player, it’s annoying, especially if you’re somewhat reliant on visual cues. As a storytelling conceit, it’s dynamite. Dealing with that would be difficult and irritating, especially at work! I could practically hear the virus mocking me; J.K. Simmons breathing in my ear. “Not quite my tempo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not the only time Rhythm Doctor pulls this trick. Sometimes, it will shrink your screen and bounce it around to the beat. Once, when Cole, a down on his luck musician with a caffeine addiction, rushes across the screen to get to Nicole, a barista at the hospital’s cafe who he’s grown fond of, the game window travels with him as you struggle to keep up via the hospital’s cameras, going entirely off your monitor before reappearing. Even the songs themselves tell a story: when a patient named Logan has trouble admitting his feelings for another named Hailey, their songs reflect it, and he often loses the beat during that level. As the two get closer across several songs, their heart rates grow closer in time. When he finally summons the courage to make it happen, the track resembles a duet at a Broadway show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The songs here vary from showtunes to dubstep to techno and everything in-between, and each is used to tell a story like this. Every patient’s unique heart rhythm can and will show up in other tracks as they bond with one another, whether it’s a miner helping an injured baseball player rehab from an injury, an elderly couple at opposite ends of the hospital who long to see one another, or Cole and Nicole hash out their issues through song. In Rhythm Doctor, the music is part of the story. Each track moves the narrative forward, and gets to the heart of who these people are and how they feel about one another. You can treat a lot of things with medicine, but sometimes the only cure for a damaged heart is working through what caused it in the first place. I cared about these characters and their relationships, and I wanted to stick around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s good, because you’ll probably have to. Rhythm Doctor holds you to a high standard. Cs may get you degrees, but you’ll need a B grade or better before you can move on to the next level. That can be a little frustrating if you get stuck, and I’m not ashamed to say I had to turn the difficulty down to clear some of the harder stages. Some even have “Night Shift” versions for an extra challenge and a bit more story, and there are several bonus levels to tackle as well, which are goofy and a lot of fun, like the one where a group of nurses pursues a limousine, kicking away projectiles the limo is hurling at them. Others are just chill vibes where you hang out with the characters. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I cared about these characters and their relationships, and I wanted to stick around.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all, though, you’re reminded that while you’re part of this story, it’s not about you. Without spoilers, there’s a rather touching scene later on that you hear about but don’t witness because you’re busy helping another patient. Almost every other character is there, but you’re helping someone else, and the scene happens without you. You only hear the other characters react to it. On one level, it’s smart commentary on the limitations of being behind a screen and the role of the player; you’re not part of this world physically, not matter how badly you might want to be. Your job is to watch and press buttons. On another, it’s a reminder that no one recovery, no one part of the hospital, and no one patient, is less important than any other. It all matters. And there’s emotional resonance here. When one of Cole’s tracks says “Sometimes I’m angry I’m not doing better than I thought I’d do at this point,” I had to pause the game for a moment. I’ve been there. I understand that feeling. I understood that character, and all his flaws. And I admired his persistence in spite of it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhythm Doctor also features some shockingly relevant commentary on the state of healthcare and capitalism. As the program you’re part of gains traction, there’s pressure from the hospital’s administrator (and head doctor) to expand it, eventually resulting in layoffs to hospital staff and overworked doctors. After all, why have staff when you can have a miracle treatment an intern in their pajamas can perform from their laptop? You don’t need people, right? Just results. Rhythm Doctor ends about as perfectly as it can given all the plates it’s spinning, but it’s nice that it never pulls punches. Nothing is free; everything has a cost, and that cost might be other people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you need a break from the story, there’s also a comprehensive level editor to play with and community tracks to download. I’ll be honest with y’all; I’m not much of a level editor cat, but what I’ve played of the community tracks is genuinely impressive. Rhythm Doctor’s soundtrack is so good that I’ve listened to it in between sessions, but it’s great to see developer 7th Beat Games turn their baby over to the community and say “go nuts.” In a world obsessed with selling you something at every moment, editors like this feel increasingly rare, and I’m glad it’s here.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Rhythm Doctor is one of the hardest games I’ve played in a hot second, regardless of genre. But the music, the humor, and the characters are all so strong that it compelled me to stick with it. Most of all, I loved the way Rhythm Doctor embraces being a game and uses that to tell its story in a way no other medium could. These songs aren’t just something you play along with; you feel them. You experience them and the emotions they convey because of how they’re presented. It’s a remarkable achievement. And all it takes is one button. Moreover, it made me want to play music again. I’ve always wanted to learn to play piano. Maybe it’s time. I’ll probably fail, at first. I’ll probably fail a lot, actually. But if Rhythm Doctor believes anything, it’s that it’s the courage to keep going, even when all seems lost, that counts. That’s what makes you who you are.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/rhythm-doctor-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The eternal problem with online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of any flavour that has some variation on a levelling system, is that eventually you run out of room, and can't progress any more. That's why so many of them essentially allow you to reset your levels, or to prestige as it's often colloquially known. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one such game that will feature such a system, and in a new blog post, developer Embark have outlined what you get when you prestige.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon">blog post</a> discusses the game's Expedition Project, its version of prestiging, explaining that it will kick off on December 17th, running for a six-day period until the 22nd. Within this period, you can choose to leave The Rust Belt for good, as long as you've reached level 20, and you'll start from a new character with some buffs and advantages.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: once an Expedition has departed, any items you have in your stash are put towards it. Every one million coins worth of value nets you an extra skill point you can use on your new raider, with the ability to earn five skill points total. Restarting with a new raider does mean that your skill tree, level, stash, workshop, crafting abilities, and blueprints will be completely reset, but you won't have to do the initial onboarding again.
</p>
<p>
In turns of some permanently unlocked bonuses, carrying out an Expedition nets you the Patchwork Raider outfit, Scrappy Janitor Cap, Expeditions Indicator icon, and +12 stash space. You also get some temporary buffs, like a 10% repair buff, 5% xp boost, and 6% more materials from Scrappy. One point to note though is that "the account buffs will expire if you choose not to depart with the subsequent expedition. Bear in mind, buffs will increase in power for your next three expeditions (but only one departure allowed per Expedition Window!)."
</p><p>
Explaining why they're handling a progression wipe like this, Embark said that making the Expedition Project optional is their "solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes - specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game." They want to offer people a choice between accomplishing more if there's things they're yet to do, but if they're ready to move on, they can do so. Basically, start planning for what you want to do come December 17th! Happy Arc Raiding!

Video games have a tendency to be very impatient in a way that I think often makes for a worse experience. Constant rewards of many flavours push us to chase after the next challenge, there's not nearly enough games that ask us to slow down. That's why I love a fishing minigame. It is a test of patience that you cannot win by brute forcing anything, the fish must come to you, and you must wait for the right time. About Fishing, the next release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> developer The Water Museum, does ask for your patience… as well as for your willingness to embark into strange, murky waters.
</p>
<p>
Quickly into the game's demo (or playtest, as it's listed as on Steam), you are shown how to fish in a tutorial that perhaps needs a smidge more of a nudge in the right direction, but I did work it out in the end. Like in any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, the fish you're trying to nab will prod your bait, inviting your twitching finger to pull the trigger. The main difference is that the camera follows your hook into the water, and if you successfully fool a fish into taking the bait, you must reel it in, moving your mouse or WASD keys as you do so to point the fish towards your corporeal form for a successful catch.

<p>
This is a game about fishing, not a game with fishing in it, so it's much more involved than a minigame, and appropriately tactile. After catching your prey, you bring it back to a man who I think is your grandpa, who is also kind of a weird asshole. There are curly fries to be hand, it is raining, yet according to him you must fill the tacklebox.
</p><p>
So, you do your best to do so, catching everything you can until your maybe grandpa teaches you a new trick: attaching a fish you caught to your hook lets you puppeteer its dead body. And you do that too, going deep into a hole, where you find a Laura Palmer-esque dead body… and a mermaid.
</p>
<p>
This is simply the opening section to About Fishing, the first chapter of a larger game that takes its cues from both Sega Bass fishing and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, a delightful combination. There is clearly a mystery to be solved, fish to be caught, and based on the game's trailer and Steam page, townspeople to meet.
</p>
<p>
Arctic Eggs was equally as odd and concentrated in the thing it was trying to be, and About Fishing is seemingly no different in the tiny bit of time I've spent with it. You've caught me hook, line and sinker, The Water Museum. I'll be keeping an eye out on the full release, but for now you can join me in wishlisting it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3856530/About_Fishing/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The final triple-A game release of the year, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, was just released. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but the game is also available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Indeed, as you might remember, it was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the previous Switch during Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight, just a few months after that console's debut. It famously had a troubled development phase, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-indeed-developed-bandai-namco-according-multiple-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had originally picked Bandai Namco</a> instead of Retro Studios to make the game. </p>



<p>The project wasn't going well, which led to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being rebooted and handed back to Retro Studios</a>, resulting in an inevitable significant delay. Even though the Austin-based studio eventually launched the game well after the debut of the Switch 2, Nintendo still kept its promise to release the game on the original Switch, too.</p>



<p>That's great news even for PC gamers because, while there are no Switch 2 emulators yet, there are plenty of Switch emulators. Sure, Nintendo cracked down hard on the scene and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced the closure of Yuzu</a> (and its fork<span>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/suyu-yuzus-emulator-fork-gets-taken-down-just-hours-after-the-first-build-release/" target="_blank">Suzu</a>), but many alternatives are still active, including <a href="https://ryujinx.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryubing</a>, an open-source fork based on</span> the historic Ryujinx emulator, as well as newer emulators like <a href="https://eden-emu.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eden</a> and <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citron</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid prime 4: Beyond - Eden vs Citron" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxSycDP8e3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All of these are running Metroid Prime 4 well, as you can see from the embedded video. But the real kicker is that with ReShade, it's even possible to render the game (and other Switch titles) in stereoscopic 3D and play it on a giant screen through the <a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Desktop software</a>. To begin, you will need to <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download ReShade</a> 6.6.2 with full add‑on support and the Rendepth shader to convert the game’s depth buffer into a side‑by‑side 3D image that Virtual Desktop can interpret as stereoscopic video.</p>



<p>After installing ReShade (select the Vulkan option), enable the Rendepth shader and set the output to side-by-side with stereo strength at 100%, Z-buffer scaling at around 30, and parallax/overlap adjusted to your preference. To verify that depth is being captured correctly, ensure that the Show depth buffer setting is toggled on and use the AdjustDepth/DisplayDepth add-on to cycle through Vulkan depth sources until the buffer displays a proper gradient from black to white, rather than a flat white image.</p>



<p>If the depth preview is inverted, upside‑down, or flat, simply edit ReShade's global preprocessor definitions, toggling flags such as “depth input is reversed” or “depth input is upside down” from 0 to 1, until the depth image looks correct. Once the right Vulkan depth source is selected (it'll be the one with the most vertices) and the image is oriented correctly, disable the debug view, enable performance mode, and keep Rendepth active to generate the 3D image in normal gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Using Rendepth and ReShade to play stereoscopic 3D Metroid Prime 4 and Switch games." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoCFGIvgiA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, in Virtual Desktop, set the 3D mode to half side‑by‑side or over‑under so that the double image from Rendepth fuses into a stereoscopic view on the virtual big screen. The creator of the video, lionellion, describes the result as a “Nintendo 3DS pop‑out” visor effect with a presentation akin to having a giant curved screen in front of you. Of course, to replicate this effect, you will need a Virtual Reality/XR headset or glasses or a glassless 3D display <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-2d-3d-gaming-monitor-concept-supports-glassless-3d-and-vr-gaming-wins-ces-2024-innovation-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this one</a>. </p>



<p>Needless to say, playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on PC can only be legally done if you purchased an original copy for the Nintendo Switch and then dumped it for your own use. </p>

            <p>
A new trailer for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> update, The Last of the Druids, was shared earlier this week, showing off all the cool things you can do in it! Which are mostly relegated to turning into animals, but in my eyes that is eternally a cool thing to be able to do, in a game or not. And with that trailer also came a release date for the update.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a week out now, due to be released on December 12th, just in time for the next weekend. As part of the new druid class that comes with the new update, when in human form you can wield "magical staves to channel the powers of the earth and the natural world," including summoning volcanoes, getting trees to use their roots to trap enemies, you know, druid stuff.

<p>
Then, there's the three forms you can take, that of a wolf, a bear, or a fire-breathing wyvern. Looks pretty neat honestly! Druid also comes with a couple of ascendancy classes, one being the Shaman, who "channels nature’s fury, harnessing rage to empower his spells and becoming a walking natural disaster raining down meteors, lightning, and ice," and the Oracle, who has "perfected the power of Foresight, using it in combat to gain a massive advantage by peering into the future to predict a monster's movements and even allocate passives from alternate timelines!"
</p><p>
Here's the rub, however: Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release date most likely won't be March 2026 like it was previously planned for. "I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," game director Jonathon Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">Eurogamer</a> in a recent interview, continuing, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."
</p>
<p>
While there was no specific updated timeline shared, Rogers said he "certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027." I'm sure this won't be welcome news to some, but hey ho, this is just how early access is sometimes. Have patience, friend, the 1.0 will come.

            <p>
Imagine a second, alternate version of our world. Everything is the same, on the surface. The sky is blue, the economy is in shambles; it's the unnatural order of things. And yet, you cannot help but feel something is different. Like there's something missing, or perhaps replaced. Ah, there it is - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</a> is not a game that even remotely exists. As it turns out, this world, our world, where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 does, or rather will, exist, is only the world we exist in thanks to the flip of a coin.
</p>
<p>
This, I would like to be clear, is not a joke. "We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'" explained Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/we-ended-up-flipping-a-coin-slay-the-spire-devs-left-it-up-to-pure-chance-whether-theyd-make-a-sequel-or-something-else/">PC Gamer</a> in a recent interview. Apparently this was during Covid, and both Giovannetti and Casey Yano were looking for their next proper project.
</p>
<p>
According to Giovannetti, a Slay the Spire sequel wasn't the only idea they had. "We had different paths we could work on," he explained. "One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on it, and the rest is history."
</p>
<p>
The coin flip itself isn't something Giovannetti witnessed first hand, it was Yano that did it over a Discord call, which the former notes was "maybe questionable," but he still believes he was told "true result. I think Casey would've massively preferred the coin went the other way, because I was always the card game person, and he was the action game person."
</p><p>
There is nothing more joyful, to me, than seeing the creator of a thing engage in an exercise that is so directly tied to the kind of thing that they make. In this case, it is Mega Crit playing with that fickle game called chance, in the hopes that it will work out, that they will, if they're lucky enough, slay the spire. But maybe don't do this if you aren't literally the folks who made Slay the Spire, this isn't a point in history to be taking unnecessary risks.
</p>
<p>
Slay the Spire 2 is currently slated for release on a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-a-secret-thursday-in-march-2026-alternate-acts-teased">secret Thursday</a>" in March 2026, where you'll be able to play it in early access. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">here</a>.

<p>Embark Studios has delayed the upcoming next part of the ARC Raiders’ Expedition Project. The Expedition, which now opens a few days later, will give you new items but practically wipe out your progress.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s hottest games has been the extraction shooter ARC Raiders. Made by Embark Studios (The Finals), the shooter has been quite popular with players and streamers. From peace pacts to all-out war, the title has already topped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-searched games</a> on Google and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently broken player records</a> on Steam. On the roadmap, it was teased that the next expedition departure would be announced. Now, Embark Studios has revealed more info on the next Expedition, including a two-day delay.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>After a minor delay in the tunnels, the Expedition departure window will open on Dec 17; this is your Raider’s chance to roll out in the Caravan you’ve built and leave the Rust Belt behind.<br>Prepare to start a fresh new adventure with a brand new Raider, and…</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1997350326311989689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog</a> on the ARC Raiders site, Embark Studios revealed that <strong>the next Expedition won’t start its window on December 15th</strong> as planned. Instead, <strong>the Expedition window will last from December 17th to the 22nd</strong>. Now, instead of players leaving on December 20th, the 22nd is now when those who signed up will depart The Rust Belt on their Caravan.</p>



<p>While the details of the Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are known</a>, the blog mentions some information regarding it. For one, player progress will be wiped, which includes blueprints, skill tree, level, stash, workshop, and crafting abilities. However, permanent upgrades like more inventory slots, XP boosts, and skill points will be included. It is a big choice to go on the Expedition, but seeing how ARC Raiders has shaped up to be since release, it does seem like a risk worth taking.</p>

            <p>Mob Entertainment has dropped another new cinematic trailer to whet our collective appetites for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 5.</p>
<p>It's one of those blink-and-you-miss-it affairs - it's not even a minute long - but it does give a flavour of what we can expect from Mob Entertainment's gargantuan mascot horror series, including another shadowy glimpse of the mysterious Prototype and our first look at an all-new character that may or may not be a new villain that some fans are calling Lilly Lovebraids.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date accompanying this teaser - just a request to wishlist it on Steam and Epic Games Store - but the speed at which Mob is churning out teasers suggests it could be here sooner rather than later.</p><p>The prior chapter, called Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, predictably enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-coming-to-consoles-this-month">on consoles in the summer</a>, which also makes January 2026 a timely opportunity to drop its successor. Watch this space.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the studio announced that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time. "This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has suggested that Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/966/G096641/20251205009/">4Gamer</a>, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-says-japanese-studios-are-unlikely-to-replicate-the-production-scale-and-speed-of-chinese-games-like-genshin-or-honkai-star-rail/">Automaton</a>, Yoshida shared his impressions of the Chinese industry, saying: "the development speed in China is amazing [and] they’re also quick at changing personnel, and all of the game development work itself unfolds rapidly".</p>

<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p><p>"I wonder if there are some aspects [of the development process] that Japanese game developers just can't replicate. One reason why games in China are so strong is because they are made in an environment which allows for hiring a large number of personnel who can work long hours.</p>
<p>"Of course, you never know what might happen in the near future, but looking at the current state of things, I think that's the biggest factor."</p>
<p>Last month, a number of Japanese publishers, including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others came together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works</a>.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, requests that CODA members' works are not used for machine learning without prior permission.</p>

            <p>
I can see it now… in the near future, the review embargo for Suda51's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, and as far as the eye can see the digital realm is scorched with 7/10s. Its maximalist shenanigans, techno-blasting soundtrack, and ridiculous premise puts it in a position where it couldn't possibly be for everyone, even if such a score is actually ideal for such a game, but when has that ever been the case for a Suda51 game? However, as I said, this vision I have is in the near future, because the hyper-violent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
This release date comes as part of an as always over-the-top new trailer, locking it for launching February 11, 2026 (as locked in as any game can be these days). There's a line in said trailer that I think perfectly encapsulates my feelings of everything I've seen of Romeo is a Dead Man so far, from the titular character himself: "Am I supposed to understand what you're talking about?" I pose this question in return to Grasshopper Manufacture, though to be honest I don't particularly need a response.

<p>
There's enough in the trailer that intrigues me enough to pull me towards that February release date; stylish as hell combat with so many particle effects you'll probably start to feel dizzy, bombastic special attacks that transport you to another dimension, a blank, empty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>-as-hell room, a zombie woman for some reason, an unexplained fusion between a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> and a Gundam, it has it all and more.

It's entirely possible that this all ends up being style over substance, the substance in question being the combat more than the story, I don't need the story in a game like this to sing the highest of emotional peaks. I need it to commit to its outlandishness, and deliver on its crunchy melee swings and punchy gunshots. I'll find out if it manages to do that in a couple of months!

            <p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda would love to bring back the found-footage survival-horror game Michigan: Report from Hell, either as a sequel or a remake.</p>
<p>The original, released in Japan in 2004 as Michigan, was not released in the US, although a dubbed version was released in Europe the following year, with the "Report from Hell" added to the PAL title.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/suda51-says-he-wants-to-bring-back-this-forgotten-ps2-game-hopefully-sooner-rather-than-later/">VGC</a>, Suda was asked if the age of social media had ever given the producer pause to reconsider bringing Michigan to a new audience, to which he replied, "hopefully sooner rather than later".</p>

<p>"As far as Michigan goes, that's something that I would definitely like to revisit or bring back in some form at some time," Suda said, who was reportedly inspired by Stephen King's The Mist.</p>
<p>"And so if possible, I hope I'll be able to speak with Spike Chunsoft and make it a reality somehow, hopefully sooner rather than later. But yeah, that's something that I've been wanting to go back to for a while."</p><p>Hotel Barcelona, the side-scrolling slasher movie parody from Suda51 and Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year">delayed from 2024 to September 2025</a> so developer White Owls could "keep polishing it and making it better". It's currently sitting on a 'Mixed' Steam user score.</p>

            <guid>1375234</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160991/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I had a moment of realisation while flipping my Switch 2 around in my hand and tapping at the screen in an effort to solve yet another clever-but-abstract puzzle. I realised that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> was one of the most unabashedly original sets of experiences I had encountered in a long time.</p>
<p>The funny thing was that I had already played every game in this collection years before. It had been so long that the zenith of mobile gaming had slipped into the realm of half-forgotten memories.</p>
<p>Simogo Games is perhaps better known for two stylised and mechanically unique titles from recent years: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sayonara_wild_hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> (2019) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lorelei_and_the_laser_eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> (2024). It <em>may</em> surprise some that it is actually a storied studio with 15 years of history, recognised for fiercely original titles built for mobile devices. Those are the games that the Simogo Legacy Collection brings together. It features seven titles that both exemplify the early heyday of mobile games and manage to transcend that format.</p>
<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160990/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is as lovingly curated a collection as you are likely to get, rivalling Digital Eclipse’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Agold-master-series">Gold Master Series</a> for presentation and additional extras. The stylish menu is fashioned as a mobile phone screen, with tiles that take you to games, settings, and a wealth of bonus material. You are free to cycle between a vast collection of music as you wander the digital halls of this studio's archives.</p>
<p>The games themselves range from fun time sinks to rich artistic endeavours. All of them need equal attention, so it is best to tackle them one by one.</p>
<p>First up is <strong>Kosmo Spin</strong>, which is perhaps the most mobile-game-like experience here and a sign of a studio taking its first steps in the industry. It is a cute collectathon that plays with perspective by having you rotate the screen to guide a robot around a planetoid. You rescue robot buddies and avoid an enemy UFO that hurls projectiles and tries to hoover you up.</p>
<p>Next is <strong>Bumpy Road</strong>, a deceptively simple exercise in hand-eye coordination. Your task is to guide a car across the screen, although the hook is that you move the vehicle by deforming the road underneath it with your finger. I had a lot of fun with this one, mostly failing.</p>

<p><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> is an odd but addictive combination of stealth and rhythm action. You control a thief who sneaks through Donkey Kong-style multi-level areas, and you can only move by tapping the screen to the beat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/year_walk">Year Walk</a> is perhaps the developer's most beloved mobile title and much more of a purely artistic experience than the previous three. Previously available on the Wii U eShop until Nintendo shut up shop <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/countdown-wii-u-eshop-spotlight-year-walk">in March 2023</a>, it explores Scandinavian folklore with an atmospheric walking (swiping?) simulator of sorts, in which you transition through screens, interact with the environment and uncover mysteries. It remains richly atmospheric to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Device 6</strong> and <strong>The Sailor’s Dream</strong> are mechanically similar puzzle mysteries that rely on your exploration skills. Device 6 has you traverse prose and interact with images in a book to help protagonist Anna figure out where she is. The Sailor’s Dream expands the concept of exploration by having you sail across the ocean and visit experiential locations.</p>
<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160992/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, there is <strong>SPL-T</strong>, an ostensibly simple puzzle game where you tap on a wireframe grid to create ever smaller divisions. This one is a compulsive experience that hides neat little easter eggs tied to screen interaction.</p>
<p>All of these games are sharply updated to look great on the Switch display. Since they were developed for small touchscreens, they feel most comfortable when played undocked. Simogo has added all kinds of quality-of-life features to make the games more playable on both screens, including open orientation switching and simultaneous touch and stick controls.</p>
<p>The one caveat is that most of the games feel a bit clunky on a large display. Even with accessible controls, these titles were made specifically for a small screen. That said, the Switch 2 version fully supports mouse controls, which helps a great deal when playing docked. Being able to move the screen and control the game with smooth mouse movement is a real boon.</p>

<p>Simogo Legacy Collection feels like the developer has considered <em>everything</em> in translating these games to consoles. It adapts mobile-first experiences into versatile ports that account for the player's needs. Outside of the porting work, these games offer seven distinct and captivating experiences that still feel fresh years after their release. Simogo plays around with the form and function of well-worn templates to create something surprising and new.</p>
<p>Even Year Walk, the most purely narrative experience here, is a unique take on the storytelling style of classics like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/myst">Myst</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/room">The Room</a>. SPL-T, on the other hand, is so subtle in its execution that you might spend hours tapping the screen before realising you are playing a postmodern twist on endless arcade puzzlers.</p>
<p>If you enjoy puzzle-driven narratives and experimental design, this bundle is nothing less than essential.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Polishing and repackaging its mobile output, Simogo have created an essential collection of classics, where every game is worth your time. Despite their mobile origins, these titles feel tailor-made for Switch and the devs have fully embraced the console's feature set.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/where-winds-meet-everything-we-know-about-the-wuxia-open-world-action-adventure-rpg/</link>
            <guid>1375207</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Where Winds Meet immediately caught our attention when Everstone Studio, a new internal NetEase development studio based in Hangzhou and specifically created to develop this game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wuxia-open-world-sandbox-rpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its first trailer at Gamescom 2022</a>. We were the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publish an exclusive interview with the development team</a> just around a month later, where we learned various details, including the studio's revelation on the title choice: they envisioned wind as a symbol of freedom, and with multiple winds gathering, it is akin to a meeting of people with different ideas. Exploration and freedom, civilization and harmony are the themes behind Where Winds Meet's original concept.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Everstone Studio tested Where Winds Meet extensively before its launch. The first Closed Beta Test <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuxia-open-world-game-where-winds-meet-starts-first-closed-beta-test-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took place in April 2024</a>; a month later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the game would be released on PlayStation 5 in addition to the previosly announced PC version. The game was launched in China in December 2024. </p>



<p>Everstone conducted two additional testing rounds this year in <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-new-cbt-set-for-may-16-19-on-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July</a>, followed by the final global release <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14, 2025</a>. The game is available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as on PlayStation 5 as a timed console exclusive. A mobile version <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is scheduled to follow on December 12, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>The title employs a free‑to‑play business model with cross‑progression between supported platforms. Monetization revolves around cosmetics, battle‑pass style rewards, and gacha systems for visual items, with both the developer and the publisher emphasizing that there are no pay‑to‑win stat advantages attached to paid content.</p>



<h2 id="genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Where Winds Meet positions itself between <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima</a>‑style prestige action‑adventure and a more systemic game, describing its core as an “open‑world wuxia ARPG” with strong narrative, social, and multiplayer layers. Wuxia here means gravity‑defying martial arts, chivalric codes, and tangled sect politics, with Everstone leaning into romanticized Jianghu folklore rather than strict historical simulation.​</p>



<p>The story unfolds in China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, a chaotic 10th-century interregnum between the Tang and Song dynasties marked by short‑lived regimes and constant warfare. Cities like Kaifeng serve as political and economic hubs, while borderlands, bamboo forests, deserts, and mountain monasteries highlight the fractures between imperial authority and the martial underworld. The protagonist is a nameless swordsman (or swordswoman) with a hidden past, drawn into conspiracies involving rival kingdoms, ancient martial sects, and supernatural‑tinged relics. The player character can join one of eleven sects (or remain sectless and 'steal' specific martial skills without joining), each with a unique philosophy, rules, signature martial arts and/or features. Here's the list of the sects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Well of Heaven</li>



<li>Silver Needle</li>



<li>Midnight Blades</li>



<li>Nine Mortal Ways</li>



<li>Velvet Shade</li>



<li>Raging Tides</li>



<li>The Masked Troupe</li>



<li>Lone Cloud</li>



<li>Hollow Vale</li>



<li>Inkbound Order</li>



<li>Mohist Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers stressed that the narrative is not purely linear: branching dialogue, optional “Lost Chapter” storylines, and faction questlines can reframe how key conflicts are resolved and which NPCs become allies or enemies. Jianghu reputation systems track how different sects and regions perceive the player, unlocking unique skills, outfits, or story beats if you side with, infiltrate, or betray particular groups.​</p>



<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The game's core combat combines Souls-style commitment with character-action spectacle, albeit leaning more toward the latter. Players can lock onto targets, manage stamina‑like resources, and use a universal guard/parry system that can deflect most strikes if timed well. Once enemies are staggered, the game encourages launching them into juggles, air‑dashes, and cinematic finishers. Accessibility options include auto-parry, auto-dodge, and timing assists, allowing less technical players to enjoy the wuxia spectacle. On the other hand, action genre fans will want to keep these assists disabled to enjoy a more challenging reaction-based experience.​</p>



<p>In Where Winds Meet, weapons define broad playstyles rather than rigid classes. For example, straight swords favor precise counters and ripostes; spears grant reach and crowd control; dual blades focus on aggressive, stance‑dancing DPS; bows and crossbows support ranged pressure; and umbrellas, fans, or Taichi techniques introduce hybrid defensive or support options. Skill trees and “Inner Power” cultivation allow you to slot martial arts manuals and passive meridian bonuses, encouraging experimentation across weapon types and sect styles instead of locking into a single build.​</p>



<p>Traversal is designed to sell the fantasy of a roaming wuxia hero. Players can triple‑jump, sprint up walls, dash across water for short distances, and glide using cloaks or swords, with many side activities—hidden shrines, vista points, legendary beasts—placed in hard‑to‑reach locations to reward mastery of movement. Mounts, boats, and fast‑travel nodes support large‑scale exploration, while “free interaction” systems let you play instruments, practice calligraphy, or interact with wildlife and villagers, adding low‑intensity downtime between major fights.​ There are indeed a lot of 'life skills' or secondary activities, such as being a healer or a scholar, cooking, fishing, and various mini-games and events.</p>



<p>Structurally, Where Winds Meet occupies a rather unique middle ground between solo RPG and MMO. Main and side quests can be completed alone, but world events, boss hunts, sect wars, and competitive arenas encourage grouping with other players in shared hubs and open zones. Seasonal updates are planned to add new regions, sects, and storylines. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">framed the game as a 'living world' title</a> with a long-term live service plan, where Jianghu politics, world bosses, and social features evolve over time without abandoning the strong core narrative available to solo-focused players.​ </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Where Winds Meet is powered by NetEase's in-house Messiah engine. The game shows modern graphics features such as detailed vegetation, reflective water and surfaces, dynamic lighting, and cinematic, polished martial‑arts animations. </p>



<p>On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-fe-arc-raiders-giveaway-free-new-dlss-rtx-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS 4/DLAA/Reflex with Super Resolution</a>, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation options available on GeForce RTX graphics cards, where the game can be boosted by up to 3.9x at 4K, reaching up to 500 frames per second on the most powerful graphics cards available on the market, the GeForce RTX 5090.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet also supports AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XeSS 2, as well as FSR Frame Generation. However, the latter is not compatible with the XeSS upscaling option or with High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, which are otherwise supported.</p>



<p>Below you can find the game's official system requirements. If you don't meet the requirements, the game can also be played through the cloud, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 version of Where Winds Meet targets 60 frames per second (though it often drops to 40 or even 30FPS in busy scenes) with an internal resolution well below 4K that is then reconstructed. The PS5 Pro version offers users equipped with the more expensive console two options: a higher-resolution standard mode and a ray traced mode that adds RT reflections. The frame rate remains highly variable in both cases.</p>



<p>Both the PS5 and PC versions support the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers feature.</p>

              <p>Amazon keeps its prices low on Alexa-enabled speakers all year long and the <strong>Echo Dot is a great choice because it is in the middle of the lineup</strong> between basic and premium options. This model is the best-selling one in the Echo family <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">right now, and it’s only $31 instead of the usual $49 for early December</a>. The small speaker has surprisingly rich sound that fills bedrooms, offices, or dining rooms without taking up too much counter space or needing a lot of setup.</p>

<h2>Why This Echo Dot Sounds Better Than You Thought</h2>
<p>The speaker design is all about making the sound fuller and giving it more bass than previous Echo Dot models could do with their small enclosures. Amazon changed the way the internal drivers are set up so that they can comfortably fill small to medium-sized rooms with sound while playing music, listening to podcasts, or reading audiobooks. The sound quality isn’t good enough to replace dedicated speakers for critical listening, but it does a good job with background music, news briefings, and alarm sounds, making the Echo Dot useful for more than just voice commands.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration lets you control thousands of smart home devices</strong>, streaming services, and information queries with your voice, so you don’t have to keep taking out your phone: You can change smart lights, thermostats, and plugs by speaking commands naturally. You can also check the weather, set multiple timers while you cook, or ask for unit conversions while you prepare a recipe. The microphone array uses far-field voice recognition technology to filter out background noise and make your voice clear even when music is playing at a moderate volume.</p>
<p>The small size is about the size of a tennis ball, so it doesn’t take up much space on nightstands or desk corners where bigger Echo devices would take up too much space. This size is perfect for bedrooms because it wakes you up with music, news, or soft sounds instead of loud beeps. While you’re getting ready, you can ask Alexa for the time, the weather, or your calendar appointments without touching any devices. The <strong>top surface has physical buttons for turning up the volume</strong>, muting the microphone, and turning on Alexa.</p>



<p>Smart home routines let you set up morning routines that gradually brighten the lights, start your coffee maker, and read your calendar. You can do all of these things with just one command or a scheduled trigger. Evening routines can lock smart locks, change the temperature, turn off all the lights in the house, and play relaxing sounds to help you sleep. You set up these automation sequences in the Alexa app, and they work every time after that.</p>
<p><strong>A physical microphone mute button is part of the privacy controls</strong>: When the button is pressed, the microphones are electronically disconnected. A red light ring shows when the device isn’t listening. The speaker also has options to limit how long data is kept or stop people from listening to recordings</p>
<p>This $18 off makes full Alexa functionality and better sound quality affordable enough to buy Echo Dots for more than one room. If you want to start building a smart home or just need hands-free voice control in important areas, this is a great deal because you get Amazon’s smart assistant platform with room-filling sound for less than the cost of basic Bluetooth speakers.</p>
