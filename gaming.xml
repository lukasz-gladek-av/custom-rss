<p>Dataminers have spotted mentions of a PS5 Pro upgrade for No Man’s Sky within mere days of Hello Games revealing details on their massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-1-update-revealed-with-deep-dive-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Part 1 update</a>. See below the datamined features for this upgrade and the players’ reception.</p>



<p>The details were revealed on X (formerly Twitter) by a game developer and modder named ThatBomberBoi. The No Man’s Sky datamined file contains information on a Graphics Details Preset for ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-spectral-super-resolution-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trinity</a>‘, which many might know as the internal codename for PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many keen-eyed viewers have noted no radical changes to No Man’s Sky’s PS5 Pro upgrade. The increase of the lowest dynamic resolution factor for the game from 0.6 to 0.8 and the base resolution for No Man’s Sky on the PS5 Pro from 1300p to 1730p are the only ones worth noting. These changes will result in a clearer and more detailed visual experience. Other than that, some settings have been upgraded from High to Ultra, enhancing the overall visual quality of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have expressed disappointment with the minimal upgrades for No Man’s Sky’s PS5 Pro upgrade on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e7qkjr/first_ps5_pro_trinity_graphics_settings_insight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>. They had hoped for more, such as the game running at 4K on the mid-refresh, but a bump to 1730p isn’t that significant. Also, many wonder what frame rate they can expect on the PS5 Pro for No Man’s Sky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players have also raised valid concerns about the files’ mention of Nvidia’s DLSS and Reflex technologies alongside Intel’s XeSS, considering PS5 Pro will run on AMD’s platform.</p>



<p>On the topic of PS5 Pro, check out the recent leak about the mid-gen refresh console’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPU</a>. Also, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer requirements</a> to meet the “PS5 Pro Enhanced’ label.

			<p>At TennoCon 2024 in London, Ontario, Canada, Digital Extremes showed off <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a>, both launching within the year. Following the presentations, we were able to chat with Megan Everett (Community Director on Warframe) and Rebecca Ford (Creative Director on Warframe) to have a deep and thorough discussion about the future of the 10-year-plus free-to-play action shooter game.</p>
<p><iframe title="TennoCon 2024 | TennoLive (Full)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zi7FVPa5ayQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>First up, what is the next old system getting a rework?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan Everett:</strong> Companions Part 2, technically. We did the official launch of 2. 0 last year, and then there were things that we just couldn't get to, so we said we'll do a Part 2, so that's gonna be getting some love this year.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Ford:</strong> And then the other one is, it's not really a system as much as it is a core Warframe interaction, which is we're adding favoring items to the UI. So, the way you manage your arsenal favorites is going to exist.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> And then, of course, Caliban is getting a rework. I don't know if that applies to the scenario. He's a system of joy.</p>
<p><strong>Is there going to be more <a href="https://wccftech.com/corpus-proxima-the-new-railjack-warframe-update-out-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railjack</a> on the horizon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes, you can look forward to a sort of micro-infested Railjack launch with the boss fight for Infested Liches.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. How about old tileset reworks like you guys did with Jupiter?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> You are not. We are thinking of doing a lighting rework. It was supposed to actually launch with Jade Shadows when that whole thing went down, but we ended up having to split it out because it was too close to TennoCon. We plan on doing a lighting rework more than anything, not a core asset rework because we think the lighting makes it look like a new asset.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely. How about reworking the ice caves?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: Oh, those are old school.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: It would probably be lighting more than anything.</p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: GI lighting can solve a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to bring CC back into the spotlight?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: Yes and no. Pablo Alonso (Design Director) and I had a conversation about CC yesterday that really comes down to, okay, if we were to touch CC, what we think is long CC is pretty much the problem, like short CC is great, Ember with her fire procs, Volt with his electricity procs. Short CC is good, and long CC is bad, and I say that in a reductive way, but we do know that. We just don't know how we're gonna approach the systemic problem of it.</p>
<p><strong>Will Digital Extremes support the migration of the Fandom Wiki and set up an official one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> Oh, that's a good question. We've been having conversations about moving it, keeping it and it really just came down to the bandwidth of the team and being able to do that. It's a lot more difficult than I think one might think it is.</p>
<p>We're good where we are now, but we are having discussions about potentially moving it. The dream is to host our own, but that is obviously a much bigger conversation with our web team and everyone like that. So, we're good where we are but we are having conversations if we do feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Shout out to the people who actually run the wiki. They're all volunteers. We wish we had a good answer for you if you have issues with the way it's hosted, but it's outside our control.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> But we've been talking to the volunteers as well, and like, what do you guys want? Because you guys are the ones putting in the work, we send you the assets and everything, but what is it that you guys want? So, more to come.</p>

<p><strong>As far as weapons go, some fans don't really have the best opinions of Wise Razor. They're wondering if maybe a new two handed Nikana stance might be in the process. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> There is not a new one in the process, but on my little post-it note of things to address when we have time, I wrote about actually changing the initial attack of Wise Razor. Our animation team, that was their first two-handed Nikana animation stance. I know that there's feedback on it, so there's no reason for us not to budget time to kind of tweak Wise Razor rather than do a new one, because I know people don't like that initial responsiveness. Again, we just gotta improve. It was our first one. We will do that. It's on the list.</p>
<p><strong>With the year 1999 established, what is the current year for Warframe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Oh, we'll never answer that.</p>
<p><strong>Alright! Are there any plans to add operator loadouts and a way to link them to your Warframe loadouts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think we're adding focus school swapping to the star chart-based loadout picker. But in terms of operator loadout, so like say you want to swap your amp to a loadout... Honestly, Pablo would be a better person to answer that, and I know that we haven't talked about it in a way that makes it seem like we will do it anytime soon. Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to update the trading system in Warframe, evolving it from just the trade chat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: I don't think in that capacity. Something we are gonna talk about is updating our players on save cross-platform. We are having deep discussions about cross-platform trading, what that looks like, and how that's going to function. That's our next step in trading. No conversations right now about taking it outside of chat. We're just looking at the cross-platform functionality of it.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: Shout out to the third party people that make Warframe Market. We're not associated. It's a fan thing; use it at your own risk, but they do a great thing, so we support it as players.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that Tau is not in the plan for the foreseeable future, but are there plans to have an alternate star chart like Empyrean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: No, but with Warframe: 1999, we are going to give you a way to sort of choose where you want to start the game, so to speak. Like, do you want to boot up in 1999 or the Origin system? That is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. A couple of questions on weapons. Folks in the community know there's the Ghoulsaw out there, but they're wondering if you can get an actual proper chainsaw.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> So we have the Pantera, which is like a sawblade, we have the Miter, which is a blade launcher, and we have the Ghoulsaw. I mean, we are in the '90s now, so A '90s saw weapon actually goes hard, so maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Another one was: I know there are spears out there, but what about spear and shield combinations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Styanax, he's the only guy. Well, Soulframe made one, so we can steal their code and tech.</p>
<p><strong>Will dedicated augment slots on frames ever be a possibility?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Probably not. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>When are Warframe players getting stamina back?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Never. A lot of stamina. I'll never say never, but never.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Derelict Void notes ever get fissures as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We'd have to take a look at the tile. I mean, that's probably more an oversight than anything.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> When we added the Omni fissures to the tile sets that we were missing, we had a Derelict and everything.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Well, I guess they have the corrupted bolts. That actually could be super cool for people.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> It might also be a reason of, like, if you're going there to crack relics, but there's some guy with a key.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah, it could be dope. We'll have to see. Our bad, sorry about that. We'll look into it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TC2024_Art-Panel_SevagothPrime_NoCredits-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Back to weapons again. Are you going to get more stances to actually change the stance of the weapons, like the Nikana Blind Justice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We haven't really done a concerted internal melee stance conversation. When we did Tennokai, that was all about heavy attacks, but we really haven't done a stance system. So, status quo is pretty likely, with the exception of Wise Razor for the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to bring back raids or some form of larger group content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> Oh, trials. Oh, what a time. We have, I think on your whiteboard, there has been an idea for trials for quite some time. But it's all about balancing what we want to do. Obviously, the story. Warframe:1999 was huge. So, it has a place, it has a time. We just gotta see when it fits in. But we do have ideas for it, and we want to bring it back. We want it to feel like what Warframe represents now and not go back to what it was. So, yeah, it's a big project.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>The thing we miss most about them is having to coordinate with the team. That's our white whale right now. It's a coordination-based mission.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at Warframe: 1999, you mentioned the Gemini system for some of the cosmetics. How expansive will that system be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> It will be the Gemini skins themselves. Any Protoframe that we may be doing in the future will also have the Gemini skin. They'll all be on the same level, fully voiced. Fully optional, you can customize your Protoframe and use that emote however you want to. It'll be a consistent theme as we continue to do Echoes of 1999 and beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We had a lot of fun coming up with them because we knew when the Protoframes came together, we wanted them to be a new tier of skin. But what we ended up doing is just super rewarding for people who really want two fashion frames in one mission, which is also optional, so, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>With Warframe: 1999, will Arthur be the only playable character for that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Actually, yes, and only for the mission you saw. You, as a player, take over after that point. I want players to really try and analyze that last frame of the demo when Arthur is versus Excalibur. Perhaps imagine that at that point, the camera perspective shifts for the rest of 1999.</p>
<p><strong>One thing I wanted to ask about <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a> is how will the development team balance both projects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>The same way a circus clown balances a hundred plates, and that's just figuring out who needs what, when, and what the team and the community need and what they expect. We're figuring it out still.</p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: Yeah, it's definitely a day-by-day, you know, long-term planning, short-term planning, what do we want to do, but also, even though we have a dedicated Soulframe team, they also help out with Warframe. We share some tech and stuff, so it's really an all-group effort, and we want to see, obviously, Soulframe get off the ground as much as anyone else does. Their development is, I think, very similar to Warframe, right? They don't want to put it out there, and it'd be unbaked, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans for a unified account system where your Platinum can be used for both titles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Oh my gosh. Honestly, I don't know. I have asked a million times what we're going to do. We want to do the right thing, and we don't know what that is yet. Sometimes, it takes time to come to the right decision.</p>
<p><strong> Can you talk a little bit more about your Umbra Warframes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I can. For the foreseeable future, there's only one Umbra, and that's Excalibur. There's an Umbra series of content that came with The Sacrifice, and I don't see us going back to it.</p>
<p><strong>Would you ever consider reducing build times on your items, like your Forma or your Fieldron</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We would consider it, but we've talked about it before in a way that basically says we have to do some serious validation of any plan because, as we've been transparent with the community, Forma kind of keeps the Warframe boat going, like it is our fossil fuel, so we need it as much as it needs to be used as a Build Modifier, but also for us, it's one of our more reliable microtransactions for how we run our game. In the absence of Gacha and RNG packs, you have Forma.</p>
<p><strong>Will Warframe expand into transmedia, such as a card game, tabletop, or anime?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We do have an animated short coming. We're collaborating with THE LINE, and they are awesome. You'll see the full thing with the 1999 launch. We do have our eye on a couple of other things. We are hoping to do a webcomic again, and if we're lucky, we'll see what happens next year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1999_ExcaliburVSArthur_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Very cool. Will there be more Lotus story on the horizon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>There will. Look forward to the Lotus Eaters.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. Are there plans for more change-of-plan scenarios? For example, if you fail to defend the last target at mobile defense, the scenario changes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I actually think it's cool. And if we could do more of it, I feel like 1999 is the place to talk to Pablo about it though, but I actually super dig it. One thing we are going to do with 1999, which we'll probably have to talk about on a future dev stream, is like an endless style variant, which kind of is just a whole bunch of change of plans. Hopefully, you can look forward to that.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the arcade games in Warframe: 1999 will be playable?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Definitely one. There is a huge one that's its own fully ready-to-go minigame. It's Calibur Chicks. It's our Contra-esque game. But we're hoping to get at least two. The second one is currently being worked on by one of our awesome devs.</p>
<p><strong>With Lotus Eaters, is there one specific mechanic or new feature you are most excited about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: For Lotus Eaters, that one's not really our quality of life update. That's more of the unannounced full one. Sevagoth Prime does come, but yeah. It's really more about setting the scene for 1999 and kind of do a little bit more of explaining. So, that's kind of what Lotus Eaters is, but then our unannounced one will have the quality-of-life stuff in it.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I'm excited for Caliban. Unannounced update: you're gonna be the best!</p>
<p><strong>I will finish off for the players who are excited about Warframe 1999 but may not have returned in a couple of years. How far will they have to progress in order to access that content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: That's a great question. It continues off of Whispers in the Walls and then Lotus Eaters Quest, so you will have to have completely caught up with the story. But lately, and really recently this year, we've been trying to streamline that process. If you are a new player and you see this 1999 demo, and you're like, I want to play that when it comes out.</p>
<p>We've really tried to make it so the game would tell you exactly the path to get there instead of, you know, yes, there's 20 different quests you can do, but there's only four required ones I need to do to get there.</p>
<p>We're trying to make those junction changes, star chart changes to really help those players get to where they want to be, because we understand that when we put out this awesome update demo and all this, you know, marketing people want to play it. We get it and we want to get them there.</p>
<p>We don't want people to be confused. That's a huge thing. We experimented with Duviri being at the beginning of the game and it didn't pan out for us, so we changed gears on that. We want to make sure that they understand the story and are caught up, but we're doing our best to get them there in the quickest way possible.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We need to do our Tenno training tool to get people through the Tenno tool tips. We do have a campaign in our game, and some people still don't know that. Our goal would be to get the campaign awareness to a point where people just continue playing it instead of being interrupted by a lack of information.</p>
<p><strong>The very last one: are there plans for a native Mac client for Warframe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Well, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we launched on the iOS platform</a>, we were like, oh, we're now kind of in the Apple ecosystem. And I think it kind of can work. We just don't know if we're going to focus on it before we launch and sort of perfect the issues with the iOS we have right now. So it's kind of like iOS, fix, fix, fix, fix, fix, and then we'll see about Android. I think it runs on the M1 processor and stuff because of the depth of the environment. So, we'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Well, thank you two very much for your time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>TennoCon, Digital Extremes' yearly convention, partners and donates towards charities in Canada. For TennoCon 2024, the Warframe developer chose two charities to partner with, unlike previous years where a single charity would be their choice for the community event. This year, AbleGamers is Digital Extremes' overseas choice and Make-A-Wish is its local charity choice.</p><p>With Make-A-Wish, Digital Extremes has granted a child's wish to become a video game voice actor. James, a 16-year-old with Spina Bifida, is familiar with Warframe due to his older brother being a Tenno--the affectionate name designated to the players of Warframe. Kevin Lim, a voice actor for the Warframe character Bombastine, was how Digital Extremes initially discovered James' wish.</p><p>"Through being involved with [Make-A-Wish, Lim] got wind of a boy named James–whose wish was to be a voice in a video game," community manager Megan Everett said. From there, Lim asked James, if he would be interested in being a voice actor for Warframe due to Lim's recent work on the game's Duviri Paradox expansion.</p><p>"Then Kevin Lim reached out to us and from there, we reached out to Make-A-Wish and asked if James wanted to be in Warframe. He was very excited in doing this opportunity. We just continued the conversation with James, Make-A-Wish, and his family. Corey [Van Den Hoogenband] and Veronica [Botnick] on our community team [who] have led the force for reaching out to charities over the years regardless of TennoCon. They were also very heavily involved with Make-A-Wish, and even [talked] with the developers to get his character for his arcade cabinet in-game made and aligning [James and his family] to come to London," Everett explained.</p><p>James, alongside his family, arrived in London earlier this week for James' role in the upcoming Warframe 1999 expansion, recording lines at Digital Extremes' studio.

		<p>Capcom shared a little teaser trailer for Terry Bogart’s return to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/street-fighter-6-year-2-characters-have-been-announced/">Street Fighter 6 during year 2</a>, the Fatal Fury and King of Fighters character set to release in autumn 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 - Terry Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LUExu3qU-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Obviously best known as a star of his own fighting game series, SNK has been a willing partner to bring Terry Bogard to other fighting games in the past. There was, of course, the Capcom vs. SNK series as a whole, but he’s also been in Fighting EX Layer and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Now he’s popping up in Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>As he joins the Street Fighter roster, Terry will be available throughout the game, in the World Tour, Battle Hub and Fighting Ground mode. Capcom has done a great job of highlighting each new character with special in-game events, and there’s sure to be a bevy of in-game cosmetics to earn themed around Terry.</p>
<p>Terry will be available to be purchased individually with Fighter Coins, but will be unlocked automatically for owners of the Year 2 Character Pass or the Ultimate Pass.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">In our Street Fighter 6 Review,</a> Nick said, “Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</p>

Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has said he'll "never" charge money for a DLC or update "for as long as I live".
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, the developer posted on social media site X to say console and mobile ports of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">Stardew Valley 1.6 update</a> are "still in progress", following the PC release back in March.

</p>
<p>
"The ports and next PC update are still in progress," said Barone. "I know it is taking a long time, it's on my mind every minute. I have personally been working on the mobile port every day. I will announce when there is any meaningful news (eg. a release date). Hope you're having a good summer."

A fan followed up this post to say people won't complain about the wait "as long as everything you add is completely free".
</p>
<p>
"I swear on the honour of my family name, I will never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live," replied Barone. "Screencap this and shame me if I ever violate this oath."

Farming life-sim Stardew Valley was released in 2016 and has received plenty of updates ever since, but none of these have cost money.
</p>
<p>
The 1.6 update added a tonne of new content, including new festivals, items and crafting recipes, dialogue, a new farm type, and plenty more. It was well-received by fans and was followed up by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-next-patch-is-here-heres-whats-new">more patches of content</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">Players can also now drink mayonnaise</a>, should they really desire to.

</p>
<p>
What's more, Barone's comment didn't relate specifically to Stardew Valley, meaning his sentiment could also apply to his next game, Haunted Chocolatier.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for that yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure"</a> and that it's "better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".

<p>HYPEX, the reliable source for early Fortnite information, has shared some compelling news for Chapter 6. Players can look forward to some exciting new movement mechanics in the game. The first, ‘prone’, has been a highly requested addition to Fortnite’s gameplay for a long time, promising a fresh tactical dimension to battles.</p>



<p>The other movement mechanic for Fortnite Chapter 6 is Swinging. We’ve had a taste of Swinging in the game, thanks to the Spider-Man mythic and other rope-based traversal items in the past. However, the nature of the swinging we’ll experience in the next Chapter remains shrouded in mystery. Will it be swinging from ropes like Tarzan or off bars like parkour?</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> currently has over 80 games in development, with plans to release a game a month to its subscribers from this month onwards.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2024/Jul/18/netflix-inc-usa-244e80f7-c939-40a1-a316-82d7d29f8a40.pdf">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix's co-CEO, president and director Gregory K Peters discussed the company's plans for gaming and how it will achieve growth.

</p>
<p>
Where the company is moving quickest is with interactive narrative games, which Peters describes as "easier to build". These are placed in the Netflix Stories narrative hub and it's here the company will be launching a new game each month based on popular series like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset.

Peters promised Netflix has "lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead".
</p>
<p>
Netflix's fellow co-CEO, president and director Theodore A Sarandos also contributed to the gaming discussion. "I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable," he said. "I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the superfan a place to be in between seasons and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters and new storylines or new plot twist events, now you could do those kind of things and then they can then materialise in the next season or in the sequel to the film."
</p>
<p>
So far, Netflix has launched over one hundred games, though many of these are small in scope.
</p>
<p>
The Netflix mobile app includes a number of third-party games as part of the subscription, like Grand Theft Auto, Football Manager, and Sonic Mania, as well as original Interactive Stories based on Netflix shows like Love is Blind and Perfect Match.
</p>
<p>
Peters noted that, while Netflix had set itself "pretty aggressive engagement growth targets", which it's met, the impact on the overall business is "still quite small" - as is investment.
</p>
<p>
Now, then, "the job is to continue to grow that engagement to the place where it has a material impact on the business," he said.
</p>
<p>
At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-developing-over-10-games-in-house-currently">Netflix head of gaming Mike Verdu revealed the company had over 10 games in development</a> at in-house studios, plus 90 games planned through deals with external teams.

</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the exact split is between in-house and third-party games for the 80 now in development, or what's changed since last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/kamiyas-still-keen-to-make-okami-viewtiful-joe-sequels-even-if-publisher-isnt<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Outspoken former Capcom director Hideki Kamiya has said he feels a "duty" to develop sequels to cult classics Okami and Viewtiful Joe in order to finish off their respective stories. 
</p>
<p>
In his latest video with fellow Capcom alum Ikumi Nakamura, Kamiya asks Capcom again for the ability to return to his former franchises.
</p>
<p>
"Creators have the duty to create sequels fans are wanting to see," Kamiya said. "Although I sound all high and mighty, it's been a while since I've moved on from Okami. But I still feel like I haven't fulfilled my duty. So Capcom-san, please, let's do it together.
</p>
<p>
"Same sentiments for Viewtiful Joe 3," Kamiya continued. "I'd be more than happy."
</p>
<p>
The video is light-hearted, and Kamiya acknowledges he is no longer anything to do with Capcom's own business decisions. Indeed, the director points out that he recently contacted Capcom to complain there was no option to pick Viewtiful Joe in a survey of franchises they'd like to see continue. 
</p>
<p>
"What the hell, Capcom?" Kamiya said in response.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Kamiya is well aware of the business reasons why Okami and Viewtiful Joe are not getting new installments today. 
</p>
<p>
"It's only because eight people have played Viewtiful Joe that people aren't going wild," Kamiya joked. "That game also ended mid-way. So I need to finish it."
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, in a previous video, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okamis-initial-sales-were-huge-failure-says-director-hideki-kamiya">Kamiya described Okami's initial sales as a "huge failure"</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Still, Kamiya seems keen. 
</p>
<p>
"I'm unemployed right now, but not super unemployed," he noted. "I haven't retired as a game creator."
</p>
<p>
Kamiya most recently served as a writer and supervising director on Bayonetta 3 and spin-off Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon, continuing to play a part in the series he originally directed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-leaving-platinumgames">Kamiya departed developer PlatinumGames in October last year</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">issues of "trust"</a>, and it's unclear what the developer is up to now.
</p>
<p>The director has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-say-he-may-take-his-ideas-for-the-series-to-the-grave-with-him">previously said he would take his ideas for future Bayonetta games "to the grave"</a> with him.

		<p>Heihachi Mishima is making a comeback in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tekken-8">Tekken 8’s</a> third DLC, Bandai Namco has announced to cap off Evo 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 - Heihachi Mishima Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It seems that reports of his death were greatly overstated, as Heihachi will be coming to Tekken 8 this autumn as the third character in the Playable Character Year 1 Pass. He will follow on from Eddy, who arrived earlier this year, and Lidia, who <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/12/lidia-sobieska-joins-tekken-8-from-july-22nd/">is joining the game’s roster this week</a>. Heihachi is a nice surprise, given the previous leaks and rumours had suggested that&nbsp;Craig Marduk and Fahkumram were the other characters in the season pass.</p>
<p>Sweetening the pot even further, Tekken 8 will also get a post-release story expansion for the first time in the series’ history. Adding a new chapter, it will expand on The Dark Awakens storyline further, which features the battle between the Kazama and Mishima families. This new chapter will be available as a free update for all Tekken 8 players, and I’m sure it will have a really, really good and plausible explanation for how he has been brought back to life. That or the usual kind of comic book or soap opera shenanigans.</p>
<p>Was his mouth always that big, by the way? Not only that, but considering he was 76 years old in Tekken 7, that’s one seriously impressive set of chompers he’s still got. Then again, considering the ravages of time and the amount of fists and feet to the face he’s taken over the decades, I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re dentures.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8 review</a>, Nick wrote, “Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a>, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time.”</p>
<p>Tekken 8 launched on 26th January 2024, and is available across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>

            <p>Heihachi Mishima, the mustachioed malevolence of the Tekken series, is going to be the next DLC character for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>. He was last seen with his loving son Kazuya, who <a href="https://youtu.be/3AZLtZ_AWlI?feature=shared&amp;t=172">threw him into a volcano</a>. Of course, to be fully submerged in impossibly hot liquid rock is merely a long-running family prank for the cast of this 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a>, sort of like forcing your granddad to do the ice bucket challenge, but with lava. Nobody truly expected the horn-haired headbutter to be fully removed from the series. But I am a little surprised to see him back so soon. </p>

<p>As the third DLC character, Heihachi is due out sometime this autumn, but no hard release date has been confirmed. He follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-bot-in-tekken-8-is-demolishing-players-by-only-pressing-one-button-over-and-over">single-button reprobate</a> Eddy Gordo and Prime Minister of Poland Lydia Sobieska, both recently added to the game's roster.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell from the trailer, players are also getting an extra chapter of story mode attached to the old man, in which Heihachi is training a posse of hench monks to wavedash over burning coals. Very funny, Mr Mishima. Tekken 8 has "character episodes" for each playable biffer from the base game, but the newer DLC characters haven't got these. So it's nice to see that Eddy and Lydia also appear to feature heavily in whatever the old unkillable man is up to. The extra story chapter will be free to all players, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/tekken/news/the-king-of-iron-fist-returns-tekken-8-first-ever-free-story-expansion-the-series">we're told</a>, whether you buy those characters or not.</p>
<p>Like I said in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>, it's a solid biff 'em up. My main complaint (aside from lamenting the loss of a slower and more cagey style of play) was that my own particular favourite characters were nowhere to be seen. This is sadly still the case. I can't see relative C-listers Miguel or Josie coming any time soon. At least not before the likes of Marduk, Lucky Chloe, or Armor King. My best chance is to hold out for jokey supercop Lei Wulong, my go-to for silly fights and messing around. Ah, maybe next year. </p>
<p>Bandai Namco announced the auld curmudgeon's return at fighting game tournament EVO 2024, where the Tekken 8 finals saw Arslan Ash facing off against Atif Ijaz in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYdVpjah58M">a typically tense match</a> with lots of judicious use of the game's new Heat meter mechanic. So go watch that if you're curious about what high-level Tekkenizing looks like.</p>

            <p>
More Marvel vs Capcom games could be on the way, following the forthcoming Marvel vs. Capcom: Fighting Collection Arcade Classics announced at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct">last month's Nintendo Direct</a>.

</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/exclusive-capcoms-dream-is-to-make-more-marvel-crossover-games-2831616/">Dexerto</a>, the collection's producer Shuhei Matsumoto discussed the future of the franchise.
</p>
<p>
"The development team at Capcom has big dreams," he said. "Maybe there is an opportunity for a new Marvel vs Capcom game. Maybe there is an opportunity for a new Capcom-based SNK game."
</p>

<p>
While he admitted he doesn't know if that will happen, in the short-term the team can "at least reintroduce these past legacy games to a new audience, to people who may not have the opportunity to play it, because it might not be out on modern or current platforms.
</p>
<p>
"What we can at least do now is to show that, hey, these series exist. We love these games.
We hope that you do too, and maybe in the future, if people get to familiarise themselves with these series, then there may be future opportunities to make bigger games."
</p>
<p>
Matsumoto said both Capcom and Marvel were keen on releasing the forthcoming collection, based in part due to fan interest in the series at competitive tournaments. In fact Capcom has been "in talks with Marvel for years" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
"[Marvel was] also on board," he said. "Because of that, it's kind of like the stars aligned. The timing was great, and now we are actually able to bring it to life. We're all very excited. And some of the inspiration about doing this was that Marvel took notice of community-based tournaments at places like Evo.
</p>
<p>
"With Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 and other Marvel tournaments happening, they know that people really love the series and really want these games to be available on modern platforms, so now is the chance for them to do so."
</p>
<p>
Does this mean Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3 could see a re-release, particularly with rollback netcode included?
</p>
<p>
"There's a lot of things that the team wants to do, and we have a lot of love for Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3," said Matsumoto. "Not just that, but other past fighting games that might not be supported with rollback or are available on a current platform. There's a lot we're looking forward to and big dreams, and now it's a matter of timing and seeing what we can do one step at a time."
</p>
<p>
Marvel vs. Capcom: Fighting Collection Arcade Classics will comprise seven games from the series, including Marvel vs. Capcom Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2 New Age of Heroes, and Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter. It's coming to Switch, PS4, and Steam later this year.
</p>
<p>
Its reveal received a hugely positive response from fans, so a successful release could inspire Capcom further.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps fan demand could also inspire a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">Dino Crisis revival</a> - a recent poll by Capcom showed its the series fans most want to see return.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/live-service-games-get-ditched-too-soon-by-big-publishers-warfame-boss-says<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>"You get terrified when you see the numbers drop."</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Publishers hoping to launch the world's next big live service game often give up on projects too soon, the boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-review">Warframe</a> developer Digital Extremes has said. 
</p>
<p>
Live service games with so-so launches could still be salvaged  with more work, Digital Extreme's Steve Sinclair told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/big-publishers-eject-too-soon-from-live-service-titles-says-warframe-boss/">VGC</a>, rather than moving on and ditching years of progress.
</p>
<p>
"They think the release is make or break, and it's not. They have a financial way to be persistent, and they never do it," Sinclair said. "It comes out, doesn't work and they throw it away."
</p>
<p>
Warframe, which originally launched in 2013, is still going strong a decade on. But plenty of other live service games end up shutting in just a fraction of the time.
</p>
<p>
Marvel's Avengers, published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> in 2020, is a recent example of this. Anthem, from Dragon Age and Mass Effect studio BioWare, is another. And currently there are concerns from fans that, due to low player numbers, Rocksteady's Suicide Squad will be next, after its first year of content concludes.

<p>
"Isn't that a shame when you put so many years of your life into iterating on those systems or building technology or building the start of a community, and because the operating costs are high, you get terrified when you see the numbers drop and you leave," Sinclair continued.
</p>
<p>
"We've seen this with amazing releases that I think have massive potential, and I think they eject too soon."
</p>
<p>
Presumably, Sinclair isn't reflecting on Digital Extremes' own business decisions here - such as its cancellation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-darkness-2-and-warframe-developer-announces-f2p-fps-keystone">The Amazing Eternals (formerly Keystone)</a>, a free-to-play online first-person shooter <a href="https://www.unseen64.net/tag/digital-extremes/">it ditched in 2017</a>, less than two months after it launched in beta.
</p>
<p>
"The competitive landscape at that time was pretty hefty," Digital Extremes' Meredith Braun said at the time. "We just saw [Cliff Bleszinski-made online FPS] LawBreakers not do so great, and it was a fantastic game, so that was sad. That happened right when we were starting our closed beta for Amazing Eternals."
</p>
<p>This weekend we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-1999-expansion-has-a-shopping-mall-romance-system-and-you-even-get-to-fight-a-boyband">Warframe's 1999 expansion has a shopping mall, romance system</a>, and you even get to fight a boyband.</p>

            <p>
Heihachi Mishima, antagonist of the Tekken series, is set to make a return to the series in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8</a> this autumn.
</p>
<p>
Heihachi's reveal was announced at this year's Evo fighting game esports event in a new trailer, along with a new story mode chapter called The Dark Awakens.
</p>
<p>
He'll be the third DLC character added to the game since its release earlier this year, following Eddy Gordo and Lidia Sobieska.

<p>

The Dark Awakens story mode will be free for all Tekken 8 players, focused on the ongoing feud between the Kazama and Mishima families.
</p>
<p>
Heihachi debuted in the very first Tekken game and has featured in every game in the series since. He's therefore deeply connected to the story of Tekken, so it's no surprise to see him return as a playable character in Tekken 8.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, his presence is already felt in the story mode due to his connections to certain characters, where he appears in multiple flashbacks.
</p>
<p>
Iconic capoeira fighter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eddy-gordo-joins-tekken-8-roster-today">Eddy Gordo was added to Tekken 8 in April</a>, while Polish president <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-season-one-roadmap-includes-dlc-fighter-the-polish-prime-minister">Lidia Sobieska joins later this week along with a photo mode</a>.


</p>
<p>
Also announced at Evo was the location of the 2024 Tekken World Tour Finals, which will take place in Tokyo in December.
</p>
<p>
Tekken 8 received extremely positive reviews when it launched in January. "Tekken 8 is a marked improvement over Tekken 7 and a perfectly executed balancing act, keeping older players happy while revealing its trademark freedom to newcomers," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-review">Eurogamer Tekken 8 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Kicking off a brand new story arc in a brand new location, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</a> opens with you joining Wuk Lamat in her quest to complete the Rite of Succession, a grand quest to decide the next to ascend to the throne of Tuliyollal as Dawnservant. It’s an adventure of great discovery for players, as you’ll follow the various exploits and successes of the current Dawnservant, Gulool Ja Ja, journey across the continent of Tural and learn about its many peoples, while also striving to discover the legendary golden city.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Full Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRYcglRzdB0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What Dawntrail focuses on is putting the Warrior of Light (that’s you, by the way) into a mentor role, allowing other characters in the story to become the focal point of the narrative. It doesn’t mean that you are pushed aside, as everyone you meet clocks you immediately as someone to not mess with, but you often work to help others reach their potential as others like Louisoix, Minfillia, or Hauchefant (sorry fanbase) did for you.</p>


<p>The result is that new characters like Wuk Lamat, Koana and others from Tural are really given the space to breathe in this story that rightfully belongs to them. Not only this, but characters that have deserved further development are explored further over the course of the story, such as Erenville and Krile.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that everything is breezy and chilled for the whole time, of course, with Dawntrail having all the classic Final Fantasy trappings of twists, betrayals, and suddenly raising stakes to keep you on your toes. The story introduces certain elements that hark back to previous Final Fantasy games which are handled wonderfully in Dawntrail, but that might be due to my sheer bias towards the specific game that it draws from. Also, the implications that are laid out for the future of the story of FFXIV are both interesting and successfully build upon what we already know in a satisfying fashion.</p>


<p>Dawntrail doesn’t fix what isn’t broken, so the fundamental gameplay of this decade old MMORPG is much the same. You run around the world fighting things, talking to NPCs and occasionally finding yourself instances either alone or with a team to support you. There hasn’t been a brand-new field mechanic introduced this time around, but Dawntrail makes great use of elements and ideas that were introduced with previous expansions &nbsp;–&nbsp;even the ‘following without being noticed’ one, which I did not enjoy previously.</p>
<p>One thing that has been a topic of debate amongst the fans of the game is with the Dungeons and Trials, which are noticeably more challenging than previous expansions. The bosses themselves hit damn hard, the mobs are relentless at times, and the mechanics of the fights are combined in some interesting and often brain-stretching ways that require some thinking and repeat runs to overcome. They’re not impossible by any means, but tough to parse out on occasion.</p>

<p>Personally, I have loved this increase in difficulty as it has been fun to overcome each challenge the game has thrown at me, and – as a White Mage player – it is always nice to feel needed. Also, by the time you’re pushing past level 90 and have followed countless instances, players should be capable of tackling these challenges. That said, I’m a savage/extreme player; I’m used to far worse than this, so this increased difficulty could push away less ardent players.</p>
<p>Speaking of combat, there are a couple new Jobs, and these complement the others well. Viper, the twin-blade wielding swashbuckler, is your new melee DPS. This Job is great fun and, once you get past the slightly confusing tool tips for the abilities, flows together in a satisfying flurry of slashes. I’m yet to experience the higher levels of this Job, so cannot call myself an expert by any means, but what I have played makes it easy to recommend to those that like being up close and personal.</p>

<p>For those like me that enjoy being a bit further away from the action, the other new Job is Pictomancer – think Bob Ross, but even more magical. This magical ranged DPS uses paint to create weapons, monsters and spells to attack in combat and might just be the most fun I have had with a Job in years. It does take a while to click, as the amount of set-up required to effectively use the abilities is larger than most other Jobs, but once you get it, the rotation of the abilities is just so damn satisfying and colourful.</p>
<p>The changes to existing Jobs, which have changed again since launch with this week’s 7.01 patch, have been a mixed bag as they always are. My precious White Mage thankfully hasn’t changed much, aside from receiving a new little dash, but other Jobs have received dramatic reworks. Some of these reworks have allow for smoother transitions for their fans, while others have basically been completely changed. The Astrologian is one such Job, which I had only just learned how to play again in Endwalker and will now have to start learning all over again!</p>

<p>If changes to your favourite Job have you gnashing your teeth in annoyance, at least you can sink into the undeniable beauty of this game. Every area in Dawntrail is brimming with bright blues, greens and golds, and full of sweeping vistas to gawp at. In fact, I have taken more screenshots while playing Dawntrail than I ever remember in another game, let alone previous expansion of this one. This is bolstered by the graphical update that came with the 7.0 update for Final Fantasy XIV that has greatly improved the lighting effects, many of the textures, and a lot of the character models.</p>
<p>The improved characters models are especially noticeable as Dawntrail has an almost excessive number of close ups on characters. This has happened previously, of course, but pretty much every cutscene in Dawntrail has a “Look how pretty these characters are. <em>Look at it!</em>” moment, and they’re right – the characters look fantastic now. Oh, and of course the most important part of FFXIV, the glamours, has been really given a boost by this update too with some gorgeous new gear to obtain.</p>
<p>Then there’s the music. Oh boy, the music. I mentioned this previously in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-in-progress/">review in progress</a>, but Soken is emptying his bag of musical tricks with this expansion. From the incredible jazz background music of Tuliyollal to the lo-fi beats of Solution Nine, every track of this game is infused with the same vibrant life of the core narrative and visual style of the expansion. The field battle theme is one of the best in the entire game, the boss theme is stellar, and the final boss theme – just wow. I’m now eagerly awaiting the release of the Dawntrail OST</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Late last week, 241 developers from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-tips-guide">Starfield</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-elder-scrolls">The Elder Scrolls</a> developers Bethesda Game Studios announced a "wall-to-wall" union under the Communication Workers of America (CWA). Alongside Bethesda Montreal’s <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_MTL/status/1806001296593346639">unionisation last month</a>, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-qa-workers-just-formed-the-largest-union-in-video-games">union of Zenimax QA workers</a> last year, this marks a historic moment in the US game industry labour movement.</p>

<p>"We, a majority of developers at Bethesda Game Studios Dallas, Rockville, and Austin, are ecstatic to announce the formation of our union with [the CWA]," the union <a href="https://x.com/OneBGS_USA/status/1814417799902601409">announced on X</a>. "As a democratic organization, we seek to empower the collective wishes of our studios' workers; having a safe, sustainable, and equitable work environment for all.  Having a proper seat at the discussion table allows us to turn those wishes into reality."</p>
<p>The union has been recognised by Microsoft, though no contract has yet been finalised. "We’re thrilled to get down to brass tacks and win a fair contract," said CWA member Mandi Parker in <a href="https://code-cwa.org/stories/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">a statement</a> on the organisation’s website. "Our unity is a source of real power to positively shape our working conditions, our lives, and the company as a whole."</p>
<p>The Bethesda Game Studios staffers join others who have successfully formed unions with the CWA, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-of-america-staff-have-ratified-a-union-contract-the-first-to-do-so-at-a-major-us-studio">Sega of America</a> and Activision Blizzard. Earlier this year, the CWA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activision-qa-supplier-lionbridge-accused-of-retaliatory-layoffs-in-union-busting-move">filed Unfair Labor Practice charges</a> against Activision QA supplier Lionbridge Technologies after they allegedly fired the entirety of a 160-person team in retaliation for union-related activities.</p>
<p>In August of last year, the CODE-CWA <a href="https://x.com/CODE_CWA/status/1696518155336593704">announced</a> that there were more than 4,000 tech, game, and digital worker members in the CWA. It’s heartening to see that number growing, given months and months of firing, closures, and 'quiet layoffs' - in which companies effectively <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-citizen-devs-cloud-imperium-fined-for-discriminating-against-autistic-programmer-over-work-from-home-request">terminate vulnerable employees</a> with return-to-office mandates.</p>
<p>In May of this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">shuttered several studios</a>, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> makers Tango Gameworks and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prey-2017">Prey</a> studio Arkane Austin.</p>

            <p>Steve Sinclair, CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warframe">Warframe</a> studio Digital Extremes, reckons publishers should give live service games more time to find their footing, and not see dodgy release periods as a "make or break" indicator of a game’s success. "It comes out, doesn’t work and they throw it away," Sinclair told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/big-publishers-eject-too-soon-from-live-service-titles-says-warframe-boss/">VGC</a>.</p>

<p>Natus Vincere has claimed the top spot at the Esports World Cup, dominating G2 in a reverse sweep for the ages and landing the $400,000 grand prize – and 1000 Club Championship Points. It was an epic tournament from start to finish, and during the playoffs, NAVI propelled ever onwards, wiping out FaZe Clan, MOUZ, and finally, G2 Esports to win the first CS2 tournament at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-historic-win">Historic Win</h2>



<p>Natus Vincere is by no means a stranger to Counter-Strike victories. It’s one of the winningest organisations in the space and has claimed countless trophies, but this one is extra special as it’s the first Counter-Strike 2 tournament to take place at the inaugural Esports World Cup. Now, Natus Vincere’s name will be forever carved in the history books – and on the grand plinth in Riyadh that marks the victors at this monumental event.</p>



<p>In the closing rounds of the tournament, Natus Vincere almost walked effortlessly to the win with a 13 – 6 victory on Inferno. In almost every round, Natus Vincere’s Valerij ‘b1t’ Vakhovsjkyj proved to be far too dominating a force for G2 to handle, earning the Ukrainian player his first MVP award and a high rating from HLTV.</p>



<p>Now that the dust has settled in Riyadh, players can look forward to the next big Counter-Strike 2 event – IEM Cologne 2024, which boasts a $1 million prize pool. After that, we’ve got the ESL Pro League S20, the BLAST Premier: Fall Final, the Thunderpick World Championship, the BLAST: World Final, <strong>and then </strong>the Perfect World Shanghai Major.</p>



<p>It’s a good year to be a CS2 fan.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-marketing-ubisoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-has-put-more-money-into-marketing-star-wars-outlaws-than-any-other-game.933345/</guid>

<p>In a recent financial update, Ubisoft’s CEO revealed that the firm has put more money and effort into marketing Star Wars Outlaws than any other Ubisoft game ever released. He also stressed that the company expects a strong launch based on the ‘positive community sentiment’ circulating the project.</p>



<p>However, a recent gameplay video that surfaced online drew negative feedback based on how ‘unpolished’ the game looks – and it’s hitting the market in just one month.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-marketing-success-apparently">Marketing = Success, Apparently</h2>



<p>During the <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/atyzrozr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent earnings call</a>, Yves Guillemot, the long-time CEO of Ubisoft, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>What we are factoring in is a strong launch for Star Wars Outlaws. That’s the fact that it’s among the most awaited games of the industry this year and reflecting a really strong positive community sentiment, and also the fact that we are coming with the biggest marketing campaign ever so far for a Ubisoft game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It would be interesting to see the numbers, as some Ubisoft titles, such as 2014’s Watch Dogs, had masterful marketing campaigns that included extensive trailers, CGI and live-action representations, billboards, ad spots, and more. Some estimates put the marketing budgets for Assassin’s Creed titles in the hundreds of millions of dollars. By comparison, I don’t feel as though Star Wars Outlaws has enjoyed that prolific a marketing campaign.</p>



<p>Ubisoft thinks the next few months will be monumental for the business. This is mostly because of the impending releases of both Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but also because of the ongoing energy around live service titles like Rainbow Six Siege and XDefiant, which has exceeded expectations since being released in May 2024.</p>

            <p>The below list of new PC games was communicated to me using smoke signals by two brave Advance News Scouts, shortly before the Maw's event horizon expanded by 100 metres. I have not heard from them since. I fear their souls are even now pigmenting the tides of Destiny 2 gifs that fill the Maw's lower intestines. Sergeant Shagbert, Corporal Pieface, I will avenge you in the only way I know how: by posting some words on a website.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 22nd July sees the early access launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cataclismo">Cataclismo</a>, in which you build castles (disclosure: Brendy did some writing for this one), together with Game Boyish action-RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513580/Veritus/">Veritus</a>, in which you storm them. On Tuesday 23rd July, there's pet sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/weyrdlets">Weyrdlets</a>, which Matt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/virtual-pet-sim-weyrdlets-is-like-animal-crossing-on-your-desktop-except-you-might-get-some-real-life-work-done-too">described</a> as "a neat mix of much-needed wholesome distraction and actual real-life utility", <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conscript">Conscript</a>, which Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conscript-review">summarised</a> as "sturdily crafted and gruelling WW1 survival horror", and dystopian circuit puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2312770/Linkito/">Linkito</a>, which Zachtronics diehards might like. On Wednesday 24th July, a choice of two ways to move: tonguing cliffsides in the ribbiting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valley-peaks">Valley Peaks</a>, or oozing morosely around your apartment in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exhausted-man">Exhausted Man</a>. On Thursday 25th July, mech-toting entomophobes get to grips with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earth-defense-force-6">Earth Defense Force 6</a>, while tidy-minded dreamers bask in the spell of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arranger-a-role-puzzling-adventure">Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure</a>. </p>
<p>As for Friday 26th July, our lost Scouts were silent. It's possible that there will be new games on Friday, but to actually name some would be to disgrace the memory of two valiant journalists - two wonderful, noble, made-up men. If you have no respect for the dead, or you're just sick of this framing gag, by all means list a few games in the comments thread. Myself, I'm so distraught that I'm taking the whole week off (this part isn't a joke - I've got Non-RPS Business to attend to.) Hope you have fun!</p>

<p>Heihachi Mishima, the old dude who everyone thought was dead (because Harada told us he was) is making a grand and shocking return to Tekken as the third DLC fighter for Tekken 8. This announcement took place on the stage at EVO 2024 in Las Vegas, with Katsuhiro Harada retconning himself and revealing that Heihachi <strong>didn’t </strong>die at the end of Tekken 7 when he, you know, was<em> thrown into a volcano.</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-heihachi-returns">Heihachi Returns</h2>



<p>In an impressive Tekken 8 trailer, fans are treated to the revelation that Heihachi Mishima is returning to the game as a DLC character:</p>

<iframe title="TEKKEN 8 - Heihachi Mishima Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QZWDIKKvNrc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Despite being tossed into a volcano by his son at the end of Tekken 7, Heihachi is back and looking perfectly healthy. His hair and moustache aren’t even singed by the roaring fires of the red-hot volcano, which is impressive. At this point, Heihachi is just plain stubborn – he’s a pensioner and he refuses to die, taking all forms of punishment with reckless abandon and coming back for more every time.</p>



<p>It’s expected that he’ll arrive as a DLC fighter in Tekken 8 in October or November if the current release schedule is anything to go by. Players are waiting for Lidia to be unlocked at present, and earlier this year, Eddy surfaced as the game’s first DLC fighter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-game-pass-valorant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will arrive on Game Pass later this week on July 24, a known Spanish leaker has claimed.</p>
<p>Some weeks ago, Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already said</a> that Modern Warfare 3 would be coming to Game Pass later this month, and we now have another leaker claiming that the shooter will be added to Microsoft's subscription service this month. On X, usually-well-informed Spanish leaker 'extas1s' (who often writes for Exputer), has <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815163683661594741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that he can now "100%" confirm that Modern Warfare 3 will be added to Game Pass (both PC and Xbox, but no cloud) later this week on July 24.</p>
<p>In the post on X, the Spanish leaker also said that Valorant will be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this week on July 26, following an initial brief beta period on consoles. The 5v5 character-based tactical FPS launched on PC in 2020, and (beta) <a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support for consoles was added last month</a>.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was released for PC and consoles in 2023. The shooter is the third installment in the rebooted Modern Warfare (sub)series. Here's what we wrote about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023-that-familiar-feeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> last year.</p>
<p><em>"Call of Duty Modern Warfare III builds off of last year’s strengths and weaknesses without having enough identity to stand up on its own", </em>we wrote<em>. "So much of this year’s content is recycled in ways the series hadn’t seen before. If you skipped Modern Warfare II and care not for the campaign, the breadth of multiplayer modes can keep players engaged for the next twelve months. It’s tough for Infinity Ward to shake off the comments that this year’s Call of Duty is merely a $60 expansion pack. Even for a fan of the series that has hit prestige year after year, the content this time around is a tough sell. The multiplayer modes and ability to “Carry Forward” unlocks into Modern Warfare III gives players both a fresh start while not forcing them to start from scratch as in previous years. Modern Warfare III might not be one of Call of Duty’s strongest entries, but the multiplayer offerings still remain the biggest draw going forward."</em></p>

<p>Hours ago, one of the most monumental grand final matches in the history of Call of Duty esports unfolded in Texas. On a stunning stage, the New York Subliners and OpTic Texas (on home turf) collided after a weekend of competition that saw both teams battle ferociously for their shot at the title.</p>



<p>When the dust had settled, a 5 – 1 scoreline saw OpTic secure the trophy – the organisation’s first Call of Duty world championship since 2017. This match was a contender for the most electrifying fixture we’ve ever seen in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-finally">Finally.</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas are your new Call of Duty League champions after eradicating the reigning champs, the New York Subliners, in an intense best-of-nine. Every step of the way, OpTic Texas was dominant, maintaining control in almost every round and refusing to relent against a capable Subliners squad. </p>



<p>It was a relatively balanced fixture in the opening Hardpoint and the first round of Search and Destroy, with the first two rounds going the way of OpTic before the Subliners picked up a clean win in Control on Karachi. That’s when OpTic Texas entered a flow state, winning the second Hardpoint by a 120-point margin and walking all over the Subliners in the second Search and Destroy.</p>



<p>On home turf, the crowd was volcanic, and the presence of the OpTic leadership team alongside the iconic dynasty of Crimsix, Scump, Karma, and FormaL meant that the Green Wall was alive and enthralled during this event. It couldn’t have worked out better for OpTic Texas if it had been scripted.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Special commendations should be handed down to every member of the OpTic Texas squad. For Dashy, it’s his first ring after seven appearances at Champs. Kenny (with his headband) is a two-time world champion now and maintained a flawless aura throughout this fixture. Shotzzy, who became MVP of the event, deserves endless praise for netting another ring. Finally, Pred, who played out his rookie season in 2022, needs recognition for his unparalleled energy this year.</p>



<p>It was a phenomenal event from start to finish, but it marks the end of our CDL 2024 season. Now, we look to the Esports World Cup for what comes next.</p>

Unlike the Steam Deck which runs Linux, Asus went with standard Windows for its operating system, which in theory allows for more games to run natively as well as the option to more easily run a variety of PC gaming storefronts. Now, in 2024, the Ally X provides a much-needed hardware refresh that improves the form factor and functionality of the device. And this time, Asus assures us the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ally X won’t be frying SD cards</a></span> (more on that later).</p><p>The Ally X, notably, is not a full blown “sequel” to 2023’s Ally. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmHGuBNq2wF&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmHGuBNq2wF" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">At $799</a></span>, it doesn’t upgrade the processor from the first, higher tier model. The AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme, however, is more than capable of powering a vast majority of modern games, from tiny indie titles that won’t ever trouble it, to more substantial graphical powerhouses like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. The Ally X, however, did add more (and faster) memory, with 24GB of ram and it has a very, <em>very</em> generous 80Wh battery that made me almost never think about battery life during my time with it. And it does have the same 7-inch, 1080p, 16:9 LCD screen that, while obviously not as flashy as an OLED panel, never fails to look splendid (that is, when my fingerprints weren’t all over its glossy surface).</p><p>While I have issues with Windows as an operating system for handheld gaming, the Ally X has made it hard for me to go back to my Steam Deck. That said, I still find Valve’s portable PC to be a better gaming experience overall. But oof, it’s gettin’ close ya’ll. </p><h2 id="h67728"><a id=""></a>My experience with the Ally X</h2><p>I’ll spit numbers and stats at you in a moment, and I’ll more thoroughly address my complaints where they exist. But there’s no mistaking it: The Ally X provided me with a wonderful portable gaming experience, and it’s likely to continue doing so. It is a substantial improvement to the experience of the original Ally and is compact enough to make it worth putting up with Windows.</p><p>As a New Yorker, I decided to really lean into the Ally X’s portable potential as much as possible. While that motivation was a little cut short by the fact that the Ally X doesn’t include a case (forcing me to use the inner shell of my Steam Deck OLED case in which it…mostly fit), its smaller size compared to the Steam Deck was welcome as I traveled on trains and buses daily. </p><p>Once I got past some frustrations with Windows 11, I rarely thought about hardware and software, I just gamed. My time was largely spent with <em>Flintlock</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em> (which I had to be home for due to a required internet connection), and <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. All ran with virtually zero flaws at a decent 40-60 frames per second depending on how I fiddled with the graphics settings. The screen has a 120HZ refresh rate too, so you can push to even higher framerates with the right game.<br></p><p>And because I was playing games on my Steam account, I could come home and pick up right where I left off on my much more powerful home computer. Like the Steam Deck, the Ally X flattens the boundary between PC gaming at home and on the go, but with wonderful battery life and a form factor that is more like pulling my Switch out of my bag than it is the mini battle tanks other portable gaming PCs tend to be.</p><p>The Ally X provides a fantastic PC gaming experience on the go for a price that’s a touch steep, but fair if you’re up for investing in a great portable experience. </p><p>That said, the choice of operating system here, which technically is not Asus’ fault, can make for some rough setup and more than a few frustrating quirks.</p><h2 id="h67729"><a id=""></a>Windows %@*&amp;ing sucks for this kind of gaming experience</h2><p>My first hour or so with the Ally X was spent, well, setting up Windows. I had to sign into my Microsoft account, turn down all the offers for a free trial of OneDrive, Microsoft 365, and other stuff that isn’t a concern to me whatsoever on a gaming machine. Then, for some reason, it wouldn’t recognize my pin to sign into the device. So I had to reset that a number of times. </p><figure id="" data-id="4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-recommend-id="image://4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-recommend-id="image://4de5ae875f015dec11bd7c1874515e4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Windows error shows on an Ally X screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given that you shouldn’t leave a portable Windows machine just open for anyone to pick up and sign into your personal account, having a pin to unlock the device is necessary. And because Windows doesn’t recognize controller input on its lock screen, I had to use the touch screen as I attempted and reset my pin two or three times. </p><p>By the end of going through Windows setup and constantly entering my pin, I was exhausted and left with a device with fingerprint smudges on it because I can’t use the controller buttons to sign in. </p><p>And it didn’t end there. Windows would constantly do its weird Windows things. While playing <em>Elden Ring</em>, I’d get spontaneously taken back to the desktop with no way to get the game back on the screen easily. Remember, there’s no keyboard, so I can’t Alt + Tab to it. I’d swipe up constantly to make the Windows taskbar appear to keep pressing the game’s icon to no luck. That, of course, left more fingerprint smudges on the device. </p><figure id="" data-id="d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-recommend-id="image://d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Just navigating Windows will result in more smudges than anyone ideally wants.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-recommend-id="image://d95541eb03700bd6d7f38ea010734ab8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X shows several fingerprints on the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Suspending the device to toss it back in my bag while moving between trains was also unpredictable. I’d hit the power button to see it go black and then suddenly pop to life again on the Windows lock screen. Why? I don’t know. Sure, there are ways to tailor Windows to play nicer with this kind of form factor, but the operating system is an unideal solution for portable gaming. It pales in comparison to SteamOS on the Steam Deck and doesn’t even come close to the seamless experience of using something like a Nintendo Switch. I would gladly take a gaming-specific operating system that might technically run fewer games (though the Proton compatibility layer for Linux OS is making Windows less and less essential these days) over an operating system that is just foundationally not meant for this kind of form factor.</p><p>There’d be other issues, like troubleshooting randomly disconnecting Bluetooth with a pair of Pixel Buds Pro that never has issues on other devices. Random Windows prompts here and there were another pain point, as was any time I seemingly activated Co-Pilot for reasons unbeknownst to me. </p><p>While Windows has gotten better with recognizing a gamepad as an input device, it’s still best practice to set up your Ally X with a keyboard and mouse connected. I loved the hardware of the Ally X, but companies like Asus desperately need to start exploring alternatives, or Microsoft needs to relent and offer some kind of more lightweight version of its OS for these kinds of gaming devices.</p><figure id="" data-id="af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-recommend-id="image://af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>I spent most of a morning’s train ride trying to troubleshoot this nonsense.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-recommend-id="image://af2b5ce3be1ed6574457ef3d19a232c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error screen on Windows shows why headphones won't work." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Something’s gotta give because this is not a great solution. </p><p>But once I got gaming, and Windows left me alone, <em>damn</em>,<em> </em>the Ally X rocks. </p><h2 id="h67730"><a id=""></a>The Ally X just <em>feels </em>right</h2><p>Upon first holding the device, the Ally X is immediately more comfortable than its predecessor and everything just feels more premium this time around. The shell has been tweaked a bit so it’s a touch larger than the original Ally, but its grips are less angular so it just rests in your hands more naturally. To be honest, I still find the Steam Deck to be more comfortable even if it is a larger device compared to the Ally X.</p><figure id="" data-id="282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-recommend-id="image://282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-recommend-id="image://282cb994367c6e88450a4a3d3e2d3b98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The rear of the Ally X shows off its grips and buttons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The triggers and bumpers have been reshaped and feel better. The same is true of the four face buttons, which, though still flat and less colorful as I’d like them to be, feel better to press than the original device. The thumbsticks, in particular, are excellent, with more resistance than the previous ones. The d-pad also got some love and feels more reliable and less slippy than the glossy one on the original. The dual rear buttons are also less prominent than the original Ally, which on that device I had found to be too prone to accidental presses.</p><div><h4> I almost never thought about battery life  </h4><p> The Ally X ships with a 65W charger that gets  the Ally X up to a full charge quickly (it’s compatible with a 100W  charger if you want even faster charge times). I don’t remember how many  times I charged this device, but it wasn’t an everyday requirement.  You’ll get less battery life if you switch the device to its more  powerful performance setting in Asus’ utility software, but even while  playing modern games, battery life was beyond generous.  </p></div><p>The Ally X is a touch heavier than the original Ally, but in my opinion, this helps it feel a little more “premium” in the weird way that extra weight sometimes does. </p><p>All of these form factor changes mean that if you’re considering an upgrade from the first Ally, you’re gonna have to go shopping for a new case and/or skin since it won’t be compatible with existing accessories for the first Ally. </p><figure id="" data-id="f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-recommend-id="image://f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-recommend-id="image://f97582bddb0236b5fe9e83ba9410acad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Ally X runs Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finally, the choice to go with a slick matte black isn’t just aesthetically pleasing, it helped me focus a bit more on the game. While I like a colorful object as much as anyone else, the black case makes it easier for your eyes to focus on the screen more so than the bright white of the original Ally’s case. </p><div><h4> What exactly did Asus upgrade?  </h4><p> Though it sports the same processor and 120HZ  screen of the original Z1 Extreme Ally, the Ally X comes with twice the  battery capacity, an additional 8 GB of RAM (which runs at a faster  speed than the original), more cooling vents and improved fans to push  heat out of the device. It also ships with 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe storage.  Check out the one-to-one breakdown of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-all-the-improvements-in-the-new-rog-handheld/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://rog.asus.com/articles/rog-ally/rog-ally-vs-rog-ally-x-all-the-improvements-in-the-new-rog-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both model’s specs on Asus’ blog</a></span>.  </p></div><p>Perhaps the best addition, however, is an extra USB-C port that can both charge the device and connect to peripherals or any USB4 compatible device. With the Ally X, Asus has made the case that these kinds of machines need two USB ports. You won’t need an external hub, for example, to charge the device while connecting it to a screen or other device. With two ports, the Ally X just feels more portable and less dependent on carrying around a bag full of extra stuff to sprout more connections into the device.</p><figure id="" data-id="60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-recommend-id="image://60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Asus / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-recommend-id="image://60f521036b2a0a91ed96bb7d7e5fce48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cables are plugged into an Ally X." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ally X is an excellent, premium-feeling portable PC gaming experience with fantastic battery life, a very pretty, color-rich screen, and increased utility with its additional USB C port. </p><h2 id="h67731"><a id=""></a>The most minor of hardware complaints</h2><p>I love the Ally X, as you might’ve noticed. But there were a few things I think could’ve been better (aside from Windows sucking the fun out of the room).</p><p>While the screen looks great, it is a fingerprint magnet. Given how much you need to use the touch screen to operate Windows to use the machine, that means a single session of gaming will see this thing smudged up pretty quickly. I found that I had to carry around a microfiber cloth to consistently wipe away the marks. The Ally X also repositioned its right thumbstick to be closer to the screen. This would often lead me to accidentally touch the screen with my right thumb. Not only would that leave more fingerprints, it would sometimes trigger something in-game as many games recognize a touch screen as a mouse click.</p><p>I also would’ve liked to have seen a 16:10 1920x1200 screen instead of the cinematic, more desktop standard 16:9 1920x1080 size. With 16:10, you get a taller image which pairs nicely with a smaller device. Such a ratio is standard on the Steam Deck and Switch for a reason. The 16:9 letterbox shape just feels a little too tight for me. That said, some older games don’t support that resolution, so the extra real estate isn’t always getting used. Still, it would’ve been a nice inclusion. </p><p>Also, for 800 bucks, the Ally X should ship with a case. </p><h2 id="h67732"><a id=""></a>Asus’ past Ally troubles</h2><p>An impressive machine in its own right, the first Ally certainly satisfied with a pretty LCD screen, a slim form factor, and some satisfyingly powerful compute power to run games at 1080p, often at great framerates. But with great power comes great heat, and that heat turned out to be a problem for the 2023 Ally model as it would be known to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/1/24146755/asus-rog-ally-sd-card-reader" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fry SD cards</a></span>. </p><p>To make matters worse, Asus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1c6dr0d/asus_finally_officially_acknowledges_the_sd_card/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1c6dr0d/asus_finally_officially_acknowledges_the_sd_card/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t exactly swift to own up to this problem</a></span>. Eventually, the company would issue an additional year warranty on the Ally to make up for any future problems users may have with the SD card reader. </p><p>That wasn’t the end of it. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/7pMrssIrKcY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/7pMrssIrKcY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamers Nexus </em>documented</a></span> in its video on the Ally’s repair services, Asus seemingly wasn’t the most honest and transparent when it came to servicing a defective device. It was an experience many other Ally owners had as well, which would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/14/24178785/asus-customer-support-gamers-nexus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lead Asus to promise</a></span> to revamp its customer service experience to avoid further issues.</p><p>For some, the damage may have already been done. And, to be honest, that’s something to take into consideration when we’re talking about throwing down $800 on the new Ally X. </p><p>Speaking to <em>Kotaku</em>, an Asus representative stated that the SD card issue has “long been identified” and that the team “took all precautions possible to avoid users encountering similar issues with the Ally X.” Time will tell how true that is. Asus also said that it will be offering a standard, one-year warranty with the Ally X, as it doesn’t anticipate the new device running into the same issue that caused them to extend the warranty on the original Ally to two years.</p><h2 id="h67733"><a id=""></a>The ROG Ally X is a fantastic hardware refresh</h2><p>The Ally X is easily the best version of the Ally. It feels great to play. Has beyond-excellent battery life and comes in a form factor that’s perfect for on-the-go gaming, despite a frustrating operating system.</p><p>All of that said, Asus is going to have to earn its trust back after previous problems. I hesitate to say it’s worth an upgrade if you have already invested in the Ally Z1 Extreme from last year, but if you’ve been interested in portable PC gaming and <em>need</em> Windows, the Ally X is more than up to the job.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
