            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, during Epic's State of Unreal presentation, we were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treated to a stunning The Witcher IV tech demo</a> that served as a preview of the level of graphics fidelity CD Projekt RED aims for with the final game. Such a great demo excited the franchise's millions of fans in anticipation of the day they'll get to play it.</p>



<p>There's still a long way before the game's launch, though. While development has been going at full speed (and with more developers than ever, 444 at the last count), CD Projekt RED has confirmed that The Witcher IV won't release before 2027. In the meantime, fans are starving for tidbits, and one such thing was provided this week <a href="https://x.com/PhiWeber/status/1962953933871042847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via X</a> by Narrative Director (previously Quest Designer on The Witcher III: Wild Hunt and Cyberpunk 2077) Philipp Weber. After sharing a picture of <a href="https://amzn.to/46m9C0h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, the latest book written by saga creator Andrzej Sapkowski (out on September 30 in English), a fellow user asked whether any of the book's points would be taken from this new book into The Witcher IV. This was Weber's response:</p>



<p><em>I can't reveal how exactly we'll do it, but Season of Storms also came out while we developed The Witcher 3, so we still tried to include some of the new elements. You can expect something similar!</em></p>



<p>Granted, Crossroads of Ravens is a prequel book. So was Season of Storms, but Crossroads of Ravens is the earliest book in the timeline as far as Geralt's character is concerned. As such, it's hard to imagine CD Projekt RED incorporating more than just a few general ideas into The Witcher IV, which takes place much later in the storyline.</p>



<p>The good news is that CD Projekt RED has long since 'solidified' its relationship with Sapkowski himself. As you may recall, Sapkowski, a self-progressed non-gamer, initially licensed the game rights for a relative pittance. After witnessing the enormous success of the third installment, though, the author eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million from the Polish studio</a>, alleging that those rights were only valid for the first game. </p>



<p>A little over a year later, the two parties <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement</a>, which included a 'framework for future cooperation'. As such, it is possible CD Projekt RED may have already picked Sapkowski's mind to ensure their vision for The Witcher IV is in line with the author's.</p>

            <p>
Fear not, fans of spirit candy! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cats-out-of-the-bag-stardew-valley-update-17-revealed-bagged-cat-content-tbc">The recent announcement of Stardew Valley 1.7 update</a> is not evidence that Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> has been banished to the realm of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-favourite-videogame-vapourware-no-silksong-allowed-edition">vapourware</a> - or so sayeth Barone himself, at least. In a brief and caveat-strewn Q&amp;A, the life sim creator has gone into more depth about development on Stardew, revealing that he's not as heavily involved with it as with previous updates. As such, he's still focussing "the vast majority" of his attention on Haunted Chocolatier.</p>
<p>It's even possible that the latter will release before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>'s next update, but let's not count our Cocoa Loco Little Choc Chicks (£6.99 minus delivery costs) before they've hatched.
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"Recently, I announced that there will be another major content update for Stardew Valley -- the 1.7 update," <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2025/09/02/on-the-recent-stardew-valley-1-7-update-announcement/">writes Barone on his blog</a>. "You might be wondering: If ConcernedApe is working on Stardew Valley 1.7, will that cause Haunted Chocolatier to take longer? The answer: Maybe a little, but not as much as you might think."
</p>
<p>

Barone goes onto explain that he's been working with a small team on Stardew Valley additions and fixes since update 1.3 - he's still "completely solo" on Haunted Chocolatier "for the time being". 
</p>
<p>
While he was "fully, personally locked-in on content development" for previous Stardew updates, Barone says that with update 1.7, "I have been trying to take more of a "creative director" role in the team, so that (at least for now) I can focus the vast majority of my attention on Haunted Chocolatier." 
</p><p>
"So far, it's been pretty good... we are working at a relaxed pace, we have a ton of ideas, and everything has been high quality," Barone continues. "Eventually, I will have to spend a little more time focused on Stardew Valley, because in order for me to maintain a full connection to the game, I need my hand to touch every piece of new content. And there are some aspects of content development which I insist on doing myself, like the music. 
</p>
<p>
"But with our "no release date" approach to the 1.7 update, it's not certain when that time will come. It might even be after Haunted Chocolatier comes out. (no guarantees though)".
</p>
<p>
Barone adds that "the reality of my life is that I have a very popular 1st game that I still want to take care of, which means that my 2nd game might take a little longer". Stardew Valley's audience is "still growing", he notes, and "it's hard to just stop improving it when there are still things that can be improved. But I hope the approach I am taking for Stardew Valley 1.7 will help keep Haunted Chocolatier on track."
</p>
<p>
Stardewman remains tight-lipped as to what update 1.7 might involve. We don't know a whole caboodle about Haunted Chocolatier, either, other than that it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/haunted-chocolatier-is-the-stardew-valleys-developers-next-rpg">more of an action-RPG than Stardew Valley</a>, and sees you staffing a chocolate shop with ghosts.</p><p>Let me laboriously do some Audience Engagement and ask: what kind of chocolate would you be <em>least</em> surprised to discover is made by ghosts? I've always found hazelnut truffles a bit sinister. I find that they mysteriously make me fatter - clear indications of paranormal activity.

Word on the street is that developers at both Crystal Dynamics and The Initiative were given a chance to salvage the title by seeking a new funding partner. Yet, despite talks initially progressing with a range of suitors including Grand Theft Auto owner Take-Two Interactive, disagreements regarding who would take ownership of the franchise seemingly created an impasse. The end result? More people out of work.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/wildgate-and-sunderfolk-publisher-dreamhaven-is-making-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Wildgate and Sunderfolk developer-publisher Dreamhaven is making layoffs</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/polygon-staffers-reunite-to-establish-independent-video-game-website-rogue">Former Polygon staffers establish independent video game website Rogue</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer // </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Video game journalists, much like developers, have been subject to a debilitating deluge of layoffs of late.

The solution for many has been to shun corporate ownership entirely and kickstart independent publications. Enter Rogue, a new worker-owned outlet established by seven former Polygon staffers. The website was formed in partnership with Rascal and will dish out news, guides, interviews, and more. Some articles (including most news and guides) will be free, while other content will be locked behind a subscription. The upshot of that reader-supported model, according to the founding team, is that advertisements and sponsored articles will be consigned to history.

<p>Barone's name was spotted in Silksong's credits, which you can access from the Extras part of the main menu.

<p>But! Neither Mereidos nor Barone will confirm who Barone voices in Silksong. Medeiros said Barone would rather not say so as not to spoil anything. Barone could potentially be any of the weird and wonderful characters you bump into along the way.</p>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has already surpassed half a million concurrent players on Steam mere hours after its launch.
</p>
<p>
After years of hype, Team Cherry's bug-filled Metroidvania finally released yesterday. On Steam, Silksong was the most wishlisted game on the charts and that's now converted to a huge number of players.
</p>
<p>
At the time of writing, Silksong has an all-time peak of 535,213 players. That's already the eighteenth highest all-time peak of concurrent players ever, beaten only by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> in terms of games released this year.

<p>
And that player count will only increase over the weekend once more players download the game and get stuck in.
</p>
<p>
What's more, this is just Steam. Silksong is also available across both Switch consoles, PlayStation, and Xbox, as well as on Xbox Game Pass, so there are plenty more people playing the game across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-causes-server-chaos-on-xbox-steam-and-nintendo-as-platforms-grind-to-a-halt">surge of players downloading Silksong immediately caused server chaos across almost every platform</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's clear Silksong is proving to be an exceedingly popular release - but does it live up to the hype? We'll have a full review in the near future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>IGN has published <span>exclusive new boss fight gameplay captured from Nioh 3. The third installment in KOEI TECMO's action RPG series was&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-announced-with-action-packed-trailer-launches-in-early-2026-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank">announced</a>&nbsp;around three months ago during Sony's June State of Play presentation. It</span> is already relatively close to release, being scheduled to launch in early 2026.</p>



<p>Unlike the prior two games, which debuted as PlayStation exclusives for a few months, Nioh 3 will launch right away on PC, too. The game even already has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Steam page</a>, although it doesn't list the PC system requirements yet.</p>



<p>Compared to its predecessors, which featured fairly linear environments, this new entry will offer players an open world-style map to explore. Another significant change will be the ability to switch at any time between the Samurai and Ninja fighting styles. According to the developers, the Samurai style offers a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles, though new actions have been added, such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment. These new actions help create intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions. This gives ninjas the advantage of attacking from outside the enemy’s range by utilizing various "Ninjitsu" techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players can use techniques such as Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows players to narrowly avoid enemy strikes. These techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Fans already got their hands on Nioh 3 thanks to the limited-time Alpha demo that KOEI TECMO released back in June. The demo was also useful for developer Team Ninja to gauge player satisfaction in the game's various areas. According to the Alpha report <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/feedback.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on the official website</a>, these are some of the improvements that the team is working on for the final game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Improve controls in response to high demand from players.</li>



<li>Improve problem areas in control responsiveness.</li>



<li>Make controls more customizable by adding options.</li>



<li>Adjust gimmicks and enemies that were unreasonably difficult.</li>



<li>Add and improve tutorial visibility.</li>



<li>Adjust the performance and balance of various actions.</li>



<li>Improve the overall quality of background graphics.</li>



<li>Improve the visibility and balance of stages and the open field, and make exploration elements easier to understand and more well-balanced.</li>



<li>Make notifications and other elements that appear on screen during combat less distracting, and make it possible to dismiss such notifications via button/key input.</li>



<li>Improve the balance of progression elements.</li>



<li>Improve the quality of the multiplayer mode.</li>
</ul>

And while tropical getaways and summer camp experiences are the focus of this pack, it's also bringing back imaginary friends from The Sims 3. You can see one of the imaginary friends in the first trailer for Adventure Awaits, as well as an extended glimpse at your Sims vacation options.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS0NxrRJm6I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aS0NxrRJm6I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Adventure Awaits doesn't just cater to adult sims. Child sims are also given the chance to have formative moments as they discover archery, diving, papercraft, and other camp activities. As for the imaginary friends, they will appear as four different dolls with a handful of personality types: Goofball, creative, competitive, and evil. Picking the evil option seems unnecessarily risky, but it's your Sim life and you get to make all of the bad decisions you want.</p><p>There are three Gibbi Point vacation neighborhoods included in this pack, including Camp Gibbi Gibbi in the Wanderwood Wilds. There are so many camp activities for children and adult sims that the only thing it's missing is Jason Voorhees to menace the camp attendees. The other neighborhoods in the pack are Crystal Valley and Jellyfish Junction.</p><p>Each neighborhood has its own exclusive activities, and adult sims can take up everything from kayaking to fishing for jellyfish. Players also have the option of turning their sims into park workers as either camp counselors or park rangers. If none of those vacation getaways appeal to you, players can build their own custom resorts. EA has also teamed up with Sims custom creators Jeyjeybink, daniellebuilds, Gryphi, KiwiSimsKate, and Axiisims, all of whom created their own unique experiences for fans to sample.</p><p>A gameplay trailer for The Sims 4 Adventure Awaits will debut on September 10. The expansion itself will follow on October 2 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>And it's seemingly got nothing to do with cost</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Star Wars Outlaws" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/878241ef8df8a/star-wars-outlaws.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, released on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>, is the latest in a long line of Switch 2 titles utilising the Game-Key Card physical release.</p>
<p>It's safe to say that most folks are under the assumption that cost is likely the driving factor behind the use of the Game-Key Card medium, with Nintendo supposedly only offering 64GB cartridges to third-party developers.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">Bluesky</a>, however, Rob Bantin, who is the audio architect for Ubisoft's proprietary Snowdrop engine, explained the decision to use Game-Key Cards, and it's seemingly got nothing to do with cost. Instead, it's all to do with the disc streaming required for Outlaws' open world, with Bantin stating that the Switch 2 cartridges simply don't offer the performance needed for Ubisoft to hit its quality target.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6EOKFq0qA_o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6EOKFq0qA_o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60cf74mtquso&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EOKFq0qA_o" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p>"Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments, and we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for. I don’t recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion - probably because it was moot.</p>
<p>"I think if we’d designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we’d build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Linneman of Digital Foundry empathised with the reasoning, stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Honestly, and this sucks, I do kinda get it. To match other consoles, they needed storage that was fast like a modern SSD, right? The cost on that stuff has not come down like the flash memory used for SW1 games. I think they probably did what they could and, even still, those carts cost $23 a piece."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, the explanation here likely won't (and can't) be applied to every Switch 2 game released on Game-Key Card. Some of it is probably going to be tied to cost, but it's nice to see a bit more nuance added to the conversation from both Bantin and Linneman.</p>
<p>Regardless of what side of the fence you sit on, it seems Game-Key Cards are here to stay, whether it's down to cost or technical limitations.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-became-a-million-seller-on-day-one-says-konami.1289526/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Japanese developer and publisher KONAMI <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001239.000050711.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater became a million seller on the day of its release (Thursday, August 28), according to KONAMI's own search when combining retail and digital sales.</p>



<p>It's a solid start for the remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, which was originally released as a PlayStation 2 exclusive and subsequently made it to the Nintendo 3DS in 2012.</p>



<p>The port to Unreal Engine 5 was co-developed by Virtuos, the same studio that recently handled the remaster of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Unfortunately, despite these two big (and rather successful) assignments, Virtuos recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-developer-virtuos-confirms-mass-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suffered significant layoffs of nearly three hundred employees</a>.</p>



<p>Anyway, here's what Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto thought about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in his 9.4/10 PS5 review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the de facto perfect way to experience the rise and fall of Big Boss. Each detail has been meticulously refined and brought to modern standards while leaving nothing behind in the past. While this also means retaining both the campiness and jank, there’s no better way to experience the first Metal Gear Solid title in the timeline. Konami has promised (and delivered) a faithful reproduction of Snake Eater, brought forth into a new console generation without deviating from the title it was based on.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>PC users have already come up with mods and tweaks to improve the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater experience on their favorite platform. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-mod-critical-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'Better Uncap FPS' mod</a> is, of course, a must, since by default the game is limited to 60 frames per second. It was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-pc-users-add-lumen-rt-dlss-4-frame-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discove</a>red that adding a few settings to the game's Engine.ini file can enable features like hardware Lumen ray tracing, Ray Reconstruction, and NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[10 Most Iconic Brands From Fallout—From Nuka-Cola to Vault-Tec]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-most-iconic-brands-from-fallout%E2%80%94from-nuka-cola-to-vault-tec.1289517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is almost an indictment of consumerism and capitalism. It’s bursting at the seams with shady, titanic corporations that almost always had some kind of dubious or deceptive subplot tucked behind the scenes in the run-up to the nuclear war that wiped the United States off the map. </p>



<p>In this list, we’re breaking down the most iconic brands from Fallout, determining which of the many organisations and corporations in the Fallout Universe stand out amongst the crowd.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-recognisable-fallout-brands">Most Recognisable Fallout Brands</h2>



<p>There are quite literally hundreds of brands, labels, organisations, and corporations in Fallout, but which of them can be counted as the most iconic? Here’s our definitive list to settle that debate and give you a little more visibility of the most iconic brands from Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-nuka-cola">1. Nuka-Cola</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuka-Cola is, without a doubt, the most recognisable and iconic brand in Fallout. It’s probably even more recognisable than Vault-Tec, which we’ll get to in a second. </p>



<p>In the Fallout Universe, Nuka-Cola is one of the biggest corporations, and its influence is felt far and wide across the post-apocalyptic wasteland. It’s the many millions of bottle caps from Nuka-Cola bottles that became the de facto currency after the bombs fell, after all.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-vault-tec-industries">2. Vault-Tec Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vault-Tec Industries was responsible for the construction of the vaults that housed many thousands of people as the bombs rained down across the United States in the Fallout Universe. </p>



<p>It’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – its mascot alone, the blond-haired Vault Boy, is one of the most recognisable characters in modern gaming. It might have been a relatively evil, disingenuous corporation, but that’s the point.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-super-duper-mart">3. Super-Duper Mart</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Super-Duper Mart is Fallout’s representation of Wal-Mart, and it’s easily one of the most iconic brands from Fallout. It’s primarily an ‘East Coast’ organisation, so it has only been present in Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76, but that’s enough for the brand to have left a lasting impression on players. </p>



<p>One of the earliest missions in Fallout 3 takes players into the heart of a Super-Duper Mart overrun by Raiders, and that’s a hugely memorable portion of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-west-tek">4. West-Tek</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>West-Tek is one of those Fallout brands that didn’t gain mass prominence until Fallout 76, when players got the opportunity to visit buildings that once housed this titanic technological corporation. </p>



<p>It might not be common knowledge, but West-Tek is one of the most iconic brands from Fallout – it’s the firm responsible for the creation of Power Armor, laser-based weapons, and some of the research into the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus).</p>







<h3 id="h-5-general-atomics-international">5. General Atomics International</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>General Atomics International is responsible for a series of robots that are commonplace across the Fallout Universe. Before the Great War, General Atomics International created the Mister Handy, arguably one of the most recognisable robots from the Fallout series – everyone who has played the games has seen one. It also produced Mister Gutsy, Robobrain, and co-created Liberty Prime.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-robco-industries">6. RobCo Industries</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>We couldn’t list Generic Atomics International and not mention RobCo Industries! This iconic Fallout brand was founded by none other than Robert Edwin House — that’s right, <strong>the </strong>Mr. House from Fallout: New Vegas. </p>



<p>As Fallout’s answer to Tony Stark, Mr. House’s corporation was responsible for the creation of a huge array of robots: Eyebot, Protectron, Sentry Bot, Securitron, Liberty Prime, and Assaultron. Not only that, but RobCo manufactured the Pip-Boy, one of the most instantly recognisable devices from the Fallout Universe!</p>







<h3 id="h-7-hubris-comics">7. Hubris Comics</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Hubris Comics is another iconic Fallout brand that, even if you don’t know it, you’ve come into contact with it. In the Fallout Universe, Hubris Comics publishes a range of illustrated items that users can pick up to get buffs and bonuses – namely, the Grognak the Barbarian line of comic books. </p>



<p>From Fallout 3 to New Vegas and from Fallout 4 to Fallout 76, Hubris’ influence has been felt by millions of players in Fallout.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-poseidon-energy">8. Poseidon Energy</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Poseidon is an energy company, which almost immediately makes it an evil corporation in the Fallout Universe. As the world came grinding to a halt, it was iconic brands like this that squeezed every cent possible out of the citizens of the United States. </p>



<p>In Fallout, Poseidon boasted ownership of some memorable locations, like the Helios One plant from New Vegas and the Oil Rig that housed the Enclave. If that wasn’t enough, Poseidon also invented many of the franchise’s Plasma weapons. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-pulowski-preservation-services">9. Pulowski Preservation Services</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Nuclear protection on a budget! Have you ever seen one of the tall, cylindrical, blue devices scattered around Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and Fallout 76? These are the Pulowski Preservation Shelters, and they make up the backbone of a gigantic scam. </p>



<p>Upon the impending threat of nuclear annihilation, one person could buy their way into one of these street-mounted shelters, but the only issue was that they didn’t work. They’re full of skeletons of the foolish citizens who were eager to hide in them to escape the nuclear fire.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-red-rocket">10. Red Rocket</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Red Rocket is a corporation and one of the most iconic brands from Fallout, without any shadow of a doubt. It operated a network of gas stations across the United States of America in the Fallout Universe, and in the wake of the apocalypse, many of them became makeshift shelters and small settlements for survivors. </p>



<p>They’re instantly recognisable, almost always because of the large model rockets in a ‘launch pose’ on the rooftops of the gas stations littered around the wasteland.</p>

The original Legion Go didn’t have VRR at all, and many VRR screens only go down to 48Hz, so 30Hz is a nice improvement.</p><p>And because Lenovo picked a lower-resolution panel at 1920 x 1200 instead of the overkill 2560 x 1600 of the original, it should be that much easier for its new Z2 or Z2 Extreme chip to deliver enough frames, too.</p><div><table><thead><tr></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Spec</td><td>Legion Go 2</td><td>Legion Go</td></tr><tr><td>Starting price</td><td>$1,099</td><td>$699</td></tr><tr><td>Screen</td><td>8.8-inch 1920 x 1200 OLED with 30–144Hz VRR, 500-nit with 1000-nit peak</td><td>8.8-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS at 144Hz or 60Hz, 500-nit</td></tr><tr><td>Chip</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z2 or Z2 Extreme</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>16GB (Z2) or 32GB LPDDR5X-8000 (Z2E)</td><td>16GB LPDDR5X-7500</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>74 watt-hour</td><td>49.2 watt-hour</td></tr><tr><td>Size w/ pads</td><td>11.64 x 5.38 x 1.66 inches (295.6 x 136.7 x 42.25mm)</td><td>11.76 x 5.16 x 1.6 inches (298.8 x 131 x 40.7mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Tablet size</td><td>8.11 x 5.38 x 0.9 inches (206 x 136.7 x 22.95mm)</td><td>8.27 x 5.16 x 0.79 inches (210 x 131 x 20.1mm)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.38 pounds (1079g)</td><td>1.88 pounds (854g)</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>USB4 x2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset</td><td>USB4 x 2, MicroSD UHS-II, 3.5mm headset</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Speaking of those chips, the AMD Ryzen Z2 and Z2 Extreme probably <em>aren’t</em> big upgrades over the last wave of handhelds.

The Z2E is a modest upgrade over the Z1E, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ku8gm6vXrQs">ETA Prime’s early tests with an MSI Claw A8</a>. Every frame counts in a handheld where the latest games struggle to play smoothly, but I would hope for more. Perhaps Lenovo got more out of it — I recall the original Legion Go being a tad faster than the original ROG Ally despite using the same Z1E chip.</p><p>You can also now get 1TB of storage by default in North America, with 2TB in the highest-end config. All but the entry-level SKU have 32GB of RAM. There’s also a fingerprint reader in the power button now, which is quickly becoming a standard feature on Windows handhelds.</p><p>And those sculpted controllers, which you’ll also be able to buy and connect to the original Legion Go since they use the same mounting system, now have a proper pivot-point D-pad instead of the flat and shallow cross button of the original. They still feature drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, too, and at CES I saw that the right pad’s mouse skate accessory now locks into place so you don’t fling it off when using the FPS mouse.</p><p>I’m afraid that handheld gaming PC prices are headed the wrong direction. The Legion Go 2 starts at $1,099.99 with an AMD Z2, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. You’ll spend $1,199.99 for the model with 32GB of RAM, $1,349.99 for a Z2 Extreme with 32GB / 1TB, and $1,479.99 for the same with 2TB. I already thought the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus was pricey after MSI bumped it $999.99, and while this is pricier still, I wouldn’t be surprised if that Claw’s Intel Lunar Lake chip may be competitive with the Z2E in Lenovo’s new handheld.</p><p>But price and performance aren’t everything, and Lenovo already has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">the $830 Legion Go S with SteamOS</a> for those who need to spend a little less for good performance. The Legion Go 2 may tempt those who’d pay extra for the best Windows handheld experience — though I suspect we may be redefining the Windows part of “best Windows handheld experience” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">after the Xbox Ally X arrives</a> on October 16th.</p><p>Speaking of Windows and SteamOS, Lenovo isn’t announcing a SteamOS version of the Legion Go 2 at this time, spokesperson Jeff Witt tells <em>The Verge</em>. As of embargo time, Lenovo hasn’t confirmed when or if the Legion Go 2 will get the same Xbox full-screen experience as Asus’ Xbox Ally handheld, but Microsoft has said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft-xbox/682463/xbox-full-screen-windows-upgrade-ally">some non-Asus handhelds will get it in 2026</a>.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-making-of-kaiju-no-8-the-game.1289502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, a game based on a successful manga is made <em>after</em> the anime adaptation has been airing for some time, but that wasn’t the case with Kaiju No. 8 The Game. (You can <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game"><u><strong>read our hands-on impressions here</strong></u></a>, by the way.) It tells its own story within creator Naoya Matsumoto’s world, as well as referencing pivotal events from the mainline narrative, and is one of the rare instances in which the game and anime were being developed in parallel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When this game began its development, the manga was only getting started,” says Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s Producer Shinya Fujita. “So there was still a lot of information that we didn’t know yet. And also at the same time, the manga was to be adapted into an anime as well. So this made it very difficult.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team started working on Kaiju No. 8 The Game more than two years ago, and the anime only started airing in mid-April last year. This meant that the game development team and the anime production effort (which involved both <a href="https://www.production-ig.co.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Production I.G</u></a> and <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/news-en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Studio Khara</u></a>) were both exploring what this world would look like in action and how best to bring the characters – and kaiju – to life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://games.aktsk.jp/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Akatsuki Games</u></a> “often referred to the manga for unreleased characters, weapons, and locations,” reflects Fujita. The team also had access to Naoya Matsumoto, the writer and illustrator of the manga, and “his advice and support were crucial,” confirms Fujita, who goes on to say that he was “surprised by his deep knowledge of game development and respect for the process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say that Akatsuki Games was disconnected from the anime. As its production moved ahead, the team were able to work with both studios on specific things. Fujita says that while his team looked to the manga for their character designs, they received invaluable help for the weapon designs from Production I.G, who “were able to create references that were very detailed and easy to understand”, and leveraged the expertise they’d gleaned from the likes of Ghost in the Shell. The team also received references for kaiju designs from Studio Khara, which had been brought onboard to oversee the kaiju designs in the anime; a natural fit given this is the studio established by Hideki Anno and responsible for the Rebuild of Evangelion films.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Gameplay</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The work on background designs also lined up with the anime. “We received a lot of art boards from Production I.G,” says 3D Artist Kazushi Matsumoto. “Every day we’d be checking what the new materials were. In the early stages sometimes we’d find that our 3D design didn’t match the art board so we’d have to remake it. It’s not like we had all the reference material we needed in the first place – we had to work closely with Production I.G. In the case that we had exactly the same location as the anime, we’d have Production I.G review our designs as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One area that was completely separate, however, was the audio side of the game. “I deeply admire the anime's exceptional music,” says Sound Artist Yasuaki Iwata, “and the sound team is inspired by the anime's music and takes a reference [from it] while creating entirely new compositions tailored specifically for the game experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Since music strongly reflects a composer's individuality,” adds Sound Director Mitsuhiro Hikino, “we carefully structured our team. We were fortunate to have experienced game composers with extensive game experience and theatrical music composers who excel at creating music that complements visuals… We centered our music around genres like Japanese digital rock and used instrumentation familiar to fans of the IP and its culture. We deliberately kept melodies subtle to prevent the music from overpowering the experience, instead allowing it to complement and enhance the impressive visuals.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Producing work that stands up next to the excellent anime was obviously important to the team, but so too was ensuring that the manga’s author, Naoya Matsumoto, was happy with their vision for his world. And sometimes that meant changing tack. Japanese mobile games often have provocative new outfits for their characters that players can acquire through their gacha system, incentivising them to invest more time and/or money in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sexy costumes… [are] pretty common in the Japanese mobile game industry,” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu. “When we proposed this plan, Matsumoto-sensei said ‘well, no – this [approach] is not for this IP.’ So we studied the IP concept again and tried to come up with some unique designs for this game.” The upshot is that the character outfits stay true to the fact that they’re all soldiers in the Japan Anti-Kaiju Defense Force or CLOZER (a specialised military outfit central to the story), keeping this game more closely aligned with the manga and anime, and reworking the concept of ‘fan service’ in the process. “The essence of the design,” concludes Kuroyabu, “is the military style.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most important of all, however, was getting Matsumoto’s blessing for Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s original storyline. It takes place at a specific time in the manga and anime’s arc, and features all the main characters. “We, the game developers, proposed ideas [to Matsumoto-sensei],” Producer Shinya Fujita explains. “We wanted to create a unique setting for the game,” so came up with the concept that Kaiju Dimensional Gates were opening up around the globe, triggering an all-in response from anti-kaiju forces. “Then, building on to the Kaiju Dimensional Gate setting,” Fujita continues, “we created the original story and then created the character Sagan Shinomiya.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/original-characters-1757049946835.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The three original characters, with Sagan front and centre.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sagan is a very important character,” Fujita explains, “because she's the only game-original character connected to the anime/manga cast.” Given how central Kikoru and Isao Shinomiya are to Kaiju No. 8’s story, it genuinely is a pretty big deal for the game to introduce Kikoru’s non-blood related sister. “We didn’t actually have any instructions from Matsumoto-sensei,” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu on whether the team had free reign to create the character, “but we proposed ideas and spent a lot of time communicating.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This included pivoting away from what Fujita describes as “a completely different character design” to find the current version which “was the better fit for this military setting.” “Because she plays such an important role, we wanted to make sure we get her right,” he concludes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“Sagan is a very important character, because she's the only game-original character connected to the anime/manga cast.” - Shinya Fujita</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sagan is joined by a couple of other new characters – Chester Lochburn, CLOZER’s strategist, and Suited, CLOZER’s weapons development guru – and the team have been quite clever in how they approach their gameplay designs. Characters in this game fall into three broad categories – Attacker, Support and Defender – and as you might imagine, given their overwhelming offensive power, many of the core cast from the manga/anime fit into the Attacker category. It makes sense, then, for the new characters to help bulk out the numbers in the other roles so that players can build well-rounded squads focused on their favourite characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Matsumoto on board for the story and new characters, there was still the question of how to handle series protagonist Kafka Hibino. After all, he’s simultaneously one of the weakest <em>and </em>strongest characters in the manga/anime. The team have followed Matsumoto’s lead by keeping this duality and allowing Hibino to use his Ultimate to transform into Kaiju No. 8 mid-fight, going from a pistol packing support player to an absolute beast. It really is binary too, as his transformation completely replaces his human moves with kaiju ones and strips him of his pistol in favour of bare knuckle brawling. “After transforming, he gains access to powerful abilities like AOE attacks and high-damage Ultimate, allowing players to truly feel his strength,” says Producer Shinya Fujita.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team have even created a standalone Kaiju No. 8 character that starts in Kafka’s transformed state. “While this version can't equip weapons like other characters,” Fujita comments, “he possesses incredibly powerful base stats even without them. Pretty much what this means is that in the game you can skip the process of acquiring or leveling up weapons; he's simply strong from the get go.” Even so, balance is key. “We want to avoid situations where a specific character becomes almost mandatory to progress,” explains Fujita, “or where players can't freely use the characters they genuinely want to play.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/gameplay-ui-squad1-1757050045669.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 8 on the squad loadout screen.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also reflected in the game’s monetisation strategy – which is always a thorny topic when it comes to live service titles, but particularly those with heavy gacha components. “Our goal is for fans to enjoy playing with their favourite characters, even if it impacts rarity,” says Fujita, “[so] we provide more opportunities for casual users to collect characters and enjoy the game.” The examples he gives of this are gifting players the choice of a rare character, as well as Kikoru/Kafka at launch, plus the free characters from the pre-registration campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming back to Kafka, as you’d imagine he’s central to the game’s new story, and there’s a lot of it, with each mission bookended by cutscenes or dialogue sequences. If it feels to-the-point, that’s very much deliberate. “In the main Kaiju No. 8 story, the focus is heavily on maintaining narrative momentum,” explains Fujita, “and thus everyday life aspects are intentionally not depicted. To fill in those gaps, we created the character stories.” This is a separate mode with small stories based around the major characters. “We hope players will enjoy the casual conversations between characters and discover new parts of their personalities that aren't seen in the main story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, in keeping with the manga and anime, there are still some pretty goofy, playful sequences in the main story. “We’re trying to stay as true to the original work's artistic direction as possible,” says Fujita, while also wanting to “show a ‘cooler side of Kafka’ in the game,” as compared with how he’s often portrayed in the anime.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“We’re trying to stay as true to the original work's artistic direction as possible…” - Shinya Fujita</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the enemies, this is where the game really takes off. “There will be 20-30 different genres [of kaiju],” says Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu. A few examples pulled from the series include Wyvern-type, Lizard-type and Ant-type, but we can’t wait to see what else the team comes up with. Kuroyabu mentioned that the team were inspired by kaiju movies, particularly the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokusatsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Tokusatsu</u></a> genre, and utilised classic elements from those films such as low camera angles to emphasise size.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The kaiju designs also have to fit neatly into a fun gameplay framework. “Our core philosophy for this game is to prioritise clarity,” explains Producer Shinya Fujita, “so we've tried to give kaiju abilities that can be inferred from their appearance. For example, Fungal-Type kaiju might inflict status ailments like poison, while Spider-Types might use web attacks to reduce your speed.” These status effects may be easy enough to counter on their own, but when the game starts throwing multiple types at you simultaneously, it’s going to get a bit more complicated. You can read more about how the game plays in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game"><u>our hands-on impressions</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the kaiju design that Art Director Yuya Kuroyabu is most excited about, it comes down to how the team are helping to flesh out existing details in Matsumoto’s world. “The one I want to call out is Kaiju No. 1,” he says. “I forget which episode [it was in], but it did show up in the original manga and anime – but only from the bust up – so no one knew what the rest of it looked like… and now we’ve designed it, so you can find out in the game! We also used this kaiju as one of our key visuals as well. It’s a special one for me.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/05/original-story-1757050156816.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">More than a little imposing…</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">3D Artist Kazushi Matsumoto shares a similar sentiment. “There are a lot of things that aren’t from the manga or anime that we’ve realised in the game,” he says, “so we’re looking forward to the players discovering them. Plus, we’ve prepared a lot of content for not only Kaiju No. 8 fans, but for Japanese anime lovers too.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that Kaiju No. 8 The Game is out in the wild, there’s the question of what comes next. “We're planning event stories that'll let players get to know individual characters better,” says Fujita, “along with high-difficulty battle content for players seeking more challenging gameplay. And of course, we're also planning story events featuring characters in special seasonal outfits.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And presumably, in keeping with Matsumoto’s wishes, those outfits will not be overtly sexy. Regardless, “the most important thing” about running a live service game, says Fujita, “is to have love for the IP. Being a fan helps understand what other fans want.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cam Shea visited Akatsuki Games in Tokyo as a guest.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost the weekend, and it’s time for another invigorating round of NYT Connections. If you’re nursing a killer streak, you’ll want to keep that going with today’s puzzle, and fortunately, I’m here to help you. Below, I’ve outlined the best NYT Connections hints for today (#817), as well as the answers, if you want the fastest solution possible.</p>



<p>Being a bit of a Star Wars nerd, today’s NYT Connections hints excited me, but once again, it was a case of the puzzle throwing a curveball to subvert expectations. Read on to get the NYT Connections clues you need to resolve today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-september-5">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (September 5)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #817</p>



<ul>
<li>HAN</li>



<li>SOLO</li>



<li>FREE</li>



<li>ZING</li>



<li>RAM</li>



<li>KICK</li>



<li>STAG</li>



<li>BUCK</li>



<li>SINGLE</li>



<li>SONG</li>



<li>JACK</li>



<li>TANG</li>



<li>MING</li>



<li>PUNCH</li>



<li>BILLY</li>



<li>ZEST</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>–<em>These words pack a sensory wallop—think of what gives a dish its lively edge or a personality its spark. You might find them in a food review or a boxing metaphor</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>These all describe someone flying solo—whether at a wedding, on a dating app, or just living that independent life. No plus-one required.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>These names belong to male animals, often used colloquially or in farming circles. If you’ve ever met a goat named Billy or a rabbit named Jack, you’re on the right track.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>These are not just history test answers—they’re the ruling houses that shaped centuries of Chinese civilization. Think dynasties that built walls, wrote poetry, and changed the course of empires.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Being a bit of a history buff, I appreciated the nod we got to the <strong>obvious </strong>above. Admittedly, this was one of the easiest NYT Connections puzzles this week, and it didn’t take too long to figure it out.</p>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, September 5.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>

<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In February, <em>Civilization VII</em> released to what feels like (the internet wasn't around in the 90s!) the worst reception in series history,<a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> its major new features dividing fans and distancing the game from what many have long loved about it</a>. Now,<a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even as the team at Firaxis work to update the game</a>, many of them are being laid off.</p><p>After a number of former Firaxis staff like artists, writers and producers, predominantly from the <em>Civ VII</em> team, began posting earlier today that they'd been let go,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 2K confirmed with Game Developer</a> that there had been a "staff reduction today at Firaxis Games", with the site estimating that "dozens of workers have been impacted by the cuts".</p><p>Using absolutely meaningless filler words as cover for the move, 2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, none of which sound like they can be boosted by laying off dozens of the people who worked there.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-vii-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As I said in my <em>Civ VII</em> review</a>, its development sounded like a mess, which would be a strategic misstep made at levels far above those affected today by layoffs:</p><blockquote><p>It's clear something has gone very wrong during the game's development. There are now multiple<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1i3wpql/vii_release_ui_spotted/#lightbox" target="_blank">&nbsp;examples</a>, both from early demos in 2024 and hidden in the final game's<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/y4pQqYr" target="_blank">&nbsp;code</a>, of&nbsp;<em>Civ VII</em>&nbsp;once having an almost&nbsp;<em>entirely&nbsp;</em>different interface. For that aspect of the game to have been overhauled so close to release sure would explain why things look so bland and rushed--one of my earliest notes from playing this was "looks like an iPad version of&nbsp;<em>Civ V</em>"--and why the interface was the first thing&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" target="_blank">Firaxis have said</a>&nbsp;they'd be fixing, because what if they're not really fixing it at all, but just...finishing it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The game sold well, however,<a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reportedly breaking pre-order records for the series</a>. In May,<a href="https://aftermath.site/take-two-zelnick-layoffs-roll7-intercept" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</a> said he had been "thrilled with Civ 7 so far", with the game currently sitting in the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1kluj5q/civilization_vii_is_so_far_the_8th_bestselling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> top 10 best-selling games of 2025 list</a>. And <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/civilization-7-studio-firaxis-confirms-layoffs-as-it-optimizes-its-development-process-for-adaptability-collaboration-and-creativity-which-is-somehow-even-worse-than-just-saying-agility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement issued to PC Gamer</a>, 2K and Firaxis say they "continue to work hard on title updates and patches" for <em>Civ VII</em>, "to ensure it aligns with the needs of our players".</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">But this is the industry as it operates in 2025</a> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762933/bioshock-cloud-chamber-take-two-2k-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially at Take-Two</a>); it's hard imagining an alternate timeline where the game broke both critical and sales records and there still  weren’t some kind of layoffs, because that's just what happens now.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2k-confirms-it%E2%80%99s-making-%E2%80%9Ca-college-basketball-experience%E2%80%9D.1289418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2K Sports is officially back in the college basketball video game market. After it was confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-walks-away-from-developing-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports was backing out</a> of building a “college basketball experience”, 2K Sports released their own statement on Thursday night. </p>



<p><strong>“Yes, it’s true. We’re working on a college basketball experience that will feature more than 100 programs from across the country, from powerhouses to Cinderella stories,” </strong>2K <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1963775457876406534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said via social media</a>. <strong>“Competition fuels quality at all levels, which is why our approach with college basketball ensures our partner schools, college athletes <em>and</em> our players all benefit.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“More good news – you won’t have to wait long to start seeing your favorite colleges show up in game. We’ve got big plans for 2027 and beyond, and even a few surprises coming in early 2026. We’ve proven the quality of the basketball experience we can deliver for years, and have every intention to bring that same level of quality to college hoops.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-how-college-basketball-2k-got-here">How College Basketball 2K Got Here</h2>



<p>It’s been a weird road to get to this point for college basketball and 2K. EA originally <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-announces-return-of-college-basketball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had its proposal for an exclusive game</a> picked by the College Licensing Company (CLC) that would’ve included all Division 1 men’s and women’s college basketball programs. That game was planned to launch in 2028, but schools <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sports-college-basketball-game-might-be-in-trouble/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were hesitant to move forward</a> with the exclusivity.</p>



<p>Reports then surfaced that 2K was making a stronger effort to get licensing. The company, specifically publisher Take-Two Interactive, shifted from plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-sports-wants-to-add-college-basketball-to-nba-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only having college teams as MyTeam DLC</a> in NBA 2K to having a full game. </p>



<p>2K already has an agreement in place with UCLA, and says that more were coming soon. Over the upcoming months and year-plus, it’ll be interesting to see what schools and conferences 2K reaches agreements with. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has previously reported that 2K sources felt a game could be released as early as 2027. Based on the statement from 2K, it appears that might actually be the case as of now. Recently, more sources have suggested that there is a plan to eventually include all Division 1 programs in a game should the first game go well. That, however, is subject to change due to it being so far in the future.</p>

<p>In July, Bandai Namco released its new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man</a> themed title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/shadow_labyrinth">Shadow Labyrinth</a> across multiple platforms. Now, in an update today, the development team has rolled out a new patch for this game.</p>
<p>It addresses multiple issues and makes some other adjustments. This will also bump the game up to Version 1.0.4, and it is now available on all platforms, including Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-review-in-progress.1289406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy Hollow Knight: Silksong launch day to all who celebrate! I’ve only played three hours so far and I’m already overwhelmed in the best possible way. It took no time at all for me to get completely lost in the world of this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-shoots-up-steams-most-played-games-chart-hours-after-launch-with-huge-concurrent-player-numbers-as-storefront-issues-ease">hotly anticipated</a> sequel, one that shortens the intimidating lead-in area its predecessor had in order to more quickly give you branching paths to pick from and the tools to explore them more confidently. It’s too early to get a real sense of where things will go, how all the changes it makes to stuff like upgrades and abilities will play out, or how big this beautiful new land truly is, but my impression so far is that Silksong is already managing to meet the sky-high expectations that have been set for it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most immediate differences Hollow Knight fans will notice is that our new hero, Hornet, isn’t the silent type like her pint-sized companion from the original. She has personality and charm, chatting with the bugs you meet across the world of Pharloom. I was initially worried that this might change the quiet tone in an unappealing way, but Hornet is still a fairly stoic character overall – confident and cautiously friendly, happy to speak her mind when she feels she should, but still reclusive in a way that allows others to do most of the talking. So it’s a shift, especially when she explains something a little more directly than Hollow Knight’s vague dialogue ever would, but one I am enjoying for the moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that the writing is top notch once again. It’s often poetic and illusive in a way that never feels overly pompous, leaving plenty of room for serious characters and silly gags alike. An early favorite of mine is a pilgrim singing to a door in an attempt to open it, only for them to claim the credit when you find the lever that actually does so. All the attention to quality and detail that made Hollow Knight a true standout is still alive and well here, with areas I can’t wait to learn more about, characters I am excited to get to know, and stellar music I can already tell I am going to be listening to for a long time to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another aspect I am excited to see evolve are the options for customization. Ability-granting charms are color-coded this time around, meaning you have to pick your priorities if certain items overlap – for example, a lot of the early options I’ve found go into the yellow slot, making me choose if I want enemies to drop more currency or if I want to have it automatically be picked up for me when they do. That choice extends into a secondary attack (the only one I’ve found so far is a quick throwing dagger), and even Crests that more drastically change your attack in a way that feels like you are swapping weapons. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Honestly, I just can’t wait to stop typing this so I can dive back in.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems like a huge amount of flexibility, and I’m excited to see if the options I will unlock let me truly start crafting coherent builds in the way I am hoping. This system runs the risk of offering a lot of false choices or leading you down certain paths that are just obviously better than others, but if Team Cherry has figured out the proper tuning, it could also open the door to supporting massively different playstyles based entirely on your own tastes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I imagine we’ll need to take advantage of those options, too, because Silksong isn’t messing around. It’s not afraid to punish you, such as the way you drop all of a currency called Rosaries when you die and have to do a corpse run to the location you were killed to retrieve them, and enemies can be tough enough to force you to take that walk if you push the limits of your exploration too far. That said, Silksong has a lot of ways to mitigate that punishment, such as letting you pay to stash your extra Rosaries in the form of a consumable item, giving you an early option to lose less of them on death, and not tying every unlockable to that single resource in case the worst does occur. It’s still early, but I think this will result in less frustration overall relative to Hollow Knight. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Tom's Favorite Indie Platformers</h3><p>Some of the best from my favorite genre.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, one of the most common reasons people would bounce off the original was the initially sparse map system – the early areas branch in a way that meant you could miss the map for a long while, and then you had to return to town to buy upgrades before it updated or even showed you on it. You still need those upgrades, but the place you get them is now located right on your path before things start to open up, and that happens much earlier, so that’s another rough edge smartly smoothed down. It’s still a dangerous thrill when you are exploring an uncharted area for the first time, trying to push your luck in search of that next resting spot, but that’s no longer a feeling you are forced into before you’ve even found your footing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I could keep digging into more early observations, but honestly I just can’t wait to stop typing this so I can dive back in. I haven’t even wrapped my head around how big this thing is going to be – and if its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Achievements_and_Trophies"><u>achievement</u></a> for speedrunning 100% completion is any indication it could be quite large, as you now have to do that in under 30 hours compared to Hollow Knight’s 20. But so far Silksong is exactly what I want from a sequel like this: it’s not completely reinventing the wheel or messing with all the things that made the first game so incredible, but it’s also not resting on its laurels. No part of it feels untouched, and as far as I can tell right now, it somehow feels even better for it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review]]></content:encoded>

It's the megaton game that every other game wants to dodge. But sometimes publishers just can't change their release dates. We put together a list of some of the other games releasing today to check out if Silksong isn't your jam (or you just like being contrarian), as well as a few of the anticipated games that scooted out of the way of Hornet and her deadly needle.</p><h2>Games Releasing September 4, 2025</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/adventure-of-samsara/" data-ref-id="5000-513724"><strong>Adventure of Samsara</strong></a> - Notably, Adventure of Samsara is a search-action (colloquially known as a Metroidvania) game, just like Hollow Knight, and you're also a little guy with a sword. This game features some great-looking pixel art.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> "The Order of the Giants" DLC</strong> - This expansion delves deeper into the "Order of Giants" hinted at in the base game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562290" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538"><strong>Hell is Us</strong></a> - In a place ravaged by war and a mysterious calamity, you search for answers about your own past. This game is a third-person action game with souls-like elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486"><strong>NBA 2K26</strong></a> - If there's anyone that isn't worried about Silksong affecting their sales, its probably 2K Games and their latest NBA game. There just isn't as much overlap with basketball as there is with a game like The Adventures of Samsara or a souls-inspired game like Hell is Us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562289" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562289"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jetrunner/" data-ref-id="5000-625135"><strong>Jetrunner</strong></a> - A stylish first-person parkour game with flashy, cel-shaded visuals.</p><p>Other games releasing today include the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everybodys-golf-hot-shots/" data-ref-id="5000-670014">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, and the Apple Arcade exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nfl-retro-bowl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-690212">NFL Retro Bowl '26</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, a bunch of other games made a run for it once Silksong claimed that September 4 date. The sci-fi roguelite FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/moros-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-563235">Moros Protocol</a> jumped to September 18, as did the PlayStation 1-aesthetic roguelike survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/megabonk/" data-ref-id="5000-656106">Megabonk</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/" data-ref-id="5000-590662">Baby Steps</a>, the follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/getting-over-it-with-bennett-foddy/" data-ref-id="5000-473119">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</a>, awkwardly planted one foot in front of the other toward a September 23 release date. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/" data-ref-id="5000-566115">Demonschool</a> was set to release September 23, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ysbryd.net/post/3lxajaaptg22t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer Ysbird said of the delay</a>, "We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red."</p><p>Meanwhile, Hollow Knight: Silksong has landed with extremely positive word of mouth. It also almost immediately started <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">crashing the servers</a> for Steam and the Nintendo eShop, and affecting service on Game Pass. Hollow Knight: Silksong peaked on Steam with 535,000 players, putting it in the top three for concurrent players alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike-2/" data-ref-id="5000-595646">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dota-2/" data-ref-id="5000-87436">Dota 2</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/more-sports-games-should-take-a-year-off.1289400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year<a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about a general malaise in the sports gaming world</a>, brought about mostly by the fact that the relentless need to release a new game every year--colliding with the ever-increasing budgets and complexity of AAA gaming--was draining the genre of innovation and chances at fresh starts.</p><p>Today, let's talk about something more positive! A rare exception to the annual grind last season was the storied <em>Football Manager</em> series, which botched its transition to an all-new engine--and a number of gameplay and interface changes that went along with it--<a href="https://aftermath.site/football-manager-25-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">so badly that it had to miss its scheduled 2025 edition altogether</a>.</p><p>What was initially some pretty bad news has, in the end, turned into something of a blessing for the series and its fans. With the chance to actually take a breath, developers Sports Interactive have (among loads of other tweaks and revisions) been able to deliver on a long-promised feature and bring women's leagues to the game, at a scale that makes it almost a game-within-a-game.</p><p>In<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6564634/2025/08/29/miles-jacobson-football-manager-interview-fm25-fm26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an interview with <em>The Athletic</em></a>, director Miles Jacobson says over 35000 women's footballers will now be in the game, with around a dozen major leagues also represented. Players will also be able to run both the men's and women's databases concurrently, meaning that while the option is there to play a men's or women's-only save, you can also manage sides across both at once.</p><p>If you're not a sports fan, this is an expected but nevertheless substantial update, as women's football has <em>exploded </em>in popularity over the past decade.<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2025/bbc-sport-record-breaking-womens-euro-2025-audience#:~:text=navbar%20(on%20mobile)-,Record%20breaking%20BBC%20Sport%20broadcast%20draws%202025's,audience%20for%20Women's%20Euro%20final&amp;text=A%20peak%20live%20audience%20of,2025%20across%20all%20TV%20broadcasters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> The recent Euros' final broke broadcast records in England</a>, while the 2023 World Cup semi final is the<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-66531590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> single highest-rating TV broadcast <em>of all time</em> in Australia</a>. So having it in <em>Football Manager</em> (when series like <em>FIFA/EAFC</em> have had it for <em>years</em>) is both long overdue but also, given the scale it’s finally arriving at, an extremely welcome addition.</p><p>Speaking of EA Sports, the interview also contains a fascinating insight into how the licensing for the women's leagues--sometimes a make-or-break factor for sports fans--have been worked around for their first inclusion in <em>Football Manager</em>. Jacobson says:</p><blockquote><p>...a massive thanks to EAFC, who have been really helpful throughout this whole process In most of the areas where they’ve had exclusive licences in women’s football, they’ve actually agreed to carve us out so that we can have licences as well. We can’t thank them enough.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Huh! While there's no <em>exact</em> release date for <em>FM26</em>, the game is coming out this year, and should be ready sometime in the next few months (they've traditionally released around October-November).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | First Look Reveal" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cDQi5kwuHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>I cannot stress to you how much better this looks than the 2023 edition</figcaption></figure></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/civilization-7-civ-vii-layoffs-firaxis-2k-take-two"><h3>Seven Months After Civ VII’s Launch, Firaxis Workers Are Being Laid Off</h3></a><p>2K said the layoffs were part of an effort to increase "adaptability, collaboration, and creativity" at Firaxis, whatever that means</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/football-manager-26-fm26-sports-interactive-womens-league-wsl-nwsl]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had the chance to play <em>Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</em> at PAX West this year and chat with Creative Director Adam Bromell. &nbsp;We get into what <em>Starseeker </em>is, why it is not <em>Astroneer 2</em>, and just what makes it different from your normal <em>Astroneer </em>experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing <em>Starseeker </em>is immediately familiar if you’ve played <em>Astroneer</em>. You have tools you know and can move around the word tearing up terrain and making it your own just as normal. You’ll even have a sweet glider that has a lot of control to get around quickly, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting parts of <em>Starseeker </em>are what surround the game and how it’s structured. It is not just another sandbox with some new mechanics, as that would be more of a sequel to <em>Astroneer</em>. Bromell wanted to make sure I knew that this is definitely not a sequel and <em>Astroneer </em>will be getting a ton of its own updates for years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, Bromell told me it is a live service game, though he didn’t want to call it that. It is a living and breathing universe that focuses on cooperative gameplay and really wants to respect your time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Bromell, he wants people that have thousands of hours in <em>Astroneer</em> to be happy with <em>Starseeker </em>just as much as those that only play for a few hours a week or month. Not only that, he doesn’t want the people that don’t play as much to feel like they’re left behind either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ideally, <em>Starseeker </em>will be easy to jump in and out of and you’ll never feel the need to grind out some kind of season pass or some equivalent to get in on the newest and coolest thing. The last thing Bromell wants is to give players chores or make it feel like a job.</p>



<p>Bromell talked about how some other games have certain things in them to generate revenue that don’t feel right, that they take advantage of players. He said that <em>Starseeker </em>will never ask for money from you for any piece of content. The only thing to purchase will be cosmetic DLC, and he made sure to note that there are still a ton of cosmetics to earn just playing the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, the <em>Starseeker</em> approach will be one that wants to respect your time and not make anyone feel like they need put in a ton of work to just catch up.</p>

<h2>What is Starseeker?</h2>

<p>Where <em>Astroneer </em>is a sandbox, <em>Starseeker </em>is more mission-based and narrative-driven. You’ll spend a lot of time on the eponymous ESS Starseeker with other Astroneers. Here you’ll find missions, talk to NPCs, and you’ll see up to 100 other players running around as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Talking with Bromell, we mentioned <em>Helldivers 2</em> some in how they want to approach the live service. That there’s an overarching story players will be working through as they work on these missions together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it comes to missions, <em>Starseeker</em> will task you with doing a lot of things from discovery to extraction. There will be plenty of resources and other things to collect outside of just what missions send you on as well. Mission design, however, does place a big emphasis on cooperation.</p>



<p>In the quick mission I played with Bromell, we were tasked with repairing a relay station and had to bring a sensor to the top of a huge pillar off in the distance. That meant one of us would have to carry that sensor with us on the way there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We worked together with me leading the way to dig a corkscrew through the terrain as we climbed up the tower to place the sensor up top. Along the way we ran into several different creature types we had to take down, with me using the terrain gun to shoot terrain at them to take them out.</p>

<p>That was one way to do it. We could have threw the sensor back and forth between us as we climbed as well. Really, anything you wanted to get up to the top.</p>

<h2>Mission-based But Focused on Player Choice</h2>

<p>I only had a brief 15 minutes or so with the game and the rest we talked, but everything I played felt very <em>Astroneer</em> and the idea of using this mission-based structure centered around the ESS Starseeker is intriguing.</p>

<p>Nothing about the mission design or content railroad you into playing any particular way, but we did talk some about how giving players just a little bit of direction can be great for some people. For me personally, I love when a game gives me a task and am often at a loss when just in a big sandbox, so taking the sandbox elements of <em>Astroneer </em>that work well and crafting goals for players with those strengths in mind is a great idea.</p>



<p>We didn’t talk too much on the story, but the idea of <em>Starseeker </em>is that you’re part of the group of explorers willing to go forth where no one has before, risks be damned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Content will roll out over time as the Starseeker will be parked in a solar system, exploring the planets in that system before it moves to the next system with more planets to explore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Will taking a sandbox and packaging it with a narrative and missions work out? Only time will tell, I suppose. I can’t wait to see how it all comes together when it comes out next year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been over a decade since the last numbered <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. While the precision-based hack-and-slash series was sleeping, most action games went one of two ways. They either morphed into sprawling RPG adventures full of bloat or tried to ape the obsession with Soulslikes, incorporating methodical hitbox dodging and disciplined stamina management. But one of the kings of 3D arcade action is awake again and ready to dispense with all of the popular trend chasing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-4-ryu-xbox-game-pass-release-date-1851746372"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> is mostly a game about killing tons of guys by executing the most lethal combos and flashiest executions you can master, and it seems to be completely content with that. I am too.</p> <p>I had a chance to play a recent build of the game at Microsoft’s campus (Xbox is publishing the game) during <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/pax-west-2025">PAX West 2025</a> ahead of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>‘s release on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 21. The joint venture between Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta</em> makers Platinum Games appears to be going great. Rather than a disjointed sequel divided between two game design philosophies struggling with each other and the series’ infamous legacy, what I played of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> felt smooth, focused, and fun. Most importantly it exuded confidence about what it is: a high-skill action game that rewards diligent fans with satisfyingly gory thrills.</p> <p>The story revolves around returning frontman Ryu Hayabusa and a new hero, the Raven Clan’s Yakumo, as they scale a cyberpunk-infused Sky City Tokyo infested with new daemon horrors and futuristic ninja soldiers. Each character has access to different weapons and skill sets, and which you play depends on the chapter your in. The option to replay any chapter as either one unlocks after you finish, and for demo purposes I opted to go with Ryu for old times’ sake.</p>

 <p>Within seconds I was chopping off heads and staggering enemies with throwing stars. A perfect dodge gives you a small window to press the attack with a counter-strike that breaks through enemy defenses. There’s also a perfect parry that consists of attacking an enemy right as they’re about to attack you, but it’s an awkward window to exploit and doesn’t feel nearly as satisfying when you’re in the heat of combat (and for those who want a less crunchy experience, there’s an option in the settings menu to turn hitstop completely off).</p>  <p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> thrives when you’re constantly moving and trying to combo light, heavy, and projectile attacks into a conveyor belt of carnage. Doing so builds up meter to unleash special attacks or enter a time-limited transformation that alters your moveset an also makes it more lethal, culminating in stylish new insta-kill animations that swap the screen to black, white, and red. The old obliterations are there too, letting you unleash geysers of blood as you quickly execute foes already suffering from severed limbs. The pulled-out third-person camera also performed well during the demo, rarely tripping me up with off-screen attacks amid the controlled chaos.</p>

 <p>I only had time to experience the first layer or two of combat, and can see how two characters, a handful of weapons each, and all of the other secondary moves can add up into a combat system with enough depth to keep things interesting while never losing sight of the moment-to-moment satisfaction that propels a game like this forward and keeps you from rage-quitting once you hit a difficulty spike or two (there are three difficulty modes in<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em> that you can swap between at any time).</p> <p>What I’ll be most curious to see from the finished game is whether its level design will feel equally refined or just like a means to an end. The early couple of sections I experienced included some wall running, wall jumping, and grappling hook swinging, both for platforming and combat. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> has collectibles and I encountered the occasional fork in the road to explore, while statues dotting the level offer checkpoints at which to buy items from and upgrade skills.</p> <p>But most of the action was confined to flat arenas without many interesting features outside of some split elevations and grappling hook points. If Team Ninja and Platinum Games are able to imbue the later stages with as much drama in-between the big battles as during them, N<em>inja Gaiden 4</em> could be the return to demanding hack-and-slash action fans have been waiting for, perfecting the essentials and carving away the rest.</p>
