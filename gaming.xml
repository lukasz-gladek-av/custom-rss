			<p>PlayStation has revealed a new line of DualSense controllers and PS5 side plates with its new Hyperpop Collection, which features three colourways and is arguably the boldest collection of new colours and designs that PlayStation has done with DualSense controllers and PS5 accessories since the console launched back in 2020.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-new-faceplates-june-2022/">We've had some great solo-colour controllers and face plates</a>, but nothing so far that has tried to be a bit different outside of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-astro-bot-levels-and-limited-dualsense-controller-announced-coming-this-july/">some limited runs of controllers featuring </a>designs <a href="https://wccftech.com/sucker-punch-ghost-of-yotei-gameplay-new-limited-edition-ps5-consoles-controllers/">based on individual games</a>. For anyone who remembers the kinds of designs and special editions we'd get back in the PS3 and PS4 days, these latest designs pale in comparison to how creative Sony and PlayStation used to get, but it's still encouraging to see them start branching out from just introducing new colours for controllers.</p>



<p>"<em>Today, we’re sharing the first look at the Hyperpop Collection, featuring three new striking designs for DualSense wireless controllers and PS5 console covers. With glossy blacks shifting into vivid neons, each finish introduces an all-new aesthetic into your gaming setup</em>," the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">reveal post on the PlayStation Blog</a> reads. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The three colours are called <strong>Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue.</strong> "<em></em><em>We’re cranking the volume all the way up with a collection that doesn’t just stand out, it takes over the room</em>," added <strong>Leo Cardoso</strong>, one of the members of Sony's design team who worked on the new collection. "<em>Inspired by the glow of the RGB lights of your impressive gaming setups, these new colors go LOUD in the best possible way.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>A seamless gradient wraps around the front and back of the DualSense, finished in a high-gloss coat that makes the colors POP more than ever</em>," added <strong>Sae Kobayashi</strong>, another member of the design team. "<em></em><em>The console covers are also getting the same glow-up, featuring a subtle hint of transparency.</em>"</p>



<p>Again, it's nice to see PlayStation do more than just solid colours, though the switch to a glossy finish is quite concerning, particularly for the controllers. You may be able to install the face plates with gloves and leave them untouched, but the controllers will start getting ruined the moment you pick them up. Unless you start wearing thin gloves whenever you play your PS5.</p>



<p>The DualSense controllers and face plates will be available beginning on <strong>March 12, 2026,</strong> with the controllers listed at<strong> $84.99 USD/¥12,480 (including tax)/€84.99/£74.99</strong>, and the face plates listed at <strong>$74.99 USD/¥11,480(including tax)/€74.99/£64.99</strong>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Enjoy Discord While You Can]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761</link>
            <guid>1399792</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The case between Rockstar and fired <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers who were unionizing gets messier. Discord is secretly preparing for a possible IPO. And Square Enix might ban you if you share <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> spoilers. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I’m trying to go into this new year by once again <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coreybrickley.bsky.social/post/3mbtmvsb7xs2l">limiting my social media intake</a>. There are a lot of cool things that get shared around and I love to see, and also too much of anything will kill you. Curated feeds. Strict time limits. This is the way.</p>

 <h2>Discord is getting closer to an IPO</h2> <p>Bloomberg reports that the gaming chat platform “filed confidentially for an initial public offering.” While that doesn’t guarantee it will move forward with a Wall Street stock offering, it does suggest the company has moved <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">another rung up the ladder toward enshittification</a>. Discord recently boasted over 200 million monthly users and has promised to remain a user-first enterprise that doesn’t monetize its audience for short-term gain. We’ll see!</p>

 <h2>Rockstar shares new details about the unionizing <em>GTA 6</em> developers it fired</h2> <p>Claims were heard from both sides at a labor tribunal this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. Rockstar also shed more light on the union-focused Discord that developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">were chatting in before they were fired</a>.&nbsp;“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members,” the company said in a statement to <em>IGN</em>.&nbsp;“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.”</p>

 <p>While the IWGB has claimed only union business was discussed, Rockstar maintains that game features were also leaked. “We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does,” its new statement continued. “Global interest in our games is unparalleled.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar went on, “Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p>

 <h2>The free <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> demo is out</h2> <p>Players will get an in-game reward for trying it, and save progress carries over to the final game which is out on console and PC on February 5. Be careful, though, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-bans-posting-certain-parts-of-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-for-a-month-after-the-demos-launch-with-strict-guidelines-on-spoilers/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Square Enix is threatening to ban anyone who potentially posts <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/guideline/dq7r/">unmarked spoilers</a> for the remake of 25-year-old game. The spoiler warnings will continue until morale improves.</p>

 <h2><em>Fallout</em> season 3 starts filming in just a few months</h2> <p>Amazon is wasting no time getting the next batch of episodes for its hit TV adaptation of the RPG series going. According to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">new production alert</a>, filming will resume in May.</p> <h2><em>Balatro</em> and <em>Silksong</em> prove conventional wisdom can’t always predict hits</h2> <p>That’s one of the points NYU professor Joost van Dreunen made in a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry">with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The success of a <em>Balatro</em>, a <em>Silksong</em>: These are all games that shouldn’t really exist,” he said. “They don’t make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved and commercially very viable and popular.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws-2000657166">Some big blockbusters are headed to Xbox Game Pass this month</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-remake-logan-paul-firered-leafgreen-2000657176">What Logan Paul doesn’t get about Pokémon</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fantasy-fps-where-you-shoot-skeletons-to-stop-the-game-from-crashing-looks-incredible-2000657233"><em>FPS Quest</em> is a neat-sounding game with an incredible trailer</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

                <p>If you're a fan of visiting multiple maps for a single quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, boy do we have some objectives for you. For the Eyes in the Sky quest, you'll be tasked with heading to three different maps to place LiDAR Scanners, and getting all of them done is going to take a bit of skill, luck, and a zipline. Let's talk about it.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete any portion of Eyes in the Sky, so you can go in with a free loadout for the Dam Battlegrounds and Spaceport objectives. However, you will need a zipline to reach the necessary spot on Buried City, so you may want to suit up for that one.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle this quest, follow the guide below.</p><h2 id="On_Dam_Battlegrounds__install_a_LiDAR_Scanner_at_the_top_of_the_Control_Tower">On Dam Battlegrounds, install a LiDAR Scanner at the top of the Control Tower</h2><p>The first LiDAR Scanner you need to install is likely to be the most dangerous of them all. To complete this objective, you'll need to visit the high-traffic and PVP-centric Control Tower POI in the middle of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631134" data-ratio="0.56484641638225" data-width="2344" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631134"></a><figcaption>Control Tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg"></figure><p>This POI is frequently riddled with PVPers and folks trying to use their keys to open doors inside the building. With that in mind, don't be surprised if you've got to take out a few folks before you get to where you're going.</p><p>There are multiple entrances into this POI, but one of the safest options is to approach this building from the south. You should spot some stairs on the side of the building. Take them up until you reach the main floor (don't go all the way up).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631135-arcraiders_20260106211606.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631135-arcraiders_20260106211606.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631135"></a><figcaption>Take the first three flights of stairs up.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631135-arcraiders_20260106211606.jpg"></figure><p>Run toward the door down the long outside hallway.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631136-arcraiders_20260106211621.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631136-arcraiders_20260106211621.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631136"></a><figcaption>Run straight ahead from here through the door on the other end of this long outdoor hallway.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631136-arcraiders_20260106211621.jpg"></figure><p>Inside, continue straight to spot a breachable door. If someone has already been through here, the door may be open already, as in the photo below. If not, you'll need to breach it quickly and hope no one comes up behind you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631138-arcraiders_20260106211648.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631138" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631138-arcraiders_20260106211648.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631138"></a><figcaption>You may need to breach this door if it's not already open.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631138-arcraiders_20260106211648.jpg"></figure><p>With the door open, you'll notice ziplines going up and down. Take the one that heads upward, but before you take it, <strong>look straight up and shoot any turrets that may be along the walls above you</strong>, as they'll rip you to shreds if you take the zipline up before they're killed.</p><p>If someone's been through here already, you may not see any turrets. This can be a good or bad thing. Since there's a very popular key room on the floor above you, it's possible someone has already gone up and entered that room, and they'll often set traps at the top of the zipline to alert them of any potential threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631140"></a><figcaption>Taking the zipline up can be dangerous, as there may be traps or other raiders waiting at the top.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg"></figure><p>If you go up and set off any traps, it's a good idea to immediately call out that you're friendly and just questing to calm other raiders' nerves. But in cases where the person is aggressive, you may have to fight back. In the worst case scenario, you'll die and have to load back in to try again--but the best case scenario is that you eliminate someone and get some sweet loot for it. </p><p>However this situation plays out, the key room on the right in the linear corridor isn't your main goal. Instead, you'll want to make your way through the corridor until you reach another breachable door at the top of some stairs. Once it's opened, you'll have access to the Control Tower roof.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631139-arcraiders_20260106211821.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631139" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631139-arcraiders_20260106211821.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631139"></a><figcaption>Breach the door at the top of the stairs to access the roof.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631139-arcraiders_20260106211821.jpg"></figure><p>On the Control Tower roof, head forward and slightly left to spot a tripod.

This quest asks you to go to Buried City, Dam Battlegrounds, and Spaceport to search for specific things, and rounding up the correct spots to visit can be a challenge if you're not familiar with the maps yet. That's alright, though--that's where we come in.</p><p>Keep in mind that, since you won't need to extract with any items to complete any steps in What We Left Behind, you can comfortably head in with a free loadout to avoid risking any of your good loot. But, of course, you're also welcome to bring your best stuff if you'd rather be ready for a fight.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, here's how to complete each step of What We Left Behind.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#On_Buried_City__search_2_containers_in_the_Raider_Camp_beneath_the_Parking_Garage">On Buried City, search 2 containers in the Raider Camp beneath the Parking Garage</a></li><li><a href="#On_Dam_Battlegrounds__search_for_anything_significant_in_the_South_Swamp_Outpost">On Dam Battlegrounds, search for anything significant in the South Swamp Outpost</a></li><li><a href="#On_Spaceport__search_for_anything_significant_in_Bilguun_s_Hideout__next_to_the_Container_Storage">On Spaceport, search for anything significant in Bilguun's Hideout, next to the Container Storage</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="On_Buried_City__search_2_containers_in_the_Raider_Camp_beneath_the_Parking_Garage">On Buried City, search 2 containers in the Raider Camp beneath the Parking Garage</h2><p>The first part of the quest sends you to the Parking Garage on the northwestern side of Buried City.

Preorders will open on January 16 ahead of their March 12 launch.</p><p>Like the console covers, the DualSense controllers will be available in three distinct colorways. Techno Red is a loud, vibrant option that fades to a glossy black at the top. First released in November 2020, the DualSense controller features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a Create Button for when you want to quickly grab in-game screenshots and video clips. Remix Green also pops nicely on the DualSense controller, with this particular shade being an instant attention-grabber. While it's also a bright color, Rhythm Blue is a touch softer than the two options above it. The blue tones give the DualSense controller a <em>slightly </em>subdued and calmer effect.</p><div title="6537254 -- Hyperpop Collection Console Covers" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5388"

                <p>In December 2025, the developers at Ubisoft Halifax--the studio behind the mobile game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-rebellion/" data-ref-id="5000-466062">Assassin's Creed Rebellion</a>--successfully voted to unionize and join the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada. Now, less than a month later, Ubisoft is shutting down Ubisoft Halifax and laying off 70 people.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Ubisoft has denied that the closure of the studio has anything to do with the employees' unionization efforts. The publisher also stated through a spokesperson that the decision to close Ubisoft Halifax had already been made before the union vote was taken.</p><p>"Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," Ubisoft's spokesperson said in a statement to VGC. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio ... 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance."</p><p>Late last year, Ubisoft came under fire for asking employees to accept "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-roasted-for-asking-devs-to-accept-voluntary-career-transition/1100-6535640/" data-ref-id="1100-6535640">voluntary career transition</a>," or in other words, an early layoff. Assassin's Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">left the company after nearly two decades</a>, and he has since stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-says-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/1100-6535519/" data-ref-id="1100-6535519">it wasn't his choice to leave</a>.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-posts-strong-first-half-growth-and-teases-major-creative-shake-up-coming-in-2026/1100-6536414/" data-ref-id="1100-6536414">Ubisoft told investors</a> that its earnings in Q2 of its fiscal year were up 39% year-over-year. The company also stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exceeded-expectations-for-ubisoft-mirage-hits-10-million-players/1100-6536470/" data-ref-id="1100-6536470">the Assassin's Creed franchise exceeded its expectations</a>. That apparently wasn't enough to prevent any further job losses at its partner studios.</p>

This includes Fallout-themed skins, limited-time game modes, and an event pass.</p><p dir="ltr">This midseason update is bringing the wasteland to Black Ops 7 and Warzone with an all-new Fallout event. As shown in the trailer above, this event will feature operator skins for Lucy, Maximus, and The Ghoul from Amazon Prime Video's Fallout TV show. The event also includes additional vault dweller skins.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4631829-codfallouteventpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4631829-codfallouteventpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631829"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty's Fallout event pass</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4631829-codfallouteventpass.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This Fallout event follows the formula of Call of Duty's other major IP events, such as the TMNT and Squid Game crossovers, offering both free and paid event passes filled with cosmetic rewards. Call of Duty's paid event passes usually cost $10. The Ghoul and Maximus are available to unlock in the paid event pass, while the vault dweller skins are earned in the free pass. Lucy's operator skin is available as a shop bundle, and Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty will feature three limited-time game modes themed around the Fallout series. Ghoul Infection is a limited-time multiplayer mode that puts a Fallout spin on Call of Duty's Infection game mode. Project RADs is a ghoul-themed Zombies mode, and Warzone features Power-Armor Royale, which lets players step into Fallout's power armor and wield miniguns in battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's popular Nuketown map is also getting a makeover for the big event. This gives a Fallout-themed design to the map, with the mannequins dressed up in blue vault suits.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out all the details for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date-and-details/1100-6537221/">Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone</a>, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and a mystery to solve in Warzone.</p>

            <p>
We've all been there. You're at the end of a game, you've done all of the side quests, you're strong as hell, finally read to take on the final boss, confident you can finish this quest you started 30-100 hours ago. Only to find that the fight is a piece of piss because, whoops! You overlevelled yourself by too much. This was seemingly the case for a number of people in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and now the game's lead designer Michel Nohra has expressed some regret for those who had that experience.
</p>
<p>
"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra told Edge in a recent interview (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">GamesRadar</a>). "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."
</p>
<p>
Part of this comes down to, in the opinion of lead programmer Tom Guillermin, being led by "humility," simply because they weren't sure if the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> was any good. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon. We're happy about that, but we didn't see it coming."
</p>
<p>
To be honest, to me it just sounds like Clair Obscur followed in a long lineage of games that let you overlevel before the endgame. And as a chronic side quest skipper, if I ever get around to this one, I'm sure the final boss will be enough of a challenge.

</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A father visiting <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-world-fourth-death-in-one-month-disneyland-2000641756">Disneyland</a> with his family was reportedly attacked after calling out someone cutting a long ride line. The father ended up bloodied and received stitches, but was able to stay in the park and enjoy some rides.</p> <p>On December 30, <a href="https://people.com/father-injured-in-bloody-disneyland-altercation-over-reported-line-cutting-11880120">as reported by <em>People</em></a> and confirmed by Disney and Anaheim police, a family started cutting the long line for the Indiana Jones Adventure ride at around 2 p.m. At one point, the family of line cutters tried to pass by another family, but the father of this group didn’t appreciate this, and a loud argument erupted. This argument allegedly turned into a physical assault, with the man leading the group of line cutters punching the father multiple times in front of his wife and 17-year-old daughter.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nxzj3zp/">According to one Reddit user</a> who claimed to have witnessed the attack, it lasted about 30 seconds and “there were several people intervening to stop the guy.” The same user claimed the attacker “managed to get some hits in even with people blocking.” The aggressive line cutter then reportedly stopped, and when people backed off, he “jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”</p>

 <p>A Disneyland spokesperson confirmed with <em>People</em> that on January 6, a&nbsp; “physical altercation” involving two male guests did occur, and one of them was treated by the park’s medical team. The alleged attacker “fled the scene and has not been located,” according to local police.</p>

 <p>A woman on Reddit claiming to be the wife of the man who was attacked says that he didn’t fight back because he didn’t want to get his family kicked out of the park or be charged with assault. The wife also says her teen daughter recorded the entire incident. As for the father, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nx4gqzl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a photo shared by the wife</a> shows him with multiple stitches above his right eye. It was also reported that he was covered in blood, and Disneyland provided new clothes while also giving his kids, 17 and 26, Lightning Lanes for the entire day.</p>

 <p>The father and his family stayed in the park, and another image shared by someone claiming to be the daughter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q0pyhn/comment/nx4hy4d/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">showed the father in line at Disney with a bandage over his eye.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meet Mohammed: An Internet Café Owner Helping Children Learn and Game in War-Torn Yemen]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/meet-mohammed-an-internet-cafe-owner-helping-children-learn-and-game-in-war-torn-yemen/</link>
            <guid>1399741</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are few people able to bring education, entertainment, and moments of stability to children amid Yemen’s ongoing civil war. But Mohammed, an English teacher and local resident, is one of them. Through his internet café, <em>Power Net</em>, he provides children in his community with access to games, learning resources, and a rare space for connection in a country facing one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises in recent history.</p>



<p>Keeping Power Net open has been a continual challenge. Rising fuel costs, unreliable internet access, and frequent power outages often threaten the café’s operations. Despite these obstacles, Mohammed continues to run Power Net alongside his work as an English teacher, providing children in his community a space to escape from the hardships of daily life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking with Mohammed, he said that the café was a long-term ambition of his and that he had been planning it for 7 years, saving up funds from teaching and other jobs. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic closed one of his businesses, which Mohammed says motivated him to go ahead with Power Net.</p>



<p>“I love gaming and gaming brings something great to the community,” he said. “We have internet cafes already, but the problem is that they use very old computers. They barely work or can’t run games properly.”</p>



<p>To get Power Net off the ground, Mohammed spent four to five months negotiating with locals for old computer parts and peripherals, something he says in hindsight was a mistake because of the poor quality of the second-hand parts and their constant breaking. Still, where he can, Mohammed fixes everything that breaks to keep the café running.</p>



<p>“It’s a place where people can come together and forget about the struggles, to forget about the war, the civil war, you know, just be a kid. Play games, come together. They love playing multiplayer games, or just watching a movie or a TV show. Because we don’t have much internet, I download a lot of TikTok videos, so the kids watch them to escape reality. It’s fun, it doesn’t even feel like a job.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>But running Power Net comes with its struggles; notably, electricity has proven to be a constant issue, one that Mohammed says nearly made him give up. </p><p>“When I opened the café, there was no electricity, so I had to buy a big cable that runs 300 meters to an electric pole. It’s connected to like 200 other cables, so every other week it breaks or even explodes. Sometimes it’s 18 hours off, 2 hours on, because electricity isn’t stable. I also bought a generator, which was a big headache because it kept breaking every two weeks.”</p><p>“After my first anniversary, the café was empty because there was no electricity, and my generator kept breaking down all the time. I took a picture to show people that, despite all the stress, I still made it happen. Everything was going up in price by five to ten times, so it was really stressful. So I randomly uploaded the photo to Reddit, and it blew up and went viral.” </p></div>



<p>Mohammad’s viral post garnered three million views and 80,000 upvotes on Reddit, prompting offers from around the world on how people could help. But there was one catch with sending items in the middle of a warzone: it was expensive. Of the hundreds of people who reached out to Mohammed to send over PC parts and peripherals, only a select few actually sent items. Because, as it turns out, sending items into Yemen sometimes costs more than the items themselves.</p>



<p>Among the many offers Mohammed received, one in particular sparked a new chapter for Power Net: STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) classes.</p>



<p>“At first, I wasn’t sure, but after looking into it, I realized it was an amazing opportunity,” Mohammed said. “This person actually sent us materials from Britain, and we started these long STEM classes where the kids made a lot of cool things. We gave them notepads, pens, and so on. I still see these kids a few years on, and they are always asking me, with open eyes, when we are going to do the next STEM classes. Some of them have grown up, but you can tell you’ve made a real impact in their lives.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mohammed’s viral post still sees him occasionally get outreach from people all over the world today, offering keyboards, mice, headsets, and sometimes a graphics card or two. Shipment costs make such offers difficult, and without banking support from the likes of PayPal, donations are tricky, too.</p>



<p>So, with the help of a friend, Mohammed setup a GoFuundMe to keep Power Net alive. First set up in 2022, the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-keep-an-internet-cafe-in-yemen-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GoFundMe raised just over $15,000</a>, which helps Mohammed maintain the cafe as well as buy new equipment. </p>



<div><p>“This doesn’t even feel like a job; it’s very fulfilling, and I feel like I am making an impact. I feel like I am helping people, I am trying to get them off the streets, and I am trying to give them good skills. We have a lot of courses, too. Because I am also an English teacher, I always tell them to bring their notebooks because I help teach them English, and we sometimes do Spanish, German, and so on. But we also teach them how to use Adobe, Blender, and other programs.”</p><p>Mohammed says that there isn’t really a long-term goal for Power Net, but that he just wants to keep the cafe going. “It’s stressful but very fulfilling. I always wanted to do something that matters, and I feel like I am doing something that matters. I don’t have a long-term goal, and I don’t know when this will end, but we achieved, not only me, but Reddit, we did this. I am very happy. So many people around the world, South Africa, India, Australia, UK have helped, it’s been amazing, and I am very happy.”</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a country ravaged by conflict and uncertainty, Power Net and Mohammed’s dedication are a small beacon of light for many children. For those who wish to support his ongoing work, Power Net’s <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-keep-an-internet-cafe-in-yemen-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GoFundMe campaign</a> continues to help keep the café and its programs alive.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims</link>
            <guid>1399738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has asked a judge to grant the fired GTA 6 developers interim relief at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing held in the UK this week. Rockstar Games, which also attended the hearing, has issued a response to the claims, denying a number of points made by the union.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has insisted the employees it fired late last year were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize. 34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB, which is representing the affected staff in the UK, has refuted Rockstar’s claim, saying that the workers "only communicated in private and legally-protected trade union channels."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Monday, January 5, a preliminary hearing at the Glasgow Tribunals Centre in Scotland saw the IWGB represent the fired Rockstar workers and make a case for why they should be granted interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interim relief is a legal mechanism that can provide workers with support while they wait for a full hearing. This week’s tribunal will decide whether or not the workers will receive the interim relief while awaiting a date for a full trial. If the interim relief is granted, the workers will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have their work visas reinstated where necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB told IGN today that it is hopeful the judge will see it their way, but insisted that if the interim relief is not granted, that doesn’t mean Rockstar will not be found guilty of breaking the law if and when the case goes to trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope this week’s tribunal will grant urgently needed relief to the workers whose lives were turned upside down by Rockstar’s brutal union-busting, leaving them and their families without incomes, without secure futures, and in some cases without even the right to remain in the country they have made their home,” the IWGB said in a statement issued to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, no matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of  the case we have brought against Rockstar Games. We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar hoped to quickly and quietly wipe out a group of workers who were organising for better conditions. Instead, their dismissal of 31 union members captured the world’s attention and ignited an unprecedented uprising of global solidarity. This case is not just about the suffering of the 31 people who lost their livelihoods in the blink of an eye. This is about the arrogance of a company like Rockstar thinking that its size and profitability grant it an unlimited licence to abuse its workers, and to do so with impunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether or not interim relief is granted this week, we will continue fighting in the courts and on the streets until we see justice, for the fired Rockstar workers and for workers everywhere fighting for a fairer future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Rockstar Games spokesperson issued IGN with the following statement on this week’s hearing. In it, the company addressed many of the union’s claims, and claimed the organization lacks any evidence to justify emergency interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar categorically denies the claim being heard in today’s hearing,” the Rockstar spokesperson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information, including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel. This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled. Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has indicated to IGN that it believes the IWGB’s claim of “union-busting” is baseless, and that the union has no evidence to support its statements. Rockstar has also denied having a “blacklist” of union members, stressing that at the time of the dismissals, the company did not know whether the claimants were union members, so could not have targeted them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">as it has said before</a>, Rockstar employees themselves raised concerns to the company and granted representatives access to the “social” channel, not the Discord channel used for official union organizing. It maintains that this social Discord channel was not private or for employees only, and indeed contained hundreds of users, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, and dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. As IGN has also reported, Rockstar has claimed that the union channel mods didn’t know who was in the channel, and that it posed a leak risk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What about this alleged leaked information? Rockstar believes it to be significant and related to game features around GTA 6. This includes specific game features, comments on the progress of GTA 6 development, and timelines to launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar believes that if the comments in question were leaked they would have been big gaming news and might even have affected Take-Two’s share price. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">Rockstar officially announced that GTA 6 would be delayed by six months</a> to November 19, 2026, the market value of Take-Two plummeted $3.75 billion in a single day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social media, and dismissed an employee in the U.S. in November 2023 and another in India in November 2025 for two separate acts of information leaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hearing comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate"><u>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the case “deeply concerning,"</u></a> and pledged that ministers would investigate. The layoffs were raised by Rockstar North's local MP Chris Murray in the UK's Parliament during a session of Prime Minister's Questions that took place late last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The video games company Rockstar in my constituency last month fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," Murray told the Prime Minister. "The [Independent Workers Union of Great Britain] IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this government is responsible for the biggest increase in workers rights in a generation," Murray continued, "does the Prime Minister agree all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a deeply concerning case," Starmer replied. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Union busting has consequences!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4's Ork campaign is chronologically the first of four, kicking off our explosive return to the planet Kronus. And we're kicking off a month of very orky IGN First coverage with their opening cinematic (watch it above), setting the stage for a load of krumpin'. You gotta respect the boyz for knowing what they're about and living their truth, even if their truth is largely mayhem and murder. They never pretend to be anything they're not, you know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action starts with an Ork assault on one of the last battle barges of the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines. The long-time protagonists of the Dawn of War series, the red-clad Astartes are in a bad spot at this point in the 42nd Millennium, with the chapter barely clinging to life. And their return to Kronus hasn't gone unnoticed, with their perennial rival in the warboss Gorgutz meeting them head-on. It's the biggest and meanest we've ever seen him, trivially snapping a Primaris marine in half with his Mega Armor exoskeleton.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the surviving Blood Ravens try to escape their doomed ship – led by returning heroes Commander Cyrus and Chief Librarian Jonah Orion – Gorgutz orders his Ork Rok (basically just a big asteroid full of orks with rockets built in) to crash on the planet and pursue the beakies. But the Ork campaign won't just be about his story, as there's a native warboss on Kronus already who isn't eager to bend the knee to this Nob from the sky.You'll get to learn a lot more about him, and the Ork campaign and battle mechanics, all month long as part of IGN First. So keep an eye out for our interviews with the creative director for Dawn of War 4, a demonstration of the new synced melee animation system, and a hands-on preview of the first several campaign missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, don't miss our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran">first preview</a> of the upcoming RTS sequel, and stay tuned for our exclusive new coverage all January long!

But this was something Clair Obscur's team hadn't expected, Nohra explained, as they weren't sure if players would enjoy the game to the extent that they did.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By way of an explanation, lead programmer Tom Guillermin said it had been "a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon," having previously been unsure how long players would stick around in the game's world once the ability to go beat the final boss became available. "We're happy about that," Guillermin added, "but we didn't see it coming."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For players seeking even tougher challenges, the game's final DLC added a fresh area full of the hardest fights in the game — and players have been having fun with their own creative ways to make these even harder.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> quests can sometimes get pretty complicated, demanding you venture across multiple maps to complete various objectives. A Bad Feeling isn't one of these, though, as it asks something quite simple of you: Just open an Arc Probe or Arc Courier. But where exactly will you find one of these, and what will you find inside? We're here to answer that for you, so read on for where to find Arc Probes and Arc Couriers.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Arc_Probes">Where to find Arc Probes</h2><p>You may occasionally see a fresh Arc Probe come in from the sky (keep an eye out for something that looks like a rocket coming down). These will be standing straight up once they land. However, these aren't likely to be the probes you normally come across, as most Arc Probes are found tipped over on their sides. In either case, you can hear Arc Probes from some distance--listen for their odd bleeps and bloops emitting every few seconds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631034" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631034"></a><figcaption>Arc Probe</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg"></figure><p>While they're found in randomized spots all across every map, Arc Probes are considerably more common during the <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong> map event. During the event, check the roof of the Testing Annex on the Dam Battlegrounds map to score at least 2-3 of them in the same spot--which is a great way to start getting your points up if you're trying to knock out an Open Arc Probes weekly trial that may be active. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631037" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631037"></a><figcaption>The Testing Annex roof is a great spot to find Arc Probes during an Electromagnetic Storm event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Alternatively, keep an eye out for the <strong>Prospecting Probes</strong> event to pop up when you're selecting a map to visit. Prospecting Probes pops up occasionally on each map except Stella Montis, and you'll be able to tell it's active by hovering over the map with your cursor. During this event, Arc Probes will be plentifully scattered across the map, so you certainly won't have any problems finding as many as you need.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631085"></a><figcaption>A Prospecting Probes event will litter the map with Arc Probes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg"></figure><p>Arc Probes typically contain items like Arc Alloy, Arc Circuitry, and Arc Motion Cores--all of which are needed for crafting items. This makes Arc Probes worth popping open if you're invested in crafting much of your loadout--though you'll likely find the loot inside fairly insignificant otherwise. </p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Arc_Couriers">Where to find Arc Couriers</h2><p>Like Arc Probes, Arc Couriers can be found in random spots all across the map and similarly emit a black smoke. And also, just like Arc Probes, these are usually easier to find during the Electromagnetic Storm map condition. While the spawn locations vary, we've had a lot of luck finding Arc Couriers in the Red Lakes on the eastern side of Dam Battlegrounds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631036" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631036"></a><figcaption>Red Lakes is often a good spot to find Arc Couriers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg"></figure><p>Arc Couriers can often house some important materials you'll need for progression, too. Specifically, keep an eye out for <strong>Surveyor Vaults and Sentinel Firing Cores</strong> when opening these, as you'll need them to craft some of your workbenches. Since the only other way to get these items is killing Surveyors or Sentinels--both of which are in very limited supply on each map--popping open Arc Couriers may turn out to be a quicker method than farming the enemies themselves. </p><p>In both cases, sometimes breaching these containers spawns a sudden drop of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-all-enemies-and-how-to-kill-them/1100-6536073/" data-ref-id="1100-6536073">Arc enemies</a> such as hornets and wasps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631033" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631033"></a><figcaption>Arc Courier</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg"></figure><p>Once you've looted an Arc Probe or Arc Courier, you'll be able to turn in the A Bad Feeling quest back in Speranza.

One of these quests is Back on Top, which asks you to visit all four launch maps and mark specific buildings. It's not a particularly challenging quest, but it can be rather time consuming due to the amount of travel time needed to reach each building on the maps.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Netflix has today confirmed that the fifth and final season of The Witcher will air on the streaming service this year. It follows Season 4 in rapid succession - that series having launched at the end of October last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026">Netflix listed The Witcher as a 2026 release</a> in the "coming soon" section of a list on its website. A synopsis for the series reads:</p>
<blockquote>"The time of the end is nigh: dark forces are aligning all across the Continent with villainous designs on Ciri. Even if Geralt and Yennefer can save their daughter and fulfill their last wish of reuniting as a family, they’ll have to face obstacles — and enemies — the likes of which they've never faced before."</blockquote>
<p>Season 5 was expected to follow Season 4 quickly, with the two being filmed back to back. Showrunner Lauren Hissrich said the Witcher team treated the two series as "one large story". <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-witcher-season-5-season-4-one-story-schmidt-hissrich-batey-response/">Jaskier actor Joey Batey added, speaking to ScreenRant</a>, "It sort of feels like Season 4, Part 1 and 2. I think that's how I read it."</p><p>Viewing figures for The Witcher Netflix series have fallen sharply since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-tracking-to-be-our-biggest-season-one-tv-series-ever-says-netflix">The Witcher's remarkably strong start in 2019</a>. Even with Henry Cavill, the series was in decline season on season, and the fourth series, which saw Liam Hemsworth replace Cavill, dropped even further. Season 4 had 7.4m views across its first four days of availability, Season 3 had 15.2m, and Season 2 had 18.5m. Season 1 saw 76m households tune in for at least two minutes, Netflix said at the time.</p>
<p>I watched a few episodes of Season 4 but bounced off it after that. Did anyone make it all the way through?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Not even three weeks ago from the time of this writing, <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">announced that it had voted for a wall-to-wall union and joined CWA Canada.</a> Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">covered the announcement</a>, as it was the latest and one of the final bits of news regarding the continued labour movement in the video game industry in 2025. Now, 20 days after Ubisoft Halifax announced its successful union vote, Ubisoft has shut down the studio, with <strong>71 developers set to lose their jobs<em>.</em></strong></p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/">VGC</a>, which obtained an email sent to Ubisoft Halifax staff informing them of the closure, claiming the decision was made as part of Ubisoft's efforts within the last 24 months "<em>to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>."   </p>



<p>Shortly after the news was made public, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-long-0438b7174_ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-activity-7414702213182222336-KkuI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">several members</a> of Ubisoft Halifax <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-clarke-ux-research_opentowork-activity-7414701237566300160-nUyA?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">confirmed the news</a> via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgegreer123_ubisoft-halifax-is-being-shut-down-if-anyone-activity-7414680117597245440-duoJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">posts on their personal LinkedIn profiles</a>. The studio had just celebrated its 10-year anniversary after its founding in 2015.</p>



<p>According to the initial report, the decision to close the Halifax studio was not made as a result of the team unionizing, and the choice was made "<em>well before</em>" 60 of the studio's staff joined the CWA Canada in its successful union vote. At the time of this writing, there's been no official statement from Ubisoft on the shuttering, though CWA Canada has made a short statement on social media, with an official statement informed by conversations with the staff at Ubisoft Halifax to follow. </p>



<p>"<em>CWA Canada is shocked and disappointed at this outrageous damaging decision by Ubisoft</em>," CWA Canada <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mbtvhfk5ak2v">writes in their post on Bluesky</a>. "<em>We are speaking with legal counsel, and we will do everything possible to fight this. We will have a full statement after we have consulted with our Ubisoft members.</em>"</p>







<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a statement and will update this article if/when we receive a response. </p>

Ubisoft are closing Ubisoft Halifax, the Canadian developers of mobile games Rainbow Six Mobile and Assassin's Creed Rebellion. This is strictly speaking outside our mandate as a PC gaming site, of course - I fear smartphones like Hell itself, and only ever communicate over long distances using homing pigeons - but it's all part of Ubisoft's wider transformation into a heavily Tencent-backed publisher, and the nasty twist is that Ubisoft Halifax had only just voted to unionise.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Ubisoft Halifax staff announced the founding of Ubisoft's first labour union in North America earlier this week, having begun the process in June 2025. Almost 74% of the studio's staff voted in favour, spanning the programming, production, design, art and R&amp;D departments. The vote was actually due to take place last June, but Ubisoft mounted challenges that were ultimately dropped ahead of vote-counting in December.
</p>
<p>
In announcement materials, the freshly unionised Halifax staff appeared positive about their relationship with the company. "We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered," they wrote. "We are unionising not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation."
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft have binned them off, though they've stressed to GI that this has nothing to do with unionisation. "Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," the company said in a statement. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance." 
</p><p>
According to an Ubisoft spokesperson, the closure forms part of cost-cutting that dates back to the lifting of Covid restrictions and the end of the pandemic revenue boom. They remain happy to recognise and work with unionised staff in general. It should of course be noted that there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">plenty of unionised Ubisoft staff in other regions</a>, but still, I'm not sure burning down a subsidiary within weeks of a union vote indicates strong desire for a healthy dialogue with the workers.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Halifax weren't always a mobile-dedicated studio. Prior to their acquisition by the House of Guillemot in 2015, they were known as Longtail and worked on guitar game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocksmith">Rocksmith</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following a rough couple of years defined by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">plummeting stock prices and shareholder uprisings</a>, Ubisoft are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded core "creative house"</a>, shoring up their core <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six operations while trimming the books elsewhere. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced plans for redundancies</a> at Massive, creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, together with a change of direction for Trials devs Redlynx.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all Ubisoft Halifax staff now looking for new jobs.

              <p><span>Razer, the company best known for its RGB-infused keyboards, cat-ear headsets, and over-priced gaming chairs, has just revealed that its “AI gaming copilot” Project Ava will be used in its latest invention: an AI anime waifu that sits on your desk, named “Kira.” She’ll be powered by Elon Musk’s Grok.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show kicked off in Las Vegas this week and, unsurprisingly, AI-powered tech is everywhere. Razer announced its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach"><span>AI gaming assistant, Project Ava,</span></a><span> at last year’s show, alongside a prerecorded video of the copilot program suggesting tips to help a player navigate a boss fight in </span><i><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Razer’s Project Ava has now returned in physical form. The newly unveiled “AI Desk Companion” version comes equipped with a built-in webcam (which Razer states is for its “human-like vision” and “full contextual awareness”), a series of customizable RGB LEDs, a USB-C port, and, most notably, a “swappable” 5.5-inch-tall 3D holographic avatar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Razer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Razer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/ah54Us7QMJ">pic.twitter.com/ah54Us7QMJ</a></p> <p>— Shacknews (@shacknews) <a href="https://twitter.com/shacknews/status/2008539048328171561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the press release, Project Ava’s holographic companion currently comes in five varieties. These include the default, amorphous green blob Ava, the aforementioned cat-ear wearing anime waifu Kira, and a buff “gaming wingman” called Zane. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The other two holograms are actually 3D recreations of real people: the South Korean eSports legend Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and the J-Pop idol Saori “Sao” Araki, the latter of whom exploded in popularity last year following her viral “Office Lady” meme.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sony-razer-project-ava-ai-gameplay"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, the physical version of Project Ava will be powered by xAI’s Grok, which recently </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrn054nxe7o"><span>started posting CSAM online</span></a><span>. If you’re curious how it will perform as Grok races </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><span>to seed social media with deepfake porn</span></a><span>, several outlets, including </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/razer-made-its-ai-gaming-assistant-into-a-waifu-hologram-2000705679"><span>both </span><i><span>Gizmodo</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>, were less than complimentary about its implementation.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>Gizmodo’s </span></i><span>James Pero stated that his experience with Project Ava was “as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there,” and </span><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i><span> Antonio G. Di Benedetto noted that the anime AI assistant Kira “kept incessantly filling gaps in communication with annoying chatter.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’re still keen to get your hands on one of these regardless, </span><a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava"><span>the FAQ</span></a><span> on Razer’s Project Ava website states that it’s “expected to be available in the second half of 2026” and that folks in the United States can already reserve one of the units by putting down a $20 deposit. The company still hasn’t revealed how much the full Grok-powered holograms will cost.</span></p>

<p>The Yakuza series has grown in popularity exponentially in the past decade.

<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lara Croft is back and seemingly better in the remake of the legendary 1996 title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-difficulty-will-be-adjusted-for-modern-player-tastes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>. Nicknamed Legacy of Atlantis, the game brings players back to Lara’s original journey to find the Scion of Atlantis.

Plus, it acts as the perfect way to celebrate its 30th anniversary, especially with the upcoming Tomb Raider: Catalyst in 2027.</p>



<h2 id="h-trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter">Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nihon Falcom</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-7-reimagined">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>A stylized remake of the 2000 classic, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined takes the iconic RPG series in a new direction.

<p>With the successful soft reboot, Dynasty Warriors: Origins under its belt, Koei Tecmo is remastering one of the earlier entries in the series: Dynasty Warriors 3. The game, which was released in 2001, is considered a favorite among fans and critics, as its excellent hack-and-slash gameplay and visuals were a treat. Taking place after Dynasty Warriors 2, players will play as over 40 officers during the Three Kingdoms era. Given the advancements made since its initial release, including Origins’ 1000 v 1 combat and Unreal Engine 5, it’ll feel like a whole new game. With the series growing in popularity, Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition Remastered is a great way to dive in and have some sword-slashing fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Tecmo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2000s were great for the horror genre, but one series made waves in Japan and later in the West: Fatal Frame. While new entries haven’t happened since 2014, a remake of the second title, 2003’s Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, will suffice. Following twin sisters Mio and Mayu, the two become trapped in a ghost-infested, cursed town and are forced to recreate the ritual that summoned the hex. Using your Camera Obscura, you’ll solve puzzles, locate important items, and kill dangerous ghosts. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake will bring plenty of spooks and scares to satisfy even the bravest, and it should be a worthwhile addition to your library—if you’re brave enough!</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo Campaign Evolved</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>The campaign of Halo Combat Evolved is getting its own game, fully remade. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Campaign Evolved</a> is the original game’s single-player, now with better visuals and new story content. As Master Chief, you’ll take the fight to the Covenant and uncover the secrets of the Halo ring. With fine-tuned FPS gameplay and many modern-day adaptations, it makes for a wonderful 25th anniversary celebration. It looks to be a very promising return to Halo Combat Evolved and the game that started it all for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Released in 2003, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time rebooted the ‘platformer’ for a new generation. Now, the classic game is getting a next-gen remake thanks to Ubisoft Montreal. Following a nameless Prince, you’ll use the power of time manipulation to stop the evil Vizier from taking over the world. It’s been in development hell for quite some time, changing studios and such. However, a promised 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a> gives hope to the many fans: Perhaps the Prince’s famed journey will see the light of day again.</p>



<h2 id="h-steins-gate-re-boot">Steins;Gate Re:Boot</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to MAGES. Inc</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Steins:Gate took many by surprise in 2009 with its genre balance and spectacular twists and turns.

                <p>Some collectors will stop at nothing to complete their collections, even if that means decades have to pass before ever finishing. One such collector was on such a journey, finding and acquiring every Xbox 360 game released, and at the start of this year, that collector has finally finished this now vintage library that totals around $20,000--with the last game being a gift from their son.</p><p>Redditor uncleseeth <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q2gdxs/comment/nxcufdh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their massive library</a> in a post on the r/gaming subreddit on January 2.

From standard editions to different variants, uncleseeth said their collection topped at 1,353 games--well over the 1,256 needed for a "complete set," which doesn't include the variants of various games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Best Games You Missed In 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Some games and items were given as gifts, including Efecto Studios' racer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-chavo-kart/" data-ref-id="5000-245779">El Chavo Kart</a> and the Xbox stand. One game that shocked them to find was The Farm 51's action-adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadfall-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-172682">Deadfall Adventures</a>, which they described as "kinda [having] Indiana Jones vibes."</p><p>But the final title they were missing was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2018/" data-ref-id="5000-464889">Pro Evolution Soccer 2018</a>, which was gifted to them by their son. With that in their possession, the collection was complete and totals roughly $20,000, as the games are estimated to resell for about $15 each after two decades. That said, there is one expensive game in the bunch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f1-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-187692">F1 2013</a>, which uncleseeth approximated is going for $250 or so.</p><p>With an Xbox 360 Elite--their first Xbox 360 got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the dreaded Red Ring of Death</a>--and a total gamerscore of 497,000, uncleseeth's next goal is to continue chasing more variants and play through the entire library. They said they've played about 800 of the games but only completed roughly 175 of them. That's a lot of games to play.</p>

<figure data-uuid="21ed6cf957940"><a title="Pokémon x Natural History Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/21ed6cf957940/pokemon-x-natural-history-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">announcement</a> back in September 2025, The Pokémon Company has today lifted the lid on the theme for its upcoming Natural History Museum pop-up store, and it's all about Pokécology.</p>
<p>Don't worry, we had to Google it too. For those wondering, 'Pokécology' is the study of Pokémon based on their assigned habitats. It all stems from Yoshinari Yonehara's <strong>Pokécology: An Illustrated Guide to Pokémon Ecology</strong>, the best-selling Japanese Pokémon book, which, conveniently, will be getting an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/preorder-the-upcoming-book-pokecology-an-illustrated-guide-to-pokemon-ecology">English translation</a> later this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhmwrxi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>What this means for the merch is a whole lot of dino vibes. The Pokémon Company has already revealed a handful of pieces you can expect to find if you're lucky enough to hold a ticket to the pop-up store (now sold out), including a dinosaur Pokémon print, special pins, a research notes Pikachu tote, and a plushie of that same Electric Type hugging the museum itself.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also revealed a special oversized TCG promo card to mark the collaboration, which shows Pikachu walking the museum's iconic central hall. This card will be available from select UK retailers from 30th January.</p>
<p>All of this merch and more will be available in the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop from 26th Jan - 19th April.</p>
<p>For those who couldn't snag a ticket to the collaboration, TPC has confirmed that a selection of the exclusive items will be available on both The Pokémon Center and the Natural History Museum's online stores — just brace yourselves for the dreaded 'Sold Out' messages...</p>
<p>On a related note, The Pokémon Company yesterday shared more details on London's <em>other</em> upcoming pop-up store at next month's European International Championships. Gosh, it's a hell of a time to be nursing that post-holiday bank balance.</p>

            <p>
A few years ago, it would have been pretty easy to imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> releasing as a free-to-play game. It is a live service game after all, most of those are free-to-play because studios want to reduce the barrier to entry. Instead, it launched as a paid-for, $40 game, a far cry from free, but not the $80-$100 releases we're seeing more and more of. And it's because Arrowhead made the decision to do so that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark did the exact same thing for their own shooter.
</p>
<p>
This comes from Embark founder Patrick Söderlund who spoke of the studio's decision to shift the game from free-to-play to paid-for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-from-the-finals-devs-is-no-longer-free-to-play-and-coming-2025">in 2024</a> in an interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi. "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" Söderlund said. ""We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."

</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Apparently, the game's lack of a campaign was a factor as well, with Söderlund noting he wouldn't want a high price tag to "be an offender for someone. We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."
</p><p>
Certainly seems like it paid off for Embark, given that Arc Raiders was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-ancient-behemoths-face-increased-competition-from-new-games-in-the-stores-2025-money-making-rankings">apparently one of the best performing games of 2025</a>, so, I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing more campaign-less, online shooters going the premium route in future. Like, for example, Bungie's yet to prove itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-lives-as-bungie-set-a-march-release-date-and-try-to-convince-you-the-extraction-shooter-is-good-now">which has also opted for the 40 bucks option</a>.

            <p>Ghost Ship Games could learn a thing or two from Rockstar about hiding secrets in cobwebs. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-let-red-dead-redemption-2s-unsolved-ancient-spiderweb-mystery-end-by-revealing-that-rdr2-is-a-spiders-dream">RDR2’s spider-spun mystery</a> continues to vex seasoned easter egg hunters, the message behind a piece of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a> promo art – posted on the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/drg">Discord server</a> earlier today – was seemingly spotted in about twenty minutes. Still, at least it looks to be a handy bit of info: a release date for its big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-unearths-its-season-6-update-as-rogue-core-spinoff-gets-delayed">Season 6 update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's the image in question, and while I confess to having initially blanked on it when it buzzed onto my phone – obviously I want up-to-the-minute alerts on all dwarf FPS news – more observant mining enthusiasts on the same Discord quickly spotted the hints. A '29' wrapped in the dangling webs. An '01' carved into the jaw of a long-dead alien colossus. And finally, a '26' stamped on the laser-cutting rocket booster shown hauling a valuable rock through other, less valuable rocks.</p>

<p>Put them together in the correct day/month/year format, and you get the 29th of January 2026, well within Season 6’s previously given 'Q1 26' estimate. Depending on the angle, you could maybe say the 29 is actually a 62, but I asked Edwin if there’s a month with 62 days in it and he said no, and Edwin is really smart so I believe him.</p><p>To recap what we know, Season 6 has been in development at Ghost Ship’s Copenhagen neighbours Invisible Walls, while the former focus on getting roguelike spinoff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> into early access. Despite the outsourcing, OG Deep Rock’s first seasonal update since mid-2024 is shaping up to be a big one, with new xenobugs to fight, a new, skeleton-ridden biome to plunder, and a new mineral extraction mission type, an artist’s rendition of which forms that teaser image.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to it! Last night I played DRG for the first time in about a month and a half, and while it absolutely has that semi-timeless quality a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">great co-op games</a> have, it would be nice to switch up both the cave locales and the opposing force of insectoids. If that’s only three weeks plus change away, all the better.</p>
