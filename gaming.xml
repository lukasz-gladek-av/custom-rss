		<p>If you were hoping to play Skate soon then we have both good and bad news. The good news is that the game is getting Early Access, the bad news is that no platforms have been announced and it will be sometime next year.</p>
<p>“Over the last two years, the team has welcomed tens of thousands of individual playtesters into the city of San Vansterdam via the PC version, with console playtesting set to come in the Fall 2024. Players can still sign up to become a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1726673954360000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2YIMaAtOtYmRQ-nMswVT9W">skate. Insider</a> today for a chance to playtest and help shape the future of skate.” said developers Full Circle.</p>


<p>EA have been keeping Skate (4) very much under wraps since it was announced way back in 2021, but some pre alpha footage has leaked out and found it’s way on to Twitter in 2022.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Skate 4 pre-alpha footage. This is in line with what I've heard about where the game is at from multiple people. They're trying to get the feel right, which is probably the most important aspect of a Skate game. <a href="https://t.co/AXNV2Agk6z">https://t.co/AXNV2Agk6z</a> <a href="https://t.co/nUINhghxLg">pic.twitter.com/nUINhghxLg</a></p>
<p>— Grubb (@JeffGrubb) <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffGrubb/status/1516906318757388288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2022</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As you can see the game is quite a way off from being completed but we do get to see the character doing some flips, running about without the skateboard and attempting – and failing – a mid-air somersault.</p>

<p>EA have created Full Circle, a team dedicated to developing Skate 4. Daniel McCulloch, former general manager of Xbox Live and producer of Forza games, is leading the team.</p>
<p>“The fans wished Skate back into existence and we want them to feel involved in the process from development to game launch and beyond. We want them to feel like they are a part of Full Circle,” McCulloch said in a press release. “We’re all about having fun and making great games that people want to play with their friends. And, we’re looking for more developers to help us build compelling worlds for players to explore.”</p>
<p>Deran Chun and Chris “Cuz” Parry are heading up the creative team, both of them have worked on previous iterations of the franchise.</p>
<p>Skate 3 was released over fifteen&nbsp; years ago and our beloved Blair didn’t really enjoy it, <a href="http://<a href=">scoring it just 6/10 </a>and&nbsp; saying “There really isn’t much depth to be found with Skate 3, due to the short career mode and lacking extra features. Thankfully, the simplistic yet effective controls and the fun to be found in some of the challenges help somewhat. With Skate 3, we see that innovation can only last so long before it becomes uninspired and stale.”</p>

					<p>I wasn't interested in playing The Plucky Squire just by looking at the screenshots. I found the art style slightly peculiar, especially when the main character wasn't in the storybook. Reluctantly, I loaded up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627570/The_Plucky_Squire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game</a> and found myself having a great time once I got into it.</p>
<p>Immediately, you are greeted by a sea of color and vibrancy, and I feel like I've loaded up a kid's game. That statement isn't too far from the truth, but the game was fun to dive into. I went into this without knowing anything about the game.</p>
<p>From my first moment of interacting with The Plucky Squire, moving about and slashing my sword, I immediately felt as if I was playing the classic Zelda games, even with the abilities you could pick up and learn via Martina, the merchant. It felt very nostalgic and homey and gave me a sense of comfort playing as this little squire who felt like the classic hero of many people's childhoods.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Plucky-Squire-Screen-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Off the bat, I was drawn to Moonbeard as a character (again, reminding me of The Legend of Zelda) and Thrash, an adorable goblin accompanying you on your journey. You play as Jot, also known as The Plucky Squire, and it's up to you to travel to Tome Tower to stop the villain of the storybook you are the protagonist of, as he is sick of being the villain every single time. Instead, he wants to make the book about him, and since you are the idol of a child who owns these storybooks, it becomes your mission to travel through both 2D and 3D settings to stop him.</p>
<p>In some elements, the game reminded me much of It Takes Two, especially once you are ejected from the book and plunged into the real world of the child who adores you and your stories. The 3D elements are a mix of cartoonish and realistic, reminding me a lot of Toy Story. It had a nostalgic feel to it, being tiny and climbing around on a desk to survive, and that was an element in the game that I enjoyed a lot. Especially when it came to hiding from the beetles that Sam (the child) was keeping as pets. However, if you got too close and alerted the beetles, you died.</p>
<p>The range of characters was excellent, with Martina and Thrash being some of my favorites from the list of companions you encounter. Martina is the storefront of the game, which sells you abilities and art scrolls for bulbs, the in-game currency you collect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Plucky-Squire-Screen-3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Although I enjoyed The Plucky Squire's gameplay aspects, I lost attention during the game's storytelling. There was nothing wrong with the story; it just didn't captivate me the way it possibly would a younger audience. If possible, I would skip through the story as fast as possible to dive back into combat, platforming, and puzzle-solving, all of which were fantastic elements I enjoyed. I liked listening to the narrator's voice, and I felt that the narrator chosen for the game was brilliant and did great storytelling despite me not being immersed in the actual details.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire reminded me of many different games I've played throughout the years, and it instantly made me curious about the driving inspirations behind this game. Was it meant to be similar to the classic Zelda games, or was it meant to be a mixture of Cuphead and It Takes Two?</p>
<p>Despite the nostalgic feelings provided by the game, it stood firm on its own two feet. Overall, the game isn't too long and will only take a few hours. I loved the element of being able to purchase the concept art for Bulbs, as it provided an extra layer of immersion into the game and helped show you how certain characters or landscapes came to be.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire was a lot of fun, and the characters all provided their own levels of entertainment, especially Violet's commentary about being a 'side-character' in a book. They were all very well-thought-out characters, and each provided something different to the game. Whether they were giving instructions or providing comedic relief in tense moments, they all had their purpose, which I liked.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Plucky-Squire-Screen-16.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This game was very well done and had a highly polished feel. One of the only gripes I had with it was navigating the menu, which felt as if it was tailored to controllers specifically. It made it a bit difficult for me as I was using a mouse and keyboard, but the actual gameplay wasn't an issue.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire is an enjoyable experience that can be very casual, or you can have it on a slightly harder difficulty if you want to add a challenging aspect to it, too. The game is perfect for gamers of all ages and could serve as a great resource to get children into gaming as well as find ways to be creative.</p>

<p>Although the game was a lot of fun and I enjoyed the actual gameplay elements of it, the story just didn't grab me. Initially, I was also deterred by the massively contrasting art styles and the finicky menus. Overall, the game is a pleasant experience, appropriate for gamers of all ages. If the story had some more flashy dramatics, it may have pulled me in earlier. The Plucky Squire is very evidently a product made with a lot of love, and you can tell that from the level of polish it has.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-reboot-officially-coming-to-early-access-next-year.983346/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot will finally launch into Early Access next year, although the studio doesn't provide a more specific timeframe for release than just "2025".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, EA development team Full Circle says it's "incredibly stoked" to reveal that&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>&nbsp;(or, to give it its proper formatting,&nbsp;<em>skate.</em>), "will be launching in Early Access in 2025".</p>
<p>The studio says more information will be forthcoming "in the coming months", so that's presumably when we'll learn which platforms the game will be available on, as well as what features we can expect from&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>'s Early Access launch.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-reboot-release-window-early-access-grinding.jpg?itok=ZPNquRDp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-reboot-release-window-early-access-grinding.jpg?itok=uxRmSl2W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skate&nbsp;</em>is officially coming sometime in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Full Circle was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-is-happening-ea-forms-new-studio">originally formed back in early 2021</a>, specifically to work on what was then called&nbsp;<em>Skate 4</em>.</p>
<p>In August of that year, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-pc-release-confirmed-by-ea">PC release of the game was confirmed</a>, and in July 2022, some of the game's alpha features were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alpha-features-of-skate-4-leaked-from-early-play-testers">leaked by early playtesters</a>, including different control schemes, a fast-travel system, and crafting materials and blueprints, although it's not clear how much of that is still in the game.</p>
<p>Later in July, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-4-now-titled-skate-will-be-free-to-play">announced</a> that the game would officially be titled&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>rather than&nbsp;<em>Skate 4</em>, and that it would be free-to-play across all platforms on which it appeared, with cross-play and cross-progression both fully supported.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the game will be released across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, which presumably means it'll be available on PS4 and Xbox One as well as current-gen platforms. No mention of the Nintendo Switch, although its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">much-talked-about successor</a> might get a look-in eventually.</p>

<p>We still don't have a concrete release date for&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, but EA and Full Circle say that they're expanding the game's playtesting to consoles later this fall, so we'll probably learn more about what shape the game is taking around then. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that the studio has no plans to make&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>anytime soon, and that the franchise as a whole will move "beyond linear, sequential" releases, offering "more options for players than ever before".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new blog post</a>, EA lays out the future of the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the studio says it sees&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>' future as "more than any one title". Future plans for the series include "cozy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games".</p>
<p>With regards to&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>, it looks like EA is planning to stick with&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>for the foreseeable future. The studio says the game will "continue to be a foundational&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>experience", although it will receive "continued depth, improvements, and modernization".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-ea-the-sims-4.jpg?itok=o1Se5gee 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-ea-the-sims-4.jpg?itok=zsu7lw6t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you've been hoping for&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>, we've got some disappointing news for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>general manager Kate Gorman said she and EA want players to "continue all of those families and generations" that you've been following in&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4</em>.</p>
<p>Creating&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5&nbsp;</em>would mean "reset[ting] your progress", and Gorman says she wants to avoid this eventuality. She says the future of&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>is all about "keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience".</p>
<p>So, what actually is in store for the future of&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>? Well, first up, EA confirms that&nbsp;the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>movie is very much real. It'll be directed by <i>Loki</i>'s Kate Herron and produced by Margot Robbie's company LuckyChap, in conjunction with Vertigo Entertainment.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>is getting Creator Kits, a set of packs made by&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>content creators that will deliver "creator-made content that's console-friendly and curated with safeguards".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-the-sims-4-family.jpg?itok=Mm5k7TEx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sims-5-not-happening-the-sims-4-family.jpg?itok=3R2f-o6s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty is happening in the world of&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, just not&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>EA also says it's currently working on Project Rene, which, I suppose, officially isn't&nbsp;<em>The Sims 5</em>, although EA stops just short of explaining what it actually is, simply saying that it is "focused on building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world".</p>
<p>We'll learn more about Creator Packs in November, and more details about Project Rene will likely emerge when an "invite-only playtest" is held this fall. Additionally,&nbsp;<em>The Sims 4&nbsp;</em>will, of course, continue to receive regular updates.</p>
<p>Given that Paradox's&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled earlier this year</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>now has pretty scant competition, although games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">InZoi</a>&nbsp;</em>are still keeping a watchful eye on the franchise's life sim crown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>' new agenda manages to achieve, and whether any of its upcoming competitors manage to knock it off its throne. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

Some of my earliest memories are of sitting in front of a small CRT TV set up in the living room watching my brother run through the fields of Hyrule.

While a little rough around the edges in some places, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a game so full of heart that it’ll remind you every step of the way why games are so special.</p><h2 id="h15051"><a id=""></a>Leaping off the page</h2><p>The developers at All Possible Futures are, like me and millions of other gamers, clearly fans of classic <em>Zelda</em> games. <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is, at its simplest, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-trailer-nintendo-switch-pc-playstatio-1849048046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-trailer-nintendo-switch-pc-playstatio-1849048046"><em>Zelda</em>-like</a></span> inspired by the golden age of the NES and SNES—think titles like the original 1986 <em>Zelda </em>or 1991’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-making-of-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-5904884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-making-of-the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-5904884"><em>A Link to the Past</em></a></span>. In a top-down 2D perspective, you control Jot—the titular Squire full of pluck—as he fights bad guys and solves puzzles.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-recommend-id="image://ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire swings a sword at a goblin on a 2D map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plucky squire swings a sword at a goblin on a 2D map" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-recommend-id="image://ea0959c541fd645116d24a687c2165f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire swings a sword at a goblin on a 2D map" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The narrative wrinkle of <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is that Jot and all the other people you encounter are characters within a children’s story book titled, you guessed it, <em>The Plucky Squire</em>. To emphasize this the game turns the screen-to-screen transitions of early <em>Zelda </em>titles into a page turning in the book, revealing the next part of the map. It’s little flourishes like this that help emphasize the charm of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>. The game’s roughly ten-hour adventure begins when the evil Humgrump becomes aware of his literary prison and finds a way to kick Jot out of the book and begins a campaign to change the story for his own benefit. </p><p>Once Jot is jettisoned out of his story, you find yourself on the desk of a young kid named Sam who loves <em>The Plucky Squire</em>. The game then transitions from a 2D <em>Zelda</em>-like to a 3D platformer, taking inspiration from yet another era of gaming. Here you do more fighting, puzzling, and jumping in an attempt to return to Jot’s home, which you quickly accomplish. From this point forward, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> becomes a multi-dimensional puzzle that tasks you with jumping in and out of the storybook to complete the roadblocks Humgrump puts in your way.</p><figure id="" data-id="3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-recommend-id="image://3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire runs through a 3D world on a kid's desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plucky squire runs through a 3D world on a kid's desk" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-recommend-id="image://3772b7b40d2084f5a216e487330aa54b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire runs through a 3D world on a kid's desk" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jot is able to do this with the aid of a growing list of tools that let him meddle with the metatextual nature of his adventure. This leads to some truly delightful levels, such as one that required me to freeze an object on the page and then close the book to transfer that object to the opposite page to then unlock a door. Combat does exist in the game, and it’s serviceable enough, but the multi-faceted puzzles are where <em>The Plucky Squire</em> shines.<br></p><h2 id="h15052"><a id=""></a><strong>A link to the past</strong></h2><p><em>The Plucky Squire</em> doesn’t just honor classic 2D and 3D games in its core gameplay—you’ll be faced with a number of minigames clearly cribbing from iconic games of the past throughout your adventure. An early boss fight turns into a boxing match straight out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-punch-out-40th-anniversary-1851271511&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-punch-out-40th-anniversary-1851271511"><em>Punch-Out!!</em></a></span> complete with dodging, jabbing, and uppercuts. A more stealth-based section late in the game seems to pull from a much more recent title, requiring you to navigate a short dungeon while moving to the beat a la 2015’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-speedrunner-makes-near-impossi-1784329931&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer-speedrunner-makes-near-impossi-1784329931"><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></a></span>. I won’t spoil every send-up for you but know that the list is long, and each one is clearly made with love.</p><p>While each of these homages look incredible, rendered in adorable 2D illustrations or 3D models, they all feel a little off. I mean this quite literally, the controls of each minigame—and to some extent the game at large—are consistently somewhat unresponsive. I first noticed this in an early 2D platforming level that takes on the side-scrolling perspective of a <em>Mario </em>game, when prompting Jot to jump never behaved quite as expected. —I’d always fall a little short due to the unexpected sluggishness of his movement. A similar problem occurred in a rhythm-inspired minigame where the proper input window felt completely unsynced to the beat. These imperfections are made less frustrating thanks to a wonderful array of accessibility options that go as far as to let you skip a minigame that is giving you too much trouble. I do, however, wish that the controls themselves were a little tighter across the board.<br></p><p>It’s almost surprising to see so much gaming history in <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s DNA considering how angled towards kids the game feels. It’s perfect for a parent to give to their child in the hopes of fostering a love for games in the next generation, even if that generation may have little to no knowledge of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>’s references. A kid is still likely to have a good time thanks to how delightful the puzzle-solving is, while a parent watching over their shoulder can smile knowingly at every homage. The story itself is simple, sweet, and easy to understand. This does mean that the more adult gamer might get a bit bored at times, but there are some jokes and clever tidbits throughout to help keep you interested. Though within all of that is a message about the importance of art at a young age and the power it has to inspire. <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is for kids, and that’s its greatest strength.</p><h2 id="h15053"><a id=""></a><strong>Forward thinking</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-recommend-id="image://9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire ziplines across a string of flags" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plucky squire ziplines across a string of flags" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Devolver Digital</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-recommend-id="image://9406e666b0ba16eda500e3bbd5adec06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plucky squire ziplines across a string of flags" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The result of classic games successfully enrapturing an entire generation led to something wonderful: more video games. There would not be a modern gaming industry without the kids who fell in love with <em>Zelda </em>on the Famicom in 1986. They would become lifelong players, critics, and developers. They would be the ones who made the games that the next generation would fall in love with, who in turn would become inspired to make even more games.<br></p><p><em>The Plucky Squire</em> is all about that lineage of art, inspiration, and creation. The most important role Jot fills as the hero of his book isn’t that of Humgrump’s vanquisher, rather it is his ability to inspire the kid whose desk his book sits on to create something of their own. Every person has a story about what game made them fall in love with the medium, and there is a chance that <em>The Plucky Squire</em> becomes that for some kid that plays it—the thing that will push them to create. How can you not be romantic about video games?</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Developer Full Circle has announced that Skate will finally launch in Early Access in 2025. The announcement comes as the game gets set for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-trailer-debut-summer-games-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console playtests this fall</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re incredibly stoked to announce that skate. will be launching in Early Access in 2025,” the developers said <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1836065157027402235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via social media</a>. “We’ll share more details on what to expect in the coming months.”</p>

Members of the Insider program have the opportunity to participate in upcoming playtests.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-skate">What Is Skate?</h2>



<p>Skate is the reboot of the classic franchise, but with a focus on multiplayer gameplay. The game will be a free-to-play live service game that will feature regular updates weekly, monthly, etc.</p>



<p>“We’re excited to be working on a ton of social features to help you team-up, cooperate, or compete with other players in the city,” Lead social designer Andreia Goncalves said back in June on the multiplayer aspect of the game. “You can play challenges together or make your own fun by combining our quick drop objects and Throwdown modes…”</p>



<p>Before the Early Access announcement, it was revealed that Skate was having its “Flick-It” trick control system rebuilt in order to make  gameplay more “fun and satisfying” for players.</p>



<p>“We want to make sure every trick feels fun and satisfying, while delivering the familiarity from past Skate games,” Full Circle said at the time. “On top of that, we’ve improved accuracy and control to make learning tricks easier.”</p>



<p>Are you excited to finally play Skate in Early Access next year? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

                <p>With the holiday season fast approaching, one of the best gifts you can get is a Nintendo Switch console. Several years after it was first released, the Switch is still a popular choice thanks to its hybrid console design and a killer library of exclusive games. Just like in previous years, Nintendo has introduced a new $350 bundle deal that pairs its best Switch console model <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-nintendo-best-selling-game-of-all-time/1100-6523297/">with its best-selling game of all time</a>.</p><p>This deluxe bundle will be available in October, and includes a Switch OLED model console, 12 months of Switch Online, and a digital download code for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>. This particular Switch is the best of the current lineup, as it combines a sharp OLED screen with some thoughtful quality-of-life upgrades when compared to the base model Switch. Storage capacity has been increased from 32GB to 64GB, it has improved speakers, and the built-in kickstand is much more stable in comparison.</p><p>This is <em>the </em>Switch to have if you're planning to play while on the go or in bed, but it does connect just fine to a TV or monitor through the included dock. There'll also be a $300 version of this bundle that includes the base model Switch, but the OLED version is well worth paying $50 extra for as the more-advanced screen makes a huge difference when you're playing in handheld mode.</p><p>As for the included game code, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been one of the best-performing Nintendo games of all time. First released on the Wii U and then later ported to Switch, the game has been improved upon for several years now and has a wealth of content to access. It's still a fantastic racing game and is especially brilliant for multiplayer sessions in either online or co-op modes.</p><p>The 12-month subscription to Switch Online also broadens your gaming options, as it lets you access multiplayer, lets you store your game save data online, various game discounts, and gives you a growing library of NES, Super NES, and Game Boy games. While details on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">Switch successor</a> are expected to be revealed by next year, there are still plenty of games coming to current Switch consoles throughout 2024 and 2025.</p>

They’ve mostly been the domain of 3D games with ultra-realistic rendering, letting players set up virtual cameras like high-end DSLRs, dial in exposure settings and focus like a pro. But we decided to add a photo mode to our 2D indie game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240060/A_Highland_Song/">A Highland Song</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Does adding a photo mode to a 2D game make any sense? Surprisingly, it can do, yes! But only if the player is given the tools to create something more than a simple screenshot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At inkle, I have a lot of responsibilities, but one of them is art director across our various projects. Ever since we made </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 Days</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I've aimed to make "every frame a painting," a concept popularized by the YouTube series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Every Frame a Painting</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Taylor Ramos and Tony Zhou. The idea is that you could take any frame of a movie and hang it on the wall because the cinematography is so beautifully executed. For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 Days</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, despite the game being predominantly text, I wanted every moment to look like a 1930s art deco travel poster. (The folks behind Monument Valley, a contemporary of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>80 Days</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, were thinking along similar lines. They loved the idea that any level from the game would look stunning as a work of art on your wall.)</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/a-highland-song-crafts-its-story-to-make-each-adventure-your-own" target="_self">A Highland Song crafts its story to make each adventure your own</a></p><p>A screenshot from 80 Days. Images via Inkle.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Photo Mode takes this a step further, inviting players to contribute their creative input to the framing and composition of a shot. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monument Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is intrinsically beautiful (and indeed, they have a built-in snapshot button), a photo mode puts the onus on the player to find and bring out moments of beauty. I’d argue that photo mode has been limited to 3D games, not because they’re more beautiful, but because the six degrees of freedom are key to providing that freedom of expression.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photography fascinates me because it communicates an idea without direct control over the subject. You can line up a photo to juxtapose contradictory objects or create a feeling of movement in a two-dimensional frame. You can tell a story using spatial relationships: a tiny ship on a wide ocean beneath a vast sky; the claustrophobic space between skyscrapers; or a hawk captured dead center, just before it closes its talons around a sparrow. Photography is about choosing your moment in time and space, and finding a point of view that forces the viewer to see what you want to show them, finding beauty even in the mundane. This is what we allow players to do in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Highland Song</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. You can’t control the mountains, where they are, or what ruins you near to—unless you move your feet.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/programming-to-120-beats-per-minute-a-highland-song-q-a" target="_self">Developing to 120 beats-per-minute: <em>A Highland Song</em> Q&amp;A</a></p><p>Stacked highland layers in Unity editor. Image via Inkle.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our secret with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Highland Song</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is that it’s not fully 2D. It’s built in 3D in Unity, using our own custom tools to stack tens of thousands of flat layers over miles on the Z axis. When you start the game, the mountains in the background are actually all the future levels in the game, extending away from you, leading to your goal: the lighthouse by the sea. The majority of those thousands of flat layers are traversable—this is the “if you see it, you can go there” of 2D games! Our protagonist Moira can hop between the individual layers, wherever they touch. (I’d call this 2.5D, except I’ve been told by Correct People On The Internet that 2.5D is strictly defined as fully 3D art with movement limited to a 2D plane. Shall we stake our claim over the term “2.4D” then?)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This extra dimension allows for a more rich ability to place the camera. While the player isn’t given full rotational control, the freedom to slide the camera on three separate axes does give them creative control over aligning and framing objects in the world. The camera can be also moved into positions that the in-game camera never naturally reaches, such as close-ups of Moira’s face.</span></p><p>A Highland Song concept art. Image via Paul Scott Canavan.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Although we didn’t plan to include a photo mode from day one, we always aimed for a painterly art style, making screenshots look like digital concept art from artists such as Craig Mullins. We worked with the brilliant Paul Scott Canavan to develop the overall art direction, building layered fragments of paintings at various scales—whether swooshes of grass, detailed rocks, or impressionistic textured paint splats. Rendering these fragments at a range of scales meant we could pull the camera in and out dramatically, maintaining the overall style and the visibility of individual brush strokes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At inkle, we love a good day-night cycle in our games, and this was especially important when representing the mountains of Scotland. A strong part of the Highlands’ beauty comes from the ever-shifting light and the notoriously changeable weather. So, a key feature of our custom graphics tech needed to be to cope with all the possible permutations of time of day, fog, cloud cover, and of course, rain and snow. For example, we have a custom fog algorithm that uses multiple color stops blended over camera distance, and this gradient is then interpolated over both time of day and weather type. It’s not physically based rendering; it’s fully artist-driven to allow us to handcraft the color palette across all conditions.</span></p><p>The color palette used in A Highland Song. Image via Inkle.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our photo mode reflects this and gives the player control over it: it lets players step outside the game’s narrative reality and play god with all the lighting and weather variables, allowing for a huge range of visual effects. We also allow players to make basic adjustments to exposure and tint in the final image.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All this control gives players significant creative freedom, far beyond taking a simple screenshot. One really fun feature we’re especially proud of is the ability to choose dialogue lines for Moira, our protagonist. The game remembers the past ten lines she’s spoken, allowing players to cycle through them. While you can’t put any words in her mouth, you can change what she says in a particular moment based on her past lines. This gives players a bit of creative control with interesting restrictions, maintaining the core voice of the character. For example, if she just said “Christ on a bike!” after falling a couple of minutes ago, you could reuse the line as a huge eagle swoops down towards her on a mountain-top, creating your own composition out of game-provided elements.</span></p><p>Image via Inkle.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most games apply these creative constraints to camera movement too, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Highland Song</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is no exception. We limit camera movement to keep Moira in frame and to prevent players from sneaking a peek at the game’s behind-the-scenes magic. Since we unload levels as the player progresses, we need to ensure the camera can’t move backward too far, avoiding any embarrassing exposures.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re really pleased we chose to incorporate a Photo Mode into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Highland Song</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (just a couple of weeks before release, no less!). It may not suit every 2D game, but with enough creative freedom, it can be hugely valuable. It provides an extra layer of enjoyment for fans, who then share their work on social media, bringing the game to new audiences.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Poker in New Super Mario Bros. Slots in Pokémon Red and Blue. Roulette in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-64-ds">Super Mario 64 DS</a>. The Witcher's Gwent. Knights of the Old Republic's Pazaak. 
</p>
<p>
If released this month, all of these could trigger an automatic 18+ age rating under Australia's tightened <a href="https://igea.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/INFRA6558-Australian-Classifications-%E2%80%93-Fact-sheet-%E2%80%93-industry_v6.pdf">rules</a> on "simulated gambling" in video games.
</p>
<p>
From 22nd September 2024, any video game with "gambling-like content" will come under strict new guidelines - even if such content is only a minor part of a broader video game, such as a casino mini-game tucked away within a sprawling RPG (thanks, <a href="https://www.vooks.net/aussie-government-announces-loot-box-and-gambling-content-classification-changes/">Vooks</a>).
</p>
<p>
The rules will apply, naturally, to video games that "solely consist of simulated gambling activities", but also to "video games that have interactive activities such as slot machine simulators, roulette wheels or other age-restricted gambling or betting services as part of a broader game".
</p>
<p>
Unlike lower age ratings such as Australia's "M" classification (not recommended for children under 15 years), the country's "R" 18+ category comes with a legal restriction on the sale or distribution of such games to minors. 
</p>
<p>
Existing video games won't need to be reclassified, though this will change if the game in question is re-released, or updated to add in new simulated gambling content (for example if a poker mini-game was added in a new expansion).
</p>
<p>
Australia's changes also extend to games with simple non-gambling related in-game purchases. Any game that lets you spend money on randomised rewards (or spend money to buy virtual currency for that same purpose) will now have the "M" category applied.
</p>
<p>This month's changes come after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/australian-mp-proposes-loot-box-regulation-bill">years-long push by Australia</a> to clamp down on games with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/australian-government-seeks-to-classify-all-games-with-loot-boxes-as-mature">loot boxes and gambling mechanics</a>.</p>
<p>Australia has frequently challenged video game content over the years, memorably taking robust stances on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/weed-isnt-usable-in-dayz-but-its-got-the-game-banned-in-australia">weed in DayZ</a> (prompting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-ban-in-australia-for-weed-dayzs-being-changed-worldwide">changes to the game worldwide</a>), <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rimworld-gets-a-chance-to-reverse-its-australian-ban">drug-fuelled cannibalism in RimWorld 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cut-version-of-saints-row-4-finally-granted-australian-release">"alien drugs" and an anal probe in Saints Row 4</a>. Several games have had to appeal initial ratings to release even under Australia's 18+ rating, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-will-release-in-australia-following-successful-appeal">We Happy Few</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-no-longer-in-australian-classification-board-sin-bin">Disco Elysium</a>. The creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> 2, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hotline-miami-2-banned-in-australia">told fans to instead simply pirate</a> their banned game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In her attempts to regain her magical abilities, Agatha creates her own coven of witches, composed of actors like Patti Lupone, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp. During the red carpet premiere of <em>Agatha All Along</em>, we learned that there may be some <em>extracurricular</em> coven activities going on—namely, a queer romance. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>During the premiere, <em>Variety</em> red carpet correspondent Marc Malkin told Plaza he’d heard that <em>Agatha All Along</em> was the “gayest Marvel project yet.”</p><p>“It better be, because that’s what I signed up for,” Plaza quipped after sassily rolling her neck.<br></p><p>In the show, Plaza plays a green witch (who are typically herbalists and healers) named Rio Vidal, who has quite the history with Agatha. It’s clear from the teaser trailer that there’s some magic between the two, and Malkin describes their chemistry as “<em>Law And Order</em> meets <em>Basic Instinct</em> meets <em>Bound</em>.” “You’re speaking my language,” Plaza responded. “All of that, yes. More, more, more.” Malkin then asks if the show gets gayer and gayer as it goes on, to which Plaza replies with, “Yes, darling, but I can’t tell you how. I can’t tell you anything. But yes, it will be a gay explosion.”<br></p><p>Plaza is notoriously playful in interviews, so it’s possible she’s exaggerating the series’ queerness—but I’m hoping she’s not! Witches have long been a persecuted people cast out from society for their otherness (or femmes wrongfully accused of witchcraft for daring to buck societal norms), so there has always been a clear cultural overlap between conjurers and the queer community. Modern practicing witches see their craft as a reclamation of power, something that the LGBTQIA+ can appreciate.</p><p>Plus, Plaza and Hahn are both hilarious, hot, talented women—why not give us a little lesbian love affair between two of the funniest contemporary actors? I’m incredibly here for it. </p><p><em>Agatha All Along</em>’s first two episodes premiere<em> </em>on Disney+ on September 18 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. Then the series will release one episode per week until Halloween week, when the final two will drop back-to-back. It’s spooky season, bitches. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps I will find out for myself now that the cinematic horror sequel is on sale on the PlayStation Store. The sequel’s price has been slashed down to $38.99 from its usual $59.99.

            <p>4J Studios - the award-winning developer best known for bringing Mojang's Minecraft to consoles - has shared  details on its next game: Reforj.</p>
<p>Reforj is described as a creative survival sandbox game, and one the studio will develop with a community-focused approach. But no, Reforj is not Minecraft 2. </p>
<p>"Reclaim the future. Rewrite the past. Reforj the world," reads the Reforj social media account.

<p>"The fact this is coming from 4J means the comparisons to Minecraft are unavoidable," said Minecraft YouTuber Joseph Garrett, aka Stampy, in an interview with Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Garrett joined 4J earlier this year, working with the developer to bring Reforj to life.</p>
<p>"We've already had articles about 4J making Minecraft 2. But that's not what we're trying to do," Garrett continued. "Despite all of us being huge fans of Minecraft, we don't need to make another one. It already exists."</p>
<p>4J founder and chairman Chris van der Kuyl added Reforj will offer players a "a very different gameplay experience" to Minecraft.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean they will still play the games they play and love every day," he said. "They will. That's something we revel in. We still have a marketplace in Minecraft. This is just something brand new for people who love the genre, and we don't think they've had anything new for quite a long time."</p>

<p>Reforj is being developed in Elements Engine, 4J's own "proprietary voxel sandbox engine". The team debuted the engine on YouTube earlier this year, adding it will "harness the incredible power of the newest generation of consoles and graphics cards" (see video above).</p>
<p>"We started on the Elements Engine about five years ago," said van der Kuyl. "The obvious question is that Unity and Unreal have taken over the market, so why do this? Well, we love creative sandbox gaming. And we realised that nobody had really thought about features that you'd want to be accelerated by next gen that would benefit sandbox gaming. Of course we want nice graphics and shiny water. But there were opportunities around using GPU acceleration for something different.</p>
<p>"Generally when you get these block building games, or voxel-based games, they start to get performance restrictive quite early. So we asked ourselves, could we build an engine that gave you persistent 60-frames-per-second in this kind-of game. It may be a geeky thing to say, but for a player it would transform their experience."</p>

</figure>
<p>Garrett added the engine's focus on the latest hardware is "not just about [4J] looking at ray-tracing" and other visual boosts.</p>
<p>"It's about... the world's saves being really efficient. It is this big sandbox world, but it doesn't save the world, it just saves the changes you made to the world, so it means that the world saves are really small and can load really efficiently," he said.</p>
<p>"We have gateways in the world where you can travel to other worlds and create new ones, and it all links seamlessly. It wouldn't be possible if you're loading data off a harddrive. [This engine] is not just adding bells and whistles to the game, it is about core design function and mechanism that is made possible by having Xbox Series S as the baseline."</p>
<p>There currently isn't a release date for Reforj, with the game still in the pre-alpha stage of development. You can stay up to date with the team's progress in the meantime via <a href="https://x.com/ReforjGame">social media</a>.</p>

			<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: when it comes to remakes and remasters, there is no better company out there doing them than Capcom. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is just another example of this, being one of the most enjoyable games I’ve played this year, and it’s technically an 18-year-old game!</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster –&nbsp;What's new and improved for this 2024 remake?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQVhYa4R4aM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back in the day, Dead Rising was one of those games that wanted to show off. It was coming out within the first year of the Xbox 360 generation and was keen to explore all the possibilities this gave them, a masterclass for the sheer number of zombies on scree, the innovative gameplay and wacky theatrics.&nbsp;It had it all.</p>


<p>With Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Capcom has done a marvellous job bringing the game into 2024, going so far beyond the un-deluxe remaster from 2016. The graphics have had a complete overhaul, reimagining some parts of what the shopping mall can be and look like, adding so much detail to the world, and also making characters feel much more expressive in their interactions – they’re all fully voiced now as well. In a game where the characters are quite zany, it really helps convey the madness of it all. Of course, this also helps with all the blood and gore on offer, which is always nice.</p>


<p>They’ve also nixed some of the original problematic content that was always creepy, but can’t be played for laughs by today’s standards. One particular mission used to see you take a photo for Kent with a high Erotica rating. Well Erotica photos no longer exist, because running around snapping pictures of cleavage in a video game is just a little weird. Now, you need to take an Outtake style photo instead, which is much better, and means I can also face my family.</p>
<p>All the changes made to the game have been for the better. From little things such as weapon durability now being displayed under each weapon so you can see when it’s going to break, to a rejig and refinement of the controller layout, and the fact that some missions have had a lot of the monotony taken out of them. Even some of the trophies have been made a little easier to swallow – trying to kill 53,000 zombies in one run now tracks across multiple playthroughs, so if you get close and just miss out, you haven’t wasted two to three hours of your life. I like a game that respects my time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, business is the same as usual. You take on the role of Frank West, a photojournalist who has covered wars, you know. Frank gets a tip that something big is going down in the town of Willamette, so hires himself a chopper and pilot and goes to take a look. He ends up getting stranded in a shopping mall and proceeds to spend the next 72 hours trying to find the truth and stay alive.</p>

<p>You can tackle that 72 hour span in a bunch of different ways.&nbsp;If you want to get the story done, you’re encouraged to follow the main scoops as and when they appear, adhering to the deadline and being in the right place at the right time. The real fun comes from going off the beaten path, exploring all that Willamette has to offer, and trying to reach and help survivors who need rescuing. Sometimes they might be stuck behind barricades, forcing you to break them down and lead them to the safety of the security room.</p>
<p>The AI seemed ok at first, but they can still be a little wonky from time to time, getting themselves stuck or refusing to move when called. It only happened a handful of times and didn’t really affect the overall experience.</p>
<p>Other times, survivors might be held hostage by Psychopaths – shopping mall workers or visitors that have lost the plot a little and gone on a murderous rampage. If there’s one thing I’m glad Capcom didn’t change, it’s these bosses. They are completely over the top and I love them. An early boss, Adam the Clown, is probably my favourite. He’s the perfect example of just how deranged (and unreasonable) these bosses can be, and offing him opens up an opportunity or two, including the ability to pick up his mini chainsaws, which I held onto for the majority of the game.</p>
<p>It was this combat that helped me appreciate how much the controls have also been tightened up. Not that original was terrible, and you can still revert to classic controls, but having the ability to move while aiming is a big plus, and&nbsp;dodging, ducking, diving, and using a barrage of wrestling moves all feel pretty tight.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed in terms of what Frank unlocks as he levels up, making him a bad ass when you find yourself in a situation without a weapon. There’s no better feeling than running up behind a zombie and using a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5FCkiz1N8">Release German Suplex</a> to throw it into another bunch of zombies. It’s so much fun!</p>
<p>Of course you’ll mainly be scouring the shops looking for all kinds of different weapons to use, and there’s a lot of choice. From using a stack of CDs from the music store, to beating zombies over the head with mannequins, the sky’s the limit when it comes to dispatching zombies, with a <em>very</em> large pool of fun and wacky items to try. It’s one of the major appeals in Dead Rising.</p>

<p>Another way to add to this is making Frank wear a bunch of different clothing. In the very stores you explore, there’s also a massive selection of things to try on and make Frank look cool as hell or a bit silly. Whatever your preference really. Back in the security room, you can even change into anything you’ve found so far on your journey, as well as some other full blown costumes available as DLC. These come as a part of the digital deluxe version of the game and it’s not entirely clear yet whether they will be sold separately, but they are pretty cool and have some great nods to other Capcom licences. I’m currently doing a run as Nemesis from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/30/resident-evil-3-review/">Resident Evil 3</a> and it’s funny watching Frank interact with people.</p>
<p>If you’re after an even bigger challenge, Infinity mode is also back, which puts you on a strict time limit while you fight for your life in the mall, with randomly spawning enemies and psychopaths, all while trying to fend off zombies and eat food to replenish your rapidly decreasing health. It’s a really fun and challenging mode.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		For those that didn’t experience Dead Rising back in the day, you are in for a treat. While not much has changed on the surface, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster goes so far beyond just giving the game a fresh lick of paint, tightening up gameplay, reimagining parts of the world, but still making for a damn fine and fun game to play.&nbsp;Go get ‘em Frank, your time is not done!	</p></div>
