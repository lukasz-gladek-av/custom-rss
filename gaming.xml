		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/bohemia-interactive">Bohemia Interactive</a> has launched <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dayz">DayZ</a> update 1.25 for PC players, adding a much-requested feature to the popular zombie survival shooter. Not only that, the Czech studio has some great news for those who have been waiting to pull the trigger on its Livonia map DLC.</p>
<p><iframe title="DayZ 1.25 Update Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPqSkrb88CQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The focus of DayZ update 1.25 is the game’s audio, with a number of welcome changes. First, there’s the new music (which can also be accessed outside of DayZ via a Steam playlist:</p>
<p>“We worked with Czech composer Dikolson to create a subtle and ambient background [music] that increases your immersion as you walk through different areas of the game at various times of the day. There’s approximately 70 minutes of music available at the moment, with more to come in the future.”</p>
<p>Not only that, the developers have been busy reworking the audio for a number of weapons including shotguns, the crossbow, and the grenade launcher. The aim is to create a more immersive soundscape where players can track each other’s actions and whereabouts more keenly through in-game sound effects.</p>

<p>And then there’s the aforementioned DLC news. Livonia, DayZ’s first major premium expansion, will be made free for everyone who currently owns a copy of the base game. Going forward, every purchase of DayZ will also include Livonia, albeit at a slightly higher price tag.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, there’s more exciting DayZ DLC news. The recently announced Frostline will add an all-new battleground, transporting survivors to the wintery climate of Sakhal. There’s more to Frostline than a simple change of scenery however, with the expansion promising new mechanics – here’s a quick overview:</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>New Terrain:</strong><br>
Explore a rugged and forgotten volcanic archipelago in the Far East, where time stands still.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>Winter landscape:</strong><br>
An authentic recreation of a late winter environment. From icy lakes to snow-covered forests and mountains, Sakhal offers picturesque scenery everywhere you go.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>Harsher survival:</strong><br>
Sakhal poses by far the biggest danger out of any other environment you may have visited. Prepare for the cold as you manage warmth, hunt for food, and fend off the dangers lurking in the snow.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>Environmental Hazards:</strong><br>
Discover the hazards of living near volcanic areas.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>Richer wilderness:</strong><br>
Encounter new animals adapted to the chilly climate, adding to your hunting challenges and opportunities.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>New gameplay mechanics:</strong><br>
New diseases and an updated fishing mechanic are among many changes to keep you on your toes.</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;<strong>Winter Cosmetics:</strong><br>
Dress for the season with winter-themed cosmetics.</p>

<p>With updates and DLC arriving later on console versions, PlayStation and Xbox players will need to wait a little longer to get DayZ update 1.25 though hopefully it isn’t too far behind!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166413/microsoft-windows-auto-super-resolution-sr-qualcomm-npu-dlss-fsr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161936/windows-on-arm-ready-software-linaro-microsoft-qualcomm">launch a game on a Snapdragon on a Windows laptop</a>, you might get an AI frame rate boost from Microsoft’s mysterious <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24070426/microsoft-windows-11-dlss-ai-super-resolution-feature">Auto Super Resolution</a> (Auto SR) feature. But while Microsoft hasn’t fully explained how the feature works, <em>The Verge</em> can now confirm it’s <em>not </em>Qualcomm technology, <em>not</em> exclusive to Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X chips, and <em>not</em> exclusive to specific games, either.</p><p>You’d be forgiven for thinking otherwise! Microsoft’s <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/automatic-super-resolution-5d6d95fa-cc02-4673-b62c-2c50f06385aa">new Automatic Super Resolution help page</a> bluntly states that a Snapdragon X chip is required — see screenshot — and that all of its processing “occurs on-device using the integrated GPU and Neural Processing Unit.” </p><p>But Qualcomm now tells us that Super Resolution is Microsoft’s <em>own</em> feature — it’s not <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2023/04/introducing-snapdragon-game-super-resolution">Qualcomm Snapdragon Game Super Resolution</a> by another name — and it’s not technically exclusive to Qualcomm chips, either. </p><p>“The ‘exclusive’ language is really about what is available today so that will no longer apply if another technology becomes available that can meet Microsoft’s performance threshold,” Qualcomm spokesperson Macey Davis tells me. “Since Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) integrates with Windows on a Copilot+ PC,&nbsp;Qualcomm&nbsp;is the only one that can exclusively run it today.”</p><p>And while Microsoft’s Copilot Plus PCs FAQ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23905618">stated that it was initially exclusive to specific games</a>, the company’s support page <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/automatic-super-resolution-5d6d95fa-cc02-4673-b62c-2c50f06385aa#:~:text=Turn%20on%20Auto%20SR%20for%20additional%20games">clearly shows</a> you’ll be able to turn it on for many other DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 titles — with a warning that “Using Auto SR with this app might cause unexpected results.”</p><p>That said, it’s not clear which rival chips might be able to take advantage. AMD and Intel, each of which are expected to have their own Copilot Plus PCs this fall with similarly speedy NPUs inside, weren’t able to tell me anything about Auto Super Resolution. Both deferred to Microsoft — and Microsoft’s page currently suggests Auto SR is just for games running as a native Arm app or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24107331/qualcomm-gdc-2024-snapdragon-on-windows-games">via Arm emulation</a>. Intel and AMD produce x86 chips that play x86 titles, not Arm ones. </p><div><p>(<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24161095/intel-ai-lunar-lake-cpu-release">Intel’s upcoming “Lunar Lake”</a> should have an NPU capable of performing 40-45 trillion floating point operations per second, or TOPS; <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-8050-strix-point-apus-xdna-2-npu-coming-2024-3x-ai-performance/">AMD’s “Strix Point”</a> should be similar after a reported tripling of AMD’s AI circuitry. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24160486/microsoft-copilot-plus-ai-arm-chips-pc-surface-event">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said last week</a> that both Intel and AMD will have laptops that support the new Windows AI features.)</p></div><p>Microsoft has yet to answer my questions, but here are a couple other burning questions I’ve asked the company about:</p><div><ul><li>Is Microsoft’s Auto SR truly a new competitor to Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS, and if so, why? Or is it a derivative of those technologies?</li><li>Will Auto SR work with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086443/microsoft-directsr-super-resolution-api">Microsoft’s upcoming DirectSR</a>, the so-called “missing link” that lets developers target all of those competing upscaling technologies at once?</li></ul></div><p>Even if Auto Super Resolution takes a while to officially come to other chips, though, I suspect tinkerers will figure it out before long. Someone already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/27/24165773/someone-got-recall-working-on-a-non-copilot-pc">got the new Recall feature working on a non-Copilot PC</a>, and I know some gamers now swear by <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F993090%2FLossless_Scaling%2F">a Steam app called Lossless Scaling</a>, which can bring fancy upscaling and even frame generation to games where the developers haven’t rolled it out themselves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Tango Gameworks, the recently shutdown Zenimax subsidiary, had at least one unannounced game in the works prior to its closure.</p>
<p>At least, that's what the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tsuyoshi-okugawa-13127135/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn resume</a> of a former programmer mentions (<a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1795393325023060194" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> 'Timur222' on X). The programmer's experience mentions work as a lead programmer in 2023-2024 on an announced title as well as a role as a graphics programmer in 2024 on an unannounced title. Whether these are two different games isn't clear, but it might be possible that the programmer merely took another role at Tango. As such, it might be that we're looking at a single "unannounced" game. We've included a screenshot of the programmer's experience, as included on his resume, below (in case it gets pulled):</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/tango-gameworks.png"></a></figure>

<p>No further details about this "unannounced title" have been shared, but we do know that Tango Gameworks was working on a sequel to 2022's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostwire-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghostwire Tokyo</a> - at least, the Microsoft/FTC court documents suggested as much. This sequel was supposed to be released later this year.</p>
<p>The closure of Tango Gameworks - the Japanese studio of industry legend Shinji Mikami - was announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier this month</a>. The studio was known for various popular titles, including the Evil Within games, the above-mentioned Ghostwire Tokyo, and the more recent hit title Hi-Fi Rush. Following this terrible news, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-will-cut-more-jobs-arkane-tango-pitching-new-projects-before-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported that Xbox is planning more layoffs</a>.&nbsp; When asked about the closure of Tango and Arkane Austin, X<a href="https://wccftech.com/xboxs-sarah-bond-tango-gameworks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">box President Sarah Bond provided an answer</a> that didn't resonate that well among the community.</p>
<p>"There's no one size fits all to it for us [Xbox Game Studios e.g. Microsoft]. And so we look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with making decisions and trade-offs like that. But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the surfaces, and ensuring that we're setting ourselves up to deliver on those promises."</p>

  <p id="YlR0Dr">We’ll never be as cool as Zagreus, the edgy prince of the underworld and star of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/9/24/21453043/hades-review-switch-windows-early-access-supergiant-roguelite-impressions">Supergiant Games’ <em>Hades</em></a>. But, with this <a href="https://us.super-groupies.com/blogs/feature/hades-01-watch-jacket-bag-new-collaboration-items?utm_source=twi_us&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=20240527hades">new collection of merch from SuperGroupies</a>, we can sure as hell try. The recently announced lineup of premium fashion accessories includes a jacket, watch, and backpack all inspired by the Supergiant roguelike.</p>
<p id="qrT7Ek">While this lineup doesn’t launch until January, if you’d like to reserve any of these sick fits for yourself, you can place a pre-order through SuperGroupies until June 16. Each piece is full of fun details and subtle nods to the franchise, and would make a fine addition to any royal wardrobe, provided you can afford them.</p>
<hr id="KR0Y1w">
<p id="YU5Oem">The <em>Hades</em> bomber jacket features an asymmetrical, zip-up design with embroidered Cerberus skulls on the left shoulder, emulating Zagreus’ armor, in addition to a red and green trim on the interior liner that resembles his eyes.</p>

<p id="uGwEFs">The official <em>Hades</em> watch is a timepiece worthy of Chronos himself. In addition to the face ringed with Roman (er, Greek) numerals, the movement features subdials marking the days of the week and the calendar month. Along the face, you’ll find a crimson blood pattern accompanying Zagreus’ Cerberus crest, sitting proudly at the 3 o’clock mark. On the reverse side of the watch you’ll find a plate engraved with all of the Olympian Sigils. </p>

<p id="zsY01Y">For almost 40 years, <em>Year One</em> has been the definitive origin story for Batman, serving as a grimy, grounded foundation for the likes of Tim Burton, Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder, and Matt Reeves, not to mention the makers of the Arkham games, <em>Gotham</em> the TV series, and, thanks to <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em>, the entire DC Animated Universe of the ’90s and ’00s. </p>
<p id="joi9Io">And IDW’s <em>Artist’s Edition</em>, produced in partnership with DC Comics and Penguin Random House, promises to shed light on the making of the most influential Batman comic ever drawn, by reproducing David Mazzucchelli’s original page art in its original 14-by-21-inch size. </p>

<p id="J1qgQ4">You’ve almost certainly heard of <em>Year One</em>’s writer, comic book titan Frank Miller, creator of <em>Sin City</em>, <em>300</em>, and <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>. Mazzucchelli, despite co-authoring the first stop in modern Batman canon, is less of a household name — though you might be familiar with his stylistically inventive, Eisner-winning 2009 graphic novel <em>Asterios Polyp</em>. </p>
<p id="epzxLJ">Miller was (and still is) best known for drawing his own stories when it came time to put <em>Year One</em> into production, but coming off of <em>The Dark Knight Returns</em>, he was apparently (reasonably) burned out on writing <em>and</em> drawing another novel-length story. Tapping the equally up-and-coming Mazzucchelli, who’d worked with Miller on <em>Daredevil</em>, is part of what made <em>Year One</em> a triumph not repeated since. </p>
<p id="MTZ49O">That’s a testament to Mazzucchelli’s talent, but also to his career choices. <em>Year One</em> was very nearly his last work in superhero comics, with his path quickly thereafter diverging so strongly into independent comics and academia that a friend of mine who had Professor Mazzucchelli’s class at the School of Visual Arts flatly refused to believe that we could have been talking about the same guy. The superhero world is extraordinarily lucky to have had him. </p>

<p id="M2xZsP">Mazzucchelli’s skill is on immediate display in the <em>Year One Artist’s Edition</em> pages that IDW has shared so far, including the above exclusive preview. Mazzucchelli shared Miller’s early talent for composition, character design, silhouette, deceptively casual linework, and striking visuals — making them great partners. But while Miller’s artistic hallmarks are in his stylization, Mazzucchelli’s <em>Year One </em>work turned toward realism. </p>
<p id="w4aawb">Mazzucchelli drew his Bruce Wayne after Gregory Peck, and his Selina Kyle has the unmistakable likeness of Grace Jones. His Gotham is ripped from the visuals of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood">New Hollywood crime cinema</a>, built from smears of light and dirt and wrinkles on walls and faces and clothing. And it’s gifted the weight of that realism to decades of Batman stories that came after. </p>
<p id="5ORK2R">IDW’s pages (featuring the lettering work of the legendary Todd Klein) also preserve the parts of the comic-making process that are hidden in the final art, like visible ink strokes, pasted-in date captions, easel tape, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-photo_blue">non-photo blue pencil</a>. The numberings on these pages may even hint at <em>Batman: Year One</em>’s earliest form — not as issues #404-407 of the comic series <em>Batman</em>, but as the single, contiguous graphic novel Miller originally pitched. </p>
<p id="1QEHT1"><em>David Mazzucchelli’s Batman: Year One Artist’s Edition</em> features Mazzucchelli’s layouts for the entirety of <em>Batman: Year One</em> at their original size (mostly), for a whopping 144 page, 14.5-by-21-inch hardcover that goes a long way to explaining the $150 price tag. There’s also a new introduction to the book by Mazzucchelli himself, and the whole look of the thing was designed by Chip Kidd. </p>
<p id="zDBE6G">If you need a present for a Batman fan this year, you could do a lot worse than the <em>Batman: Year One Artist’s Edition</em> — that is, if they don’t get it for themselves in the meantime. Check out three more original Mazzucchelli pages, the cover of <em>Batman</em> #407, and promotional art below: </p>

The company is also taking a whopping $100 of the price of PlayStation VR2, which is normally $550. The version bundled with <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain </em>is also available as part of the same deal. </p><p>The discounts come as Sony races to move more hardware.

PS VR2, on the other hand, appears to be all but dead in the water. Despite well-designed tech, the high price and lack of must-have games seems to have wiped out any momentum it had. Sony has never said how many of the new VR headsets it’s sold, and according to a report earlier this year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-headsets-production-sales-halt-sony-1851344240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-headsets-production-sales-halt-sony-1851344240">it’s already halted production</a></span> due to backed up inventory. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Activision is seemingly set to raise the player count in Call of Duty: Warzone. A tweet from developer Raven Software suggests that lobbies in the free-to-play battle royale game are growing from 100 to 120 with the upcoming Season 4 launch on May 29.</p><p>As fans no doubt recall, Warzone originally had 150-player lobbies before this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-season-5-patch-notes-for-mw2-and-warzone-include-movement-buffs-and-al-mazrah-br-changes/1100-6516482/" data-ref-id="1100-6516482">reduced to 100 in 2023.</a> At the time, Activision said it made this change because matches were feeling "too chaotic" with 150 players. Reducing the player count at the time also helped with matchmaking times, Activision said. Since then, though, players have been calling for Activision to increase the player count, and now it's happening. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">Warzone Mobile</a> also has 120-player lobbies.</p><p>Season 4 for Modern Warfare III and Warzone debuts May 29, ushering new maps, operators, and weapons, along with a new battle pass and BlackCell DLC bundle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/sakamoto-days-first-official-teaser-shows-why-this-could-be-the-next-big-anime-hit/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sakamoto-days-first-official-teaser-shows-why-this-could-be-the-next-big-anime-hit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="343" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After dominating popularity rankings, and consistently being one of the best financially performing Shonen Jump manga, <em>Sakamoto Days</em> is getting an anime adaptation. Re-creating the visually stunning action sequences from the <em>Sakamoto Days</em> manga is no easy task, but the first anime adaptation trailer proves we are in for an absolute treat. </p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">Since 2020, Yuto Suzuki has written and illustrated <em>Sakamoto Days</em> in Weekly Shonen Jump. The manga follows the story of a legendary retired hitman, Taro Sakamoto, who attempts to settle down as a family man but is dragged back into his former life to protect his loved ones.</p> <p data-characters="521" data-current-count="795" data-injectable="true">TMS Entertainment shared the first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkd1y3z0w2Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser trailer</a> for <em>Sakamoto Days</em> and confirmed that the anime will air in January 2025. TMS Entertainment feels like the perfect studio to bring this manga to life; the studio has an extensive background working on action shows, from working on iconic spy anime series <em>Lupin The 3rd</em> in the ’70s to modern anime adaptations like<em> Dr. Stone</em>, <em>MEGALOBOX</em>, and <em>Undead Unluck</em>. If the quality of<em> Sakamoto Days </em>is anywhere close to that list of gems, this anime adaptation is in good hands.</p>
 <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="166" data-injectable="false"><em>Bartender </em>director Masaki Watanabe will sit in the director’s chair, while Taku Kishimoto takes on Series Composition and Yo Moriyama heads up Character Design.</p> <figure data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="SAKAMOTO DAYS | Official Teaser Trailer | English Sub" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkd1y3z0w2Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">In addition, TMS confirmed that Taro Sakamoto will be&nbsp;voiced by veteran voice actor Tomokazu Sugita, who is most known for roles as Sakata Gintoki in <em>Gintama</em>, Joesph Joestar in <em>Jo’Jo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>, and Escanor in <em>Seven Deadly Sins</em>. With a proven ability to expertly mix action and comedy as Joesph Joestar or Sakata Gintoki, Sugita is an ideal choice for Sakamoto. </p> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">The trailer only gives fans a brief glimpse at the action scenes, but it’s already easy to tell that an immense amount of attention to detail was put into these set pieces. The first fight we see from Sakamoto’s past features impressive lighting and various shot angles. </p>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="true">Meanwhile, the few snippets we get to see of the supporting cast also boast remarkable visual effects that jump off the screen, as Sakamoto sends his enemies into the ground. If TMS Entertainment doesn’t shy away from some of the more intense scenes and puts everything into the large-scale destruction, this adaptation could reach the fight choreography heights of a <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> or <em>Demon Slayer</em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">We won’t know what other anime series’ <em>Sakamoto Days</em> will be up against in the winter season of 2025, but this show has everything it needs to be a sensation based on how strong the manga has been from the start to its last few arcs. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8bitdo-appeals-to-the-salarymen-with-the-ibm-edition-of-its-keyboard.883230/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/8bitdo-appeals-to-the-salarymen-with-the-ibm-edition-of-its-keyboard/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=8bitdo-appeals-to-the-salarymen-with-the-ibm-edition-of-its-keyboard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="278" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">8BitDo has quietly announced that the next version of their Retro Mechanical Keyboard is themed after the PC that accidentally changed the market. The Retro Mechanical Keyboard – <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-mechanical-keyboard-m/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M Edition</a> is styled after the ones that came with the ubiquitous IBM line of early computers.</p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Previously, we had fun color schemes like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/8bitdos-mechanical-retro-keyboard-is-the-keyboard-i-want-to-be-buried-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NES, Famicom</a>, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/8bitdos-new-keyboard-goes-beige-with-a-commodore-64-aesthetic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Commodore 64</a>. The first PC that I ever had consistent access to was my aunt’s IBM, which I mostly used to play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-secret-agent-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secret Agent</a>, Duke Nukem</em>, and <em>SimFarm</em>. Even with that association, I have very little nostalgia for the machines.</p> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">As its name implies, the color-scheme is based on IBM’s Model M keyboard which replaced the original Model F. Rather than being membrane, dome switch, or mechanical, IBM’s keyboards instead used a design called “buckling spring” for input, which is exactly as it sounds. This style of keyboard is fondly remembered for the dull click of its keys.</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">Of course, 8BitDo’s Retro Mechanical Keyboard – M Edition still uses mechanical switches like their previous versions. They maintain the video game stylings, as well, which is a bit strange. There are still the two big Super Buttons and the programmable B and A “Supper Buttons” (that’s really what they call them.) It’s not that you couldn’t use a Model M for gaming, but I associate them more with accountants.</p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">They gave me a Famicom edition back when the line first released, and I’m still typing on it today. Right now. During one particular week where I kept spilling drinks on it, I had to pull the keys to get all the liquid out of it, but it still works. Good as new. I’ll keep it forever if I can.</p> <figure data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via 8BitDo</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-also-they-re-releasing-a-numpad" data-injectable="false">Also, they’re releasing a numpad</h2> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">My biggest complaint about the Retro Mechanical keyboard was the fact that it omits a numpad. That complaint is being addressed, as 8BitDo has also announced that they have <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/retro-18-mechanical-numpad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">matching numpads/calculators</a> coming for each of the keyboard styles.</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">These are detached numpads, so you don’t need to own one of the keyboards to use one. They can be connected to your PC, or they can be used on their own as a calculator. USB ports are kind of a scarce commodity on my computer currently, but I may need to find a way for one of these.</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false">Both the 8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard – M Edition and 18 Mechanical Numpad are arriving on July 15, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/disney-speedstorm-muppets-kermit-event-unlock/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/gameloft">Gameloft</a> has revealed a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/disney-speedstorm">Disney Speedstorm</a> Muppets time limited event, which introduces Kermit the Frog as a playable character.</p>
<p>As with any new racer, in order to unlock Kermit you will need to earn 10 character-specific tokens. These can found in premium loot boxes or earned by completing challenges in the time limited Kermit event races.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Speedstorm - Kermit The Frog Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-fD1mC4zZ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s an overview of Kermit’s unique skills:</p>
<p>“This Speedster Class racer is all about getting ahead of the competition and he’s bringing a musical touch to his race towards victory with his Unique Skill – Banjo Connection!</p>

<p>Banjo Connection’s normal activation – Kermit the Frog plays an energizing melody on his banjo, generating boost fuel. If another racer gets close to Kermit the Frog, they get a small speed boost while Kermit the Frog gains a huge speed boost.</p>
<p>Banjo Connection’s charged activation – Kermit the Frog plays a calming melody on his banjo, rendering him invulnerable for a short amount of time. If an opponent gets too close to him during this time, they’ll have their top speed reduced while Kermit the Frog gains increased boost fuel generation.”</p>
<p>Disney Speedstorm originally launched in 2023 and received a slew of seasonal updates, adding various Disney characters and circuits. The latest season – Sugar Rush – is currently live with a spread of new Wreck-It-Ralph content. In our recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/10/disney-speedstorm-review-2024-edition/">Disney Speedstorm review</a>, we scored it a 7/10, saying that:</p>
<p>“Despite being drenched in familiar IP, Disney Speedstorm isn’t the kind of idle kart racing shovelware older gamers grew up with. There’s a clear reverence for the characters it features and their fantastical worlds, evidenced by the passion in Speedstorm’s art direction and soundscape. When coupled with Gameloft’s previous racing hits, the result is something that caters for casual gamers and genre die-hards alike. Just beware that whilethis virtual Disneyland-on-wheels is free, some of its main attractions come at a cost, whether spending time grinding away in queues to meet your favourite Disney mascots, or paying cash for that VIP fast-track.”</p>
<p>You can download the game for free on PC, mobile, and consoles (except Nintendo Switch) complete with crossplay.</p>

I have played many a creepy throwback game that takes inspiration from the ever inadequately named "Golden" (Grimy and Diseased? Cadaverous, perhaps) Age of survival horror on PS1, but it's rare you play one that invokes the N64, and even less often that you stumble on something horror-adjacent that riffs on Star Fox 64. Ah, Star Fox! The natural companion piece for, say, Eternal Darkness or The Suffering. In fairness, I did always find those Pez dispenser dialogue animations pretty eerie.
</p>

<p>
The work of Norwegian dev Agelvik, Death in Abyss (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076520/Death_In_Abyss/">Steam link</a>) is a third-person "submarine action game" in which you explore a noxious ocean full of angry, bioluminescent brains and what I hope are ravenous tadpoles, though other possibilities occur. You're here to shoot everything in cold blood, of course, but there's room for some whimsy along the way in the shape of your craft's movement. Put it in reverse, and it does a cute little backstroke. Seriously, look at this trailer. I can't get enough of it. If I am ever rich and stupid enough to buy a submarine, I want one that moves like this.

<p>
Death In Abyss also takes inspiration from the slaughterous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-daggers">Devil Daggers</a> and the anime Made In Abyss, which I haven't seen but understand to be pretty unpleasant, and possibly Problematic. Agelvik's <a href="https://linktr.ee/agelvik">past works</a> include Gun Devil, God Damn The Garden, Apple Slash and Lulu's Temple, all of which channel a particular blend of upbeat and macabre I find very appealing.
</p>
<p>
There's a Death In Abyss demo coming in July, all going to plan. If this is your cup of mutant herring gizzards, the recently launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supernatural-spaceship-shooter-underspace-show-admirable-ambition-in-its-next-fest-demo?preview_key=yUFeWmh34zOTiUSUnzIi-I71Gu2uDT4v&amp;preview_device=desktop">Underspace</a> might also grab you. It's similarly abundant in oceanic monstrosities, though it's a sprawling Freelancer-like rather than a level-based action experience, and doesn't, as far as I know, feature any backstroke-capable spacecraft.

And though the Starforge Systems' limited-edition Smite 2 pre-built isn't bleeding edge at its asking price of $2500, it's a potent machine with a lot of character that ensures it's worth checking out--especially for hardcore fans of the MOBA looking to add some Smite flair to their battlestation.</p><p>You can see the full Smite 2 limited-edition PC stats for yourself below:</p><ul><li>Intel Core i5-13600KF</li><li>GeForce RTX 4070 Super 12GB</li><li>Deepcool LS720 360mm AIO Liquid Cooler</li><li>Teamgroup Delta RGB 32GB DDR5 6000 CL38 (2x16GB)</li><li>MSI Pro Z790-P Wifi</li><li>2TB Teamgroup Z44A7 PCIe 4.0 NVME</li><li>MSI MAG A850GL PCIe 5</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4309317-20240525_115529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309317" data-ratio="0.66706161137441" data-width="3376" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4309317-20240525_115529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309317"></a><figcaption>Killer RGB and above-average build quality are stars here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4309317-20240525_115529.jpg"></figure><p>Starforge Systems sent us a unit to try out, and we're mostly impressed with what it has to offer. The upper mid-range specs will handle just about anything the average gamer throws at it with high settings at 1440p--with some room to spare--and even 4K is perfectly doable for those willing to sacrifice some frames in the pursuit of eye candy. Plenty of fans keep things cool and surprisingly quiet, while the 2TB SSD guarantees most folks won't have to worry about making space for all of their games.</p><p>The real star here, though, is the absolutely gorgeous case. Sporting a slick black and yellow aesthetic, it'd be a treat even without the extensive Smite branding. But the addition of Zeus art on the case's left and right sides beautifully complements the package. Thin lightning stretches across one side to the front where a giant Smite bolt logo runs from top to bottom, while the grated top goes all in on boldly featuring the game's name. It's somehow both elegant and geeky, and it miraculously manages to avoid looking cheesy.</p><p>Enough can't be said about the build quality here, too. This is a very big (and shockingly heavy) case, which allows the components to be arranged in a clean, attractive way that highlights each piece while leaving tons of open space for viewing and comfortable tinkering. With the RGB in full swing, it's one of the most eye-catching builds in recent memory--and a part of this is due to the included platelight and acrylic panels.</p><p>Swappable acrylic panels allow fans a way to dedicate their rig to a character from Smite that they adore. Even better, the process is relatively painless and only requires unscrewing a few screws to pull out the platelight, so swapping between them frequently isn't a drawn-out task. You can even purchase and showcase any of the non-Smite panels from the <a href="https://starforgesystems.com/collections/plate-lights" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starforge Systems website</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4309318-20240525_115415.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309318" data-ratio="0.71377459749553" data-width="2236" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4309318-20240525_115415.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309318"></a><figcaption>Swappable acrylic panels further enhance the Smite vibe of the build.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4309318-20240525_115415.jpg"></figure><p>Though it would be amazing to see additional Smite panels become available, it's reasonable that Starforge Systems chose six popular gods from the game to ensure they'd be instantly recognizable even to casual players. The PC comes with the Zeus panel pre-installed, but panels featuring Bellona, Anubis, Scylla, Kukulkan, and Surtr can be purchased separately for $39.99 each. And yeah, that feels a bit pricey, but they're well-made and clearly designed as a supplementary feature for those who want to go all-in on this limited-edition offering.</p><p>With that being said, there's no denying that you're paying a bit of a premium for the limited-edition branding and customizability here as a whole. Similar pre-builts can be found for hundreds less, while you can find plenty of top-end options that sport a more powerful processor and GPU at this PC's price point. But this limited-edition build is designed very specifically for the most hardcore of Smite enthusiasts, and with that in mind, it succeeds admirably being at once capable and ravishing.</p><p>For those willing to dish out a bit of extra cash for this visually appealing love letter to Smite, it's a beastly rig for stomping your foes in Smite 2 when it lands later this year. In the meantime, you can pick up a <a href="https://www.smitegame.com/news/smite-2-founders-editions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Founder's Edition</a> to gain access to closed alpha weekends in the lead-up to the full release.</p>

<p data-characters="202" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Raven Software already gave <em>Warzone </em>players a good idea of what they should expect from the upcoming seasonal update. However, there was one surprise that nobody saw coming: even bigger <em>Warzone</em> lobbies.</p> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">One day before <em>Warzone</em> Season 4 begins, Raven Software has <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1795505182165418148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted,</a> “120. BR.” The post all but confirms that the lobby size on Urzikstan will be increased from 100 to 120 once the patch goes live on May 29 at 1 p.m. ET. <em>Warzone 2</em> initially featured 150-player battle royale lobbies, but the developer controversially slashed that number down to 100 in August 2023 as part of the Season 5 update. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true">To justify the decision, Raven Software at the time <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1686747507093651456">argued</a>, “We’re reducing the number of players across our core Battle Royale modes, which will prevent the match feeling too chaotic but provide improved matchmaking times, faster pre-game lobbies, and a better quality of match overall.”</p>
 <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone 2</em> increased second-chance mechanics and the speed of circles closing in as a counterbalance to fewer players in a match. <em>Modern Warfare 3’s</em> iteration of <em>Warzone</em> doubled by adding a drivable train, zip lines around the battle royale map, and quicker movement mechanics to increase engagement in light of fewer players. Unfortunately, none of those quality of life changes did enough to reinvigorate interest in standard battle royale matches. </p>
 <p data-characters="651" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">Resurgence took over as <em>Warzone’s </em>most popular game mode, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-players-fear-the-worst-about-urzikstans-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubts started to creep</a> in for players, if the devs intended to continue supporting the traditional battle royale format. As part of the March Season 2 update, Treyarch introduced Ranked Play Resurgence to accompany the returning small-scale map Fortune’s Keep. Then, at the start of the Season in early April, the devs showed more love to Resurgence by bringing back Fortune’s Keep and moving Ranked Play over to the popular map. Urzikstan did not get any new POIs, substantial changes, or Ranked Play throughout both seasons, and won’t get Ranked Play again in Season 4. </p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">While Resurgence provides a fast-paced experience because of the smaller map sizes and respawn mechanics, Urzikstan suffers from lulls between engagements as the map is much larger. Increasing the player count on Urzikstan should help the map attract some players back, but it’s unclear if this change will be enough to bring back interest to the game mode’s peak. </p>

Olympus (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hades-2-surface-unraveling-a-fateful-bond-thalamus-1851466545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-surface-unraveling-a-fateful-bond-thalamus-1851466545">which you can only safely access after several runs down below</a></span>).<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/im-skipping-hades-2-early-access-1851459155">Why I Won’t Be Playing <em>Hades 2 </em>In Early Access</a></span><br></p><p>It’s clear that the game is still in Early Access when you venture up top, as the path to the surface currently has two fewer levels and is far less difficult than the one that takes you to Tartarus. But after getting my ass repeatedly whooped by the third level boss down below (my poor baby boy Cerberus), and gathering a lot of important extra upgrades for Melinoë (including the Eternity Arcana card that gave me two Death Defiance every night, and an Incantation that turned any Shades I ran past into allies), I started regularly attempting trips up there. Eventually (and far faster than I got to Cerberus), I reached the last surface boss of <em>Hades 2</em> Early Access: Eris.<br></p><p>Eris is Strife Incarnate, and is, naturally, incredibly fucking annoying. She has a goddamn gun that sprays bullets in an arc around her or fires a single, painful shot that’s difficult to dodge, and she’s incredibly fast, flitting about the arena so often she’s hard to keep track of. But I found through my struggles with the Sirens (the second boss down below), that my best build to tackle bosses was as follows:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>The Twin Wands: </strong>The spinning projectiles you can conjure up with your Special button are super effective when you can get Boons that inflict Scorch or Daze, and ones where you can add an extra projectile. With the Twin Wands equipped, I simply dash around and continuously press Y so that I can constantly conjure up projectiles and encircle foes all around the map. You can even use them to strike enemies from behind cover.</li><li><strong>Level Your Cast: </strong>I consistently looked for Boons that added damage to my special Casts. You can quickly use Cast to call forth a circle in the arena that will trap baddies, but holding the Cast button will keep the circle there longer *and* cause it to do damage when it expires. My favorite Boon that made this even more powerful was Nova Strike.</li><li><strong>Luckier Tooth: </strong>The best way to ensure you’re going to beat a boss is to have a few extra lives as back-up. The aforementioned Eternity Arcana card can be leveled up to give you more Death Defiance, but you can also apply the Luckier Tooth Keepsake (obtained after giving Nectar to the training ground’s bundle of bones, Schelemeus) for another Death Defiance. I went into every Eris battle with four lives. </li></ul><p>Eris moves <em>very </em>quickly around the arena, so it would also behoove you to <strong>pick up an Apollo Boon or two to up your speed.</strong> Getting behind her when she’s firing the Adamant Rail helps, as well. And though there are two pillars you can hide behind (and use your Twin Wands’ Special to still hit her if she’s on the other side of that pillar), her charged single shot can demolish those pillars in one go, so be careful.</p><p>It took me three or four tries to beat Eris, but once I did, I felt like I was ready to go after Chronos.

Not only does reaching him require you to get past two more levels than Eris’ boss battle does, but he has some devastating AOE attacks that are tough to read in your first few attempts. The first time I got to him, he killed me in his first phase. The second time, he killed me with one AOE attack in his second phase. The third time, I got halfway through his health bar in the second phase before his dashing strike got me. It was the fourth time that was the charm.<br></p><p>On your quest down to Tartarus, I’d <strong>suggest equipping Arachne’s keepsake</strong> out the gate—this gives you some armor, and if you are lucky enough to encounter  Arachne herself while traveling through Erebus (and you haven’t taken much damage on your way to her), you can get <em>even more</em> armor. During the run in which I finally bested Chronos, I was able to have Arachne’s armor on through both Erebus <em>and </em>Oceanus, and took <em>no</em> HP damage because of it.</p><p>After besting the Sirens in Oceanus, I equipped Luckier Tooth and kept it on for both the Mourning Fields and Tarturus. This meant I had four lives heading into the Chronos battle. <br></p><p>If and when you encounter <strong>Selene the moon goddess, if she offers you the Boon that allows you to self-heal, take it</strong>. You can use this ability three times per level, as the fountains at the end of each level will restore your uses. I ran into her in Erebus, and didn’t even need to use the healing function until the Mourning Fields. </p><p>Since my build focused heavily on Fire Boons, I<strong> also grabbed the self-healing one that allows you to restore 30% of your HP over 30 seconds after taking damage</strong> (if you have at least 3 Fire Boons equipped). The more Fire Boons you have, the more healing you’ll do. I’d suggest always going for the double Boons when you can—the levels that show two different logos for the Greek gods. Sure, you’ll have to deal with the ire of whoever you don’t pick, but once you get through the encounter, you’ll get another Boon. This is how I ended up having five different Fire Boons, which greatly increased my self-healing!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1de9b6beee4570f8987e52e0f3aaaecd" data-recommend-id="image://1de9b6beee4570f8987e52e0f3aaaecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Twin Wands build in action.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re focused on a Cast-heavy build, <strong>you <em>must</em> grab a Boon that helps restore your Magick</strong>, otherwise, you’ll quickly run out in an encounter.<br></p><p>I’d also suggest <strong>equipping the Arcana card The Boatman</strong>, which has you start off every night with extra gold in your pocket, and <strong>paying for the Charon discount at the Well of Charon</strong> (the shop in-between levels) if it’s available. Having both of these equipped meant that, during my successful run, I was able to buy almost everything Charon had on offer, which often included an extra Boon.<br></p><p>Lastly, if you get the option to visit the vendor in Tartarus, and that vendor has <strong>the Boon that strikes Chronos for 20% of his HP at the start of the encounter</strong>, grab it without hesitation.<br></p><hr><p>A huge component of a successful <em>Hades 2</em> run is luck—I beat Chronos because I had so many good Boons and other goodies stacked on top of each other. My methods for fighting him were nowhere near as polished or as sensible as they were when I fought Eris—I was mostly just cringing and panicking, dashing away from him when he’d slice across the map and swing his scythe in a huge arc (though if you can get behind him during this attack, you can wail on him a bit). During his first phase, he killed me once.<br></p><p>When I got him to his second phase, I was fast enough that I could easily avoid his painful AOE attacks, but that didn’t stop me from getting repeatedly whacked by him and the NPCs he conjured up. I had three lives left, and he made very swift work of them. Thanks to my restorative Magick bar, I continuously used my special Cast to rain damage down upon him, and my long-press Special maneuver to constantly inflict Scorch.<br></p><p>He had a sliver of HP left when he struck me <em>hard</em> with his scythe swipe, dropping me to 35 HP (and no Death Defiance). I held my breath, ran up to him, long-pressed Cast, long-pressed Special, and boom, he was toast. As you can see from the above image, my Cast and Special did an astronomical amount of damage—I rarely even used the Twin Wands’ main attack.<br></p><hr><p>Now, my build might not be for everyone. Maybe you prefer the ax as it offers some shield from <em>Hades 2</em>’s baddies, or the exploding skull for the distance it affords. Maybe you think using three Death Defiance is cheating. Maybe you hate Scorch. But this is the build that helped me bring death to Chronos, and I stand by it. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As mentioned, everybody’s favorite Knight of Sunlight, Solaire, makes a stunning appearance in front of <em>Hades 2</em>’s protagonist Melinoë in a piece of art from Mustakro on X (formerly Twitter). The artist followed this up with a rendering of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mustakro/status/1795484118190288979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mustakro/status/1795484118190288979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Siegmeyer</a></span> in the <em>Hades</em> style.

Fan artists sure haven’t! Plenty of movie and TV characters have also been <em>Hades</em>-ified.

Others might not be gods but just seem like they would be getting themselves in trouble in the many biomes of Hades.

<p data-characters="313" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The highly anticipated release of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> has been shrouded in mystery, with fans eagerly deciphering Activision’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-is-teasing-its-next-entry-with-a-strange-mount-rushmore-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">redacted clues</a>. The anticipation is palpable as we delve into everything you need to know about <em>Black Ops 6</em>, including a release window, platforms, trailer, and <em>Zombies </em>mode.</p> <h2 id="h-when-does-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 come out?</h2> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">As of right now, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> does not have a set launch date. However, based on Activision’s past release history, we can estimate an arrival in late 2024. They’ve generally released games within the same year as the announcement, including <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>and <em>2.</em></p> <figure data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">For example, <em>MW3 </em>was first announced in August 2023, followed by its full release on Nov. 10, 2023. Activision already has an announcement date planned for <em>Black Ops 6, </em>which will be on June 9, 2024, at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-watch-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">That means <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> could be released sometime in September or October, but we won’t know until the official announcement launches.</p> <h2 id="h-what-platforms-will-black-ops-6-be-on" data-injectable="false">What platforms will Black Ops 6 be on?</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">Although we don’t have a release date for <em>Black Ops 6, </em>we do know that it will be available on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> on Day One. Thus, the game will be compatible with Xbox Series X|S. PC Game Pass may also be available for those who have this device.</p>
 <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">Based on some rumors, PlayStation devices will likely be included, specifically the PS5. However, Nintendo playability might not be available, as only a select few <em>Call of Duty</em> entries have made it to this platform.</p> <h2 id="h-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-trailer" data-injectable="false">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 trailer</h2> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> received a live-action trailer, showcasing notable figures like Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, and George H.W. Bush. The concept of lies is the primary theme of the trailer, as each character discusses how “your whole life is a lie.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Black Ops 6: 'The Truth Lies' - Live Action Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V08UPqchVgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">The trailer suggests that Saddam Hussein may be the main antagonist of <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Of course, this is purely speculation, so we’ll need to confirm it once the announcement arrives.</p>
 <p data-characters="129" data-current-count="129" data-injectable="false">Prior to this trailer, we did get an Open Your Eyes snippet depicting more historical content from the ’90s era and beyond.</p> <figure data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="open your eyes #thetruthlies" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEjmwoVrF0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">With the two videos together, we can assume that <em>Black Ops 6</em> will be heavily based on real-life events. The series has been known for this, as seen in the original <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Black Ops’</em></a> Cold War era.</p> <h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-have-zombies" data-injectable="false">Will Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 have Zombies?</h2> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">Given that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-cod-zombies-maps-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Zombies</em> mode</a> has been in every <em>BO </em>entry, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will likely include this feature. The mode was first introduced in <em>Call of Duty: World at War, </em>which took off in the rest of the <em>BO</em> series. While <em>Zombies </em>has primarily been reserved for <em>Black Ops </em>titles, it did transition to <em>Modern Warfare </em>with its third installment.</p>
 <p data-characters="111" data-current-count="111" data-injectable="false">More and more <em>Call of Duty </em>games may have <em>Zombies</em>, but for now, we can hope for another classic <em>BO </em>undead mode.</p>

			<p>Fans of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/batman-arkham/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batman: Arkham series</a> have not exactly been in a great place following the release of Rocksteady Studios’ severely disappointing <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, but there may be a sliver of hope for those wishing the spirit of the Arkham games would live on. Last year, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-suicide-squad-dev-rockstead-loses-founders-sefton-hill-jamie-walker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rocksteady Studios co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker had left the company</a>. Hill served as director for all three Arkham Trilogy games and Jamie Walker was Rocksteady’s studio director, so they weren’t just a pair of suits, but rather the main creative force at the developer. Well, now we may know a bit more about what Hill and Walker are working on post-Rocksteady.</p>
<p>Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker have founded the new London-based studio <a href="https://www.hundredstar.games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hundred Star Games</a>, which already has around 100 employees. <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/hundred-star-xbox-aaa-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According a report from eXputer</a>, Xbox is funding Hundred Star Games’ first project, which will be a “AAA, single-player, action-adventure game” built with Unreal Engine 5. The eXputer report says the game is “likely” to be exclusive to the Xbox ecosystem, but, of course, it’s no longer a lock that Microsoft footing the bill for a game means it will be exclusive as games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-thieves-ps5-april-release-date-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sea of Thieves</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hi-fi-rush-ps5-release-march-2024-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, and (reportedly) the <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">next entry in the Doom series</a> go multiplatform.</p>
<p>According to eXputer, around 20 percent of Hundred Stars’ current staff come from Rocksteady. Beyond that, we don’t have a ton of info about the studio past this official description…</p>
<p><em>“Hundred Star Games is a video game start-up based in East London. Our ethos is of creating a small team of only 100 industry veterans and emerging talents, who are committed to crafting cutting-edge gaming experiences that inspire and captivate players worldwide. With innovation at our core, we're dedicated to pushing boundaries, embracing diversity, and fostering a vibrant gaming community. Our empowering company culture is unique to the industry which encourages leadership at all levels, accountability, team support, vulnerability, and connection.”</em></p>
<p>The masterminds behind the Batman: Arkham series getting back to developing a more straightforward single-player adventure certainly sounds promising. Then again, Hill and Walker oversaw the majority of Suicide Squad’s doomed development, so let’s hope that was just a one-time stumble. What do you think? Excited to see what they might be cooking up?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="eElKbU">Families of victims killed and injured in an Uvalde, Texas school shooting are suing Meta and <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> publisher Activision Blizzard for promoting guns to kids. “[Activision is] chewing up alienated teenage boys and spitting out mass shooters,” attorney Katherine Mesner-Hage <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F736998045%2FActivision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F24166245%2Fuvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23930286__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23930286__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.scribd.com/document/736998045/Activision-Uvalde-suit-via-Polygon&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24166245/uvalde-school-shooting-activision-blizzard-negligence-lawsuit&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">wrote in the complaint</a> filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p id="y5AZI9">Activision is being targeted as an alleged “training camp for mass shooters,” while attorneys call out Meta and Instagram as “the firearm industry’s best advertiser.” The Uvalde victims and their families are also suing Daniel Defense, whose AR-15 style rifle was used by 17-year-old Salvador Ramos to kill 21 people and injure 17 others at Robb Elementary School on May 24, 2022, <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2024/05/24/uvalde-shooting-lawsuits-gunmaker-instagram-texas/">in a separate lawsuit also filed Friday</a>. Daniel Defense’s DDM4v7 rifle, which the Uvalde victims’ lawyer called “an upscale version of the AR-15,” was highlighted on <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>’s opening title page while also being promoted on Instagram by Daniel Defense. Ramos purchased that weapon minutes after his 18th birthday, which was eight days before the shooting at Robb Elementary School.</p>
<p id="BIZA6d">The lawyer wrote that Ramos was not a casual Call of Duty player, saying he “played obsessively, developed skill as a marksman, and obtained rewards” in the game that required him to “grind for hours on end.” Before downloading <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> in 2021, he played several other versions of the game, including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</em> and <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>. Mesner-Hage alleges that Ramos was introduced to the DDM4v7 rifle simultaneously through Call of Duty and on Instagram. Ramos also allegedly searched for other accessories inspired by video games — “a Red Dot Sight, a smoke grenade, an AR-15 weapon skin, and an EOTech holographic battle sight.”</p>
<p id="prUiP2">The lawsuit also included several gruesome details of the attack, including that Ramos approached a teacher and said “good night,” before shooting her in the head — something Mesner-Hage said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b93j9sBZ1A">is something longtime Call of Duty character Captain Price is known to say in <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em></a> and other games.</p>
<p id="4P2hQh">“There is a direct line between the conduct of these companies and the Uvalde shooting.  Just 23 minutes after midnight on his 18th birthday, the Uvalde shooter bought an AR-15 made by a company with a market share of less than one percent,” attorney Josh Koskoff wrote in a news release. “Why? Because, well before he was old enough to purchase it, he was targeted and cultivated online by Instagram, Activision and Daniel Defense. This three-headed monster knowingly exposed him to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it.”</p>
<p id="dI6Y4l">An Activision spokesperson told Polygon that academic and scientific research shows “no causal link” between video games and violence. “The Uvalde shooting was horrendous and heartbreaking in every way, and we express our deepest sympathies to the families and communities who remain impacted by this senseless act of violence,” the spokesperson said. “Academic and scientific research continues to show that there is no causal link between video games and gun violence.”</p>
<p id="kzgDVZ">But the Uvalde victims’ lawyers disagree, pointing to the evolving realism of Call of Duty’s weapons as a marketing tool for gun manufacturers. They also referenced at least five other mass shootings in which Call of Duty was allegedly linked to shooters, one of which was a shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas. After that shooting, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/9/20798498/walmart-violent-video-games-movies-store-displays-shooting-el-paso">Walmart instructed its employees to remove signage</a> referencing violent video games and hunting from its store, but did not stop selling guns. </p>
<p id="uONIoj">Indeed, researchers haven’t found a causal link between playing video games and gun violence; the Stanford Brainstorm Lab spent months reviewing all scholarship related to the topic, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/stanford-researchers-scoured-every-reputable-study-link-between-video-games-gun-violence-politics-mental-health-dupee-thvar-vasan/">according to Fortune</a>. There was some link to vaguely described “aggression,” which encompassed a range of actions. These studies still didn’t find a causal link between games and violence, the researchers wrote. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/11/05/660642531/right-wing-hate-groups-are-recruiting-video-gamers">Certain video game communities</a> <em>have</em>, however, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15554120231167214">been linked to right-wing extremism in the United States</a>.</p>
<p id="c4nYIM">It’s true, too, that video games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/31/3938148/video-games-fund-gun-manufacturers">have licensed weapon likenesses</a> for video games; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/5/8/4311346/ea-will-no-longer-pay-for-rights-to-use-real-guns-in-video-games">Electronic Arts dropped the practice in 2013</a>, for instance, but still uses the same types of guns — just without the names. “It is hard to qualify to what extent rifle sales have increased as a result of being in games,” Ralph Vaughn of Barrett Firearms Manufacturing, whose M82 sniper rifle has appeared in Call of Duty games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shooters-how-video-games-fund-arms-manufacturers">told Eurogamer in 2013</a>. “But video games expose our brand to a young audience who are considered possible future owners.” </p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 4, dubbed Loot Reborn, has overhauled the loot system. This includes a new way to power up your gear in the endgame of Diablo 4 via the new Masterworking system. Masterworking improves the bonuses of every affix an item has, increasing how powerful your build can be. However, getting the materials to masterwork gear requires some grinding.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Masterworking</h2><p dir="ltr">You can masterwork Gear at the blacksmith, but only after unlocking The Pit, a new endgame dungeon, which is the only way to get Masterwork materials. To unlock The Pit, you must first beat a Tier 46 Nightmare Dungeon, which requires you to be on World Tier 4 and features level 100 enemies. The Pit starts at Tier 1, with level 100 enemies, and goes all the way up to Tier 200. To enter The Pit, you need 3 Runeshards, which drop from Whisper Caches, Helltide chests, Legion chests, Nightmare Dungeons, and World Bosses. Once you unlock The Pit, you will need to complete one run to unlock the masterwork menu at the blacksmith.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Masterworking works</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309280-d4masterwork.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309280-d4masterwork.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309280"></a><figcaption>Each masterwork rank requires three different materials and a bunch of gold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309280-d4masterwork.jpeg"></figure><p>Each item can be masterworked a total of 12 times, with most ranks adding a 5% boost to every Affix an item has. However, ranks 4, 8, and 12 each add a boost of 25% to a single affix at random. Only items that are either Ancestral Legendary with two Tempered Affixes or Ancestral Uniques can be upgraded via masterworking.</p><p dir="ltr">Depending on the type of item, you will need some basic crafting materials, like Veiled Crystal or Forgotten Soul, Gold, and one of the three Pit materials, depending on which upgrade rank you are on.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranks 1 through 4 require Obducite, 5 through 8 require Ingolith, and 9 through 12 require Neathiron. Obducite is dropped from Tiers 1 to 29 in The Pit, Ingolith Tiers 30 to 59, and Neathiron 60 to 200. <strong>You can transmute the higher tier materials into the lower tier versions at the Alchemist, but you can't turn the lower tier materials into the higher tier</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Pit itself is relatively simple. Each run has a 15-minute time limit to hit mastery, ending with a significant amount of that tier's crafting material. Dying in The Pit takes time off the clock, with the first death taking 30 seconds, the second taking 60 seconds, and the third death and every death after taking 90 seconds. To complete The Pit, you need to quickly kill enemies to fill up a meter. Once the meter is filled, a portal takes you to the boss fight. The boss fight is similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-nightmare-dungeons-nightmare-sigils-guide/1100-6514817/">Nightmare Dungeon</a> boss fights, except a shadow of a random enemy also appears in the arena, firing off attacks during the fight. Completing a tier will unlock the next tier, but if you complete it fast, you can unlock up to three tiers in a single run.</p><p dir="ltr">If you run a higher tier with a party than you have unlocked, you will unlock the tiers after that tier, but not before it. For example, if your highest tier is 35 and you run a 45 with a friend, you will unlock tier 46, but not tier 36.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309281-d4reset.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309281-d4reset.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4309281"></a><figcaption>You can reset items if you are unhappy with your masterwork rolls, but you won't get any of your materials back.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4309281-d4reset.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to note that upgrading gear takes a decent amount of materials, especially if you don't get the rolls on the 25% bonuses you want. <strong>You can reset an item's masterwork ranks back to zero at any point, but it costs money and materials to do so. You also do not get your masterworking materials refunded, so make sure you really want to reset it</strong>. You can salvage masterworked items to get some of The Pit materials back, but you will only get a fraction.</p>

It also suggests new twists in the story of the expansion: the temptation of one of Destiny's most notable characters, Commander Zavala.</p><p dir="ltr">Destiny 2 players have known that the Witness, the antagonist operating from the shadows for the last 10 years of the Destiny Light and Darkness Saga, has designs to end the world, but the story trailer finally shows us what that might look like. The "Final Shape" the Witness wants to bring about is a reshaping of reality that locks the universe into a perfect stillness, which the Witness believes will bring an end to all suffering. In practice, that means turning everyone and everything into taxidermy-like statues, and when the trailer shows that applied to the people of Earth, it hits pretty hard.</p><p dir="ltr">You can check out the trailer yourself below. It includes the reunion of Cayde-6, who was killed in the Forsaken expansion but has returned in The Final Shape for reasons even he doesn't understand, with his buds Zavala and Ikora. It seems like Destiny 2's major characters will see a fair amount of action in The Final Shape, too; the trailer suggests a similar number of story cutscenes to what Bungie put in Destiny 2's vanilla campaign.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrxWFrd1zQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Most notable, though, is where the story seems to be headed, with the trailer teasing that Commander Zavala might be tempted by the Darkness. If you've been following the story for the last few years, that makes a lot of sense. Zavala has been struggling with a crisis of faith for <em>a while</em> now, especially after the events of The Witch Queen expansion when the Hive, a group of genocidal aliens and basically humanity's greatest enemies, were gifted with the same physics-breaking superpowers, the Light, as Zavala and the rest of us Guardians.</p><p dir="ltr">Zavala has seemed like he's been having a hard time for the last few years, and after the Lightfall campaign, one of his close friends and lieutenants, Amanda Holliday, was killed. That loss hit him <em>very</em> hard, and you can see early in the trailer that Zavala is wearing Amanda's scarf tied around his arm. So when the Witness suggests that maybe Zavala might get everything he wants if he helps enact the Final Shape, there are some good reasons why Zavala might consider the offer.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the trailer is among the first times we're hearing actor Keith David in the role of Zavala, who he plays throughout The Final Shape. David is taking over the role from Lance Reddick, who'd played Zavala since 2014 and was a regular Destiny 2 player himself, died in 2023. </p><p dir="ltr">The Final Shape launches on June 4, so we'll have to wait until then to see how things shake out.

It's used to describe long overtime and has been a common practice in the industry for decades--though also heavily debated and polarizing.</p><p dir="ltr">Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke touched on the touchy subject recently at the Digital Dragons conference in Poland, per <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/baldurs-gate-3-had-less-crunch-than-larians-previous-rpgs-but-its-director-says-you-will-always-have-a-little-bit-of-overtime/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. He admitted that crunch is unavoidable at times by nature of the beast, though paid overtime helps the situation.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"We didn't overly crunch [on Baldur's Gate 3], but we did have to do a bit of crunch," Vincke said. "And I think, to be honest, you will always have a little bit when you're trying to finish something, especially when there's so much complexity that needs to be brought together."</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean Vincke and Larian just accept crunch as standard. Vincke, who directed Baldur's Gate 3, said there was less crunch making the RPG compared to previous games the studio has worked on. It became necessary with Baldur's Gate 3 because "we had things happen that we didn't foresee," according to Vincke.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-studio-says-its-next-two-games-could-be-its-best-work-ever/1100-6522782/" data-ref-id="1100-6522782">Larian is working on its next two games that could be its "best work ever."</a> Neither will be Baldur's Gate 4, as the company leaves the world of the Forgotten Realms to create its own properties.

<p data-characters="126" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The 90+ TOTS Player Pick SBC has refreshed in <em>EA FC 24</em>, and it’s certainly a matter of delight for the whole community. </p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">These picks allow players to get a TOTS item from a choice of three cards, with all of them rated 90 or higher. This SBC certainly has increased chances of getting the better Team of the Season players, and completing it is pretty easy. Let’s take a look at what the tasks are, their conditions, and if you should complete them at all. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-90-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 90+ TOTS Player Pick SBC Tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">The latest version of the TOTS SBC is pretty similar to last week’s release. There are two tasks —the 85-rated squad and 87-rated squad. </p>
 <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="29" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – 85-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="109" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min. Team Rating: 85</li> </ul> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="138" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 2 – 87-Rated Squad</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. Team Rating: 87</li> </ul> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, you’ll only need one TOTS/TOTW item to complete this SBC. It’s best to complete the 83+ TOTW Pick SBC in case someone doesn’t have a Team of the Week item. As an alternative, using a duplicate TOTS card can be a good idea. </p>

			<p>Today, Bungie has released the official launch trailer for Destiny 2: The Final Shape, out on June 4. This will be the eighth expansion produced for the free-to-play first-person shooter MMO game released in 2017.</p>
<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-detailed-for-february-2024-launch-season-of-the-witch-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled to launch in February 2024</a>. However, Bungie endured some rough times, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffering layoffs</a> and leading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delayed-june-additional-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion's delay until June</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a sixth Prismatic subclass that will combine both the powers of Light and Darkness, allowing players to mix and match abilities and supers from the other five subclasses (Void, Solar, Arc, Stasis, and Strand). The Prismatic subclass introduces two meters that fill up as players damage and defeat enemies with either Light or Darkness abilities; when both meters are fully charged, players can activate a super-like ability called Transcendence, which grants supercharged melee and grenade regeneration, increased damage resistance, and increased weapon damage.</p>
<p>Players can also unleash unique grenades of combined elements depending on their class while Transcendence is active-Electrified Snare (Arc and Strand) for Titans, Freezing Singularity (Void and Stasis) for Warlocks, and Hailfire Spike (Solar and Stasis) for Hunters. Prismatics will also have more Aspect and Fragment slots than the other subclasses.</p>

<p>Destiny 2: The Final Shape will also inaugurate a new content delivery model through episodes. The first episode, Echoes, will start on June 11, one week after the expansion's release. New and existing players' Power levels will be increased to the new minimum Power level of 1900, a soft cap of 1940, with the hard power level cap set at 1990, and the Pinnacle Reward cap at 2000. These power level increases will take effect upon the release of The Final Shape itself on June 4.</p>
<p>This episode's story will focus on the Vex and take place shortly after the events of The Final Shape and its raid. Revenant, the second episode of Destiny 2: The Final Shape, is tentatively scheduled to launch in October 2024 and will focus on the Scorn. Heresy, the third episode, is tentatively slated to release in February 2025 and will focus on the Hive.</p>

<p>In other Bungie news, a jury <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just awarded the studio $63K</a> following a lawsuit against Destiny 2 cheat maker AimJunkies.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24166283/deep-rock-galactic-season-five-updates-franchise-survivor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-never-been-a-better-time-to-delve-into-deep-rock-galactic.883128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166283/deep-rock-galactic-season-five-updates-franchise-survivor<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RaU7fC">In the years since the rampant success of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/22/18097804/left-4-dead-10th-anniversary-legacy">back in 2008</a>, we’ve seen many solid co-op horde shooters. Few of these games have garnered as loyal a community as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074194/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-review-impressions"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a>, a dwarven twist on the familiar four-player formula that came out a decade after <em>L4D</em>. Not only is <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> still in a strong place, with season 5 set to debut in June, but the franchise has also expanded into successful spin-off titles. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/guides/24073651/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-beginner-tips-tricks"><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em></a> is an auto-shooter in the vein of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22927447/vampire-survivors-review-roguelike-bullet-hell-steam-pc-browser-8-bit-characters-power-ups"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, and Ghost Ship Games has announced a roguelike called <em>Deep Rock Survivor: Rogue Core.</em> It’s a great time — maybe even the <em>best </em>time — to get into all things Deep Rock Galactic.</p>
<p id="Igzfpq">The original game is about a space corporation called Deep Rock Galactic with lax safety regulations and a voracious thirst for profit. The corporation sends teams of dwarves to alien planets, and those teams must excavate valuable resources while being assailed by endless hordes of bugs and beasties. There are four classes: Scout, Engineer, Driller, and Gunner. Each class has its own abilities — for instance, the Engineer can create new platforms, the Scout can use a grappling hook to reach high locations, the Driller tears through terrain and creates new tunnels, and the Gunner is especially proficient at bug murder.</p>
<div id="J8YOEg"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/922YV_0T6CY?rel=0&amp;start=6699" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RnMkWk">Season 5 will come with a few new fun additions, which I tested during a play session with Ghost Ship Games. The new mission type is called Deep Scan, and it sends dwarves searching for Morkite Geodes deep within the mines of Hoxxes. Once the team has triangulated a position, they can call in an enormous Drillevator, a portmanteau that explains the function of the tool wonderfully. It’s fun to have horde shooter mechanics applied to vertical spaces, and it’s thrilling to plummet down through the core of the planet, occasionally halting and allowing waves of furious bugs to catch up. Once the dwarves reach their destination and collect valuable Morkite seeds, the corporation is generous enough to gift them with some Jet Boots, which allows them to rocket up into the air with minimal risk of injury or death.</p>
<p id="cGZ7wR">There will be a new season event involving Core Stores, which are giant, dark, crystalline-like structures that glow with a menacing purple energy — but are extremely valuable to our higher-ups back at the corporation. The new season also adds Overclocks, a modifier that dramatically upgrades certain functions of a dwarf’s base weapons.</p>
<p id="yN8Dfc">For those who haven’t caught the past seasons of <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>, in season 5 Ghost Ship Games is adding the ability to select any season and play through it at your leisure. This includes the old season rewards and cosmetics, as well as any conditions or complications from that season’s story. It’s similar to <em>World of Warcraft: Classic</em>, in that it allows players to sample past offerings without any FOMO.</p>
<p id="oBtIAY">Players can expect more from the larger world of Deep Rock Galactic in 2025, when Ghost Ship Games launches <em>Rogue Core</em> into early access. After <em>Rogue Core</em>, Ghost Ship Games intends to release Season 6 of <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>. Of course, there’s a wealth of content to dig into already — especially if you’ve never given <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> a shot. Auto-shooter spin-off <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> has also <a href="https://x.com/FundayGamesdk/status/1768635634241954204">sold over a million copies</a>, which suggests the franchise has legs. This new season is the best chance to jump aboard the base game and dig into everything the horde shooter has to offer. </p>

The Polish politician and karate master will bolster the roster this summer.</p>

<p>First introduced as a DLC fighter in Tekken 7: Fated Retribution, Lidia is the prime minister of Poland and a practitioner of traditional karate. The formal and proud fighter clashes with fellow karate practisioner Jin Kazama in the trailer and humbles the arrogant Reina by dishing out her new Rage Art.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wapN3UqjJmI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Lidia follows on the heels of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/01/15/eddy-gordo-is-tekken-8s-first-dlc-fighter-opening-cinematic-released">Eddy Gordo </a>as the two revealed Year 1 season pass fighters. Owners of Tekken 8’s Deluxe, Ultimate, or Collector's Editions automatically receive these fighters. Each can also be purchased individually for $7.99. Two more fighters remain in the Year 1 pass, who will be added during the fall and winter</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-the-mad-max-movies-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-the-mad-max-movies-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="173" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Since 1979, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mad-max-movies-order/">George Miller’s <em>Mad Max </em>series</a> has transformed from a schlocky B-rate post-apocalypse story to one of the most beloved action franchises of all time.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true"><em>Mad Max </em>is set in Australia sometime after the world has been desolated by plagues, economic collapse, and ecological die out. The dregs of humanity hang onto life and go to war over the remaining food, fuel, and shelter. The humans in <em>Mad Max </em>also spend a good chunk of their time creating spike-covered vehicles that can patrol the wastes and duke it out in high speed battles. It’s a goofy premise that takes itself entirely too seriously, but that’s part of the appeal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">The <em>Mad Max </em>movies are beloved for good reason, but even super fans like myself have to admit that some of them are quite a bit better than others. They might not all be worth a rewatch, but they’re definitely worth ranking.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="532" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Roadshow Film Distributors </figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-mad-max-beyond-thunderdome" data-injectable="false">Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</h2> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><em>Beyond Thunderdome </em>is arguably the most iconic <em>Mad Max </em>movie thanks to the titular combat arena and a truly memorable performance from Tina Turner. At the same time, this movie is a lot worse than your memory might lead you to believe. There’s less time spent watching post-apocalyptic gladiators duke it out than there is watching Max interact with a group of semi-feral children. Digging into various factions and the plight of kids in the wasteland definitely gives <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em> a different feel than the other movies, but that’s not really to its benefit.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Roadshow Film Distributors</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max</h2> <p data-characters="589" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Mad Max</em> still holds up, but I’d be lying if I said that nostalgia had nothing to do with this ranking. Truly an example of low-budget filmmaking at its finest, <em>Mad Max</em> is about as stripped down as you can get. We learn about Max’s origins as a sort of police officer in an apocalypse-lite society (the world doesn’t become completely desolate until the sequel). The gang leader Toecutter is still the most memorable villain of the series, and the stunt performers who absolutely risked their lives while filming deserve much of the credit for making <em>Mad Max</em> so good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">In some ways, <em>Furiosa </em>is more like <em>Beyond Thunderdome </em>than any other <em>Mad Max </em>movie. <em>Furiosa</em> tells a grandiose story set over more than a decade, and it spends lots of time building up various factions and locations in the wasteland, which is why you should probably <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/which-mad-max-movies-do-you-need-to-see-before-furiosa/">catch up on the series before watching it</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">That said, the stories it weaves together are much more interesting than the ones presented in <em>Beyond Thunderdome</em>, and the action scenes that link all the brooding and worldbuilding moments together are top-notch. <em>Furiosa </em>doesn’t provide quite the same thrill ride as other movies in the series, but it definitely tells the most cohesive story and gives us a clear vision of the wasteland that the other movies don’t really explore.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Roadshow Film Distributors </figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max: The Road Warrior</h2> <p data-characters="591" data-current-count="891" data-injectable="true">It <em>almost</em> doesn’t get better than <em>The Road Warrior</em>. The sequel to the original <em>Mad Max</em> opens up the world and brings the apocalypse to the forefront of the story. There aren’t cops any more, just roving bands of car-obsessed raiders and the people who desperately try to avoid them. <em>The Road Warrior </em>ups the ante on all the action shown off in the first film and truly sets the tone for the rest of the series. Some of the storytelling is a bit clumsy, and there’s the Mel Gibson of it all to get past, but <em>The Road Warrior </em>still stands out as the best of the original <em>Mad Max </em>trilogy.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Mad Max: Fury Road</h2> <p data-characters="600" data-current-count="900" data-injectable="false">It feels a little weird to put a legacy sequel at the top of this list, but it’s also hard to deny that <em>Fury Road</em> is a masterpiece. The movie basically functions as one giant chase scene, and it manages to capture everything that makes the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise great. From beginning to end, it’s packed with clever world building details, breathtaking shots, and some of the most well-choreographed action scenes ever put to film. Everything the earlier movies did well, <em>Fury Road</em> does better, so if someone was only ever going to watch a single entry in the series, this is the one I’d recommend.</p>

<p data-characters="182" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em>. It’s a highly beginner-friendly challenge available in Ultimate Team, with solo options to complete for tasks. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Albert Gudmundsson was in terrific form in the recently-concluded Serie A season, and EA Sports has released the card to celebrate his performance. This is certainly one of the cheapest TOTS SBC that you can complete. If you’re a beginner, this can be an excellent way to reinforce your Ultimate Team squad. </p> <h2 id="h-what-are-the-ea-fc-24-albert-gudmundsson-serie-a-tots-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">What are the EA FC 24 Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC Tasks?</h2> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">As mentioned earlier, the solo task makes this challenge very easy to finish for beginners. Do note that the task has certain specified conditions that are required to be fulfilled to get the TOTS card. </p>
 <p data-characters="33" data-current-count="33" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Albert Gudmundsson</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false"> <li>Min. 1 Players from: Serie A TIM</li> <li>Min. 1 Players: Any TOTS or TOTW</li> <li>Min. Team Rating: 84</li> </ul> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">While the overall rating of the squad has to be 84, you’ll have to use at least one TOTS or TOTW card. You can complete the 83+ TOTW Pick to get a Team of the Week card while saving coins. </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/EA-FC-24-Gudmundsson-TOTS.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;2304&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1024&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>

If you want to complete tonight’s challenge, make sure to use saved fodder. Far more expensive SBCs, like the Trinity Rodman TOTS challenge, are expected next week. </p> <p data-characters="33" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Albert Gudmundsson</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true"> <li>Thiago Alcantara 84</li> <li>Stanislav Lobotka 84</li> <li>Memphis Depay 84</li> <li>Thomas Muller 84</li> <li>Ismael Bennacer 84</li> <li>Casey Stanway 84</li> <li>Serge Gnabry 84</li> <li>Griedge Mbock 84</li> <li>Alan Varela TOTW 84</li> <li>Luis Alberto 84</li> <li>Franco Acerbi 83</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">The Albert Gudmundsson Serie A TOTS SBC features a 94-rated ST item, and the card boasts of 99 Pace. Speed won’t be an issue at all, but both Shooting (92) and Passing (88) can do with a bit of boost. The 4* Skills and 4* Weak Foot could also be hard to manage at this stage of the game. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="false">Nevertheless, this SBC certainly is well-worth its price. Those who have tight budgets could also look to complete the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">Henrikh Mkhitaryan TOTS SB</a>C, which probably has one of the best returns in terms of offered value. </p>
