            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's promised ad spot at the Super Bowl just aired, and in it we got a glimpse into the Pokémon preferences of celebrities such as Lady Gaga, Trevor Noah, Charles Leclerc, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The minute-long ad shows Lady Gaga, Trevor Noah, Formula One racer Charles Leclerc, singer Jisoo, actor Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, Spanish football (soccer, for the Americans) player Lamine Yamal and rapper Young Miko all describing their favorite Pokémon before eventually revealing them. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Lady Gaga (of course) picked Jigglypuff, and Jigglypuff even did a brief little duet with her singing its signature song. Trevor Noah prefers Psyduck, Leclerc chooses Arcanine, Jisoo picks Eevee, Ramakrishnan chooses Luxray, Yamal picks Zygarde, and Young Miko's partner is Gengar. Shockingly, The Pokémon Company managed not to put Pikachu in this ad anywhere (except in the logo, of course)!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ad ends with all the celebrities asking the audience, "What's your favorite?" This question is the start of a year-long campaign put on by The Pokémon Company in celebration of its 30th anniversary. In addition to the ad, The Pokémon Company is kicking things off by introducing a new camera feature to Pokémon GO (which is somehow ten years old this year!) that allows users to participate in the campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, The Pokémon Company has promised various events including "Day Out" and "Night Out" experiences designed for fans to celebrate Pokémon, with daytime events more family-focused and nighttime events more for adults who grew up with the series. The Pokémon Company has also already announced other celebratory events, such as a <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-tcg/product-gallery/pokemon-day-2026-collection" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">themed TCG collection</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-fans-dissect-new-pokmon-sets-praise-eevee-but-say-mega-bloks-did-pikachu-better">Pokemon LEGO sets</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon's 30th is a big moment for the franchise, and we're expecting them to celebrate in style. Historically Pokémon has thrown a big digital showcase entitled Pokémon Presents on or around Pokémon Day (February 27), where the company lays out its plans for the year across video games, the TCG, and merchandise. Fans are eagerly hoping for the announcement of a new Pokémon game, perhaps a remake of beloved DS games Black and White, or the kick-off for the next generation of Pokémon, Gen 10. Heck, at this point, I'd just be happy to have the classic games on Nintendo Switch Online!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

<p>The 30th anniversary of Pokemon took center stage for a brief moment during Super Bowl 60.</p>



<p>An entire generation of kids who wanted to be the “very best like no one ever was” has grown into a population of adults who have taken different paths but share a love of Pokemon and fond memories of it.</p>



<p>That love was on display in a Super Bowl 60 commercial. Trevor Noah, Lady Gaga, Blackpink’s Jisoo, and more all named their favorites and spoke about why they have a love for the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-lady-gaga-s-favorite-is-jigglypuff">Lady Gaga’s Favorite Is Jigglypuff</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that Lady Gaga is a fan of Jigglypuff. The Grammy Award-winning Superstar praised the fairy-type Pokemon for using her voice as a means of protection and self-defense. Gaga even noted that Jigglypuff has a 12-octave vocal range.</p>



<p>Trevor Noah remarked that his favorite is Psyduck. Noah praised Psyduck for its ability to change the world with its mind. He also said that every time you met a new one, it was like meeting a new part of yourself.</p>



<p>Charles Leclerc, Lamine Yamal, Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, and Young Miko also appeared in the ad, which ran for just over a minute.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-turns-30">Pokemon Turns 30</h2>



<p>2026 is a big year for Pokemon. It has been 30 years since Pokemon Red and Blue launched on the original Nintendo Game Boy. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-day-2026-pokemon-presents/">Pokemon Day</a> falls on February 27 every year. </p>



<p>Each year, a stream hosted by The Pokemon Company sets the stage for the franchise’s immediate future. This year, fans expect the launch of the 10th generation of everyone’s favorite friendly monsters.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Still Plans First-Party Xbox Handheld, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-still-plans-first-party-xbox-handheld-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>1429477</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As Microsoft continues to shape its vision for the future of the Xbox brand, it still plans to develop a first-party handheld device, even if “everything is an Xbox.”</p>



<p>In 2025, ASUS launched the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally series </a>of handheld gaming devices. The two new devices were more powerful versions of the previously launched <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/asus-rog-ally/" id="629">ROG Ally systems,</a> designed to make it easier to access PC game launchers, including<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075"> Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>



<p>Still, a new <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-the-next-gen-xbox-2027-locked-in-most-ambitious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Jez Corden </a>notes that plans remain in place for a first-party Xbox handheld, even if the next mainline Xbox console is the primary focus for now. </p>



<p>The next-generation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>platform is touted as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft’s </a>boldest effort in the gaming space to date, even after a game-changing quarter-century. As such, they’re not committing to a firm launch date for the next home console yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-changes-coming-soon-to-the-asus-rog-xbox-ally">Major Changes Coming Soon to the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally</h2>



<p>The report from Corden notes that Microsoft is testing a new NPU-driven highlights feature for the Xbox Ally X that automatically transforms gameplay clips into shareable videos. This feature is slated for a March 2026 release.</p>



<p>The next Xbox console is also set to take notes from the Ally X handheld by bringing multiple launchers, such as the Epic Games launcher and Steam, to the platform. Regardless of the hardware, the overall message remains the same: make Xbox accessible anywhere and everywhere.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-murder-man-concerned-about-missing-game/</link>
            <guid>1429474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Robert Richens was apprehended by UK police last year for brutally murdering his former girlfriend. Recently, Richens appeared at Oxford Crown Court for sentencing, being sent down with a life sentence on February 6, 2026. In new footage captured by the police officers who brought Richens in, it was revealed that the killer had something else on his mind at the time.</p>



<p>In a clip that has gone <strong>viral</strong> in recent days, Richens was caught sobbing midway through being arrested, blurting out that he was going to ‘miss GTA’.</p>



<h2 id="h-callous-and-merciless-murder">‘Callous’ and ‘Merciless’ Murder</h2>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://www.thamesvalley.police.uk/news/thames-valley/news/2026/february/02-02-26/man-jailed-for-life-for-murder--abingdon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Thames Valley Police</a> in the United Kingdom, itwas confirmed that Robert Richens, aged 35, was jailed for life, with a minimum term of 16 years, for the 2025 murder of his former partner.</p>



<p>Per the report, Richens had called emergency services on the morning of May 30 and stressed that he’d accidentally killed someone. Upon investigation, it was found that his former partner, Rachael Vaughan, had been subject to a ‘sustained assault’ that had left her lifeless.</p>



<p>Here’s the clip that surfaced recently on social media, showing Richens sobbing and lamenting the loss of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-6/" id="36">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A man in the UK was arrested for murder, and his only concern was that he’d miss GTA VI as he’d likely get life in prison. </p><p>The police officer replies “You’ve got ages for that” 💀 <a href="https://t.co/by2KVdbLkn">pic.twitter.com/by2KVdbLkn</a></p></div>— ben (@videotechuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/videotechuk_/status/2020303229091999969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>In the video, a police officer casually asks what GTA he’s referring to, and when Richens simply said, ‘Six,’ the officer brushed it off, suggesting he ‘had ages’ until the game came out.</p>



<p>Richens won’t only miss Grand Theft Auto 6, but likely Grand Theft Auto 7 too, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/rockstar-games/" id="1648">Rockstar’s</a> release cadence is anything to go by. While UK prisons permit games consoles, they’re only allowed older units that cannot connect to the internet, which includes the likes of the PlayStation 2 and original Xbox.</p>



<p>During sentencing, the judge labelled Richens’ actions as callous and merciless for the crime he’d pleaded guilty to.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 and PlayStation Handheld To Have Impressive Memory Specs, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-specs-playstation-handheld-impressive-memory/</link>
            <guid>1429471</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The latest round of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/playstation-6/" id="217" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6</a> claims surfaced recently, alongside claims regarding the upcoming ‘PlayStation handheld’, dubbed Project Canis. In a series of posts on NeoGAF, reliable tech leaker, KeplerL2, divulged some tidbits about the upcoming next generation of PlayStation hardware, focused squarely on <strong>memory capabilities</strong>.</p>



<p>In the string of posts, KeplerL2 claimed that the PlayStation 6 could boast up to 30 GB of GDDR7 memory, using a specific configuration to fit it into the console. Elsewhere, the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 says, could have as much as 24 GB of LPDDR5X memory, putting it at least on par with the recently released ROG Xbox Ally X, arguably the most premium handheld on the market.</p>







<h2 id="h-playstation-6-and-playstation-handheld-claims-surface-again">PlayStation 6 and PlayStation Handheld Claims Surface Again</h2>



<p>It’s once every few months that we’re seeing fresh information emerge regarding the next generation of PlayStation hardware.</p>



<p>In April 2025, we had claims come <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/portable-ps6-wont-be-as-powerful-as-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from KeplerL2</a> that the upcoming PlayStation handheld won’t be as powerful as the PlayStation 5. In August, a fresh wave <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of technical specs leaked</a> for both devices, and in October, it was claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 6 will be released</a> as early as 2027.</p>



<p>This new spate of information comes from KeplerL2 again, who has proven to be mostly reliable in the past for technical insights.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/amd-ceo-reveals-next-gen-xbox-could-launch-in-2027-%E2%80%94-ceo-says-semi-custom-soc-ready-to-support-launch-in-2027.1693009/page-9#post-271240975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a thread</a> on NeoGAF, KeplerL2 addressed a question around <strong>how </strong>Sony would ‘hit 30GB of GDDR7 with only 4GB modules on a 160-bit bus.’</p>



<p>Per KeplerL2, the tech titan would opt for 3 GB memory modules arranged in a clamshell configuration. It would reduce the memory bus but hit a higher memory speed overall and promote more bandwidth, as much as 640 GB/s (thanks to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/playstation-handheld-reportedly-with-24gb-memory-ps6-console-with-30gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">videocardz.com</a> for the breakdown).</p>



<p>Additionally, KeplerL2 suggested that a ‘good amount of memory’ for the PlayStation portable (‘PS6 handheld’) would be 24 GB, which is more or less the industry standard right now for top-tier handheld gaming devices.</p>



<p>As always, these kinds of claims or suggestions should be taken with a grain of salt until we have it from the horse’s mouth.</p>







<p>What do you think? Can you see the PS6 launching with almost double the memory capacity of the PlayStation 5? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is introducing a new Ringside Pass, similar to battle pass systems in other games. Now, the gameplay designer, Cornell Gunter, explains the benefits fans can expect from this new addition.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> is set to release worldwide on March 13. This year’s game features the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/" id="170273">several match types</a> to WWE video games. However, there are also many changes coming to this year’s game, including the introduction of a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-will-the-wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-work/" id="174147"> new Ringside Pass</a>, which changes how unlockables work in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-dev-says-ringside-pass-is-about-content-first-and-foremost">WWE 2K26 Dev Says Ringside Pass Is About Content First and Foremost</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/m935QSZHAfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JustBryan,</a> WWE 2K26 gameplay designer Cornell Gunter praised the changes that the new Ringside Pass will offer. He notes that Ringside Pass Premium will offer day-one DLC. He also notes that the new system is strictly about content rather than time-sensitive releases. </p>



<p>While it is divided into seasons, none of the benefits are time-limited. If a player returns to the game after several months away, they will still have access to all premium content. Overall, there will be 120 reward items per season.</p>



<p>“I’m very excited to see what the reactions are by the end of the lifecycle. Because I think people are going to be very, very happy with what we are able to achieve and what we brought to the table with the Ringside Pass,” Gunter said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Team Vitality has lifted the trophy at IEM Krakow, extending a phenomenal record over the last year or so and sending FURIA packing at the final post. The victory came after a hard-fought battle in the Tauron Arena in front of thousands of fans, but Vitality’s final streak through FURIA was a masterclass to behold.</p>



<p>Only the opening round on Mirage was of any use to the Brazilian side, stumping up a tough 11-13 finish that quickly went squandered in the subsequent maps. By the third map, Team Vitality was dominating 13-2, showing why it was worthy of that all-important trophy and the $400,000 prize.</p>







<h2 id="h-team-vitality-matches-iem-krakow-predictions">Team Vitality Matches IEM Krakow Predictions</h2>



<p>In our earlier coverage, our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/iem-krakow/" id="3570">IEM Krakow</a> predictions had Team Vitality sitting pretty in first place, and it’s always nice to be validated by the result.</p>



<p>Team Vitality has pushed onwards and upwards with a monumental, award-winning streak that has left the team being regarded as one of the all-time greatest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/counter-strike/" id="482">Counter-Strike</a> rosters ever created. In the last year, the organization has edged into double-digit territory in terms of trophies raised, and this latest one, secured at the first IEM Krakow event, is more ammunition for the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before IEM Krakow, the team’s last win came at the StarLadder Budapest Major in December, which yielded a 3-1 win over FaZe Clan and a $500,000 prize.</p>



<p>Krakow seemed in the bag for Vitality throughout much of the tournament. For die-hard fans of the brand, this was only ever going to go one way.</p>

From lush forests to forgotten cities, <em>Colorbound</em>‘s overworld offers a variety of mind-bending puzzles that span a variety of locations and aesthetics.</li><li><strong>Finding Balance</strong> – Not all colors behave the same way.

Using this to your advantage can help Anku cross the treacherous terrain to reach his destination.</li><li><strong>Rooted in Culture</strong> – <em>Colorbound</em> draws inspiration from the Aymara culture of the Andes, blending traditional music and art styles with an indie-gem-inspired puzzle platformer experience. Informed by Panpipe Studio’s Chilean culture and heritage, <em>Colorbound</em> celebrates the rich culture of South America while delivering a universal story of love, loss, and the power of art.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>More changes could be coming to Xbox Game Pass, per a new report.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-game-pass/" id="1075">Xbox Game Pass</a> is currently a cornerstone of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/xbox-series-x/" id="28">Xbox </a>business. This past October, the cost of the Game Pass Ultimate tier increased to $29.99 per month after the company added nearly 50 games and committed to over 75 day-one releases per year.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/874303/microsoft-xbox-roadmap-2026-notepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge </a>reports that more changes could be coming to the subscription service. One potential change is Microsoft experimenting with bundling additional third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions. Game Pass Ultimate currently includes access to Fortnite Crew, Ubisoft+ Classics, and EA Play.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/microsoft/" id="189">Microsoft </a>is considering merging <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox/" id="131">Xbox </a>Game Pass Premium, the second-tier offering, with PC Game Pass. PC Game Pass is currently $16.49 per month and only allows players to access games on PC, rather than through the cloud or on consoles.</p>







<h2 id="h-still-don-t-expect-changes-to-game-pass-in-2026">Still, Don’t Expect Changes to Game Pass in 2026</h2>



<p>Tom Warren also states that he doesn’t expect any changes to the service this calendar year. Not only did Xbox make significant changes in October, but Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions.</p>



<p>Regarding the future of Xbox,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-says-next-xbox-console-may-launch-next-year/" id="173908"> AMD recently stated that the next Xbox console could launch in 2027.</a> It’s been said that the next Xbox in-home unit would be a PC-console hybrid. </p>







<p>In 2025, the brand entered the handheld market with the ROG Ally Xbox devices. Learn more about those <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rog-xbox-ally-vs-rog-xbox-ally-x-differences-price-specs/" id="148540">here</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 6.46pm</strong>: In a statement to Eurogamer, Epic Games' senior communications manager, Brian Sharon, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>"Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the 'Inappropriate Content' and 'Hateful or Abusive Content' policies. We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place."</blockquote>
<p>Original story follows.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Original story:</strong> Horses developer Santa Ragione has responded to comments from an Epic Games Store executive claiming he "made provably incorrect statements about the game's content".</p>
<p>Posting the statement online over the weekend, Santa Ragione refuted claims that Epic Games Store "love" the studio, alleging the storefront had "ghosted" it when it withdrew support for its controversial horror game at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Santa Ragione's Horses was, of course, the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">Santa Ragione claimed that it had received notification from Epic 24 hours before Horses' release</a>, explaining it would no longer distribute the game after its "review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines". Epic's email specifically referenced its policies around "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content", saying Horses contravenes guidelines prohibiting content that "promotes abuse and animal abuse", and "contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behaviour or [that is] not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated".</p>
<p>On this latter point, Epic said it had filled out an IARC Questionnaire based on the content it reviewed, receiving an Adult Only (AO) rating - a rating category it does not distribute on its storefront.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, however, Epic VP Steve Allison told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a> in an interview, "We love [Santa Ragione] [... but the studio's] answers were just different than... some of the moderators' were after they played through the game".</p>
<p>"Our time on this topic was limited, but it seems news of the Steam ban triggered an Epic review of the rating, which is usually produced via a self-reported submission to a ratings coalition," Game File's Stephen Totilo later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me7ljfxjes2i">clarified</a> on social media.</p>

<p>"The fact that the game does not deserve an AO rating is apparent from the widely available full walkthroughs on YouTube and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, as well as from its distribution on the Humble Store," the studio added.</p>
<p>Despite the issues distributing Horses, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/following-controversial-bans-from-steam-and-epic-santa-ragiones-horses-has-sold-18k-copies-and-repaid-debts">Santa Ragione has generated enough to repay the loans it took out in order to finish developing the game</a>, as well as the royalties owed to Horses creator Andrea Lucco Borlera.</p>

            <p>The creator of the Rayman series has once again teased that a remake of the original Rayman game is on the way.</p>

<p>"I think Rayman is still a fun game, and there's a lot of content," Michel told <a href="https://retrogamesofficial.com/">RetroGamer</a>. "The pacing is a bit slow because you have a big character on the screen. It also has pixel-precise gameplay, so it's not always easy, but it's interesting that the constraints of yesterday make it still feel original today.</p><p>"Even though it's complex, I think there's a kind of remake planned," he added. "I think it's a nice move, because [the lack of savepoints is] the only point that could be a problem for non-skilled players. But yeah, I think it's still a very nice game."</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps now one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-finally-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-rumours-with-a-gta-meme">second only to the Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>, the unannounced Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-unannounced-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-popped-up-on-the-australian-ratings-board">even popped up on the Australian Classification Board</a>. The Australian government has rated it a 'G' - the equivalent to the UK's 'U' - for its "very mild impact" violence. It's reportedly coming to both the PS5 and Nintendo Switch, with Atari listed as both the developer and publisher.</p>
<p>On the 30th anniversary of the Rayman series, towards the end of last year, brand producer Loic Gounon spoke about the history of the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-series-returns-to-life-on-its-30th-anniversary-but-dont-expect-a-new-game-soon">and provided a little teaser of what's to come</a>. In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>It's now unclear, however, if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake. The news wiped<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years"> over a third off its share price</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has "aggressively" been cracking down on cheaters and already banned "tens of thousands of players so far".</p>
<p>That's according to Embark Studios' CEO Patrick Söderlund, who told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">IGN</a> in a new interview that while he wasn't "going to give a specific number" on how many players have been caught cheating, with "anywhere between 0.1 percent to one percent of any multiplayer crowd in a large-scale multiplayer game is cheating", the team had to work hard to "be a step ahead".</p>

<p>"We have been pretty aggressive on this," Söderlund said. "The game wasn't prone to so many cheaters in the beginning, but as with all multiplayer games that get successful, this becomes a component, unfortunately. For us as developers, just like a [Distributed Denial-of-Service] attack, it's one of these things that you just have to try and be a step ahead. To be very honest with you, it's not always easy because the minute you do something, the minute you come up with something, they've come up with something else to do."</p>
<p>That's not the only difficulty, either. Söderlund said that the banning process alone is "delicate" because "we need to make sure that we ban people that deserve to be banned".</p>
<p>"If you take general figures, anywhere between 0.1% to 1% of any multiplayer crowd in a large-scale multiplayer game is cheating, and therefore, to some extent, should get a temporary or a longer, or permanent ban," Söderlund explained.</p>
<p>"It could be a minor thing that you're trying. An aim bot that may get you a 24-hour suspension, to doing something that, frankly, means you shouldn't be playing the game anymore. So, we've put together a system. We've started banning players, and why do I know that? Because I see an influx of people trying to get to the studio, and to me. 'Oh, I didn't do anything'.</p><p>"We're seeing a pretty substantial change in that, but I know that we have banned probably tens of thousands of players so far, that I know. Again, we need to make sure that we get it right. That we are fair, and that, in the case where it's clear that we didn't get it right, that we can quickly remedy the situation so that player isn't affected in an unfair fashion or way."</p>
<p>It's this need to be fair that does, Söderlund admits, result in "a little bit more cautio[n] than what I think some people want for that specific reason".</p>
<p>"Regardless of how cautious you are and what systems are in place, there are always people that are going to feel like they're treated unfairly that, 'I didn't do anything,' and then there are absolutely people that will get caught or that are unfairly banned that we need to deal with. We try and look at it from that perspective, but we will continue to go after people that are doing things in the game that they shouldn't do."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raider-is-committed-to-skill-and-fun-not-unfair-advantages-and-is-refunding-gear-lost-to-cheaters-even-if-you-didnt-report-them">Arc Raiders committed to returning items to your inventory if you lose them to cheaters</a> shortly after launch, saying it was "committed to skill and fun, not unfair advantages". And you don't even have to be the person to have reported them, either.</p><p>While finding and losing gear in extraction shooters is a key part of the experience, developer Embark Studios said it was working to ensure that players who lose out due to "unfair play" are compensated, regardless of whether or not they're the one who reported the cheaters in the first place.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p>Epic Games Store plans to be available on the next Xbox console at launch.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game">Game File</a>, Epic Games' Steve Allison said Xbox had "welcome[d]" the idea of including Epic's storefront on its hardware, adding "we're going to be there, like, on day one".</p>

<p>"We definitely plan to be on the new hardware for Xbox, because, unless their policy or stance on it changes, [Microsoft] are telling us they’re going to welcome that," Allison said. "And we're going be there, like, on day one. That will probably require us to build in whatever their requirements are, some sort of software to support that."</p>
<p>To do this, however, Epic needs to design a dedicated app for the next Xbox console, and Allison admitted, "we haven't built the apps for those that we need to build".</p>
<p>If this comes to pass, it'll herald a significant change in the console ecosystem, which, up until now, has been extraordinarily closed to third-party sellers.</p>
<p>Allison went further, confirming Epic Games Store now averaged around 67 million monthly users last year – around half of Steam's, Allison thinks – and generating a record $400 million (£294m) in revenue from the sale of third-party games.</p>
<p>Consequently, Epic now intends to expand into other markets, including on iOS in Japan, mobile in Brazil, add more social features (forums(!), specifically), and make it easier to switch between EGS' PC offerings and EGS on mobile. We should also expect an update to the store's game launcher later this year, too.</p>
<p>"We're ripping out the guts. We're replacing the guts with modern guts. That are faster, it won't have, like, a two-second lag on your refresh, it won't take as much system resources in your tray, all that stuff's underway."</p>
<p>In a different interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/epic-wants-to-bring-its-store-to-the-next-gen-xbox-as-it-begins-to-show-serious-growth-weve-been-talking-to-the-folks-at-microsoft">WindowsCentral</a>, confirming Epic Games had "been talking to the folks at Microsoft" and expected "serious growth" as it continues to build its sales business, Allison hinted that its free games program can have a significant impact on the sale of <em>its</em> free games on <em>other</em> platforms, like Steam and consoles.</p>
<p>"We take it very seriously," Allison said about its free games program. "The team loves to highlight games that they think are awesome, that may have been underserved or missed by players.</p>
<p>"We bring in 10 million new players a year through the program. It's very consistent. It's the best customer acquisition spend you can ever make, from a dollars-per-new-user standpoint," Allison added. "It's really important for our players. I would never want to see us rug pull it away from people, it's kind of part of our identity."</p>
