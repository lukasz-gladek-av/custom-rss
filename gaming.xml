                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day</a> is one of the best times of the year to buy those pricey electronics that you've been eyeing, such as a great pair of noise-canceling headphones that <em>actually </em>block out noise. And right now, two of the best pairs of noise-canceling headphones are available for markedly reduced prices. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's flagship WH-1000XM5 Bluetooth headphones</a></strong> are on sale for $300 at Amazon (click the coupon box). This matches the lowest price ever at Amazon. The XM5s were briefly available for this price earlier this year.</p><p>Amazon's XM5 deal is slightly hidden, as you need to click the coupon box on the listing to subtract $98 from the price. Only the black model is eligible for the coupon deal. Amazon's coupon discounts often don't remain available for as long as traditional deals.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones</a></strong>, which released last summer, for $349. Four different color options are eligible for this deal, and the offer is also available at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847981169951816547%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprime-day-sony-bose-bluetooth-headphones-and-earbuds-deals%2F1100-6509437%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a> as part of the retailer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-buy-black-friday-in-july-deals/2900-5599/" data-ref-id="2900-5599">Black Friday in July Sale</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4067282-sony-headset-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4067282" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4067282-sony-headset-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4067282"></a><figcaption>Sony WH-1000XM5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4067282-sony-headset-2.jpg"></figure><p>There's a lot of great technology packed into the XM5 headphones, but it's the noise-canceling features that make them one of the best around. This iteration uses what Sony calls "Auto NC Optimizer" to automatically adjust the noise-canceling function based on your wearing conditions and environment, resulting in excellent audio isolation.</p><p>Beyond that, the headset itself has a lightweight design with soft leather, the new Integrated Processor V1 provides a sumptuous range of Bluetooth-powered sound for your music-listening sessions, and its battery life can last up to 30 hours. If you're in a rush, you can easily grab a few hours of playback from just a few minutes of charging. The headphones come with a hardshell carrying case to keep them safe when not in use and while traveling.</p><p>The other big selling feature here is the selection of touch control settings that will allow you to pause, play, skip tracks, control volume, activate your voice assistant, and answer phone calls.</p><p>The QuietComfort Ultra headphones offer many of the same features as the XM5s, including superb noise cancellation. In this department, Bose's and Sony's premium headphones are hard to distinguish from each other. You can't go wrong with either if you're looking for headphones with noise cancellation.</p><p>The Ultras are a tad comfier thanks to a better headband design. Both pairs have swiveling earcups, but unlike the XM5s, the Ultras have a foldable design which leads to a smaller footprint for the included carrying case. The Ultras also have touch controls as well as aware (ambient) and quiet (noise-canceling) modes. Battery life isn't quite as good, as the Ultras only offer up to 24 hours on a full charge, and the fast-charging feature isn't <em>as </em>fast (15 minutes for 2.5 hours versus three minutes for three hours with the XM5s).</p><p>We've rounded up some of the notable Bluetooth headphone and earbud deals for Amazon Prime Day and Best Buy Black Friday in July below. Best Buy even has <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847999546871490091%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fprime-day-sony-bose-bluetooth-headphones-and-earbuds-deals%2F1100-6509437%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods for $70 (was $130)</a></strong>.

            <p>
With Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's October launch on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC inching ever-closer, Activision Blizzard has <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/07/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-mp-beta-dates-revealed">announced</a> a fresh set of dates for players' diaries, confirming it'll be hosting a multiplayer open beta this September, with those eligible for early access (which includes Game Pass subcribers) able to hop in one week prior.
</p>
<p>
Black Ops 6's multiplayer open beta - that is, the <em>actually</em> open beta, accessible to all players on all platforms - starts 6pm BST/10am PT, 6th September to 9th September. It'll let participants check out the game's Omnimovement system (which basically lets you run in any direction, not just forward), a variety of brand-new Treyarch-built maps across a number of squad-enabled modes, a non-specific selection of weapons, equipment, and Perks, plus loadout building.
</p>
<p>
As for the not-quite-so-open "early access" beta, that kicks off a week earlier, running from 6pm BST/10am PT on 30th August and concluding on 4th September. This initial session is only open to players who've pre-ordered the game on their respective platforms (there's no platform-exclusivity this time around) <em>and</em> to Game Pass subscribers.

<p>
Activision notes players who've pre-ordered the Vault Edition of Black Ops 6 can also use its items during the beta. So that's all four Operators from the Hunter vs. Hunted pack (Park, Adler, Brutus, and Klaus), plus its five Mastercraft weapons - the LR 7.62, Marine SP, Ames 85, Jackal PDW, and combat knife.
</p>
<p>
The publisher adds it'll be sharing more on Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's campaign, multiplayer, and zombies content in the "coming days and weeks". But if you want a bit more background on this year's Call of Duty instalment right now, Eurogamer's  Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">spoke to Treyarch</a> earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 24th October. It'll also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">available day one as part of a Game Pass subscription</a>, but Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">recent Game Pass service changes</a> mean new members will now need to pay more if they want to access it on launch day.

If you’re gaming on an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">Xbox Series X</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review">Series S</a> (or a Windows PC), you now have a plethora of great third-party options from the likes of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wired-Controller-Xbox-x/dp/B08F454ZK5?tag=theverge02-20">PowerA</a>, <a href="https://scufgaming.com/xbox-instinct-pro-controller">Scuf</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Revolution-Competition-Controller-Xbox-Customization-X/dp/B09RW9DL96?tag=theverge02-20">Nacon</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Xbox-Remappable-Enhancements-Superhuman-X/dp/B096H3SKXZ?tag=theverge02-20">Turtle Beach</a>, as well as high-quality <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vergexboxcontrollerbuyingguide&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-wireless-controller">first-party controllers</a>. The days of the cheap “little sibling” controller that looked cool but barely worked are over.</p><p>I’ve spent a ton of time playing all kinds of games (first-person shooters, fighters, third-person action-adventure, racing, indie roguelikes, etc.) to test a wide swath of Xbox controllers, and it may be unsurprising that the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Pulse-Red-Windows-Devices/dp/B0859XT328?tag=theverge02-20">Xbox Wireless Controller</a> is the best Xbox controller for most. It makes a great PC controller, too.</p><p>But while the <em>de facto</em> Xbox gamepad strikes the right balance of quality, comfort, versatility, and price, there are several alternatives worth cross-shopping if you have specific needs — ranging from high-end options like the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vergexboxcontrollerbuyingguide&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2%2F8rsn7j6375gg">Xbox Elite Series 2</a> and <a href="https://scufgaming.com/xbox-instinct-pro-controller">Scuf Instinct Pro</a> to quality budget picks like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wired-Controller-Xbox-x/dp/B08F454ZK5?tag=theverge02-20">PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller</a>. </p><div><p><h3>What we’re looking for</h3></p><p><h4><strong>Connectivity</strong></h4></p><p>Is it wireless? Does it support Bluetooth? Or is it wired only? If so, is the cable replaceable?</p><p><h4><strong>Quality</strong></h4></p><p>Does it feel cheap or nicely made? Any glitches or reliability issues while testing?</p><p><h4><strong>Extra features</strong></h4></p><p>Does it have handy extras like remappable buttons, or extra ones? </p><p><h4><strong>Customization</strong></h4></p><p>Can you remap buttons or tune it with custom software profiles? Are there fun cosmetic flares to its design?</p><p><h4><strong>Value</strong></h4></p><p>Is it priced affordably, about average, or does it come at a steep premium?</p></div><p><h3>The best Xbox controller for most people</h3></p><div><p>The official Xbox Wireless Controller has a dedicated share button for saving clips and screenshots and sharing them online, Bluetooth support, and a USB-C port for charging up&nbsp;Microsoft’s play-and-charge rechargeable battery.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> No / <strong>Software customization: </strong>No / <strong>Power: </strong>AA batteries or </em></small><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Microsoft-Xbox-Charging-Station-x/dp/B08K4NHVPG?tag=theverge02-20"><small><em>add-on rechargeable</em></small></a></p><p>Okay, I already know what you’re thinking. “The best controller for Xbox is the one that comes with the Xbox?” That may seem like a no-brainer, but this “standard” controller truly does earn this title as the best option for most Xbox gamers. It may lack some of the extra features that we’ll go over on premium options, but this controller is the distillation of four generations and numerous first-party controllers before it — and it shows.</p><p>This is the only affordable wireless Xbox controller out there, thanks to Microsoft’s proprietary protocol. While some may hate that it comes with AA batteries instead of a built-in rechargeable cell, that also means it’s flexible, allowing for rechargeable AAs or a battery pack. It also works as a wired accessory with a USB-C cable, and user-replaceable batteries mean you’re not stuck with a controller that doesn’t hold its charge after years of use.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The standard Xbox controller looks great, feels great, plays great, and is available in cool colors.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>AA batteries may not be ideal, but you can also use add-on rechargeable packs, like this one from </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Microsoft-Xbox-Charging-Station-x/dp/B08K4NHVPG"><em>Hori</em></a><em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Attention to detail: Microsoft color-matches the light-up Xbox button to the controller.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>But the standard-issue Xbox pad isn’t just great because of its connectivity. The hardware itself is excellent for the controller’s $60 asking price. The sticks, buttons, triggers, and the sunken dish-shaped D-pad all feel impeccably tight, with the latter having a satisfying clickiness to it. If you’re a hardcore fighting game fan, you may be better served by an arcade stick or a controller geared toward that genre — one with an impeccable D-pad like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LPY3BPK/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?tag=theverge02-20">Hori’s Horipad Pro</a> — but the Xbox Wireless Controller is an exceptional jack-of-all-trades.</p><p>The only things it really lacks compared to pricier options are extra, customizable buttons and software tuning for things like stick sensitivity, though Microsoft does offer cosmetic customization through its <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=vergexboxcontrollerbuyingguide&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fxboxdesignlab.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fxbox-design-lab">Xbox Design Lab</a>, which ranges from $69.99 to $99.94 depending on the configuration. There’s a lot to love about these controllers, whether you make your own or pick out one from the various colors Microsoft continues to offer.</p><p><h3>The best cheap Xbox controller</h3></p><div><p>The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller is a budget-minded wired controller for Xbox and PC that connects via Micro USB and features two customizable buttons on its rear. It’s offered in many different colors and licensed designs.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> Micro USB / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Two / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> Wired</em></small></p><p>If you’re looking for a great controller but you don’t have a lot of money to spend — and you don’t mind a cable — PowerA’s Enhanced Wired Controller offers an impeccable value without sacrificing too much. Its full retail price is $37.99, but some color schemes can dip as low as around $25. Speaking of colors, the Enhanced Wired Controller comes in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23171609/powera-enhanced-wired-controller-pastel-xbox-hands-on-impressions-photos">wide variety of hues</a> and designs, including licensed ones from game franchises like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Fallout</em>. Some of these designs may make you suspect these are cheap, cringe-inducing knockoffs, but the quality of the controller may surprise you when you use it.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>PowerA’s Enhanced Wired Controller is quite a great bargain, with all kinds of colors and unique designs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The customizable rear buttons are easy to operate without getting in the way.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>If only this controller had USB-C instead of Micro USB.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>First off, let’s get its biggest downside out of the way: it uses a Micro USB connection (gross, I know). You at least get a lengthy, detachable cable with it, but not having a reversible connector is annoying. Thankfully, nothing else about this controller feels so outdated. Its build quality is just fine, and it even has two mappable rear buttons built into the grips — which is great to have at such a low price.</p><p>The rest of the PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller is a whole lot of table stakes, but it executes everything quite well for a ridiculously affordable price. There’s no impulse trigger rumble, but if there’s any feature to cheap out on, I’d say that’s the right choice. On the flip side, the Enhanced Wired Controller comes with a two-year warranty, which is twice as long as pricey options like Microsoft’s Elite Series 2 offer. </p><p>PowerA offers a whole lot of bang for your buck with the Enhanced Wired Controller if you’re on a tight budget. It also sells the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Advantage-Wired-Controller-Xbox-Console/dp/B0C8C3JF9X?tag=theverge02-20">Advantage Wired Controller</a>, which is essentially a newer version of the Enhanced Wired Controller with USB-C and hair-trigger lockouts. The Advantage could be a shoo-in to dethrone the Enhanced Wired as the best budget controller, but at $37.99, it can’t yet match the Enhanced Wired’s near-perpetually discounted price of around $25. </p><p>If you have Elite controller tastes but a standard controller budget, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Wired-Controller-Xbox-X/dp/B0BVGQ175Y?tag=theverge02-20">PowerA Fusion Pro 3</a> is a fine alternative if you don’t mind that it’s wired. It looks a bit like the Microsoft Elite Series 2, complete with four rear buttons, trigger lockouts, and rubberized grips, but costs much less. The Fusion Pro 3 is significantly lighter than its predecessor, plus it has a more compact case and is $10 cheaper — offering quite the value for $79.99 (especially if it starts going on sale). The older <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Controller-gamepad-gaming-x/dp/B08XXWJ787?tag=theverge02-20">Fusion Pro 2</a> is still fine, especially if you prefer detachable rear paddles to built-in buttons, but at this point, it’s only worth it for that preference or if it’s heavily discounted.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="KM3tS8" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-FUSION-Wired-Controller-Xbox-X/dp/B0BVGQ175Y?tag=theverge02-20">PowerA Fusion Pro 3</a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->78</span></p><p>The Fusion Pro 3 is the latest version of PowerA’s affordable alternative to premium controllers like the Xbox Elite Series 2. It comes with swappable sticks, friction rings, a compact zip-up case, and features four programmable buttons built into its rear.</p></div><p><h3>The best premium Xbox controller </h3></p><div><p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is easily one of our favorite controllers at <em>The Verge</em>. It’s an improvement on the already excellent Elite controller, with deep customization, optional rear paddle buttons, a swappable D-pad, and analog sticks that allow you to tailor its layout to suit your play style.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Up to four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Built-in rechargeable</em></small></p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2</a> is Microsoft’s fancied-up, premium version of the stock controller. It’s also older, having been released a year before the Xbox Series X / S consoles arrived. So while it does sport a USB-C port and wireless support, it lacks the convenient Share button found on the latest Xbox Wireless Controller. However, it makes up for that in droves with exceptional build quality, extra buttons, user-swappable sticks and D-pad, and lots of customization.</p><p>If you pick up an Xbox Elite controller, you instantly recognize the quality of materials put into it. Where the standard controller uses an unassuming plastic build, the Elite mixes higher-quality plastic with rubberized grips and bits of metal. Combine this with its built-in rechargeable battery, and the Elite is noticeably heavier than its cheaper brethren. It also comes with a charging dock and zip-up case with passthrough charging. </p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The Xbox Elite Series 2 is made from premium materials but has a nice, subdued aesthetic.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The metal, dish-like D-pad is a small work of art. Sadly, however, it’s a far cry from the best D-pad around.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The four removable paddles on the rear sit beneath the trigger locks and charging dock pins.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>As excellent as the fit and finish are, the key components that may give you a competitive edge are the hair-trigger locks and rear paddle buttons. In theory, the hair trigger gets shots off faster when playing shooters, and the rear paddles allow you to jump, crouch, reload, etc., without taking your thumb off the right stick for aiming. However, using that many buttons on the back of the controller definitely takes some adjustment. You have to train new muscle memory, and since it requires dexterity with more fingers, they’re not for everyone. </p><p>These premium features come at a steep cost, too. The Elite Series 2 is normally priced at $179.99, and even though it occasionally drops as low as $139.99, it’s still more than twice as expensive as a regular Xbox controller. You have to really want its extra features and user customization, and if you’re not using its rear paddles or the software adjustments for stick sensitivity, you’re not getting your money’s worth. (And if you want to customize the colors, you’re looking at $209.99 for the <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">Design Lab</a> “Elite Package.”)</p><p>Microsoft also has a stripped-down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23340603/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-core-white-controller-release-date-price">Elite Series 2 “Core” version</a> with an MSRP of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Core-Controllers/dp/B0B789CGGQ?tag=theverge02-20">$129.99</a>, which is the same controller in white-and-black, red-and-black, or blue-and-black finishes without the rear paddles, accessory charging case, or extra stick toppers and D-pad. You can get all of those in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fcomplete-component-pack">a $30 accessories pack</a>, which turns the Elite Series 2 Core back into a standard Elite Series 2 and actually makes it a slightly better deal if the full package isn’t on sale.</p><p>You must also be aware that the Elite has a bit of a reputation for lackluster quality control, with horror stories from users about going through multiple replacements under warranty. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517317/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-hardware-issues-warranty">extended the controller’s warranty from 90 days to a year</a> in late 2020 to help address concerns, but buying an Elite Series 2 may still feel like a slightly risky proposition. However, when you nail that perfect sequence — switching to your pistol and landing a headshot with a quick pop-pop of the hair trigger while your thumbs stay firmly planted on the sticks — it can feel worth it.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features">Read our Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review</a>.</h5></p><p><h3>A formidable alternative to the Elite</h3></p><div><p>Scuf’s Instinct Pro is its top-tier controller for Xbox consoles and PC. It is the only third-party wireless option around, and for its very high price, you get rubberized grips, built-in mappable rear paddle buttons, hair-trigger locks, swappable sticks, and user-configurable cosmetics.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Xbox wireless, Bluetooth, wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> No / <strong>Power:</strong> AA batteries or </em></small><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hori-Microsoft-Xbox-Charging-Station-x/dp/B08K4NHVPG?tag=theverge02-20"><small><em>add-on rechargeable</em></small></a></p><p>The Scuf Instinct Pro finds itself in a bit of a weird spot, as it’s the only wireless option from a third party, but it’s by far the most expensive Xbox controller around (it starts at $199.99). The one I tested clocked in at $263.91 with a special faceplate and added color accents. That’s more than the Xbox Series S occasionally sells for, which is an entire console. Still,  you’re in for a treat if you’re okay with spending that kind of money, as the Instinct Pro is arguably better than Microsoft’s Elite in some very specific ways — primarily, its comfort and implementation of rear buttons and hair triggers.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>Scuf’s Instinct Pro is ultra-premium and very customizable — for an added cost.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The magnetic faceplate and sticks are easy to pop off and swap out.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Scuf’s rear rocker buttons and textured rubber grips are intricately detailed.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>The Instinct Pro has very unique rear buttons, and I actually prefer them. Instead of paddles, there are four rocker-like buttons built into the controller’s body that you push toward or away from your hand with a middle finger. It still requires training your brain a bit to get accustomed to it, but I found them more intuitive.</p><p>Rear buttons aside, the Scuf’s other big feature is its hair triggers, which have the quickest response of all the controllers tested here. Just flick a switch on the back, and the left and right triggers feel like you’re clicking a mouse — it’s incredibly satisfying. The hair triggers, rear buttons, and the excellent textured grip material on the controller’s underside make this controller a joy to use.</p><p>The Instinct Pro feels like Scuf essentially hot-rodded a stock Xbox controller, but like any boutique item, it comes with a massive cost. Meanwhile, it still uses AA batteries and lacks software customization, so as much as I enjoy using it, I’d only advise getting one if you’re super passionate about its very specific qualities or you absolutely love the colorful accents and magnetically swappable faceplates on <a href="https://scufgaming.com/instinct-pro-builder?source=collection">Scuf’s configurator</a>.</p><p><h3>The best customizable controller</h3></p><div><p>The RIG Nacon Revolution X is a wired controller for Xbox consoles and Windows PCs that offers a slew of detailed software customization options. It’s also got four customizable rear buttons, adjustable sticks, and optional weights to insert into the grips to give it more heft.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Wired / <strong>Connector type: </strong>USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons: </strong>Four / <strong>Software customization:</strong> Yes / <strong>Power:</strong> Wired</em></small></p><p>RIG’s Nacon Revolution X may be worthy of an award for terrible naming, but its real strengths are in its deep customization. If you’re the type that likes to endlessly tinker with lots of detailed settings, this is the controller for you. Normally priced at $99.99, the wired Revolution X and its added features don’t come cheap, but the price is a little fairer when you consider the competition it squares up against.</p><p>When you first pick up the Revolution X, it seems very unassuming — and borderline cheap. While it’s not a looker, it’s a form-follows-function type of controller. It’s comfy to use, and its four rear buttons built into the grips are large and nicely contoured. The real stars of this show, however, are the analog sticks and their software customizations, as well as the expansive custom options for other inner workings of the controller.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The Nacon Revolution X looks a little cheap at first, but its premium features are steeped in deep customization.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The rear grip covers open up to allow the optional weights to be added.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The controller, cable, stick tops, grip weights, and stick rings are all packaged in the included zipper case.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>While other user-customizable controllers have three user profiles you can swap between on the fly, the Revolution X has four — plus a “classic” mode with basic settings and a ring of RGB light around the right stick to remind you what mode you’re in. The software app is not the most user-friendly, but the controls go very in-depth. Thankfully, there are helpful starting points with presets for arcade fighting games, racing, FPS games, and even sniping, which makes the options much easier to understand. Add the ability to customize and remap every button on the controller, as well as a Dolby Atmos for Headphones app license, and you’ve got a lot of customization options.</p><p>The customization doesn’t stop with software, audio, or lighting, however. The Revolution X comes with ring spacers to adjust the range of the analog sticks, too, as well as a series of small weights ranging from 10g to 16g, which you can insert into its grips to give them an additional amount of heft. </p><p>Adding up all these features, you see why the Nacon is such a great controller for tinkering. It took me time to warm up to it, but upon setting it up the way I preferred, it made for a very compelling controller in a variety of game types.</p><p><h3>The best controller for shooters</h3></p><div><p>Turtle Beach’s Recon Controller is a USB-C-wired gamepad that offers a great deal of audio tweaking for wired headsets. Its Superhuman Hearing mode draws out footsteps and gunfire in the mix, and the two rear buttons help make it great for FPS games.</p></div><p><small><em><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Wired / <strong>Connector type:</strong> USB-C / <strong>Mappable rear buttons:</strong> Two / <strong>Software customization: </strong>No / <strong>Power: </strong>Wired</em></small></p><p>Turtle Beach is known for its headsets, so it makes sense that its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611872/turtle-beach-recon-controller-xbox-review-features-price">Recon wired controller</a> features some robust audio controls. Its strengths really come into focus when playing first-person shooters, where its Superhuman Hearing mode tweaks the audio of any wired headset to draw out footsteps and distant gunfire in the mix. At its regular price of around $60, and once selling as low as $39.95, the Recon is a fairly affordable way to gain a slight competitive edge in multiplayer games without spending well over $100 on a controller.</p><div><div><p><figcaption><em>The Turtle Beach Recon controller’s biggest strengths lie in its plethora of audio controls.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>It’s a bit much to take in at first, but these buttons allow for very handy audio controls when using a wired headset.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The bumpers, shoulders, and customizable rear buttons have an excellent textured pattern that feels great.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>This pad isn’t going to win any beauty contests thanks to all those awkward buttons located smack-dab in the middle of its forehead, but each one has a valid purpose. There are four levels of microphone monitoring, overall game volume controls, game chat volume mix, four EQ presets, four programmable modes for mapping the two rear buttons, and four levels of optional right-stick sensitivity adjustments. That last feature, dubbed Pro Aim by Turtle Beach, lowers the sensitivity of the right analog stick while you hold the right-hand rear button, allowing for very small movements like sniping, though it’s a bit clumsy to use.</p><p>Learning to use all these controls may sound daunting, but the <a href="https://support.turtlebeach.com/s/article/4404255528091-Recon-Controller-Quick-Start-Guide">controller’s quick-start guide</a> makes it easier. Superhuman Hearing is very helpful for shooters and worth using extensively for games like <em>Halo Infinite</em> — just be aware that it’s going to muddy up the soundtrack a little, so you may want to leave it off during story-driven, single-player games. </p><p>Audio controls aside, the Recon lacks fancy features like hair triggers and swappable thumbsticks, and the D-pad looks like the standard Xbox Wireless Controller but pales in comparison. The controller’s plastic build feels cheap, but the rubbery grips redeem it with a nice and comfy feel. As for the sticks, triggers, and additional rear buttons, they all feel tight and snappy. Combine that with Superhuman Hearing, and you’ve got a great recipe for shooters. The Recon has a bit of a learning curve, but if you play ranked matches and value a fairly priced wired controller with extra buttons and helpful audio functions, you can’t go wrong here.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611872/turtle-beach-recon-controller-xbox-review-features-price">Check out our full review of the Turtle Beach Recon</a>.</h5></p><p><h3>Other controllers worth knowing about</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G7-Wired-Controller-Windows/dp/B0BM9HRCCV?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>GameSir G7</strong></a> is an excellent wired controller with textured grip material feeling a tiny bit like a Scuf, clicky face buttons like a Razer, and two programmable rear buttons.

It has more customizable buttons than any other controller (six total), though their positioning requires reaching, and it’s a bit pricey.</li><li>Briefly mentioned above, the <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhori-pad-pro-wired-controller-for-xbox-series-x-xbox-one%2F-%2FA-86501139"><strong>Horipad Pro</strong></a> has one of the best D-pads around. It also offers a lot of software customization at an affordable price, but its shoulder buttons are a bit stiff.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/PowerA-Enhanced-Wired-Controller-Xbox-X/dp/B0B7P2GDZ5?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>PowerA’s Nano Enhanced Wired Controller</strong></a> is an adorably small guy for people with tinier hands or children. Unlike most kid-centric gamepads, it looks just like a full-size model, and unlike our budget pick from PowerA above, this one ditches Micro USB for USB-C (hallelujah!).</li><li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22556150/nacon-rig-pro-compact-review-xbox-series-x-s-one-pc-wired-controller-price-features"><strong>Nacon Pro Compact Controller</strong></a> has some of the Revolution X’s excellent software customization <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nacon-Compact-Controller-Dolby-Xbox-X/dp/B08YXHFQLW?tag=theverge02-20">at a much lower price</a>. It’s also one of the smaller options around, though the ergonomics may feel hit or miss depending on your hand size.</li><li>One of the dumbest yet most endearing controllers is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>Hyperkin Duke</strong></a>. This reissue of the original Xbox pad is a love letter to the salad days of 2001. It’s just not great to use for modern games. Thankfully it comes with a display stand, as it’s more of a collector piece.</li><li>Unlike the Duke, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Xenon-Controller-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C5DZHCY9?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>Hyperkin Xenon</strong></a> is a reissued gamepad that’s actually worth using, especially if you have an affinity for the mid-aughts Xbox 360 design. The original 360 controller’s biggest innovation was its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/17/17862306/xbox-360-controller-button-wireless-multiplayer">intuitive wireless system</a>, which is sadly absent from this wired reincarnation. But hey, at least Hyperkin improved on the Xbox 360 controller’s awful D-pad and included some cool <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Xenon-Controller-Windows-Gaming-Console/dp/B0C5DYLJD6?tag=theverge02-20">color-matched USB-C cables</a>.</li><li>I also tested the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23408638/turtle-beach-recon-cloud-controller-xbox-pc-android-price-availability"><strong>Turtle Beach Recon Cloud</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725207/powera-moga-xp-ultra-mobile-xbox-hybrid-wireless-controller-price-specs"><strong>PowerA MOGA XP-Ultra</strong></a>. While the latter is noteworthy for being the first third-party wireless Xbox controller, neither made the cut due to high costs and niche use cases. The recommendations above present better alternatives unless you really want to use a controller with an Android phone — which, frankly, you can do with a standard Xbox controller and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Mobile-Gaming-Xbox-Wireless-Controllers/dp/B08TL96LYC?tag=theverge02-20">a cheap phone clip</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/30/23981792/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-xbox-pc-wireless-controller-antidrift-announcement-price"><strong>Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra</strong></a> is an interesting new contender that we haven’t yet tested. It has a 1.5-inch display for adjusting audio settings (and checking social media, apparently), swappable Hall effect sticks, microswitches, hair triggers, remappable rear buttons, and customizable RGB lighting. It’s the brand’s first fully wireless Xbox controller, too, and comes with Bluetooth to allow compatibility with other platforms. All of these features contribute to the controller’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=theverge02-20">$199.99 price tag</a>, which puts it in the ultra-premium territory that Turtle Beach hasn’t dabbled in until now.</li><li>Modular controllers are getting a little funkier with the release of <a href="https://eshop.thrustmaster.com/en_us/eswap-x2-pro-controller.html"><strong>Thrustmaster’s eSwap X2 Pro</strong></a>. We haven’t tested it and thus can’t recommend the wired Xbox / PC gamepad, but we’re putting it on the radar for those who might appreciate having hot-swappable analog sticks, triggers, grips, and D-pad. It’s one of the only customizable controllers we’ve seen that lets you rearrange the positioning of D-pads and sticks however you want, and you can even buy a <a href="https://eshop.thrustmaster.com/en_us/eswap-x-racing-module-forza-horizon-5-edition.html">racing module</a> that’s meant to simulate a steering wheel. Unfortunately, none of the analog stick modules feature Hall effect sensors, and there are quite a few reports that the standard mini-stock modules are prone to degrading after a short time.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=theverge02-20"><strong>PDP’s Victrix Pro BFG</strong></a> (wireless) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Victrix-Gambit-Tournament-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CRZ81L8K/ref=asc_df_B0CRZ81L8K/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=693459401938&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=5902966588197599316&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9026954&amp;hvtargid=pla-2310650876772&amp;mcid=56d7cd3f36fb3c7ab385002e782ca403&amp;gad_source=1&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20"><strong>Victrix Gambit Prime</strong></a> (wired) are another pair of modular controllers getting decent reception right now, though we haven’t tested them yet. Both allow you to remove modules and swap in others, including alternate D-pad designs, taller thumb sticks, hexagonal gates for the analog sticks, and even a fighting pad that gives you six frontal face buttons. The controllers also have programmable rear buttons and customizable hair triggers (the Gambit Prime uniquely lets you customize the back paddle to give you access to two or four extra buttons), but their lack of rumble may be a nonstarter for some.</li></ul></div><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/full-dev-build-of-warhammer-40000-space-marines-2-leaks-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-beta-has-been-canned-campaign-length-is-around-12-hours/">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marines 2</a> will be released on 9 September 2024. However, a complete dev build of the game has somehow been leaked online. The build is fully playable and is a whopping 75GB. While it is fully playable, it is still missing some assets. The build seemingly includes server binaries that include Linux, allowing players to connect and co-op with their friends in the build. The files contain the debug exe file and the dev playground.</p>
<p>While this has gone live, we strongly suggest&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> downloading the dev build for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marines 2. Not only could there be a considerable risk of malware and other viruses knocking about in the files, but it was not meant to be put on the internet mere weeks before the game's official release.</p>
<p>Because of the dev build appearing online, in-game footage of Space Marines 2 is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsIN65oeFlM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now available on YouTube</a>. While you can choose to watch this, be warned that there will be spoilers if you plan on getting the game's full upcoming release.</p>
<p>With how polished this dev build of Warhammer 40,000 Space Marines 2 is, it's possible that this is very recent and could be from within the last month. The game was recently announced as going gold, so it tracks that the dev build online would be so polished aside from placeholder assets.</p>
<p>The dev build that has been released is supposedly playable from start to finish, with very few frame issues and bugs along the way. However, it remains to be seen if this is a legitimate build of the game or not.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, neither Focus Entertainment nor Saber Interactive has released a statement on the build online. However, it is likely that they will try to find ways to remove it from the internet.</p>
<p>We don't know how it leaked, but it was randomly posted to a tracker with a date of June 20, 2024, listed next to it, suggesting that this dev build could be one of the final builds they have for the game.</p>
<p>Should any updates be released about the dev build and how it came to be on the internet, we will update you accordingly so that you can keep up to date with all of the news on Warhammer 40,000: Space Marines 2.</p>

<p>GameSpot corroborated the news with an EA spokesperson, who said that "an update on the Team Builder website tool will be provided at worldwide launch on July 19."</p><p>College Football 25 is currently available in early access for people who bought the Deluxe Edition. In case you missed it, there's also a free 10-hour trial that begins on July 16 via EA Play. While Team Builder isn't available for the time being, there's plenty to fiddle around with in the meantime, such as Dynasty Mode, where you can start as a head coach or a coordinator that progressively gains renown.</p><p>The global launch of College Football 25 is on July 19. If you want to get a headstart, there's an easter egg for the Road to Glory mode where you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-football-25-easter-egg-lets-you-graduate-early-and-earn-more-xp/1100-6524945/" data-ref-id="1100-6524945">graduate early and earn more XP</a>.</p>

			<p>Leaks suggested that EA Sports FC 25 was around the corner, and they have since been confirmed. EA unveiled the brand new iteration of the franchise shortly after Spain won the Euros Championship. The full announcement for the latest football game will be fully revealed on July 17.</p>
<p>The details for this game are slim, but they will all be announced on July 17. For now, we know of the star-studded cast gracing the front cover of EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition. It includes football legends such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Gianluigi Buffon, Aitana Bonmati, and Jude Bellingham. You can expect to see Jude Bellingham's face on the front cover for the Standard Edition of the game.</p>
<p>According to the internet leaks, the game will be released sometime in September 2024. It will be on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC. This allows football fans to play it across various platforms should they want to get stuck in the game.</p>
<p>These leaks come from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ea-sports-fc-25-voici-la-date-prevue-de-lannonce-du-jeu-et-les-stars-de-couverture-de-son-edition-ultimate-55459">well-known leakier billbil-kun</a>, after creating a report on Dealabs to announce the release date of EA Sports FC 25. Since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-series-entirely-removed-from-digtal-storefronts-ahead-of-ea-sports-fc-24/">end of EA's partnership with Fifa</a>, this is the second iteration in the franchise carrying the brand new name of the series.</p>
<p>Within these internet leaks, they have suggested that the Ultimate Edition of EA Sports FC 25 will cost a hefty price tag of $99.99, with the Standard Edition costing a slightly more reasonable $69.99. Considering these games are very similar and don't have many changes between each iteration, it is a shock to see that this game will cost this much.</p>
<p>According to the leaks, the official release date for the game will be September 27, 2024. The owners of the Ultimate Edition will benefit from a 7-day Early Access period before the full release of the Standard Edition.</p>
<p>This is the only information we have on the upcoming EA Sports FC 25, but there will be an update once EA has officially revealed its plans for the game on July 17.</p>

He would later appear in the nature-doc spin-off series <em>Wildboyz </em>alongside Chris Pontius as well as in numerous <em>Jackass </em>films, too. These days, he’s got a popular podcast and YouTube channel and has been sober for over a decade. But back at the height of <em>Jackass</em>-mania—the mid ‘00s—Steve-O was offered a few video game gigs. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/videos/steve-o-has-never-played-the-jackass-game-star-players/2300-6464586/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/steve-o-has-never-played-the-jackass-game-star-players/2300-6464586/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new video interview with <em>Gamespot</em></a></span>, Steve-O confessed to long thinking games were a waste of time. However, he’s come around on them now, realizing that everyone has their own ways of having fun. In the interview, he also revealed that he doesn’t play many games (though he does enjoy <em>Angry Birds</em>) even though he’s appeared in three different video games. </p><p>First, he appeared in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nfl-2k5-says-new-england-wins-a-super-bowl-shootout-5882210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nfl-2k5-says-new-england-wins-a-super-bowl-shootout-5882210"><em>NFL 2K5</em></a></span> in 2005, a beloved PS2-era football game that was so good (and cheap) that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://grantland.com/features/tom-bissell-making-madden-nfl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://grantland.com/features/tom-bissell-making-madden-nfl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it scared EA</a></span> into exclusively locking up the NFL license for its <em>Madden </em>franchise to avoid competition. According to Steve-O, he was paid “exactly $100,000” to appear as one of five celebrity coaches you could challenge to a digital football match. The other celebs? Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Funkmaster Flex, and Carmen Electra. </p><p>Next, Steve-O was featured in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/tony-hawk-s-underground-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/tony-hawk-s-underground-2"><em>Tony Hawk’s Underground 2</em></a></span>. While he was basically just a voice and a photo in<em> NFL 2K5</em>, in <em>THUG2 </em>he was a secret skater that you could find and unlock, with his own in-game character model, exclusive tricks, and even a unique mechanical bull that he used instead of a skateboard. Funnily enough though, while he was a bigger part of <em>THUG2</em>, Steve-O says Activision only paid him $5,000 to appear in the game. </p><p>Finally, in 2007 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">Steve-O appeared as one of the main characters in <em>Jackass: The Game</em></a></span>. According to the stunt performer, he hadn’t played the game until <em>Gamespot </em>set up a PS2 and let him try it out during the interview. As for how much he got paid to appear in <em>Jackass: The Game</em>, Steve-O doesn’t say, but implied it was far less than <em>NFL 2K5. </em></p><p>“Jackass was <em>really </em>good at not paying us that much,” explained Steve-O.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players can also dive and spin around in a full 360 degrees, and the movement system will be active across the entire game, including campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's podcast includes an interview with Treyarch's associate design director, Matt Scronce, who goes more in-depth about this new movement system. The developer explains that Black Ops 6's movement gives people the opportunity to live out the action hero fantasy, but says that players can still play and "hold their own" against opponents utilizing omnidirectional movement if they choose not to use the advanced movement features and prefer standard Call of Duty movement.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've been very conscious of making sure that we're not widening the skill gap too much," Scronce says. "If you just want to slow down, [the movement] you can and still be successful, you just may not look as cool. And that's fine."</p><p dir="ltr">Players won't be forced to partake in the action-style diving and sliding, but they won't be able to toggle off the new movement feature either. "Omnimovement is a core foundational feature that cannot be disabled by a player," Scronce confirms.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to omnidirectional movement, Black Ops 6 also features Treyarch's new "intelligent movement" system, which aims to reduce how many buttons or keys players need to press to perform movements.</p><p dir="ltr">Scrone says that the intelligent movement feature is optional, so players will be able to toggle this feature on and off as they choose. The developer reveals this feature will be off by default, but players can toggle it on to have access to three settings with tunable options for each, with the goal to reduce key presses for actions like sprinting and mantling cover.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also used this podcast to reveal the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-revealed/1100-6524972/">beta dates for Black Ops 6</a>, and with such drastic looking changes to Call of Duty's movement, this will be a good opportunity for players to test out the new movement mechanics before launch. Here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">everything you need to know to access the beta</a>.</p><p>Additional Black Ops 6 details will be provided during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on August 28.</p>

It is called <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/meghanlynnftw/hunter-ed"><em>HUNT(er/ed)</em></a>, a TTRPG about monsters and those that hunt them. It has several prolific indie designers attached, and it was fully funded three hours after going live.</p>
<h2>The <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>
<p>According to its campaign page, <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> is a two-player experience of pursuit, determination, and what it means to be a monster. The game is played with a standard deck of cards and a pair of six-sided dice. The TTRPG will be a 32-page zine printed by Mixam and feature cover art by the Ennie-award-winning illustrator Sonya Henar.</p>

The other is the alienated and hated monster, determined to survive by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Once characters are created, players take turns rolling dice. Rolling doubles causes you to progress one step further to your goal: freedom or capture. When this happens, both players are provided a roleplaying prompt, letting them act out the events and memories of that section of the hunt. Will the hunter slay the monster, or will some common ground be found?.</p>
<p><em>HUNT(er/ed</em>) was written and designed by Meghan Cross and Dillin Apelyan. Apelyan, aka Superdillin on social media, is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/crit-awards-no-longer-attending-gencon-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">CRIT Award</a>-winning designer and AP player. Their work includes the AP <em>The Atomless</em>, Dropout's <em>Adventuring Academy</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Critical Role's</a> Critter Hug, and writing contributions to <em>City of Mist: Local Legends</em> and <em>Capers: Cyberpunk</em>.</p>
<p>As for Cross, this is her third tabletop Kickstarter campaign. She specializes in GMless and Solo RPG experiences, such as the post-apocalyptic garden tending game <em>Weeds in the Waste</em> and a game about places of power and guardians, aptly named <em>Sanctuary &amp; Sentinel</em>. She has also been featured on WebDM, Party of One, and Protean City Comics.</p>
<p>The pledge tiers of <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Digital Edition for $15:</strong> A PDF copy of the game distributed through itch.io</li>
<li><strong>Physical Edition for $20:</strong> A physical copy of the game</li>
<li><strong>Physical &amp; PDF for $25:</strong> A PDF and physical copy</li>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition for $125 (Only 10 Available)</strong>: A PDF, physical copy, and a custom engraved hook and loop game</li>
</ul><p>At time of writing, the <em>HUNT(er/ed)</em> Kickstarter campaign has raised <span><span>$3,106, surpassing its initial funding goal of $2,500. It also unlocks a stretch goal: a custom deck of roleplaying prompt cards. The deck of cards will be included in all Deluxe Edition pledges and can be bought as a separate add-on for $12. The campaign concludes August 14.</span></span></p>

            <p>
Tove Jansson's beloved Moomins are heading to Journey developer ThatGameCompany's acclaimed free-to-play "social adventure" Sky: Children of the Light this autumn, and there's more news on its upcoming animated series Sky: The Two Embers, which is now due next year.
</p>
<p>
Sky: Children of the Light, which initially launched for iOS back in 2019 before expanding to PC and consoles, is a sort of leisurely puzzle adventure set among the different realms of a beautiful kingdom in the clouds - and it's all built around a gently collaborative multiplayer core designed to encourage "compassion, friendship, and altruism".
</p>
<p>
It's also a game that follows a live-service-style seasonal model, with those seasons occasionally featuring collaborations with other properties and people. Sky: Children of the Light has, for instance, already run seasons based on The Little Prince, animated movie A Deer of Nine Colours, and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/journey-devs-sky-children-of-light-launching-musical-experience-with-frozen-2-star">music artist Aurora</a>, and we now know the Moomins are up next.

<figcaption>Sky x Moomin teaser trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEN0OYYjGYM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As announced during <a href="https://www.thatskygame.com/news/skyfest-2024-an-anniversary-celebration-like-no-other/">this year's SkyFest</a>, a two-week long community celebration running from 12th-26th July, the Moomins are coming to Sky: Children of the Light in their own "rich, narrative-driven" season this autumn. It'll see players journeying to Moominvalley to experience an adaptation of the 1962 Moomin tale The Invisible Child, with a new story chapter releasing each week throughout the season.
</p>
<p>
"This new season also celebrates the importance of being true to yourself and overcoming obstacles from childhood, ThatGameCompany says in an accompanying press release. "It uses subtle yet reflective storytelling to express the cross-cultural themes of the Moomin stories, such as family, friendship, nature, and introspection." 
</p>
<p>
While ThatGameCompany isn't saying much more about its Moomin collaboration right now, it <em>has</em> offered another look at Sky: Children of the Light's upcoming dialogue-free animated series, Sky: The Two Embers. Initially announced back in 2022, the series is now due to arrive next year, and Sky: The Children of Light will host two seasons based on its twin stories - that of the Dawn and Dusk Ember - in 2025. ThatGameCompany's announcement was accompanied by a new trailer and a  several-minutes-long clip from the first episode, but the only footage of both right now comes from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVZmYDYK6t0">in-game SkyFest 2024 stream</a>.
</p>
<p>
Expect to hear more on the above as release dates draw nearer, and if you haven't yet dabbled in Sky: Children of the Light, it's available for iOS, Android, Switch, PlayStation, and PC.

Murray is leading a small team of developers to create an RPG where the map is the size of Earth, because why under-promise and over-deliver when you can pitch players the moon, or something even bigger than that? “I’m convinced it’s either <em>Light No Fire</em> or the biggest <em>No Man’s Sky</em> update ever,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CharOnTwitch/status/1812849903636304196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CharOnTwitch/status/1812849903636304196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> streamer CharOnTwitch. “Never seen Sean hype something this much before.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2719590/Light_No_Fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Light No Fire </em>has a Steam page</a></span> but we haven’t heard anything else about it since the announcement. It’s possible Murray is psyching fans out for a new trailer or some other reveal about the game, perhaps with a deeper dive planned for Gamescom next month. August also marks the eighth anniversary of <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s original launch, the perfect time to completely reinvent the game again with something entirely new. Maybe players are finally going to get those long-requested custom space stations. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Built with Hall Effect sticks to resist drift, a slightly reworked form factor for improved ergonomics, and a built-in Share button that works with Xbox Series X, the controller is a nice blend of retro style and modern convenience.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>The Dutchess also has a 3.5mm jack and bumpers that serve as Black and White buttons from the original Xbox pad (which are still awkwardly placed beneath the face buttons). These controllers aren't wireless, but they do come with a 10-foot detachable braided USB-C cable for a low-latency play experience. The Duchess Wired Controller is available in black or white, both of which are officially licensed by Xbox.</p><p>The Duchess isn't the first retro Xbox controller designed by Hyperkin, as the brand is also responsible for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Duke Wired Controller</a>. This one is modeled after the original, ultra-bulky Xbox controller that was the predecessor to the Xbox Controller S. If you want to add it to your collection, you'll find it on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> for just $60 (down from $90).</p><p>Hyperkin's Duke was quite popular when it first launched, and we wouldn't be surprised if the Hyperkin Duchess Wired Controller follows in its footsteps. So if you want to ensure you can add it to your collection this summer, be sure to land a preorder while it's in stock.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-deal-walmart-prime-day-2024/1100-6524765/">PS5 DualSense Edge Controller Gets First Major Discount Ahead Of Prime Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-weve-ever-seen/1100-6522718/">This Is The Best Nintendo Switch Lite Deal We've Ever Seen</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/walmart-deals-prime-day-2024/2900-5577/">Huge Walmart Sale Features Incredible Gaming Deals Ahead Of Prime Day</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Early Prime Day Deals to Shop Now Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meta-quest-3-vr-headset-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet-at-walmart/1100-6524762/">Meta Quest 3 Deal Restocked At Amazon, No Longer Available At Other Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/9-nintendo-switch-exclusives-are-35-ahead-of-prime-day/1100-6524715/">Grab Super Mario, Zelda, And More Nintendo Switch Exclusives For $35 While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-joy-con-super-mario-party-bundle-deal/1100-6518931/">Super Mario Party Joy-Con Bundle Is Cheaper Than The Controllers By Themselves</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-a-pair-of-apple-airpods-for-only-69-at-amazon-before-this-very-nice-deal-sells-out/1100-6519008/">Grab A Pair Of Apple AirPods For Only $69 At Amazon Before This Very Nice Deal Sells Out</a></li>   </ul> </div>

However, new players may find themselves wondering what each of the different symbols mean, or how to tell what quests are worth their time. This guide will explain the three main types of quests, as well as how to tell if a quest can or can’t be completed.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,196742,196411" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h35653"><a id="msq"></a>Main Scenario Quests</h2><figure id="" data-id="ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-recommend-id="image://ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a main story quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character accepts a main story quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-recommend-id="image://ca2e4e255d5044d6db3e007bf30b2da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a main story quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As the name implies, Main Scenario Quests (or MSQs) are the primary quests players will undertake. They can be identified by a circle with what appears to be flame or smoke trailing from them (it is actually a meteor, a reference to the meteor which struck Eorzea shortly before the game rebooted as <em>A Realm Reborn</em> in 2013).<strong> </strong><br></p><p><strong>MSQs drive the story forward and completion of them is usually required to gain access to important features such as jobs and new areas</strong>. You should prioritize these if you’re looking for more diverse and exciting gameplay while also providing a larger focus on story than other quests. <br></p><h2 id="h35654"><a id="fq"></a>Feature Quests</h2><figure id="" data-id="dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-recommend-id="image://dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character cheers as they accept a Feature Quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character cheers as they accept a Feature Quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-recommend-id="image://dda75f37b2eeeb0cfc1bbdaca2440b27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character cheers as they accept a Feature Quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Feature Quests are quests that unlock content in the game. Their icon features a blue background with a yellow exclamation mark in the center and a plus sign on the left side.. If MSQs are the primary focus of a new player, Feature Quests should be a close second. Not only are these quests required to upgrade your Class to a Job, but <strong>some of them are a great way to learn how to best play your role </strong>and will provide rewards specifically suited to your Job. They also have their own unique storylines which can be just as deep and engrossing as those experienced in the MSQ.</p><p>It is important to remember where your Class’ Guild is early on as once you reach a certain point in the MSQ, you will unlock various Feature Quests from the guilds around your starting area. Before you know it, you’ll have a map full of blue quest markers. Generally, you should focus on your starting Class’ Guild, but it is worth checking in with new Feature Quests that open up to see what they offer At this point in the game, it may be a little early to start focusing on a combat Job different from your main one as you are still early in your starting Class, but some of these Feature Quests may allow you to start leveling a crafting or gathering role, called Disciples of the Hand and Disciples of the Land respectively. There is no harm in picking these up now if you’re interested in them as they can help build your character without stalling progress on your primary Job. It can also be fun to take on a different Job’s Feature Quest to mix up the usual gameplay loop. </p><h2 id="h35655"><a id="sq"></a>Side Quests</h2><figure id="" data-id="434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-recommend-id="image://434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a side quest on busy street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character accepts a side quest on busy street." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-recommend-id="image://434bcd9ec6bc82d6bdadefbd99a06daf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character accepts a side quest on busy street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You will see a ridiculous amount of Side Quests while playing <em>FF14</em>. This can be a completionist’s nightmare. Like other games, these quests normally tell their own standalone stories and have little to no impact on the rest of the game. They also tend to provide less valuable rewards for completion. On the flip side, they can be completed fairly quickly and are almost always simple fetch quests, or have you go kill a certain amount of a specific monster. </p><p><strong>Due to their simplicity, new players should not spend too much time on Side Quests as they can easily lead to burnout</strong>. But don’t dismiss them entirely. Some of the first Side Quests you’ll encounter teach basic game mechanics such as emoting or interacting with objects, but you can most likely learn these without picking up the quest to do so. The best method to handle Side Quests is to pick up any you see, but then prioritize your focus on MSQs and Feature Quests. </p><p>If MSQ’s and Feature Quests take you to an area in close proximity to the Side Quest location, it doesn’t hurt to stop in, kill some monsters and continue on your way. Then, next time you are in the area where the sidequest was offered, turn it in and enjoy a small amount of EXP and some clutter removed from your quest log. </p><h2 id="h35656"><a id="gqm"></a>Green Quest Markers</h2><figure id="" data-id="66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-recommend-id="image://66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character turns in a completed quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character turns in a completed quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-recommend-id="image://66b16c3e862160448417dfb8f72b1549" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character turns in a completed quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike the other Quests listed, Green Quests markers don’t have a specific name. But if you see one, you should go to it immediately as it indicates the final step in a quest you’re currently on. These markers will appear for MSQs, Feature Quests or Side Quests. A Green Marker means it’s time to get ready for some EXP and other rewards. We like Green Quest Markers.</p><h2 id="h35657"><a id="RQM"></a>Red Quest Markers</h2><figure id="" data-id="141bc3656b1b8e2f185377c53ad3c1fc" data-recommend-id="image://141bc3656b1b8e2f185377c53ad3c1fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character cannot proceed with a quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character cannot proceed with a quest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="141bc3656b1b8e2f185377c53ad3c1fc" data-recommend-id="image://141bc3656b1b8e2f185377c53ad3c1fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character cannot proceed with a quest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like Green Quest Markers, Red Quest Markers don’t have a specific name. And they aren’t a type of quest either.A Red Quest marker simply means the quest can’t be completed at this time. </p><p>You’ll typically see these when you’re too low-leveled to accept a certain questl. Alternatively, you might see a Red Quest Marker if you haven’t proceeded far enough into a given quest to unlock it. </p><p>Normally, you’ll first see these for Feature Quests for various guilds that haven’t opened up yet as you haven’t moved the story far enough yet. Of course, there is no harm in interacting with Red Quest Markers as they will simply describe the reason they are preventing progress.In some instances, you might just be missing an item that can be easily obtained. For example, one early quest asks you to turn in a High Potion to complete it. Until you’ve obtained a High Potion, this quest will have a Red Quest Marker. Once you collect a High Potion, you’ll see the Red Quest Marker turn into a shiny Green one, which we just learned are our favorites.</p><hr><p><em>FF14</em>’s many different kinds of quests and markers might seem a little confusing at first, but once you spend enough time with the game, they’ll become second nature. Just remember that MSQs should always be completed since they offer some of the best moments of the game. Feature Quests should be done if they interest the player as they provide some of the better rewards and storylines. Side Quests should be saved for when they can be finished at your leisure, but don’t need to take priority. You can obviously interact with the game in any manner you see fit, but by prioritizing the best content <em>FF14 </em>has to offer, you can prevent burnout and instead sink yourself into the more satisfying content of the riveting world of Eorzea.</p><p>.<br></p><h2 id="h35658"><a id=""></a><br></h2></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-review-in-progress-beta-impressions.927876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Grab a copy of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch</a> off some dusty GameStop shelf and rub it under the musky armpit of the Guardians of the Galaxy’s Peter Quill and you might have something close to the feeling of Concord. As competitive hero shooters go, this sci-fi contender from Sony plays it quite safe, complete with immediately charming characters immaculately rendered in gobsmackingly beautiful cutscenes and ability-based PvP combat that never addresses why those characters are fighting one another when they’re clearly allies in said cutscenes. But just because it doesn’t offer much in the way of innovation doesn’t mean Concord isn’t extremely fun to play. I still have lots more to see when it launches properly next month, but with 16 characters and four familiar game modes available in its preorder beta this past weekend, the vast majority of the 10+ hours I’ve spent with it so far have been a sweaty, gun-toting good time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>You and your squad will form a five-person team of super-powered characters, each with their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and special abilities, and then bring them to bear against an opposing team in a variety of formulaic game modes. Those include a standard deathmatch mode, a “Kill Confirmed” mode called Trophy Hunt, an attack-and-defend mode called Cargo Run, and a zone control mode called Clash Point – none of which possess even the slightest hint of novelty. But being overly familiar isn’t necessarily a bad thing if you’ve got best-in-class gunplay and awesome characters with compelling powers to back it up, and boy, Concord has got both of those down pat.</p><p>Concord sagely keeps its weapon selection very slim, with just two options given to each character by default and no way to customize that – but the upshot there is that every single weapon feels incredibly responsive and finely tuned, and no two characters have weapons that feel at all similar. The arena-controlling old lady, Duchess, wields a submachine gun that’s devastating at close range, while the sneaky and tactical Vale mostly relies on a long-range sniper rifle to take out enemies from afar. Not everything seems perfectly balanced – I, for one, think most things should probably die when they take a sniper rifle shot to the head, and it’s a bit weird that the character that uses a slow-loading missile launcher as her main weapon doesn’t do more damage with it – but they all feel really good to use, and that means I’ve been having fun even when it feels like something needs tweaking here and there.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Every weapon feels responsive and the abilities are largely fantastic.</p></div><p>Similarly, the abilities that complement those weapons are fantastic, diverse, have very generous cooldowns, completely changing the way combat plays out depending on which character you’re playing as. The floating, fireball-chucking Haymar can blind opponents for a period of time and make them pay for standing in the same spot too long, while the rampaging ogre, Star Child, can close distances quickly with his charging attack and smash the ground to do heavy damage around him. Not all characters feel quite as original, like how Teo is the world’s most generic soldier and comes equipped with a smoke grenade and cluster grenade as his two powers, but those bland options are few and far between. Learning each character, using their abilities to counter the team comp of your opponents, and juggling the madness on the battlefield with top-notch gunplay was just as fun in my first match as it was in my 30th, and I certainly can’t say I’ve felt that way about most hero shooters I spend time with.</p><p>One of the few novel twists Concord brings to the genre is the way its competitive playlist works. Unlike the casual playlist where you can play whichever character you please (so long as someone else hasn’t already selected it), in competitive you cleverly aren’t allowed to select the same character again if you win a round while using them. Since matches go to best of seven rounds, that means winning one will push you to get outside of your comfort zone and use a minimum of four different characters. Not only is this a neat way to force people to master more than just one or two options, it also encourages communication with your team between rounds to ensure you’ve got proper coverage to play out whatever strategy you’re trying to pull off as your options get slimmer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The other interesting wrinkle Concord adds to the formula is character variants: Slightly different versions of existing characters that come with a unique perk and an altered appearance, and which can be unlocked by completing specific objectives during matches. For example, the gunslinger Lennox can normally reload his weapon by dodging, while the variant you can unlock for him loses that ability, but gets more ammo for all his weapons instead. The five variants available for each character so far offer mostly minor changes like this, but they definitely add a meaningful thing to chase that provides more options in combat. Perhaps more importantly, they also give you the opportunity to fudge the numbers a bit in the competitive playlist, since variants count as separate characters on your crew, and therefore, let you play as the same characters in multiple rounds.</p><p>I also just love that Concord is chock full of goofy terms in its “How To Play” tutorial section, like how it tells you if certain game modes are likely to be sweaty by assigning them a “Sweatstrum” rating, or how it explains you can recharge your abilities with “Sloops,” AKA “Skill Loops.” There might not be much of a story yet, but this game’s got charm coming out of its Martian ears.</p><p>There’s still more I haven’t been able to play in this early beta version, like the two game modes that remain locked for now, but Concord is already shaping up to be a heavyweight hero shooter I could easily see competing with the genre’s giants. It doesn’t seem like it will bring much new to the table, and that’s a bit of a bummer considering we’ve already played great games very similar to this one before, but I’m heartened by what I’ve seen so far and am looking forward to playing a whole lot more when it launches next month.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis' All-Time Sweaty Shooters</h3><p>If you like to push your skill for the kill to the limits, here are Travis Northup's top recommendations.</p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Once Human 5 Things We Wish We Knew</p>
      </div>
<p>As for a paid DLC sharing--encompassing the battle pass as well as cosmetics, furniture, and weapon skins--the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/6145807877737890043" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's also working on its implementation. As it stands, the feature "has taken longer to implement than expected." It's now set to become available during the maintenance on the morning of August 1.</p><p>The developers recommend players to "refrain from making purchases for multiple characters" until the feature becomes available. It's worth noting that the battle pass level will not be shared across all characters on a single account. Any cosmetic rewards from the paid tiers of the battle pass, however, can be used by multiple characters.</p><p>If you already purchased the in-game currency Crystgin on multiple characters, the amount will be accumulated. For multiple cosmetic items or battle passes, you'll receive a Crystgin refund for the duplicates.</p><p>Lastly, the team is aware of waiting queues. The server player limit, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/6145807877738837219" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according</a> to Starry Studio, is due to the increase in the number of players exceeding previous expectations. "When too many players are on the same server, we risk losing server data," the developer said, while acknowledging that it's working on improving the limit on each server.</p><p>For now, expect a patch update on July 18 that will improve the queuing experience to "offer compensation for those who spend too long waiting in a queue." All the while, Starry Studio said it has "personnel taking shifts and working 24 hours a day to make new server available," as well as an upcoming invitation code feature slated for August, which will allow you to invite players to join your server even if it's at capacity.</p><p>Once Human launched on July 9 as a free-to-play open-world survival game set in a post-apocalyptic future. It features mechanics such as a sanity meter, which is affected by eating polluted food and drinking dirty water, amongst other conditions.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-the-most-complex-fully-realized-companions-weve-ever-crafted-says-bioware/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new interview <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/15/a-deep-dive-into-biowares-companion-design-philosophy-in-dragon-age-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published today by Game Informer</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard Game Director Corinne Busche reckons the upcoming game has the most complex and fully realized companions ever crafted by BioWare.</p>
<p>That's a tall order, given the studio's legendary track of roleplaying games, which includes Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect, and Dragon Age itself. Busche has an explanation, though:</p>
<p><em>They're complicated, they have complicated problems, and that's what's interesting. As much as I adore the companions and the journeys I've been on with them in past Dragon Age titles – previously, it feels like companions are going on an adventure with me, the main character, whether it's the Hero of Ferelden or Hawke, you name it. But in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, in many ways, the companions are so fleshed out that it feels as though I'm going on a journey with them. I'm exploring how they think and feel; I'm helping them through their problems. We're working through their unique character arcs. They feel like my dear friends, and I absolutely adore them.</em></p>
<p><em>We've really moved into a place where you can have the highest of highs, and it can be colorful, it can be optimistic, but also, you can have the lowest of lows where it gets gritty, it gets painful, it gets quite dark. But throughout it all, there is a sense of optimism. And it creates this delightful throughline throughout the game.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] In our base of operations this time, our player hub, the Lighthouse, each of the companions has their own room. And what I love about it is it becomes a reflection of who they are. The more time you spend with them, as the game develops as you work through their arc, their room and their personalities will evolve and flourish and become more complete as they trust you more and you understand them better.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] The companions also develop romantically and I'm not just talking about with the main character Rook; I'm talking about each other. There are moments in the game where two of our companions fell in love with each other and I had to make some pretty challenging choices as it related to the quest we're on. And it broke my heart, it absolutely did. I would say, as you're adventuring with them, as you're returning to the Lighthouse and getting to know them – all these decisions and conversations and things you learn about them – it endears them to you in a way that I honestly haven't experienced before. And sometimes that fills me with joy and sometimes it breaks my heart.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has seven companions (that we know of - BioWare might be hiding something....): the Veil Jumper Elf Mage Bellara Lutara, the Grey Warden Elf Warrior Davrin, the Mourn Watch member Human Mage (Necromancer) Emmrich Volkarin, the Inquisition member Dwarf Rogue Lace Harding, the Antivan Crow Human Rogue Lucanis Dellamorte, the Shadow Dragon Human Mage Neve Gallus, and the Lords of Fortune member Qunari Warrior Taash. All of them <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-features-companions-ability-wheel-for-strategic-combat-romance-has-no-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will be available for romance</a> regardless of your player character's gender and race.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard currently has a generic Fall 2024 launch window for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.

Custom builds require you to source the key internal components yourself, from the graphics card to the processors to the cooling systems. They allow for far more fine-tuning and customization than a prebuild, but they inherently require a level of technical prowess that can be quite daunting.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/installing-a-video-card-the-kotaku-review-1840243131&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/installing-a-video-card-the-kotaku-review-1840243131">Installing A Video Card: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p>During my time at <em>GamesRadar</em>, I had a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/ibuypower-y60bg201-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ibuypower-y60bg201-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">loaner PC from iBUYPOWER</a></span> that served me well. It was a prebuild that I used to play <em>Warzone </em>and <em>Overwatch</em> and occasionally stream on Twitch, requiring little from me in terms of setup other than removing some cushioning and plugging the tower in. It’s been nearly two years since I had a gaming PC, though, and my attempts to get back into the swing of things have been frustrating as hell.</p><h2 id="h38847"><a id=""></a><strong>The trials and tribulations of PC gaming</strong></h2><p>A few months ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfKsGZ1cssvqVVRej_5dMOTXDK8ykKJvyG56Mij_nkest1BdNzErgkaAq8jEALw_wcB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ibuypower.com/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwkdO0BhDxARIsANkNcrfKsGZ1cssvqVVRej_5dMOTXDK8ykKJvyG56Mij_nkest1BdNzErgkaAq8jEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iBUYPOWER</a></span> sent me a prebuilt PC to test/review that required that I install the graphics card in it (a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485">GeForce RTX 4070)</a></span>. I followed the instructions, lying prone on the floor of my apartment as I unscrewed the brackets that would hold it in place, desperately trying to keep my cat away from all the tiny screws and delicate parts. I watched YouTube tutorials before I even attempted this process, nervous that my clumsy fingers would snap off a delicate (and crucial) plastic tab. When I placed the graphics card in the tower, I heard the telltale click of it slotting into the PCie (peripheral component interconnect express) port, connected the internal power cables, closed everything back up, plugged in all the peripherals and the HDMI cable, and heaved the beast under my desk. </p><figure id="" data-id="ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-recommend-id="image://ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Alyssa Mercante</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-recommend-id="image://ff5de3345ef631e5db00d73acc919066" data-format="jpg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat sits on top of a PC tower." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I turned it on, however, my monitor said there was no signal. I tried other cables. I uninstalled and reinstalled the GPU. Nothing. I figured maybe the monitor, dormant for nearly a year, was the culprit, so I lugged it out into my living room to check if it would display my Xbox Series S. It did, so I lugged it back into my bedroom and tried again. No luck.<br></p><p>To their credit, iBUYPOWER’s rep was kind and responsive, and did their best to help me get the old PC shipped back and send a new one out, though it took a few months to get it all sorted, during which the space I had cleared out for the gaming PC accumulated dust. I assumed the problem was a user error, a reminder that I am woefully inadequate in the world of PC gaming—until the second PC had the same issue. Determined to troubleshoot it, I put out a call for help on social media, and dozens of learned PC gamers came to my aid. One person walked me through every step of installing the card again, with me sending videos and pictures to them to ensure that I had, indeed, done it correctly.<br></p><p>Then, after it <em>still</em> didn’t work, the person helping me noted that this specific rig had a Hyte riser cable connector in, which is just for aesthetics as it allows you to mount your graphics card upright. They suggested that I unplug the Hyte riser cable and slot the GPU on its side in a different PCie port to see if the cable was the issue, not my GPU installation. So I opened the damn thing up again and got to it, my hands shaking as I tried to ensure nothing snapped off in the process. After successfully unplugging the riser cable, I discovered that the “low profile” layout of the case meant the graphics card couldn’t fit in any other slot. Dejected, defeated, and covered in sweat, I boxed the PC up and prepared to send it back again, thanking iBUYPOWER for their time and energy and abandoning my PC gamer dream.</p><figure id="" data-id="94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-recommend-id="image://94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->NZXT</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-recommend-id="image://94e4815da5f996773b07834f634b80c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The NZXT player three PC." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h38848"><a id=""></a><strong>A PC gaming breakthrough</strong></h2><p>A generous internet friend who lives near me saw me tweeting my PC woes and offered to let me borrow their old tower, informing me when I came to pick it up that all I would need to do was get Windows downloaded onto it. I stood there, sweating on the sidewalk, realizing the new problem I had created for myself: downloading Windows onto a wiped PC required me to get a version of the OS onto a USB drive, which I could then plug into the tower—and the only functioning computer I have at home is a MacBook Air with no USB ports.<br></p><p>Still, I hauled the tower back to my apartment, where I sat on the floor for about half an hour, dissociating, until I had a eureka moment: the iBUYPOWER’s motherboard display port would at least let me use the PC to download Windows onto the flash drive. So, I unboxed the damn thing again, chided my cat for immediately jumping into the box, and set it up in my living room. A few hours and several questions to my PC builder friend later (where do I download Windows, what the hell is Rufus, which boot device do I select), I had Windows running on my friend’s PC.</p><p>Then, after all that work, after all the sweat and frustration, NZXT sent me over their own prebuilt PC, which already had its graphics card installed (I had told them of my installation woes, and how I’d given up on trying any sort of custom work). In an almost mind-numbingly hilarious manner, the absolute beauty (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nzxt.com/product/player-three-prime&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nzxt.com/product/player-three-prime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Player: Three Prime</a></span>, which will run you a cool $3,700 and looks like a gorgeous, techno fish bowl when turned on) booted up with no issue whatsoever.<br></p><p>It took me less than 20 minutes to take the behemoth out of the shipping box and set everything up, after which I collapsed back onto my bed and let out the kind of maniacal laugh you’d expect to hear from a horror movie villain. Hours upon hours of struggle, months of waiting, and this beautiful thing turned on like a light switch. I think it’s prebuilds or nothing for me, guys. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At that point, millions of people hopped into the dense RPG—which is based on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragon</em>s rules and settings—and fell in love with its characters, writing, choices, and turn-based combat. So it wasn’t too surprising that in November 2023, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>walked away with Ultimate Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-sequel-expansion-larian-studios-1851356964">And then it went on to win <em>so many</em> other awards across big and small events</a></span>.
