            <p>Waking up at the crack of dawn today, I felt a great disturbance in the Force, as if millions of voices did not have a comments thread in which to badger us to play Troubleshooter Colon Abandoned Children. I burst from the covers, ran weeping to my PC (this happens most mornings, to be fair) and discovered that I had forgotten to finish the intro for our latest What Are We All Playing This Weekend article. And now I have. So, what are you all playing this weekend?</p><!--more-->
<p><strong>Jeremy</strong><br>I've come down with a bit of a cold, so it's highly likely that this weekend will mostly be spent in bed trying to recover from the whirlwind of house repairs and other chaos that has dominated life since October. I shall resume my hunts in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xii">Final Fantasy XII</a> and let the auto-battling Gambit system take over for me, most likely. Go on, my brave Ivalice squad - kill some things while I shuffle your macros from behind the scenes in order to alleviate the aches in my bones!</p>
<p><strong>Callum</strong><br>This is like turning up to a biker bar and loudly announcing you’ve bought a vintage Volvo, but I picked up an old PS3 on eBay this week purely so I could play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4: Guns Of The Patriots. I’m sorry, PC brethren. I’m one of you, I promise! But I’ve given up hope they’re ever freeing this game from its PS3 prison, and paid my way to spending the weekend hiding in cardboard boxes and doing cool spy shit. Well, I’ll do that for 10 minutes before Kojima wrestles me down and forces me to watch my fifth subsequent feature-length movie masquerading as a cutscene.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong><br>Right, so Raceroom has just gotten a new car pack featuring the Mercs, Audis and Opels of the 2002 DTM series. As you might have read in the RPS 100, I love me some German touring cars, so you’ll probably find me blasting around Hockenheim or the Norisring in a pitched battle with Bernd Schneider, Laurent Aiello or Manuel Reuter this weekend.</p><p><strong>Ollie:</strong><br>It's been a rough time for me recently. My anxiety has been hitting me so hard that I feel like half a person. So this weekend, I'll be splitting my time between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trackmania">Trackmania</a>, and a couple of hours stroking some of my favourite cats in the nearby cat cafe. And all three of those activities will be shared with some of my favourite people in the world. Hopefully together it can help soothe my frayed nerves.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong><br>I continue to enjoy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-hours-of-tweaker-gunslinging-and-trench-warfare-im-sold-on-darktides-imminent-hive-scum-update">Hive Scumming</a> around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a>. Myself and a couple of friends have formed a shouty little triumvirate of mohawked wrong'uns, each specialising in one of the three pillars of grimdark hoodlum combat doctrine: guns, knives, and methamphetamine.</p>
<p><strong>Julian</strong><br>After a week of working perhaps too many 7am - 11pm days, I'm relaxing by going to an 11pm - 7am Wong Kar Wai marathon. As such, I have no plans to play games this weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Edwin</strong><br>I'm spending time with my partner this weekend, then I'm off for three days helping my dad with a house move. I might find some time for a go at Total Chaos, the new horror game from the Turbo Overkill developer. Although I've played a lot of horror games recently. Maybe I'll read a book? Maybe I'll read some books recommended by a game developer, even?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>And you, reader dear, what are you playing this weekend?...</em>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/skybound-games-faces-4-million-dollar-lawsuit-iam8bit/</link>
            <guid>1375111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Skybound Game Studios, the gaming subsidiary of Robert Kirkman’s Skybound Entertainment, is facing a sizeable lawsuit filed by iam8bit. This lawsuit alleges fraud, a breach of contract, and theft of original designs, and it was taken to the LA Superior Court for consideration.</p>



<p>The filing claims that Skybound has failed to explain financial discrepancies logged over the years of the partnership between the two firms, amongst other things. This has left iam8bit to file a considerable claim against Skybound.</p>







<h2 id="h-skybound-faces-allegations-of-financial-misconduct">Skybound Faces Allegations of Financial Misconduct</h2>



<p>Skybound Game Studios and iam8bit entered into a partnership in April 2021, and according to the complaint, Skybound has always failed to deliver monthly financial reports as agreed and has added ‘millions of dollars in fake line items’ to expense reports.</p>



<p>It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was explained</a> that an impartial auditor was introduced to the debate, and even then, Skybound couldn’t explain the finances.</p>



<p>Beyond financial woes, iam8bit has accused Skybound Games of cutting it out of a deal related to Stray, the dystopian indie smash hit that launched on PlayStation in 2022. It was claimed that Skybound used original designs created by iam8bit for promotional purposes to secure a separate deal for a Nintendo Switch release of the game.</p>



<p>It has been argued that Skybound has exploited trade secrets while scalping iam8bit’s creative output for marketing purposes.</p>



<p>This leaves iam8bit’s legal team to seek monetary damages, some kind of punitive reform, and compensation for legal fees.</p>



<p>Skybound Games has refused to comment on the lawsuit thus far.</p>







<p>Do you think Skybound Games should be held accountable to this extent if found guilty of these financial discrepancies? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FURIA has stormed into the playoffs of the StarLadder Budapest Major, completing a flawless 3-0 run through the tournament’s third stage to cement their dominance over rivals G2 in Hungary. Heading into the series, the head-to-head between the two was locked at 3-3, but FURIA shattered that ratio with a decisive 2-0 win.</p>



<p>It was an intense series that left FURIA one step closer to lifting the trophy in Budapest.</p>



<p>The predictions don’t end with this article, though. Insider Gaming, together with the international betting brand GG.BET, brings you to the heart of unforgettable moments of the Starladder Major Budapest 2025. Visit <a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gg.bet</a> to dive deeper, place your bets, and feel the adrenaline of esports!</p>



<figure><a href="https://gg.bet/news/betbuilder-now-on-ggbet" target="_blank" rel=" noreferrer noopener"></a></figure>







<h2 id="h-furia-in-the-fight-for-first">FURIA in the Fight for First</h2>



<p>The opening map in the series, Inferno, provided FURIA with early leverage, as the team secured a commanding 13-5 win over G2. It was a shock-and-awe mission for FURIA, with FalleN and YEKINDAR putting out multi-kills that left G2 flailing in the wind for much of the map.</p>



<p>Overpass came next, and again, FURIA was swinging around the map with reckless abandon. Even a brief respite provided by SunPayus with a clean pistol clapback wasn’t enough to recover those lost rounds.</p>



<p>In a post-match statement, Sid ‘sidde’ Macedo explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were still deciding if we would full buy or not. I knew we needed a pause to organize our ideas, and FalleN came up with a very good plan of playing off the stacks, playing with numbers, and playing with smokes. Everyone contributed, and I’m glad I called the pause to bring it together.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This victory effectively breaks the deadlock with G2 and extends FURIA’s dominant streak at the Budapest Major in Hungary. The Brazilian side scooped trophies going into the Major, and now they’re looking to add another to that cabinet.</p>

<p>Mega Mall updated alongside updates for Chrono Cross &amp; more</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1b1587e12c2c9"><a title="Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b1587e12c2c9/nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo released a new system firmware update for the Switch 2 last week, and it's once again led to a bunch of Switch games receiving compatibility updates.</p>
<p>We've already covered the updates for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/chrono_cross_the_radical_dreamers_edition">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamers Edition</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>, and it appears one other game that's also been fixed is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story">Mega Mall Story</a> from the Kairosoft series.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100bbc00cb9a000">Nintendo's official compatibility page</a>, the management simulation title was updated earlier this week, with "previously identified issues" now resolved.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067pxoytq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story_2">Mega Mall Story 2</a> is still apparently "unsupported" on Nintendo's platform, and other Kairosoft titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/game_dev_story">Game Dev Story</a> also appear to have issues.</p>
<p>Apart from this fix for Mega Mall Story, some issues have also reportedly been identified some other titles. This includes a problem with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/streets_of_rage_4">Streets of Rage 4</a>, which abruptly closes the game if you select 'Extra' from the menu. And, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hazel_sky">Hazel Sky</a> also has some graphics issues.</p>
<p>If you didn't already see it, a compatibility update was also released for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata The End of YoRHa Edition</a> and multiple other games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/doom_plus_doom_ii">DOOM + DOOM II</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s 1.1.3.0 update is bringing the fog of war into winter. As part of the new Winter Offensive, players will be able to access a new version of the Empire State map called Ice Lock Empire State. This map will only be around for a limited time, but it swaps out the standard map with frozen streets and other examples of cold and hazardous weather.</p><p>The new map will also have a themed event mode, allowing you to play Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations that utilize the new "Freeze" mechanic. Players will also be given access to the ice climbing axe through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path. Once they have the axe, players can unleash it as a melee weapon on unlucky foes. That bonus path also features an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, and XP Boosters.</p><p>According to Battlefield Labs, the new update has "a broad range of fixes and refinements across Battlefield 6." Some of the improvements include weapon reliability, vehicle behavior, and quality-of-life bug fixes. You can find the complete notes for this update below.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 1.1.3.0 Update Notes</h2><h3>Audio</h3><p>With this update, we’ve made a wide range of audio improvements, including a dedicated tuning pass on footsteps to make movement clearer, easier to locate, and more readable at different distances.</p><p>We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches. To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p>These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.</p><h2>Changelog</h2><h3>Players</h3><ul><li>Fixed a clipping issue when dragging a soldier on an inclined surface when being prone.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with character shoulders when jumping.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue where fall damage wouldn’t be applied immediately after being revived.</li><li>Fixed snapping and aggressive camera movements when performing takedowns on prone enemies from specific angles.</li><li>Fixed an issue allowing players to use vaulting to avoid being roadkilled by an enemy vehicle coming at high speed.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing controller haptic feedback to continue indefinitely when a reload was interrupted by swapping to another weapon or gadget.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing hit registration to fail when firing while making extremely rapid aim adjustments.

<p>Electronic Arts (EA) isn’t looking to bring back Dead Space in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As first reported on the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8">Insider Gaming Weekly,</a> sources have told Insider Gaming that the series has been put “on ice”. That’s based on internal messaging happening within the company.</p>







<p>Sources added that with the direction of EA, they don’t expect the series to be picked back up anytime soon. That includes the idea of a remake, reboot, or sequel. </p>



<p>That said, there is still of a future for the 17-year-old series. With reports that the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Funt being in a tough spot financially after the EA sale, those who spoke under the condition of anonymity are hoping that EA, under the new ownership, would want to sell the IP.</p>



<p>This isn’t saying EA is actively looking to sell the series. This is from talking with a few people in the company that feel EA could sell it to try and pay off the debt and recoup some of the money after the deal closes next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios has published the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> update 1.1.3.0 patch notes ahead of next week’s Winter Offensive update, revealing a detailed list of audio improvements, soldier visibility tweaks, a range of map adjustments, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch notes for the third major Season 1 update were published in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a post</u></a> on the EA shooter series’ website today. The full breakdown follows up on promises made by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-audio-fixes-and-multiplayer-mode-adjustments-ahead-of-update-1130"><u>BF Studios’ outline from earlier this week</u></a> and touches on every notable change coming to Battlefield 6 and REDSEC when Winter Offensive reaches its December 9 release date.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Battlefield 6 Season 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though today’s patch notes cover everything from audio to Sector sizes, players may be happy to see the studio continuing to adjust an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-outline-upcoming-aim-assist-and-weapon-bloom-adjustments-for-what-could-be-the-biggest-update-yet">issue that has wormed its way to the front of online discussion</a> since launch: hit registration. BF Studios says the 1.1.3.0 changes should result in more predictable bullet impact and easier-to-read damage feedback thanks to tweaks to quick aim, pre-zoom firing, and close-quarters gunfights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other elements the Battlefield 6 developers took aim at with the Winter Offensive update include better weapon handling, improved character highlights and animations for visibility, gadget reliability, and refined gameplay for vehicle-savvy players. Launch players will also notice relatively extensive changes to Sectors and vehicles across seven Breakthrough maps: Manhattan Bridge, Mirak Valley, New Sobek City, Operation Firestorm, Liberation Peak, Siege of Cairo, and Empire State.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be some time before players get a handle on whether many of these changes correct the balance of the average Battlefield 6 multiplayer match. Those audio tweaks, however, will likely be noticeable from the get-go, with the hope being that infantry noise is clearer and easier to read at different distances.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve also continued addressing performance and memory issues that could cause sounds, such as footsteps or vehicle audio, to drop out or fail to play, especially during large-scale Battle Royale matches,” BF Studios says in the update 1.1.3.0 patch notes. “To get ahead of this as we add more audio content to the game, we’ve adjusted the memory priorities for most sounds in the game and optimized how some larger audio assets load. In practical terms, this means that important combat, movement, and vehicle sounds should play more consistently even under heavy load.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“These changes are part of an ongoing effort to improve the overall stability of the soundscape. While this isn’t a complete overhaul, and there may still be edge cases depending on hardware and match conditions, it's a big step toward more reliable and predictable sound across the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each change arrives in addition to new weapons, limited-time winter events, and more new content that players have been told to expect since launch. Highlights include the Ice Lock Empire State map, the Ice Lock multiplayer and Gauntlet modes, the Ice Climbing Axe melee weapon, Portal updates, and a mini–Winter Offensive-themed battle pass bonus path. It’s the latest in the run of Battlefield 6 Season 1 chapter updates, which saw Rogue Ops bring Blackwell Fields and battle royale to the experience October 28, while California Resistance added Eastwood November 18.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plans for Season 2 remain under wraps for now.

This update also includes several quality-of-life improvements across UI, HUD, and controller aiming options, along with map-specific updates designed to stabilise objective play and reduce round-end matchmaking frustration.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also made improvements to reduce cases where player settings could be reset when updating the game to the newest version. While this behaviour should now occur less frequently, we are still seeing isolated instances and expect to fully resolve the issue in an upcoming update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As always, thank you for continuing to share your feedback which helps us refine and evolve the Battlefield 6 experience.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>New Content: Winter Offensive</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>New Time-Limited Map:</strong> Ice Lock Empire State<strong>.</strong> A winter-shrouded version of Empire State featuring frozen streets and seasonal environmental visuals.</li><li><strong>New Time-Limited Multiplayer and Gauntlet Mode:</strong> A themed event mode playable across Domination, Conquest, and Gauntlet mission variations on Ice Lock Empire State featuring the event-limited “Freeze” mechanic.</li><li><strong>New Melee Weapon:</strong> the Ice Climbing Axe<strong>.</strong> Unlocked through the Winter Offensive Bonus Path.</li><li><strong>Portal updates:</strong> Ice Lock Empire State is available for use in supported Portal experiences during the event window.</li><li><strong>Battle Pass:</strong> Winter Offensive Bonus Path: an 11-tier, time-limited reward track featuring event cosmetics, XP Boosters, and the Ice Climbing Axe.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Major Updates for 1.1.3.0</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Improved hit registration across situations that previously felt unreliable</strong>, including quick aim adjustments, firing before a zoom completes, and close-quarters fights with many players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-metroid-prime-4-mario-120fps-perfomance-mode-2000650994"><em>Metroid Prime 4 Beyond</em></a> is more mature than your average Nintendo-published first-party game. So players were expecting some violence, sci-fi monsters, and guns. What they might not have been expecting was for so many of the puzzle game’s doors to look like, umm, well…</p> <p>As with past <em>Metroid</em> games from Nintendo, a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021"><em>Prime 4</em>‘</a>s presentation is inspired by H.R. Giger’s designs from the classic sci-fi movie <em>Alien</em>. This is especially evident in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s first large level, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657">Volt Forge</a>, which contains a lot of Giger-esque architecture and environmental details. But other parts of <em>Prime 4</em>, like the famous artist, seem inspired by other parts of human anatomy, like vaginas. What I’m trying to say is there are a lot of doors in this game that might make your more prudish grandparents uncomfortable.</p>    <p>“Lotta vaginas in this game,” bluntly, but accurately, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanmoher.com/post/3m7733nyj4k2a">declared critic Aidan Moher on Bluesky</a>. And he’s right! In the early portions of <em>Prime 4</em>‘s campaign, you’ll encounter a few different doors that seem inspired by vulvas.&nbsp; Fans online are now sharing screenshots of doors that look very vaginal online.&nbsp; Some are large, and some are small. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyvagina/comments/1pe7opb/the_doors_in_metroid_prime_4/">One of these doors</a> even popped up on a subreddit dedicated to highlighting objects and locations that look a bit like vaginas.</p>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Why is all the discourse on Metroid Prime 4 about Miles and not how all the doors are extremely vaginal?

And honestly, I think most people will pick up on the vagina doors without any help. I’d pay a lot of money to be in the boardroom with some stuffy Nintendo execs if they are ever sat down and told why, suddenly, vagina door and <em>Prime 4</em> are trending on social media and Reddit.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>1374946</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Wreckreation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-is-a-sandbox-racing-game-set-in-a-400km%c2%b2-open-world/">the open-world sandbox</a> driving game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-release-date-open-world-sandbox-racing-game/">that lets you edit the world as you go</a>, which was developed by Three Fields Entertainment, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-criterion-devs-reveal-first-details-on-their-new-game-coming-out-soon-has-couch-co-op/">a studio made up of former Criterion developers</a> who worked on the Burnout series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandbox-racer-wreckreation-out-now-pc-ps5-xbox-series/">released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this past October</a>. Now, chief executive officer Fiona Sperry has announced that the entire staff at Three Fields Entertainment has been told they could potentially lose their jobs.</p>



<p>Wreckreation's launch has been marred by technical issues, though Sperry doesn't directly cite a lacklustre launch for the game as a reason for putting the entire staff at risk of redundancy. </p>



<p>"<em>Today I am having to share one of the hardest messages of my career. After twelve years of building and nurturing Three Fields Entertainment, I am forced into the situation of today placing our entire team on notice of redundancy</em>," Sperry <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/fiona-sperry-601a0530_today-i-am-having-to-share-one-of-the-hardest-activity-7402348277788057600-slcG?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">began in her post on LinkedIn</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard — with heart and dedication — to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project. But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future. We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful.</em>"</p>



<p>Sperry's post also includes a video featuring post-launch content the studio is adding to Wreckreation in the hopes that it will bolster the game's audience while the team also works to correct the technical problems players faced at launch.</p>



<p>"<em>My hope is that by showing this work publicly, someone out there might also see that potential and perhaps an opportunity could still emerge," </em>Sperry continued<em>. "But even if that hope does not materialise, we want this to stand as a testament to our vision and to the strength, passion, and skill of our tiny team. I truly believe in the potential of this game and in the brilliance of the people who built it."<p>"To everyone who has supported us, played our games, or believed in our studio: thank you. Your support has meant the world -&nbsp;&nbsp;We will, again at our own cost, ensure the&nbsp;next update that includes a Crossplay feature does get published before Christmas and we hope you and your friends can enjoy the world that we have built together, whichever platform you play on.</p></em>"</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the second major release from Three Fields Entertainment to miss its mark. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dangerous-driving-high-speed/">Dangerous Driving in 2019 earned a 5/10 from Wccftech</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dangerous-driving/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-4">stands at a 62 on Metacritic</a>. At the time, Wccftech's Nathan Birch wrote, "<em>Dangerous Driving is, at best, a rough early prototype of a proper Burnout successor. The basic mechanics and sense of speed are there, but they’re badly undermined by bland track design, infuriating AI, a lack of features, and a host of other issues. Those feeling nostalgic for Burnout would be best served taking the classics out for another spin, rather than taking a chance on this lemon.</em>"</p>

              <p>Netflix’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, doesn’t believe that the streaming giant is a negative force in the film industry. Instead, the soon-to-be owner of Warner Bros.&nbsp; believes Netflix is more of a savior.</p> <p>Netflix announced its <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">$82 billion bid to gobble up Warner Bros</a>., the legendary film and media company, earlier today. If it clears regulatory hurdles, the deal will position the supreme ruler of streaming services as a God Emperor of a massive TV and film catalog, as well as the properties belonging to Warner Bros. Games, which include the Lego games, as well as DC adaptations like the <i>Arkham </i>series of <i>Batman</i> games, and the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games.</p> <p>During an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">earlier this year</a>, Sarandos was asked point-blank: “Have you destroyed Hollywood?”</p> <p>“No,” Sarandos replied, “we’re saving Hollywood.”</p> <p>The CEO then casted doubt on the role of movie theaters moving forward. Though the streaming giant will need to premiere some films in theaters to be considered for certain awards, Sarandos doesn’t see the theater experience as something accessible for most folks. He said:</p>

 <blockquote><p>If you’re [fortunate enough to live in] Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a bit of an odd statement considering that cars exist. Still, Sarandos sees the industry’s reliance on theaters as an arbitrary limitation he’s happy to dispense with, much to the displeasure of Hollywood veterans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-academy-awards-mean-nothing-to-me-if-they-dont-mean-theatrical-avatar-director-james-cameron-says-netflix-films-should-not-qualify-for-the-oscars-because-theyre-not-in-theaters">like <em>Avatar</em> creator James Cameron</a>.</p>

 <p>The industry remains concerned over the impact Netflix is likely to have should its purchase of Warner Bros. go through. <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">According to <i>A Shot</i></a>, the Director’s Guild of America, led by director Christopher Nolan, is going to meet with the streaming company to address “major concerns.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Directors Guild of America, led by president Christopher Nolan, plans to meet with Netflix to address major concerns regarding the streamer’s acquisition of Warner Bros. <a href="https://t.co/EcwdZ0A0Qz">pic.twitter.com/EcwdZ0A0Qz</a></p> <p>— A Shot (@ashotmagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashotmagazine/status/1996978975311364261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Theaters have been in a bit of a bind ever since the global pandemic made it hard to convince people to leave their homes to go see a movie. Should Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition go through, it’s all the more likely that even fewer movies may hit the literal big screen.</p> <p>And with that, let’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0">reflect on some wise words</a> about experiencing movies from one of the all-time greats.</p>

			<p>Russia is off the board for Roblox, as the country's media regulatory body, the Roskomnadzor, blocks the game from Russian citizens. Included in its reasons for the block is the safety of children with regard to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">multiple reports</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sued-louisiana-lack-safety-protocols-against-sex-predators/">abuse and child predators</a> on the platform and the Roskomnadzor's concern that children will be exposed to what it defines as "<em>inappropriate content</em>," including in-game LGBTQ+ content.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://tass.ru/obschestvo/25806963">local Russian publication TASS</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn41q11gy58o">BBC News</a>, the Roskomnadzor cited the platform being "<em>rife with inappropriate content that can negatively impact the spiritual and moral development of children</em>."</p>



<p>In response, a Roblox spokesperson said, "<em>We respect the local laws and regulations in the countries where we operate and believe Roblox provides a positive space for learning, creation and meaningful connection for everyone.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We have a deep commitment to safety, and we have a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent harmful content on our platform</em>."</p>



<p>Roblox may be one of the more high-profile titles to be blocked by the Roskomnadzor, but it is hardly the first. Just last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-accused-of-removing-games-from-steam-at-russia-request-flick-solitaire/">a solitaire game was banned on Steam in Russia for its LGBTQ+ content</a>. And while much of the world would not agree with Russia's assessment that LGBTQ+ content is negative for the moral development of children, the overwhelming amount of reports and litigation that Roblox has faced over its lacklustre protections for children, which have resulted in predators abusing and assaulting kids, is not an unfair reason to block the popular game.</p>



<p>Roblox has been trying to make the platform a safer place for kids, and<a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/"> just last month introduced age verification via facial recognition to unlock the ability to use in-game chat features</a>. Despite its issues and ongoing litigation, Robox continues to grow, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">recently set a peak concurrent users record that surpassed Steam's overall concurrent record</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Marvel Studios has just announced it’s bringing the 2019 MCU finale </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> back to theaters next year.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“<i>Avengers: Endgame</i> — Back in theaters, September 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370">Marvel Studios announced on X</a> on Friday. It’s accompanied by a short video that begins with a black screen before Anthon</span><span>y Mackie’s iconic “on your left” line plays, revealing the <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> logo to what is presumably a recording of a theater audience’s hoots and hollers. “Avengers, assemble,” Chris Evans’ Captain America says, accompanied by more screaming. </span></p> <p><span>We have reached the stage in pop culture where we are nostalgic for something that happened six years ago.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Avengers: Endgame — Back in theaters, September 2026. <a href="https://t.co/PRmW9pEAxm">pic.twitter.com/PRmW9pEAxm</a></p> <p>— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>(Hilariously, an account called the Official Chicken Little Movie Account posted the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em> as a reply to the announcement.)</p>

 <p><span>Maybe this is a sign of how badly the COVID pandemic damaged our cultural psyche, but it’s more likely Marvel is trying to bring back some goodwill ahead of the release of </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span> next December. </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span>, part of the </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> series that first kicked off in 2012, is also considered a part of the “Multiverse Saga,” which plays on the franchise’s recent focus on time travel and alternate realities (we’ve seen it play out in films like </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Thanks to the multiverse’s rule-bending logic, </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> will star Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man in the first four </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> films, but returns this time as Doctor Doom. It will also feature a massive, frankly absurd ensemble cast drawn in part from more than two decades of comic book movies. The roster is split into what appears to be teams, if this post claiming to showcase a video of a recent Disney Italia presentation is to be believed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney Italia presented 'AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY' at a conference in Sorrento</p> <p>(via <a href="https://t.co/My30rheaoK">https://t.co/My30rheaoK</a>)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/avengersdoomsday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#avengersdoomsday</a> <a href="https://t.co/mRwzyOYM9z">pic.twitter.com/mRwzyOYM9z</a></p> <p>— Nerd Al Quadrato (@nerdalquadrato) <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdalquadrato/status/1995901455585227173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The “teams” include actors from the original MCU flicks (Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki), the aughts </span><i><span>X-Men</span></i><span> movies (Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique), the </span><i><span>Fantastic Four</span></i><span> reboot (Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm), and the </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span> crew AKA </span><i><span>The New Avengers</span></i><span> (Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova).</span></p>

 <p><span>If </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> sticks to its December 2026 release date, it’ll hit theaters more than seven years after </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>. Normally, you could argue Marvel is worried fans will have forgotten what’s going on, but nearly every movie released since 2019 has somehow tied into the larger MCU picture. Plus, </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> was the </span><i><span>end</span></i><span> of many core Avengers’ stories, while <em>Doomsday</em> seems to be picking up threads from a menagerie of Marvel films.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cynic in me thinks this is an attempt to recreate the magic that took place when </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> released all those years ago, and bad people recording in the movie theater with their phones gave us </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAIzLj3mYTw"><span>real-time audience reactions</span></a><span> to the return of the Thanos-snapped heroes and Captain America wielding Thor’s hammer. (If you consider that a spoiler, you must have been trapped in ice for the last half-decade.) The screams, the cheers, the exclamations of surprise—aside from the most recent </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> flick bringing back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to stand alongside Tom Holland in Spidey suits, Marvel hasn’t gotten a crowd pop like that since.</span></p> <p><span>There have been some serious stinkers since </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>, including </span><i><span>Eternals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Captain America: Brave New World, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Maybe Marvel hopes we’ll all step into a time machine and transport us back to a pre-COVID era when superhero movies could still stir something in our hearts. Nostalgia, remember, is a helluva drug.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021</link>
            <guid>1374907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> out now on Switch and Switch 2, is a game that, as I continue to play it, is winning me over more. But one part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Prime 4</em></a> annoyed me so much that I had to finally go into the settings, dig through some menus, and bypass a warning screen to fix it. I’m talking about the default jump button for the Morph Ball which is, inexplicably, different from the regular jump button.</p> <p>Look, I understand that this isn’t new to<em> Prime 4</em>. It was like this in <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em>,</a> too, and <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/960329-metroid-prime-trilogy/58099153">the Wii version of <em>Prime 2</em></a>. So for some folks, this might be second nature and not weird at all. But I haven’t played much <em>Metroid Prime </em>beyond the remaster of the first game, so when I discovered that jumping in Morph Ball mode used the X button instead of B, which is how you jump when controlling Samus on foot, I was perturbed.</p>

 <h2>How to change the jump controls in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></h2> <p>I tried to play using the default controls for a bit, hoping I’d get used to it, but no luck. Thankfully, Nintendo and Retro Studios let you customize <em>Prime 4</em>‘s controls. The problem is that to do so, you have to dig through a few menus and alarm bells. It’s odd. But here’s how to change the Morph Ball jump button in<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:</em></p> <ol> <li> <blockquote><p>Pause the game and open up the settings menu.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Scroll down to the control scheme subsection and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now hit ZR to bring up the Morph Ball controls.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Select “Spring Ball” and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now highlight the B button slot and confirm the swap.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>If your B button slot contains question marks (???) you need to do another step</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>The game will ask you if you want to go into advanced mode. Hit Ok.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now you can swap the&nbsp;??? (which is later revealed to be the Spin Ball ability) and fix this silly control choice.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>This should work the same on Switch or Switch 2. Since making this change, I’ve had a lot more fun jumping around as the Morph Ball. I’m not sure why Nintendo buried this option in some menus and behind a warning, but I’m thankful they included the ability to remap controls at all. Not every developer does that, and it can be very annoying. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go hop around as a ball in <em>Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Eidos Montreal Worked on Kojima’s ‘OD’ Before Being Asked to Move to Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-move-to-japan-kojima/</link>
            <guid>1374901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Insider Gaming has learned that Eidos Montreal worked with Kojima Productions on the developer’s new game ‘OD’ for around a year before some of its developers were asked to move to Japan.</p>







<p>According to sources who added further context to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">past report on the current layoff situation</a> at Eidos Montreal, OD, which was previously known as Overdose, had been in development there for around a year in 2023. The game was internally known as P21, but development of the project at Eidos Montreal ceased after a request from Kojima Productions to have the developers move to Japan and cut ties with Eidos Montreal, said the people.</p>



<p>At the time of the request, around 20 developers were working on the project.</p>



<p>Kojima’s ‘Overdose’ title suffered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-overdose-gameplay-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monumental leak in November 2022</a>, when gameplay footage obtained from the backend of YouTube by a leaker known as ‘The Snitch’ surfaced online. The two minutes of gameplay revealed that the game featured Death Stranding’s Mama (Margaret Qualley) in a blue dress and officially leaked the working name of the game as ‘Overdose’.</p>



<p>In 2023 at The Game Awards, Kojima officially announced with Jordan Peele that the game would be called ‘OD’, saying that people would “either love it or hate it”. In September 2025, a new teaser for the game, titled ‘Knock’, was released.</p>



<p>The game has seen several setbacks since its announcement, with filming for the game being delayed until 2026 due to the&nbsp;2024–2025 SAG-AFTRA video game strike. On November 23, 2025, Ubo Kier, who was set to star in the game died at the age of 81. </p>







<div><p>Kojima said in a statement on X,</p><p>“I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly. Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “<em>OD</em>” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in Milan at the end of September, he told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year. He was full of energy then too, making me laugh with his usual “Udo-isms.” I still can’t believe this. Udo wasn’t just an actor. He was truly an “icon” of his time. We’ve lost a great “icon.” There will never be another like him. Udo, rest in peace. I will never forget you.”</p></div>



<p>It’s currently unknown when the game will officially be released, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/</link>
            <guid>1374880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A rumor from a reliable film insider may have revealed who’s cast as Thor and Baldur in Amazon’s God of War series. The show was recently given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a two-season greenlight</a>, with casting underway.</p>



<p>Ever since 2005, PlayStation and Santa Monica’s God of War series has delivered on the action front. With excellent drama, fun hack-and-slash gameplay, and gory godly kills, there’s a lot to love. The reboot series, consisting of God of War and God of War Ragnarok, put a more dramatic twist on the series, earning it huge praise. In 2022, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video would be making the reboots into a streaming show. Earlier last month, Emmy-winning director Frederick E.O. Toye was revealed to direct the first two episodes, with the casting ongoing. Now, it seems a new rumor says that actors for Thor and Baldur are close to being cast. </p>







<h2 id="h-boots-and-severance-stars-in-talks-to-play-baldur-and-thor-in-amazon-s-god-of-war-according-to-film-insider">Boots and Severance Stars In Talks to Play Baldur and Thor in Amazon’s God of War, According to Film Insider</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor comes from reliable film insider <strong>DanielRPK</strong>, who’s leaked details on several projects like Avengers and Spider-Man. In <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/145161885?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Patreon post</a>, it’s mentioned that <strong>antagonists Baldur and Thor have actors in talks to play them for Amazon’s God of War</strong>. For <strong>Baldur</strong>, <strong>Max Parker</strong>, who recently played the lead in Boots, is up for the role of the Norse immortal. Meanwhile, <strong>Olafur Darri Olafsson</strong>, known for his role as Mr. Drummond in season two of Severance, is in talks to play the drunken god of thunder from Ragnarok, <strong>Thor</strong>. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that <strong>these castings have not been confirmed</strong>, so <strong>take it with a big grain of salt</strong>. Even if not, both actors are pretty great choices for the roles in God of War. As of now, no official casting has been revealed. Filming is expected to start early next year, so it won’t be long until it’s known who Kratos and Atreus are.</p>







<p>What do you think of the rumored Amazon God of War cast for Thor and Baldur? Do you think they are good choices? Who do you think would make a great Thor? Baldur? Kratos?

                <p>Cash is still the ultimate commodity in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/" data-ref-id="5000-532553">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>, and Rockstar Games has been known to go out of its way to entice players with in-game currency rewards... <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-players-get-1-million-cash-just-for-logging-in-right-now/1100-6534169/" data-ref-id="1100-6534169">sometimes for just logging in</a>. Now, Rockstar is offering $500,000 in game currency to anyone who follows a simple request.</p><p>To earn the prize, all you have to do is link your Discord account to your Rockstar Games account. Just <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockstargames" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clicking on this link</a> will take you where you need to be.</p><p>If you need something to invest all of that cash in, GTA Online's next update--A Safehouse in the Hills--allows players to buy their own missions. A new trailer for that update dropped today, and it revealed the return of Michael De Santa, one of the leading characters from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. If the footage is any indication, Michael's retirement didn't fully take. Or perhaps he's just very passionate about keeping certain criminal affairs out of his upscale neighborhood.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APJ-lT0sBhg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/APJ-lT0sBhg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get one of these mega mansions for yourself, players will have to strike a deal with the Prix Luxury Real Estate company, which promises "sprawling grounds, breathtaking views, and first-rate amenities--including the latest in personal assistance and business service technology."</p><p>A Safehouse in the Hills will launch on December 10, and players who opt into a Prix Luxury Black Tier VIP from now through December 7 can grab an Ubermacht Revolter sports car at the Luxury Autos showroom. Players can also advance to the Gold Tier membership by finishing all three New Listings missions, which will reward users with a $1 million bonus of in-game cash, as well as a $2 million discount on one of the luxury estates being offered by Prix Luxury.</p><p>Earlier this fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">Rockstar added GTA Online</a> to its GTA+ membership service. It's still unclear what will happen to the game after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is released in November 2026, but at least one video game analyst has argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">GTA Online is the real cash cow</a> of the franchise.</p>
