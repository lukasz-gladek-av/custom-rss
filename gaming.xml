			<p>The shadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator continues to improve at a steady pace, enhancing Bloodborne's emulation considerably.</p>
<p>As shown in a new video shared on X by <a href="https://x.com/Khalid2c7u" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Khalid2c7u</a>, on the late version of the emulator, the PlayStation 4 exclusive's load times have been reduced to a few seconds on an SSD, which is a massive improvement over the long load times on native hardware.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><br>
Besides improving load times considerably, the latest version of the shadPS4 emulator also brought some other enhancements, although there are still plenty of known issues left to fix, such as huge RAM and VRAM consumption. A nice overview of the game's emulation progress and issue has been provided in the video below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>.

<p>Besides improving Bloodborne's emulation, the latest version of the shadPS4 emulator is making more <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console exclusives</a> playable on PC, such as Vanillaware's Dragon's Crown Pro, as shown in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vivr0Ylvpz8">video</a> shared by Jaquan Butler. As reported on the emulator's Discord server, the latest version of the emulator is also capable of getting in-game in Metaphor: ReFantazio, which is a massive accomplishment for a game that has only just been released.</p>

The original <em>Saw </em>film is returning to theaters for its 20th anniversary later this month, making it the perfect time to revisit the entire horror series. Back in 2004, director James Wan and writer Leigh Whannell transformed an ingenious idea and a $5,000 short film into a billion-dollar franchise. With a total of ten films and <em>Saw XI</em> set to release next September, the <em>Saw </em>series is known for its knotty plots, gruesome and inventive traps, and dubious morals as John Kramer, aka Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), chooses his victims based on their sins and their lack of appreciation for the gift of life.<br></p><p>Jigsaw forces people to play his twisted games and fight for survival, reminding them of life’s precious value. The series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=torture+porn+after+9%2F11&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=torture+porn+after+9%2F11&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDIxMDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=torture+porn+after+9%2F11&amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_en&amp;oq=torture+porn+after+9%2F11&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDIxMDRqMGo3qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paved the way for the post-9/11 rise of “torture porn,”</a></span> a genre that takes pleasure in abject suffering, but it isn’t entirely rooted in that. Some films in the franchise unpack real sociocultural issues, or tug on your heartstrings, or pose philosophical questions that will weigh heavily on your soul—and yes, of course, there’s a lot of gnarly gore. </p><p>Just like Jigsaw’s victims, we’re about to make some tough choices, so let’s take a look and see some of the best and worst twists and turns this franchise has made. Here are all the <em>Saw</em> movies, ranked from worst to best.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee46a8da6acc03b7aae71db6d6eae196" data-recommend-id="image://ee46a8da6acc03b7aae71db6d6eae196" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four people stand with chains around their necks in a barn.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Seven years after <em>Saw: The Final Chapter</em>, the series was resurrected by writers Josh Stolberg and Peter Goldfinger and their Jigsaw copycat killer who wreaks havoc on ethically questionable citizens. <em>Jigsaw </em>immediately establishes itself as unique through its setting: no longer featuring dilapidated urban buildings like the other films, it’s set largely in a rustic barn on Tuck’s Pig Farm, owned by John Kramer’s ex-wife and her family.<br></p><p><em>Saw </em>traps are always more interesting when there’s lots of people with different personalities stuck in a twisted maze, and in this case, a group of petty criminals trapped inside a farmhouse must work together or turn against one another to survive. The traps are very imaginative, if a bit hokey, like one involving a funnel with a spiral-shaped blade that turns someone into a human pencil shaving, and another with a laser that incinerates someone’s head open like an orchid flower. The film cleverly uses its pastoral setting, for one of the coolest—and even quaintest—traps in the series, as the characters are stuck in a silo that fills with grain. The revelations about Jigsaw’s past—including his obsession with pigs—add some unexpected emotional gravitas to his character. </p><p>But <em>Jigsaw </em>just can’t overcome the uncharismatic lead performance from Matt Passmore as Logan, a veteran and medical examiner at the Metropolitan Police Department, and his connections to Jigsaw are redundant and unbelievable. How many different apprentices can Jigsaw possibly have?<em> Jigsaw </em>commits the biggest sin for a horror movie—especially one in the<em> Saw </em>franchise: it’s boring.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-recommend-id="image://ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chris Rock aims a gun while covered in blood." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chris Rock aims a gun while covered in blood." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-recommend-id="image://ee0e662edb7cc5ebd2e889642505a282" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chris Rock aims a gun while covered in blood." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After <em>Jigsaw </em>did poorly at the box office, <em>Spiral: From the Book of Saw</em> was a different attempt to re-launch the series. <em>Spiral </em>returns the <em>Saw </em>series to its mystery thriller roots, shifting from a straight-up gorefest to a more procedural drama. The return of director Darren Lynn Bousman (<em>Saw II</em>, <em>Saw III</em>, <em>Saw IV</em>) was also promising, but unfortunately <em>Spiral </em>left the audience spinning in a whirlwind of ambivalence and predictability. The lead performances from Chris Rock (who brings a refreshing levity to the series) and the brooding Max Minghella as detectives trying to solve who keeps killing crooked cops, are the film’s few highlights. The formidable Samuel L. Jackson as Chris Rock’s father is another fantastic addition, and their tense relationship gives <em>Spiral</em> a dramatic emotional core. The traps are quite creative, particularly the subway trap, which cleverly makes use of a public urban space. Then there’s the hot wax trap, a terrifying concept that forces a brutal choice between suffocating or severing your spinal cord.<br></p><p>But whatever strengths <em>Spiral </em>has going for it are immediately undone by a rushed, predictable, and far too silly ending. Even worse, the movie dances around the potentially meaningful commentary on racism and police brutality that may have made this entry in the series stand out. <em>Spiral</em> has no idea what tone it wants to strike: serious drama, gritty thriller, corny slasher, or comedy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-recommend-id="image://df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person with a box on their head screams." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person with a box on their head screams." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-recommend-id="image://df432b5c5f5687ba7d2ec57e397284ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person with a box on their head screams." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw V </em>brings on a new director, David Hackl, for a very tense showdown between Mark Hoffman (Costas Mandylor)—the lead investigator of the new Jigsaw murders and secretly the killer’s apprentice—and FBI Agent Peter Strahm. It’s refreshing to see Scott Patterson, known for his role as Luke in the cozy series <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, take on a darker character, especially as he becomes the latest victim of Jigsaw’s deadly tests.<br></p><p>But the cat-and-mouse game between Hoffman and Strahm could have been much more exciting; instead, the entire film feels like a bland, hurried stepping stone to better ideas involving Hoffman as Jigsaw’s successor. The only thing <em>Saw V</em> has going for it are memorable traps that involve spilling enough of your blood to fill a beaker, a head trapped in a box that fills with water, and a group of victims with chains around their neck having to work together to acquire the key without backing into a wall of razor blades.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e79264e53df33208f5b75b69ac3b3a30" data-recommend-id="image://e79264e53df33208f5b75b69ac3b3a30" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person in a cage reaches for a handle.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As the title indicates, <em>Saw: The Final Chapter</em> was meant to be the last until filmmakers realized that the series had some more lifeblood to squeeze out. Before taking a new direction with tonal shifts and side stories that expanded the Jigsaw universe, <em>Saw: The Final Chapter</em> signaled the end of the franchise as we knew it: ultra-violent and over-the-top.<br></p><p>Since you gotta have a gimmick, the seventh installment is also known as <em>Saw: 3D</em>, and it makes the traps even more disgusting by shoving them in your face, though these effects come off as very cheesy when watching at home  without 3D glasses, especially with the bright red blood. Since <em>Saw: The Final Chapter </em>promised to be the last film, the traps are bigger and meaner, such as a public one in the middle of a town square, or another where a man has to excruciatingly peel the skin from his back that’s glued to a car seat, or else his girlfriend will be ripped apart by a speeding car tire. </p><p>The main storyline about a self-help guru who lied about being a Jigsaw survivor is serviceable enough (and even features that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/darrenbousman/p/CxQ8fiqPUDK/?img_index=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/darrenbousman/p/CxQ8fiqPUDK/?img_index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hilarious meme with John Kramer wearing a backwards cap</a></span>), but the real delights are the callbacks to the original <em>Saw </em>and the way it brings the series full circle. We <em>finally </em>get to see the horrifying aftereffects of the famous Reverse Bear Trap and the prodigal return of Dr. Gordon. Actor Cary Elwes had been in a lawsuit that accused his management firm and the <em>Saw </em>producers of denying his share of the profits, making him absent from the series for some time. He was able to make this triumphant return to the franchise in 2010 once it was settled out of court. <em>Saw: The Final Chapter </em>is a helluva lot of fun, even as it cranks everything up to eleven.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="44a55144c76a8aa029078dec62a1a30b" data-recommend-id="image://44a55144c76a8aa029078dec62a1a30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman sits with a bit in her mouth while a machine tangles up her hair.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw IV </em>is the first film in which Jigsaw orchestrates his games from beyond the grave and it struggles to find its footing. This time, Lieutenant Rigg (Lyriq Bent) is the player and he must save Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg). Along the way, he faces various criminals in traps and must decide if they are worth sparing in spite of their misdeeds. </p><p>The investigation storyline is  exciting, though, as FBI agents Peter Strahm and Lindsey Perez discover a second apprentice. Detective Hoffman quickly steps into the spotlight as a key player in the series. With his devilish grin and shifty eyes, he becomes a deliciously nefarious character, and one of the most entertaining parts of the series’ latter half. The film digs deeper into Jigsaw lore and the intricate web of connections between the ensemble. </p><p>We learn more about John Kramer’s tragic backstory, revealing how his ex-wife Jill suffered a miscarriage after Cecil, a drug addict, robbed the clinic where she worked and accidentally slammed a door into her stomach. Of course, it wouldn’t be a <em>Saw </em>movie without wild revelations, and the surprise ending features a barbaric trap involving a pair of ice blocks. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-recommend-id="image://0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looks horrified inside a cage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman looks horrified inside a cage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-recommend-id="image://0c1663272168be194af908a6bc16dacd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman looks horrified inside a cage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In <em>Saw VI</em>, Jigsaw tackles the injustices of the healthcare system which, in many ways, deserves the punishment. This film’s game involves health insurance executive William Easton (Peter Outerbridge) and his colleagues who cheat their clients, including John Kramer, out of medical coverage.<br></p><p><em>Saw VI</em> features one of the best traps in the entire series, as William’s co-workers are strapped to a spinning merry-go-round that will unleash shotgun blasts unless he stabs his own hand to save them. The tension reaches a fever pitch as the playground equipment keeps spinning and shooting while his co-workers scream, plead, bribe, and beg for their lives. It’s a bold and lacerating visual that forces us to confront the reality of the human lives behind soulless corporations. There’s also another horrifying trap that involves acid injected into someone’s entire body. </p><p>The movie continues to paint Hoffman as a cruel and sadistic apprentice who enjoys seeing his victims suffer and sometimes not even giving them the opportunity to escape. He’s the stark opposite of Amanda (Shawnee Smith), Jigsaw’s first apprentice and one of his few survivors, who has a big heart. Hoffman turns this latter half of the <em>Saw</em> franchise into a really dark rollercoaster ride.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-recommend-id="image://2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person sits in a chair with a mask on that has hoses attached to the eye sockets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person sits in a chair with a mask on that has hoses attached to the eye sockets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-recommend-id="image://2b1760988d0d59945e406e6d1c51b822" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A person sits in a chair with a mask on that has hoses attached to the eye sockets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw X</em> makes another bold pivot in style, and this time, it truly works. Tobin Bell steps out of the supporting shadows and into the leading spotlight as John Kramer. This prequel humanizes the notorious villain and gives the audience room to empathize with him. He travels to Mexico for an experimental procedure to cure his terminal cancer, only to discover he’s been scammed. John Kramer is no longer just a menacing figure with an intense gaze and calculated way of speaking in a deep, gravelly voice—he’s a sick old man in deep pain dealing with his body slowly breaking down.<br></p><p>The quiet scenes at the clinic capture his ordinary routines and offer an intimate glimpse into the loneliness, fear, and sadness that emanates from him. With the help of his fiercely devoted apprentice Amanda, Jigsaw seeks revenge on the swindling doctors and their associates. Amanda’s unspoken connection with John has always been so fascinating, and it’s a thrill to see them back together after so many years. John also forms a sweet relationship with the young caretaker, Carlos (Jorge Briseño). </p><p>But all this emotional focus doesn’t soften the brutal violence. The traps in <em>Saw X</em> are simple yet terrifying, from one victim severing their leg with a Gigli saw to another drilling into his skull to remove a piece of cerebral tissue. Not only do the unvarnished, close-up views of this violence give you the heebie-jeebies, but it’s all infused with a wrath that feels personal, since <em>Saw X</em> has taken the time to immerse you in John’s state of mind. Director Kevin Greutert pulls back on the frenetic editing techniques and focuses on what matters most: Jigsaw’s heart and his quest for vengeance. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-recommend-id="image://c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Saw victims argue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Saw victims argue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lionsgate</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-recommend-id="image://c0f7e5b65114a61defa39cb9bdb13ca5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Saw victims argue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Director Darren Lynn Bousman, who took over for James Wan, is instrumental to the <em>Saw </em>series.. His more frenetic and stylized vision shifted the <em>Saw </em>movies from psychological thrillers to more bloodthirsty spectacles. <em>Saw II</em> establishes what would become the franchise’s signature elements: elaborate, grisly traps and a series of twists that unfold and collapse like a house of cards. In this sequel, Donnie Wahlberg delivers a heated performance as Detective Matthews, who is desperate to save his son after ambushing Jigsaw’s hideout. </p><p>And <em>Saw II</em> heightens the tension by having a large group of strangers (including Amanda, a survivor of a previous trap) being tested by Jigsaw at the same time. While this would become the norm as the series rolled on, it was a big step up from two guys stuck in a bathroom in the first movie. In a twisted, <em>Saw </em>version of a haunted house, they must navigate an abandoned factory filled with deadly contraptions. One of the franchise’s most legendary traps makes an appearance here: the giant needle pit. The genuinely surprising, right-under-our-noses conclusion gives new meaning to the trope “the call is coming from inside the house.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eb4118f37197e7224369354bf3335e43" data-recommend-id="image://eb4118f37197e7224369354bf3335e43" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man reaches for a cell phone while crying.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The one that started them all. <em>Saw </em>was the little indie movie that could at Sundance in 2004. It launched the careers of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, who would go on to create terrifying horror films like <em>Insidious </em>and the<em> Conjuring</em> series. What makes the first <em>Saw </em>installment so gripping is, ironically, its simplicity. Before the series spiraled into a mega-franchise packed with twists upon twists and traps upon traps, <em>Saw </em>was a sparse, taut mystery thriller.<br></p><p>Budget limitations mostly confined the main story to one decrepit bathroom: a  self-absorbed young photographer (Leigh Whannell) and a haughty oncologist (Cary Elwes) wake up to  discover a suicide victim clutching a gun and a tape recorder, with corroded hacksaws beside them that are too dull to cut through their chains. We can see where this might be going, but nothing prepares you for the shocking twist ending, one that, with the sound of a slammed door and a horrified scream, rattles you to the core. The original <em>Saw </em>is reminiscent of what makes David Fincher’s <em>Seven </em>so great: it’s got a gritty, macabre aesthetic, razor-sharp violence, and the twisted psychology of a serial killer with a devious agenda.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0991a6bf0089029d94408453531703ed" data-recommend-id="image://0991a6bf0089029d94408453531703ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman stands in a tiled room with a device around her neck.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Saw III</em> is nastier than the first two installments, fueled by raw desperation and extreme risks. Jigsaw’s apprentice, Amanda, kidnaps brain surgeon Lynn (Bahar Soomekh), fashions an explosive necklace around her neck, and forces her to perform surgery on her dying mentor. At the same time, Lynn’s husband Jeff (Angus Macfadyen) must complete a game in which he must face his profound grief and rage over the loss of their son.<br></p><p><em>Saw III</em> is about so much more than the life-and-death tests faced by Jigsaw’s victims, extending to the fate of Jigsaw itself. It explores the power of forgiveness and whether wrongdoers deserve vengeance or redemption. We also witness Amanda’s emotional dependency on John and her desperate desire for his survival, making for some of the most riveting scenes in the series. The torture devices are gnarly as hell, drowning you in a vat of pig guts, twisting every single limb in your body, or freezing you into a human icicle. Even the brain surgery scene, shot up close and personal, is stomach-churning and filled with suspense. <em>Saw III</em> found that perfect sweet spot between intense thrills, psychological drama, and torture porn before the series would turn into something far more carnivalesque. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Possibly, at least.</p><p>The sun has set on Dracula’s Castle once more, and as the <a title="Games > moon [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moon">moon</a> rises a hellish horde of murky Mudmen, ghastly ghosts, and frightening Fleamen take the stage as the battle of good and evil rages once again.

        <p>What a horrible night to have a curse, especially if you are:</p><ul><li><strong>The Belmonts</strong> – Your favorite whip-obsessed family of vampire hunters, including Simon, Richter, Trevor, and even Sonia.</li><li><strong>The Belnades</strong> – A myriad of legendary witches from throughout the history of the occult clan. Sypha, Yoko, and even distant relatives like Charlotte Aulin and Maria Renard have their spellbooks ready.</li><li><strong>Other Heroes</strong> – Not just Jonathan and Charlotte, but Jonathan Morris AND John Morris?! Amazing allies abound, from Shanoa to Eric Lecarde.</li></ul><p><strong>Over 40 New Weapons</strong></p><p>Fighting the forces of evil is hard as hell:</p><ul><li><strong>Whips</strong> – Whole lot of whips.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-out-now-60fps-performance-improvements-shader-compliation/">Unreal Engine 5.4</a> brings significant CPU and GPU improvements over the engine's first release, a new comparison video highlights.</p>
<p>The comparison, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJkOalo1xPE">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, puts The Matrix Awakens tech demo running in the 5.44 and 5.0 versions side by side, highlighting how, without any custom optimization, CPU performance has been improved up to 40% depending on the scenario, which is quite an improvement. GPU performance hasn't been improved as much, by up to 20%, although, as the YouTuber noted, a proper comparison is made impossible by the many new features added in 5.4 which were absent in the engine's first version, such as proper support for Virtual Shadow Maps, Hit Lighting feature for Hardware Lumen and others.</p>
<p>Regarding shader compilation, which is still among the most critical aspects of the engine that impacts performance the most, Unreal Engine 5.4 featuring a short shader-pre compilation step means that any game won't stutter crazily at the beginning, but there are performance drops caused by shader compilation happening during gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5.4 vs Unreal Engine 5.0 - The Ultimate Graphics/Performance Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJkOalo1xPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can check out how The Matrix Awakens Unreal Engine 5.4 runs on your system by downloading the tech demo <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FRRPF62zupoDDev9HpMTEdaGbKEfyuzZ/view">here.</a></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.4 is the latest public version of the engine, but the next, 5.5, is already in the works and its first preview version was released earlier this month. The most notable new feature is MegaLights, which enables developers to have a massive number of movable, dynamic lights, all with realistic area shadows and the ability to light volumetric fog. You can learn more about this version of the engine <a href="https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/unreal-engine-5-5-preview/2048423">here.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/railgods-of-hysterra">RailGods Of Hysterra</a> is one of those games that, as it were, shovels a bunch of relatively dried-up concepts into the squirming furnaces of something appealingly ghastly. On the one hand, it's burdened by talk of "crafting", "base-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building</a>" and "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a>" - all things I have enjoyed but am currently weary of, and which together make the game sound interchangeable with half of Steam. But it's elevated, on the other hand, by talk of living helltrains that eat crocodiles for breakfast. Without further ado, here's a trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>In RailGods Of Hysterra, the Lovecraftian Old Gods have overrun the Earth and turned it into a stormy themepark of snakes with missing chins and assorted freaky little guys. You (and up to four of your friends) play a Dreamer, who has awoken in the Dreamlands and is now charged with guiding a monstrous RailGod along the Eternal Railway, raiding dungeons and visiting the last outposts of humanity. The final objective: transform yourself and your ravening choo-choohulu into an elder deity on par with the cosmic A-listers.</p>
<p>"Born from forbidden rituals and unholy magic, your RailGod is no mere machine but a sentient locomotive, pulsing with eldritch life," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201910/RailGods_of_Hysterra/">the Steam page explains</a>. "It craves the flesh of your enemies, demanding their sacrifice as fuel for its relentless journey. This colossal fortress on wheels is not just your stronghold - it's your most terrifying weapon against the unspeakable horrors of Hysterra. Upgrade its Carriages with sinister innovations, and as your bond deepens, you'll unlock the power to battle the titans and witness the downfall of the Great Old Ones."</p><p>The broad flow looks similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/last-train-home">Last Train Home</a>, except that combat is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo</a>-ish, with a mix of blades, spells and guns. Each away mission is both a chance to investigate the world, and an opportunity to harvest materials for locomotive expansions and upgrades, not least those nice, crunchy alligators. It looks like most of the critters you'll feed your locomotive are just fuel for the next leg of the journey. But you can also "confine and sacrifice Deathless enemies to receive Dark Gifts, gaining the upper hand against the eldritch creatures threatening your path to godhood".</p>
<p>One thing the Steam page doesn't specify is whether you can feed other players to the train. It'll be a real waste of potential if you can't, though I imagine one outcome might be stranded players innocently asking friends to drop into co-op, so they can spartan kick them straight into the boiler. Beyond that, I must predictably ask: Thomas The Tank Engine mod when?</p>
<p>Developers Troglobytes Games are them what did body-swapping shmup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/body-snatching-shooter-hyperparasite-enters-early-access">Hyperparasite</a> and the less-regarded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2055410/The_Kindeman_Remedy">Kindeman Remedy</a>, in which you and a sadist nun torture prisoners in the name of science. It's safe to say these developers have an appetite for the icky. I haven't played The Kindeman Remedy, but it sounds far more unpleasant than some train with tentacles.</p>
<p>RailGods will come chuffing through the cracks in reality in 2025. If you prefer your traingods without the tentacles, may I recommend the anime <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_adhS3FPJw">Train To The End Of The Road</a>? Or if you'd rather politicise your traingods, how about China Mieville's novel Iron Council? I'd happily play a game based on that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After one barrage the cannons are out of juice, so you have to recharge them by spinning nearby energy stations, which in turn spawns the Tyranid horde. Meanwhile, the Bio-Titan will bombard your position with high-damage artillery fire.</p><p>Once the cannons are recharged, you need to activate the central terminal to link your sidearm once again, aim, and let the cannons fire. You need to repeat this process a number of times to bring the Bio-Titan down. It’s a stressful boss fight with a lot going on; the Tyranids can easily overwhelm your squad, even on the easier difficulties, and the Bio-Titan itself can effectively one-shot you if you hang about the same area for too long. Crank the mission up to Lethal — the new, hardest difficulty added with Update 4.0 — and you’re in for a world of hurt.</p><p>Or are you? One Space Marine 2 player has worked out a way to solo the Bio-Titan even on Lethal difficulty, exposing a flaw in the design of the mission that the developers at Saber Interactive may want to patch out at some point (once they’re done addressing the backlash to Update 4.0, perhaps).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It all started with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1g6r831/it_is_possible_to_fully_kill_the_biotitan_with/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor RedditOakley’s discovery</a> that it is possible to deal damage to the Bio-Titan when it walks past the Space Marines just after they step out of the final elevator room but, crucially, before activating the terminal (this imposing moment was used to reveal the Bio-Titan in promotional videos). This (tiny) damage is reflected when the Bio-Titan’s health bar displays, and then you do all that fortress cannon stuff we mentioned before.</p><p>RedditOakley theorized that it would thus be possible to continue to damage and eventually kill the Bio-Titan using Space Marine weapons and without having to go through the cannon activation process, and that theory turned out to be true. The only question was, from where would you safely shoot the Bio-Titan down? After all, in Space Marine 2 ammo is scarce; infinite ammo resources are ammo crates and loadout pods only; and the swarm can quickly become too much to handle.</p><p>The answer is the elevator room itself, which, if you never activate the terminal, is a safe haven of sorts (although you won’t see the Bio-Titan’s health bar). “I fired up a solo Minimal [the easiest difficulty] run and progressed to where the door opens and you meet the titan,” RedditOakley explained. “We have the ammo crate next to the elevator and a loadout pod available, the door to those never closes as the room is used to spawn enemy waves.</p><p>“The titan itself will walk around the battlefield, and often stay close to where you're standing. This is the range where it is possible to shoot and damage it with your guns. The titan will even lob acid globes at you here after a while.</p><p>“So that's what I did. I just kept shooting, and shooting and shooting, clearing the waves and [tougher] extremis that came along the way. I didn't have any way of seeing my progress as the health bar isn't visible in this area, so all I could do was keep shooting and praying.</p><p>“Then eventually a red hit marker showed up and the end cutscene appeared.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In their post, RedditOakley issued the Space Marine 2 community a challenge: kill the Bio-Titan using Space Marine guns only on the hardest difficulty, Lethal. Of course, someone answered the call: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1g6r831/it_is_possible_to_fully_kill_the_biotitan_with/lsmjx54/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor xD3viLzx</a>, who used the Sniper class and the Las Fusil to slowly — and I mean slowly — solo the Bio-Titan on Lethal.</p><p>As you can tell from <a href="https://youtu.be/I3F96tWEbqY?si=Tw35zng5wVTIDdx7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the footage of the run</a>, xD3viLzx popped in and out of the elevator room to snipe at the Bio-Titan, returning to grab ammo from the loadout pod when needed. Whittling down the Bio-Titan’s health in this way took 45 minutes, rinsing and repeating while occasionally avoiding a barrage from the Tyranid itself and dealing with waves of enemies. It’s a monotonous cheese, for sure, but an effective one. Upon the final blow the mission ended properly, the victory recorded as it would if the Bio-Titan were killed as Saber intended, and the appropriate rewards dished out.</p><p>It should be noted that this cheese isn't a win button. xD3viLzx still had to make it to the mission’s final area in one piece on Lethal solo, which for me is a more impressive feat than the Bio-Titan cheese itself. xD3viLzx’s perfect parry was on point, but there were a few hairy moments in the run when the AI-controlled teammates saved the day with a revive. Still, the cheese makes the hardest part of the mission relatively trivial. You just need time and the patience of a saint; the entire run took one hour and 14 minutes.</p><p>So, will Saber cut this cheese out the game? <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-responds-to-steam-review-bomb-campaign-over-nerf-patch">It’s promised a patch this week to address balance concerns sparked by Update 4.0’s heavy nerfs</a>.

            <p>There is no additional story content on the cards for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p>
<p>Developer Insomniac shared the news last week, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-january-2025-release-date-on-pc">post announcing the Spidey sequel's upcoming PC release</a>.</p>
<p>"While we have no additional story content planned for Marvel's Spider-Man 2, we're delighted to bring all of our previously released post-launch content to the PC version, including New Game+, new suits and colour variants, Photo Mode features, and more," said Insomanic's senior community manager Aaron Jason Espinoza.</p>

<p>This is a change to what many had expected, firstly because 2018's Marvel's Spider-Man received DLC in the form of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/insomniac-details-spider-mans-post-launch-story-dlc-the-city-that-never-sleeps">The City That Never Sleeps collection</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, earlier this year, the game's development menu was accidentally left accessible, which showed content that was not in the base game. Many surmised this content was either cut ahead of release, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-2-update-adds-debug-menu-and-potential-dlc-spoilers">Insomniac had plans to use it for an unannounced DLC expansion</a>.</p><p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is set to launch on PC on 30th January next year. It was initially released on PlayStation last October, to widespread praise and some truly bumper sales. In the first 24 hours alone, an incredible 2.5m copies were sold, making it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-fastest-selling-playstation-studios-game-ever">Sony's fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game ever</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">Eurogamer's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 review</a>, our Chris Tapsell called it "a little simple and a little over-stuffed [but a] game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style". He went on to award it four out of five stars.</p>
<p>The studio has clearly left room to develop the story further, with a third entry.

			<p>Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire promises a lot, giving impressions of an open sky to fly through, putting together a crew, and going on a lot of adventures. Unfortunately, the reality is that Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire wasn’t yet ready to set sail, with issues galore that just compounded until I had to throw in the proverbial towel around what felt like the halfway point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire – Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFHazY90IVQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The story of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire follows Glenn Windwalker, the latest in the line of adventurers from the Windwalker family. The story starts with his mum returning from an adventure alone, with Glenn’s father nowhere to be seen. Some time passes, and whatever business Glenn’s parents got involved with catches up with them when their home of Blossom is attacked by the Alliance. Glenn ends up escaping with some of his buddies and vows revenge against the Alliance. It’s all very by the numbers, to be honest. Later on, more factions make themselves known, but by then the problems of Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire have compounded into a rather boring mess.</p>


<p>For much of the game you will be flying through the skies of Sky Ocean in either a small airjet or a big airship, depending on the environment. The airjets are used to explore the few floating islands and outposts dotted about and used in combat against other airships and flying beasts. The big airship is used to fight the bigger pirate and alliance ships that are all sitting in place across the Sky Ocean.</p>


<p>For what should be an ocean filled with hustle and bustle of other adventurers, traders and more, it feels strange that only your ship is moving through it. It also suffers from lacking draw distances and other issues. This sky ocean has lots of floating lands that appears via pop in or form right in front of you. In the basement region, the island artifacts just did not render properly, constantly appearing and disappearing. One of the areas you’ll find in each region is a hunting zone to gather resources from the flying beasts and they may even have treasure chests, but the random generation is so poor that some treasure chests just won’t open and others just do not exist even if you have flown to the spot that the marker is pointing to.</p>
<p>Combat takes too long and is unrefined. Combat is turn based with parties of up to four facing off against each other. On your turn you can choose to attack, evade, use an item or retreat. There are also Arts, elemental based weapons that can confer status effects on friend and foe alike. There are status effects which come up with the message ‘translation description missing’, so I couldn’t even tell you what some of these do. It isn’t just here that item descriptions are missing, as they are also missing for some items in the shops.</p>

<p>It also just takes too long. If you play battles at normal speed they can take over ten minutes just because of the repeating animations that play out for every attack. Luckily, you can fast forward through these animations to cut down on the time battles take. Early on, battles can be tough, but very quickly they become easy to pass because the enemy patterns hardly change letting you use the same routines to take them out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>You would also think in the Sky Oceans there would be quite a lot to do, but there isn’t. In each region, there is at least one outpost that you wander around on foot to get quests, which break down into hunting creatures for meat or taking out pirate airships. When you accept a quest to take out pirate airships, the quest giver says you need to take out five to be successful. In reality, the quest counter requires you take out six to complete the mission. In addition, when fighting in my giant airship, none of my characters ever earned any XP or levelled up, which meant the ship crew remained at level one. Not that it mattered, since the airship is totally overpowered and can take out a pirate ship in a couple of turns.&nbsp;Another issue popped up here, where after finishing battles against pirate airships my airship would inexplicably have drifted off to the edge of the map, smacking up against the air wall that separates regions.</p>

<p>When you are hunting, you will need to gather a certain number of resources, and take them back to the quest giver. First time, complete success. In the second region, I completed the hunt and returned to the town and quest giver, but I could not complete the quest because the game decided I had already completed it despite the quest being open, and the trophy for it never popping.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-superior-amd-fsr/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler is definitely superior to AMD FSR 3.1 but lags behind NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios, according to a very early comparison.</p>
<p>A couple of days back, Digital Foundry shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQKbuUXg9_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">face-off video</a> between the three upscalers based on Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart using approximate quality settings, as getting a perfect match proved to not be possible. In addition, the PC version of the game by Insomniac uses a different implementation of Dynamic Resolution Scaling than the console version. Using this approximate recreation of the same visual quality settings, the early comparison highlighted how PSSR is superior to AMD FSR 3.1 in anti-aliasing newly revealed detail and in movement. On the other hand, the upscaler lags behind NVIDIA DLSS in certain scenarios, as PSSR returns a softer image and DLSS resolves geometry with less aliasing. Still, NVIDIA had over six years to improve its upscaler, while PSSR is just at the beginning, so things will surely improve in the future.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, there's an area where the PlayStation 5 PSSR upscaler delivers better results than NVIDIA DLSS, at least in Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart. With ray-traced reflections, the Sony upscaler does a better job delivering better image stability, although this could be a result of Insomniac using a custom sampling pattern for PSSR. On lower quality settings, the Sony upscaler merges the checkerboard correctly, delivering a higher resolution output, while checkerboard artifacts are clearly visible with NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>As Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart has a high internal resolution, it is not surprising to see the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler doing a fairly good job even in its first iteration. However, the true test, as Digital Foundry highlighted, will be in games with low internal resolution, such as Alan Wake 2, whose internal res on PlayStation 5 is 864p.</p>
<p><iframe title="Upscaling Face-Off: PS5 Pro PSSR vs PC DLSS/FSR 3.1 in Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQKbuUXg9_4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take longer to know what the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler will be able to do in many other games, as the system launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-details-leak-online.1014927/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-online-playtest-leak/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Several users have leaked details on the Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program online.</p>



<p>The leaks <span>started on X (formerly Twitter) with user&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233?t=fhm7o87i8WjzEhEMX9QsoQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@Ethan_ThisGuy</a>, who shared several images of the playtest’s con</span>tents. Nintendo quickly DMCA’d the content, but mirrors and other users have since uploaded the photos.</p>



<p>The images read, “In this game, the goal is to work with others to fully “develop” a massive, expansive planet by utilising creativity and farmed resources. As you progress across the planet, you’ll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will become essential in your journey.”</p>



<p>It continues, “Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a heating light that purifies and developers the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done. Players will repeat this process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.” </p>



<p>Images and details from the leaks suggest that the game is going to be a Nintendo MMO, with the visually on-brand in a cartoony fashion. Images of the leaks can be found over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1g8hr2p/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_info_has_already/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch Online Playtest Program is scheduled to take place between October 24 and November 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/british-fallout-like-atomfall-gets-detailed-gameplay-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Atomfall, the forthcoming British <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>-like game from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> studio Rebellion, has received a new trailer detailing more of its setting and gameplay.</p>
<p>Set in 1962, the game takes place in a fictional quarantine zone in the north of England, though is loosely based on the Windscale fire, an accident in a nuclear reactor facility in Cumbria, 1957.</p>
<p>Of course, there's something far more sinister going on here and it's up to players to discover the truth of the accident - as you can see in the trailer below.</p>

<p>For instance, the zone is controlled by a military response team called Protocol but are they really who they seem? Then there's the British Atomic Research Division (B.A.R.D), responsible for experiments in nuclear bunkers. There are other factions too, like the primitive cults that have sprouted in the region along with imposing wicker men.</p>
<p>The trailer provides a clear look at gameplay, which involves plenty of first-person combat, sneaking around military facilities, crafting ammo and tools, and battling giant mechs and glowing zombie-like creatures.</p>
<p>It's clearly inspired by Fallout, but with a welcome British twist. That was certainly my impression of the game when I went hands-on at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, though this trailer provides far more detail beyond me swinging a cricket bat at enemies.</p><p>At the least, I was particularly fond of its various British-isms, from the rolling countryside, to eating cornish pasties, and a character greeting me with a hearty "how do?!". There were plenty of dialogue options too as you uncover the mysteries beneath the hills, though it's unclear for now if RPG-style choices will impact the narrative.</p>
<p>Atomfall will release across current and last-gen consoles - PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S - as well as PC (Steam, Epic, Windows). It's also coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>Will you be giving it a go?</p>
<p>Fallout itself may not be going to the UK anytime soon, but the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-mod-closes-in-on-1m-downloads-as-team-folon-gears-up-for-next-fix">Fallout: London mod has proven incredibly successful</a> - it's almost at a million downloads.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Elijah Wood is set to star as Dr Jonathan Crane (aka Scarecrow) in Camouflaj's upcoming VR game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-shadow">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>.</p>
<p>Wood, who among many roles is perhaps best known for starring as Frodo Baggins in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films, shared news of his casting with a video message to fans.</p>
<p>"When Camouflaj initially approached me about joining the cast for this, I was super intrigued for a few reasons," Wood said. "I'm a massive Batman fan - the films, games, comics, I collected the toys when I was young - and I was super intrigued at the notion that this next chapter in the Arkham series would be done entirely in VR."</p>

</figure>
<p>Wood added this was his first experience with motion capture, and the prospect of that "excited" him.</p>
<p>"And then, obviously, playing such an iconic character was a delicious request," Wood closed. I'm very excited to see all of your reactions to this game. I am excited myself to experience it and play it, but until then, remember: Just like fear, the shadow exists within us all."</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whM4tQo02YU">Q&amp;A with the developers</a>, Camouflaj studio head and game director Ryan Payton and director of production at Camouflaj Matt Walker said they had Wood in mind for the role from the very start, with "no backup plan" in place if the actor said no.</p>
<p>
"So, thank God when we prepared all the materials and the whole pitch, he responded very favourably to the offer," the developers shared.</p> <div>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadows-vr-take-on-the-dark-knight-now-has-a-release-date">Batman: Arkham Shadow is set to release tomorrow</a>, 22nd October, on Meta Quest 3.</p>
<p>The game is set prior to Arkham Asylum (though after Warner Bros. Montreal's own prequel entry, Batman Arkham Origins). The decision to set the game during this time was a deliberate move by Camouflaj, as it would allow Shadow to feature a younger, less experienced Bat that could be put under pressure without an array of allies.</p><p>For more, our Tom spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-shadow-might-be-vr-but-its-the-first-dc-game-since-arkham-knight-im-actually-excited-for">Camouflaj boss Ryan Payton about Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> earlier this year. Meanwhile, Eurogamer's VR connoisseur Ian has already been hands (and eyes) on with the game. You can check out his thoughts in the video above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In a climactic scene of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a>, hero and amateur snowboarder Cloud Strife stands with his fellow adventurers as they are about to face a final, possibly fatal battle. With the steely glare of a polygonal warrior on the verge of killing god, he turns to them and says: "Let's mosey!" It's an unintentionally comical moment - an easy-going phrase, as if they're all going to the shops and not jumping into a big glowing pit at the end of the world.</p>
<p>It's a result of the RPG's famously rushed translation. But maybe not in the way you think. A fan translation of Final Fantasy VII has now fixed a bunch of mistakes that were present in the original, and "let's mosey" is one of them. The fix? Have Cloud say it way more often.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The fan rework of the script is the work of the <a href="https://www.shinraarchaeology.com/retransmod.html">Shinra Archaeology Department</a>, a group of fans who have combed through the original Japanese with the aim of creating a mod that offers "a full retranslation of the game's text that fixes mistakes in the original English translation; improves tonal accuracy using idiomatic language; and conforms to the localization choices of the Compilation and Remake trilogy where applicable." </p>
<p>In other words, they are out to fix that bit where Aerith sees an unwell dude and says: "This guy are sick". (In that case, they've gone with the simple: "The guy in there seems pretty ill.") For the true localisation nerds among you, the modding team have shown all their working. You can see the full script and all its alterations in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gV0egr-cpvBdL0aCX-qke5LhuNfqcB75S_CG7-vG1jM/edit?gid=637880383#gid=637880383">this Google sheets document</a>. </p><p>As for the "let's mosey" line, the solution is counter-intuitive but it checks out. Far from removing that one instance of Cloud's casual call to saunter, this rework actually restores all the <em>other</em> moments when Cloud says it throughout the game, as it appears in the original Japanese. In the English version, it was most often simply translated as "let's go", making our blond buster boy's fascination with moseying a kind of forgotten catchphrase. As a result, when he says it in this climactic moment, it makes no sense. To us English speakers, he's never said it before.</p>
<p>For a fuller understanding of this moment, and why it's jarring, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsiJPoHlPqEEA07AKMQ2Hm2oRLiGkR_uJ">this video series by Tim Rogers</a>, former wordist of Kotaku, who also went through the entirety of Final Fantasy VII, pointing out many of the mistakes made by the original put-upon translator. Here's <a href="https://youtu.be/oOiPU7cmLn0?feature=shared&amp;t=2349">the moment in question</a>, so you don't need to watch all those videos (but you <em>could</em> - they're a lot of fun). </p>
<p>Anyway, if you like the idea of replaying the game with a new localisation effort, you can install the mod using the <a href="https://7thheaven.rocks/">7th Heaven Mod Manager</a>, though you will need <a href="https://github.com/dotaxis/7thDeck">a different mod manager</a> if you want to make it run on Steam Deck, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/final-fantasy-7-retranslation-mod-promises-english-speaking-players-an-experience-as-close-as-possible-to-that-of-japanese-speaking-players/">PC Gamer note</a> in the article that brought it to my attention.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/it-took-about-2-seconds-for-nintendos-mysterious-switch-game-to-leak<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nintendo is working to take down images of its new unannounced Switch game after the internet — as expected — leaked it online.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-asks-players-to-please-not-talk-about-its-mystery-switch-online-playtest-when-it-goes-live-and-we-all-know-how-thats-going-to-go">Nintendo asked those who successfully signed up for its then mysterious Switch Online Playtest not to reveal what it is once it went live</a>. Documentation included a request “that you do not discuss or disclose content from either the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test software or website with others.”</p><p>At the time, the internet collectively scoffed at that request. And now, it’s all out in the wild. Today, October 21, ahead of the playtest going live on October 23, some users were able to download the playtest, which weighs in at 2.2GB. Images of this website and its details are now spreading across social media, Discords, and subreddits.</p><p>The leak appears to have been kickstarted by X/Twitter user @Ethan_ThisGuy, who posted images of the playtest website along with the post: “hope Nintendo doesn't kill me for this.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hope nintendo doesn't kill me for this <a href="https://t.co/dgVHQFCaXX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/dgVHQFCaXX</a></p>— Ethan :3 (@Ethan_ThisGuy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><em><strong>Spoilers</strong></em><em> for Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program test follow:</em></p><p>Those images, which X/Twitter has now pulled offline “in response to a report from the copyright holder” (a clear sign of their legitimacy), reveals a social MMO hybrid experience some are already comparing to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/miiverse">Miiverse</a>, Nintendo’s discontinued social network for 3DS and Wii U.</p><p>The idea, according to leaked images of the Nintendo website, is to work with other players to develop a massive planet via farmed resources and building on your own plot of land. Players use Beacons that emit a healing light that “purifies and develops the land.” The idea is to place multiple Beacons until your planetary block is fully developed.</p><p>The player’s Beacon sounds like a protected space in which only they can move, lift, or edit items. Outside their Beacon is considered a public space anyone can work in.</p><p>There’s a ‘Dev Core’ that acts as a player hub. Here you level up your character, obtain items, and talk to other players. Players earn points for developing the land and socializing with others.</p><p>There’s a definite user-generated content (UGC) aspect to this new game, and you’ll be able to share what you make with others. This is very Nintendo: it says to create UGC players must pass a test in-game to show they understand “the importance of respectful communication.” Only then will players obtain a UGC License and be able to create UGC. There is, as you’d expect, a player report feature, which I imagine will come in handy for tackling all those… certain things players will inevitably build.</p><p>And finally, as Nintendo had signaled, it recommends playing this new game in TV setup with a wired connection, given it’s a server-based experience.</p><p>That’s all we have for now. It’s odd that Nintendo would insist on such secrecy around what sounds like a relatively straightforward Switch online MMO (we still don’t know the name of the thing), but hopefully we’ll know more when it actually goes live later this week and, well, the whole thing inevitably leaks.</p><p>This is a Switch experience for now, but the big question is whether it will also be available on the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-everyones-talking-about-nintendo-switch-2-leaks-today"><u>Switch 2</u></a>, which Nintendo has yet to formally announce.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Information on Nintendo's upcoming Switch Online Playtest Program has leaked online.</p>
<p>Last week, Nintendo announced it would be hosting a playtest on its console, which related to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people">new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service</a>. It noted places would be limited, and only up to 10,000 people would be accepted to participate in the test.</p>
<p>At this time, Nintendo asked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-asks-switch-online-playtesters-not-to-disclose-any-information-but-how-long-will-that-last">successful applicants not to disclose details of the test</a>. But, they have, and we now have an idea of what Nintendo is working on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Images from documentation sent to program participants have been shared on social media. They allude to an almost MMO-sounding game, which features blocky Minecraft-like worlds. Players were reportedly told they will need to work together "to fully develop a massive, expansive planet by utilising creativity and farmed resources", with new lands, enemies, and resources appearing while players progress.</p>
<p>Another image described "special tools" called Beacons which would "heal the land". Meanwhile, the playtest will reportedly feature a "social hub" in which players can interact with each other.</p>
<p>The images, seen by Eurogamer earlier this morning, have since been removed from the internet due to a copyright strike by Nintendo.</p> <div>

<p>The playtest is due to officially launch on 24th October, and run for a little under two weeks, until 6th November. It involves a 2.2 GB software download. We will likely hear more on the playtest over the coming weeks, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Nintendo recently released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">motion-sensing alarm clock, Alarmo</a>. The bedside gadget is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-alarmo-clock-costs-90-now-available-to-switch-online-subscribers">available now in the UK if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber</a>, priced £89.99 on these shores.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The playtest is running from October 23rd, 9PM ET until November 5th, 8PM ET, and is only available to the roughly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266478/nintendo-switch-online-invite-application-beta-playtest">10,000 people who have already registered</a> for the program.&nbsp;</p><p>The test software is now available to download ahead of the start of gameplay, and requires 2.2GB of free space. Participants didn’t sign an NDA, but Nintendo requested in the playtest terms and conditions that users refrain from sharing any details about it — which has gone about as well as can be expected. While Nintendo has <a href="https://x.com/Ethan_ThisGuy/status/1848221882496987233">already started issuing copyright strikes</a> to take leaked media offline, screenshots and information about the playtest are still available across websites <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1848222093864731126">like X</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1g8hzis/nintendo_switch_online_playtest_program_full/">and Reddit</a> at the time of writing.</p><p><strong>Warning: spoilers ahead!</strong></p><p>This appears to be Nintendo’s attempt to develop its first MMO (massively multiplayer online) style game. According to the game description, “the goal is to work with others to fully ‘develop’ a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and framed resources.” Players will encounter “new lands, enemies, and resources” as they progress, and utilize “Beacons” that create zones to develop the environment around where they’re placed. These Beacon zones are personal — players can only “move, lift, or edit items” in zones they have placed, and cannot edit anything within someone else’s Beacon.</p><p>There’s a separate social hub called the “Dev Core” where players can level up, obtain items, and interact with each other. Nintendo also describes “UGC (User-Generated Content) features” for creating and sharing custom content, but players are required to pass an in-game test “to show that you understand the importance of respectful communication” before this capability can be unlocked.</p><p>At a glance, the game shares some similarities with family-friendly MMO’s like <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Roblox</em>. The IP is either entirely new (in that it doesn’t feature any recognizable Nintendo characters) or it’s a placeholder for the game system itself — meaning it could be part of an existing franchise at release. All we know for sure is that previous speculation suggesting the playtest would bring <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/189706-nintendo-switch/80865507">GameCube titles to the Nintendo Switch Online</a> service can probably be put to rest.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve won't be releasing a new Steam Deck console each year because "that's kind of not really fair to your customers".</p>
<p>The handheld PC device will finally be available to purchase in Australia in November. Two of its designers from Valve, Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat, were interviewed by <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/">Reviews.org</a> and discussed the trend of yearly hardware refreshes.</p>
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence," said Yang. "We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. And, honestly, from our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better.</p>

<p>"So we really do want to wait for a generational leap in compute without sacrificing battery life before we ship the real second generation of Steam Deck. But it is something that we're excited about and we're working on."</p>
<p>Valve first released the Steam Deck in North America and Europe in 2022, which was followed by the OLED model in 2023.</p>
<p>While a Steam Deck 2 is in development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-says-technology-doesnt-exist-yet-for-full-steam-deck-20">Valve told Eurogamer last year</a> - ahead of the OLED release - that the technology does not yet exist.</p>
<p>"Obviously we'd love to get even more performance in the same power envelope, but that technology doesn't exist yet," said Aldehayyat. "That's what I think we'd call a Steam Deck 2.0.</p>
<p>"The first Steam Deck was the first moment in time where we felt like there was enough GPU performance in a portable form factor that lets you play all your Steam games. We would love for the trend of perf-per-watt to progress rapidly to do that, but it's not quite there yet."</p>
<p>It's certainly an interesting take from the company, considering Sony's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PS5 Pro</a>. It costs £700 and includes an upgraded GPU among other features, though the improvements are incremental.</p>

			<p>In July 2023, Korean publications <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> that Sony was attempting to secure some sort of exclusivity for Crimson Desert, the upcoming action/adventure game in development at Pearl Abyss.</p>
<p>Now, the Korean developer and publisher primarily known for Black Desert has confirmed that was indeed the case. More specifically, they revealed to have received an offer from Sony for a timed exclusivity that would ban the Xbox version for a period of time. However, they decided to go with the self-publishing route after judging it would result in higher profits.</p>
<p>The news came from the recent Kiwoom Securities Corporate Day, where Pearl Abyss executives talked about Crimson Desert in great detail, as <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/vlvk1703/223609533714" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> by financial blogger HPNS. The game notoriously received many delays (it was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set to launch in Winter 2021</a>); according to Pearl Abyss, this is because the developers added many gameplay features to the open world design, mainly to improve interactions with the environment and NPCs. Games like Assassin's Creed and The Legend of Zelda were referenced for the player's freedom, and Red Dead Redemption and The Witcher 3 were also huge inspirations.</p>
<p>When it comes to AI, Pearl Abyss says the NPCs have a behavior system that lets them judge the best course of action depending on the situation. For example, if they see that too many of their allies have already been slaughtered by the player, they may attempt to flee for their life. There's also a reputation system, and players can allegedly behave like a hero or a villain depending on their actions. The behaviors also change based on the day/night cycle or dynamic weather, with NPCs getting slower at night or when the temperature is freezing. Pearl Abyss also claimed having their own engine makes these features easier to implement than they would be with Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>A final interesting tidbit is that Sony reportedly gave a highly positive evaluation of Crimson Desert, which likely explains their offer. They compared it to Ghost of Tsushima for the story's quality and atmosphere, which says a lot, given that Sucker Punch's title was the most successful new IP released by Sony's PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>For more on Crimson Desert, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shown-off-in-50-minute-gameplay-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 report</a>. In theory, the game is expected to launch in the first half of 2025, although we wouldn't be too surprised if that changed again.</p>

            <p>Earlier this month, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> studio Cloud Imperium Games were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">mandating overtime for employees</a> in the lead-up to their fan convention, Citizencon, which was held this past weekend. Additionally, this TOIL (time off in lieu) wouldn’t be made available until the release of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc"> space game</a> Star Citizen’s accompanying single player campaign, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squadron-42">Squadron 42</a>.</p>
<p>At CitizenCon over the weekend, CIG head promiser Chris Roberts said that he’s “confident” that Sqorty-two will release next year, 2026, via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-confident-of-releasing-standalone-single-player-story-game-squadron-42-in-2026">Ian Games</a>. CIG also released a video of the entire first hour and fifteen of the game, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>As of this May, Star Citizen had raised over $700 million in crowd-funding. I imagine a fair old chunk of that went towards rounding up at least one and half Kojima’s worth of Gr8 M8s, including Mark Hamill, Gillian Anderson, Gary Oldman, Andy Serkis, Mark Strong, Sophie Wu, and Henry Cavill.</p><p>I haven’t watched the whole video yet, but it’s got some fun aliens in it. They’ve got teeth like the Goombas from the (good) Super Mario Movie. Has that film has a proper critical re-evaluation yet? Like, I feel that bad but interesting is better than just, palatable. I’m trying to fill space here because I don’t want to start watching the video and saying things about it. It’s very impressive but it’s still vaporware until I can physically shoot some aliens and make dialogue choices that annoy Gillian Anderson. I don't want to believe it's real just yet because, context aside, it does look very good.</p>
<p>Sqorty-two was first announced in 2012, so this clip marks a decade and change since. The game was announced as “feature complete” at Citizencon last year. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wing-commander-3-heart-tiger">Wing Commander 3: Heart Of The Tiger</a> is currently on sale! at <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/wing_commander_3_heart_of_the_tiger">GOG for £2.39</a>, and you get to make Mark Hamill say dumb shit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When the Nintendo Switch Online playtest was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-announces-open-playtest-for-undisclosed-switch-online-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on October 10, fans were extremely curious of what it could be all about. Today, the playtest became available for download to the users who had been selected ahead of the test actually going live on October 23. Alongside the download, users were also provided with plenty of information on the mysterious Nintendo Switch Online playtest, and those details have just <a href="https://streamable.com/j23wki" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked</a>.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this is a community game about connections with which Nintendo seeks to 'test the boundaries of mass multiplayer functionality and gameplay' on its servers. Here's the Nintendo Switch Online playtest overview:</p>
<p><em>In this game, the goal is to work with others to fully "develop" a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and farmed resources. As you progress across the planet, you'll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will become essential to your journey.</em></p>
<p><em>Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a healing light that purifies and develops the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done. Players will repeat the process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.</em></p>
<p><em>The Beacons players receive will be their most valuable tool. You are the master of your Beacon Zone. Only you can move, lift, or edit items within your Beacon's light. Just as others cannot edit things within your Beacon Zone, you cannot edit things in someone else's Beacon Zone. Places outside of Beacon Zones are public areas that anyone can work in. In public areas, anyone can pick up things, place them, and edit them. To protect your builds and precious items, you'll want to store them inside your Beacon Zone for safekeeping.</em></p>
<p><em>The Dev Core is a separate space from the planet you'll be developing. Think of it as a social hub to gather with other players. At the Dev Core, you can level up your character, get items you will need for your journey, commune with others, and more. Players earn Connex Points by interacting with other players in a variety of ways. Players can use Connex Points in the Dev Core to raise their Connection Level. By increasing your Connection Level, players will have access to fun community-related items.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Every player is equipped with a special skill known as the Development Positioning System, or DPS. This allows players to see a wide array of details, including the development status of the planet and the positions of other players. With the DPS's spectate feature, players can see Beacons and other players from great distances.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch Online playtest is certainly not what we thought it would be. All the same, it's an interesting endeavor for Nintendo, and if it really helps them push the server boundaries for multiplayer, all the better. Stay tuned for any more leaks and info on it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-physical-disc-release-on-october-21-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-gets-physical-disc-release-on-october-21-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1014819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-physical-disc-release-on-october-21-its-claimed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Not even 24 hours since Game Science teased its release, the launch date for the physical disc version of Black Myth: Wukong on PlayStation 5 (PS5) has been leaked online.</p>



<p>According to known data miner <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1848035754372677750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, physical edition of Black Myth: Wukong will launch on Monday, October 21 in the United States. The game will be available for $64.99.</p>







<p>For those in Europe, he said that it will launch “very soon” for €69.99. He didn’t have a specific date, however, at the time of writing. Nor  did he have information on other possible region launches.</p>



<p>“Destined Ones, thank you for your patience!” the studio said on Sunday about the pending release. “With the master disc for Black Myth: Wukong ready, the PS5 physical edition will be available to you very soon.”</p>



<p>If billbil-kun’s claim is accurate, an announcement should be coming within the next handful of hours after publishing. Also, for those wondering, it will be available from multiple retailers, and be an actual disc that comes with the copy of Black Myth: Wukong. It won’t just be a code in a box.</p>



<p>When it launched in August, Black Myth: Wukong became one of the most-played games in Steam history thanks to strong launch sales in China. In just its first month alone, the game sold over 20 million copies and had earned over $1 billion in gross revenue on Steam alone. </p>



<p>Just recently, it was discovered that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-esrb-xbox/">had been rated by the ESRB</a> for a release on Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up the physical disc for Black Myth: Wukong on PS5? Let us know in the comments, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations launches on October 25, but gameplay from the game has leaked online ahead of its official release. </p>



<p>A YouTuber by the name of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@swr.nezumi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vexi</a> managed to get a rom of the game early, and played it on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch emulator Yuzu</a>. They then uploaded two separate six-minute videos of raw gameplay. They made sure, however, to not include any story spoilers for players.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-it-s-claimed">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insomniac-gearing-up-to-show-more-from-wolverine-its-claimed/">Insomniac “Gearing Up” To Show More From Wolverine, It’s Claimed</a></h6>



<p>Also, they made it clear in the video description for one that they pre-ordered the game in order to support the developers.</p>



<p>“[I] don’t usually upload stuff like this, but figured people might want to see it since the rom is out there now,” the description reads. “Don’t worry, I already pre-ordered the game on Steam, but I’ve been so excited to play it I wanted to check it out as soon as I could.”</p>



<p>You can check out both gameplay videos for Sonic X Shadow Generations below. It should go without saying, however, that there’s a good chance they get taken down by Nintendo in short order. And let us know what you think of the gameplay in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>



<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Atomfall is inspired by the real-life events of the 1957 Windscale disaster and the story picks up five years later in a fictionalised quarantine zone that encompasses rolling countryside, valleys, caves and even a picturesque English village. </p><p>But this picture-perfect postcard setting is a hostile landscape that hides a dark mystery. To get to the bottom of what happened at Windscale, you will need to navigate military encampments, delve through abandoned bunkers below ground, and risk your life in Pagan ruins. Your trusty metal detector will also help you uncover a few secrets buried beneath the surface! </p><p>Central to the dark mystery are the host of eccentric characters and cryptic organisations that inhabit the quarantine zone. These individuals have been cut off from the outside world for years and left to their own devices, so are anything but normal. Your interactions with them are important and will shape your journey. But be careful, they aren’t all friendly and you will need to get to grips with an array of ranged and melee weapons if you are to survive!</p></blockquote><p><em>Atomfall</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,211 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,277 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,346 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,573 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,514 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/atomfall" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/atomfall/9nc4wdl5kzbl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a> in March 2025.

<p>Rebellion has published a five-minute deep dive into Atomfall online, giving players an in-depth look at the world that they’ll be exploring in this remarkable and unique game. I played Atomfall at Gamescom and can safely say it’s one of my most highly anticipated games – and that’s not just because I’m a huge Fallout fan.</p>



<p>Check out the latest Atomfall trailer below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-atomfall">Prepare for Atomfall</h2>



<p>Atomfall <strong>feels like </strong>Fallout set in the United Kingdom, but it’s so much more than that. It’s unique enough to stand apart from Bethesda Game Studios’ post-apocalyptic series, and it all begins with Atomfall being inspired by <strong>real-world events</strong> that occurred in the 1950s.</p>



<p>It’s also not exactly a post-apocalyptic game, which you’ll come to learn a bit better when you check out the video below:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>In Atomfall, you’re left up to your own devices to explore and survive in a ‘quarantine zone’, but everything is not what it seems. From what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-preview-gameplay-trailer/">I experienced at Gamescom</a>, Atomfall is a game that encourages freedom and a multi-faceted approach, allowing users to use their wits and the game’s fundamental mechanics to overcome objectives however they see fit.</p>



<p>It’s also possible to kill absolutely everyone if you so desire, so that’s great.</p>



<p>Atomfall is set to be released in March 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series XS. It’s also coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one, which is a <strong>huge </strong>win for subscribers.</p>

<p>FlyQuest is the latest team to be eliminated from the League of Legends World Championship, falling just short against Gen.G in the quarterfinals in Paris. What started as a balanced fixture turned into a dominating finish for Gen.G, who will now move into the semifinals with the hope of taking down T1 – and Faker.</p>



<p>In an emotional post-match interview, FlyQuest’s Bwipo was seen shedding tears. This is the furthest the organisation has got at the League of Legends World Championship <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one-gone">Another One Gone</h2>



<p>Only four teams now remain in the most prestigious tournament in esports. It has been a stellar year for League of Legends, and this tournament has been no different. We’ve seen record-breaking viewership throughout the competition thus far, and the crowning jewel of the event – the grand final – is yet to be played.</p>



<p>FlyQuest had a solid run at Worlds 2024 that led to a fifth-place finish. Historically, the organisation has made it to Worlds <strong>once</strong>, and even then, the team finished in twelfth place.</p>



<p>This year has been a remarkable one for the team, and there were straight expectations that the squad would get at least this far. It was just weeks ago that the team clutched the top spot at LCS Summer 2024, netting a $100,000 prize – the same amount that they’ve walked away from Worlds with.</p>



<p>In an emotional post-game interview, FlyQuest’s Bwipo said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s tough to stay positive but we made you guys believe. That was the goal.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will now be a hiatus lasting a few days before the two semifinal fixtures take place in Paris, France:</p>



<ul>
<li>Weibo Gaming vs. Bilibili Gaming</li>



<li>T1 vs. Gen.G Esports</li>
</ul>



<p>T1 is still the favourite to win, but Gen.G has had a phenomenal tournament thus far and hasn’t dropped a series. </p>



<p>Do you think T1 can pull off the win yet again? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>"It was tough for those couple of years before [Silent Hill 2's] release," director/producer Jacek Zieba told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/">Gamespot</a>. "Now it's very good spirits inside [the studio]. We want to show what we can do on our own, how we can evolve our ideas."</p><p>"They recreated a legendary game," director/designer Wojciech Piejko said of the different internal Bloober team that worked on the remake. "They made the impossible possible, and it was a bumpy road because of all the hate on the internet. The pressure was big on them, and they delivered, and for the company, it's an amazing moment."</p>
<p>"We want to be a horror company," Zieba added. "We want to find our niche, and we think we found our niche, so now we just… let's evolve with it. And how that happens is more complex, but it also happens organically in a way, like with [2016's] <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/layers-of-fear">Layers of Fear</a>, people in the studio were like, 'Okay, we made some shitty games before, but we [can] evolve'."</p>
<p>"We gathered a team that loves horror," Piejko added. "So I think, for us, it would not be easy to switch [to other genres], and we don't want to."</p>
<p>"Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Eurogamer's Silent Hill 2 Remake review</a>, awarding the game an impressive five out of five stars in the process.</p><p>Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 remake has already sold a total of 1m copies</a> across both physical and digital media since its global launch on 8th October. That likely makes Silent Hill 2 Remake the best-selling Silent Hill game ever.</p>
<p>It's been almost two weeks since fans were welcomed back to Silent Hill again, but as yet, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-silent-hill-2-remake-fans-warn-of-brookhaven-hospital-progress-glitch">still no remedy for a glitch that's soft-locking some players' progress towards the end of the Brookhaven Hospital level in Silent Hill 2 Remake. Here's everything you need to know about the glitch... and how best to avoid it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
