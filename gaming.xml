                <p>Nintendo Switch 2 users have two official methods for charging the new Joy-Con 2 Controllers for wireless play. Out of the box, you can dock the console with the controllers attached before removing them for TV mode, either connected to the grip or turned to the side for single Joy-Con controls. For $40, you can replace the standard grip with the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Nintendo+Switch+2+Controller+Charging+Docks+Are+Cheap%2C+But+There%27s+A+Catch&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-06-20+13%3A34%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-20+13%3A34%3A56&amp;fnarticle_id=6532497&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FJoy-Con-2-Charging-Grip%2F15898369899%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-controller-charging-docks-are-cheap-but-theres-a-catch%2F1100-6532497%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip</a>, which lets you charge the right and left controllers while playing.

While many of them are known brands with solid track records, there’s always the small possibility they won’t work as intended or will damage to your controllers. Unofficial controller chargers for other platforms, including the original Switch, generally work perfectly fine, and it's very rare for an accessory like this to damage your controller. But since they don't have the official Nintendo seal of approval, this is a "buy at your own risk" situation. If you want to play it as safe as possible, the Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip is the way to go. The official grip has built-in back buttons and lets you play while charging via the detachable USB-C cable.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4515966-switch2joy-conchargingdocks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515966" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4515966-switch2joy-conchargingdocks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515966"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 Joy-Con Charging Docks - third-party, not licensed by Nintendo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4515966-switch2joy-conchargingdocks.jpg"></figure><p>Of the unofficial products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mumba-Charging-Nintendo-Switch-Controllers/dp/B0DWMQ2N7F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mumba Charging Dock</a> has been the most popular on Amazon since the Switch 2's launch earlier this month. It has sold over 1,000 units in the past month and has earned great reviews from buyers so far. Offering a compact design that holds and charges up to four Joy-Con 2, it’s a frugal choice at just $20.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition is coming. Publisher Modiphius has announced a streamlined version of the officially licensed, narrative-focused miniature skirmish game, incorporating changes to the rules based on player feedback.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare </em>Second Edition Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2026. This new edition will launch with box sets containing new plastic miniatures for the game. If you already own some Wasteland Warfare miniatures from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-wasteland-warfare-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Commonwealth</a> or from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> TV</a> series, they will be compatible with this new edition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-wasteland-warfare-second-edition-supermutant-miniatures.jpg?itok=mOEiL0Ms 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-wasteland-warfare-second-edition-supermutant-miniatures.jpg?itok=R7p94ayD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare </em>Second Edition will be a solo-first adventure wargame. You play as a customizable hero from one of <em>Fallout's</em> many factions. From there, you can recruit a warband and explore a procedurally generated apocalyptic wasteland, surviving attacks from creatures, mutants, and humans.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this new edition will retain some multiplayer. These include a co-op mode where multiple players can join a single warband and explore a campaign map together. Alternatively, there is a battle mode where players can duke it out with their custom warbands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re doubling down on all the best bits of the Wasteland Warfare experience, inspired by elements of the Into the Wasteland, Homestead, and solo rules from the first edition, to give players a more refined and streamlined version of the solo campaign that’s so popular. The game really nails the feeling of Fallout: exploring the wasteland around you, being jumped by irradiated creatures, coming across other camps of survivors, raiders, or super mutants, and scavenging what you need for your warband to survive. War never changes!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon release, <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition will support fifteen different factions taken from the history of the franchise. These include staples like the Brotherhood of Steel, NCR, Super Mutants, Raiders, and Survivors, as well as more recent groups like the Minutemen, the Institute, and the Cult of the Mothman. These factions will receive further support in supplements down the line.</p>

The movie was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/10/19/konami-announces-silent-hill-2-remake-silent-hill-f-a-new-movie-and-more">first announced</a> to be in production in October 2022 during the first Silent Hill Transmission.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> is being directed and co-written by Christophe Gans, who directed the 2006 <em>Silent Hill</em> film. The project also boasts a soundtrack composed by long-time series composer Akira Yamaoka. The movie is an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, which was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/silent-hill-2/engrossing-and-unsettling">remade in 2024</a>, and centers on protagonist James Sunderland receiving a letter from his deceased wife, Mary, urging him to find her in the foggy, monster-infested town of Silent Hill. Despite being the third film adaptation of the franchise and the first since 2012’s <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>, <em>Return to Silent Hill </em>is not connected to the previous movies.</p><p dir="ltr">The cast includes Jeremy Irvine as James, Hannah Emily Anderson as both Mary Sunderland and Maria, and Evie Templeton as Laura. You can check out the film's original 2022 teaser (complete with commentary from Gans) below. <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> is set to premiere in theaters on January 23.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZLrjCzVGz8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZLrjCzVGz8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's been an eventful time for the Silent Hill franchise.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-reveals-persona-4-revival-and-stranger-than-heaven-might-not-be-out-until-2027.1224426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to SEGA's <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20250618_Management_large_MTG_all_e.pdf">latest fiscal report</a>, the recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-revival-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-new-trailer/"> Persona 4 Revival</a> and RGG Studio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/stranger-than-heaven-is-the-official-name-of-rgg-studios-project-century/">Stranger Than Heaven</a> might not be out on store shelves until 2027.</p>
<p>Included on a slide in the presentation about what's defined as the "<em>medium-term pipeline</em>" for SEGA and its release schedule, five announced games are listed, including Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, which is due out on September 25, 2025.</p>
<p>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, which is already out at this time of writing, Football Manager, set for a 2025 launch, and Persona 4 Revival and Stranger Than Heaven.</p>
<p>Both Persona 4 Revival and Stranger Than Heaven are listed as "<em>announced titles to be released in or after FY2027/3.</em>"</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This release window doesn't lock in either game to releasing in 2027. SEGA's 2027 fiscal year will begin in the 2026 calendar year, which means either, or even both games, could still likely make it out in the back half of 2026.</p>
<p>But it does give us a sense that we could be waiting until 2027 for at least one of these games, if not both, to make it out the door.</p>
<p>We heard <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">rumors and teases</a> about Persona 4 Revival for months leading up to its official reveal, and Stranger Than Heaven was first known as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-virtua-fighter-project-century-announced-by-like-a-dragon-series-developer-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/">Project Century</a>&nbsp;before its official title was announced this month as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. A two-year wait time for either game sounds about right, considering the pace at which modern video games are made.</p>
<p>Hopefully, we'll be hearing more about both games soon, though if they really aren't going to be out in 2026, we might not hear any more from SEGA about either game for the rest of 2025 while the teams working on them are heads-down in development.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>

<p dir="ltr">Nobody is quite sure what the reason for the bug is. Some players report it happening while in a full party, while others said it happened to them playing solo. A few players theorize that the bug could be coming as a result of player's dealing too much damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Even before her Season 8 rework, Lilith has always been a hard fight (despite her <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hardest-boss-in-diablo-4-has-already-been-defeated/1100-6515043/" data-ref-id="1100-6515043">being defeated for the first time</a> less than a week after Diablo 4 came out). Her various phases made her a significant challenge unless players could deal enough damage to largely ignore the fight's oppressive mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, in Season 8, players are now forced to deal with those mechanics even more than before. Even if a player can deal an incredible amount of damage, it's impossible to "brute force" through the phases, as attacks that would previously transition her into the next phase will instead only drop her health to a specific percentage. This makes for extended periods of time during where Lilith is entirely immune to damage, forcing players to dodge her various projectiles and spike waves which inflict a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players for a mistake.</p><p dir="ltr">A bug making Lilith unkillable wouldn't be the biggest deal if Blizzard hadn't tied an important reward, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-get-resplendent-sparks-for-uber-unique-crafting/1100-6523718/" data-ref-id="1100-6523718">Resplendent Spark</a> used to create Mythic Uniques, to the first time players kill her each season. Despite the annoying nature of the boss fight, players almost always want to defeat her at least once to claim the Spark before ignoring the boss for the rest of the season. That, however, isn't exactly possible when she can't be killed.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't issued a response to the thread on Reddit or offered an ETA on when players can expect a fix. Broken boss fights aren't the only issue Diablo 4 players are contending with, as the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-reliquary-battle-pass-system-is-even-worse-than-players-originally-thought/1100-6532514/" data-ref-id="1100-6532514">Reliquary battle pass has also drawn criticism for its poor design</a>. Blizzard has stated its looking to make changes to Diablo 4's Reliquary system in the future, partially out of response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">Diablo 4's disappointing Berserk crossover</a>, but that those changes won't be arriving as part of its upcoming Season 9. Diablo 4 Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, is set to arrive on July 1 and will let <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">players craft their own spells</a>.</p>

			<p>Mafia: The Old Country has gone gold ahead of its August 8, 2025, release date, developer Hangar 13 has announced.</p>
<p>The studio posted a short video clip on the <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1936076608135172440">official Mafia X account</a> announcing the news, as the team now shifts to focusing on polish and making sure Mafia: The Old Country is ready for prime-time when it releases in August.</p>
<p>The Old Country is a prequel and a return for the series after the last brand-new Mafia game came out in 2016. Since then, we've had a remake of the first game and remasters for the second and third games, but nothing brand new until now.</p>
<p>Hangar 13 has claimed that this will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-says-mafia-the-old-country-will-be-the-best-looking-mafia-game-thanks-to-unreal-engine-5/">"<em>the best looking Mafia game</em>"</a> in the series, and, through the studio's work with Italian developer Stormind Games, has put in the effort to make everything about players' journey in Italy <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-in-mafia-the-old-country-feels-authentic-says-co-developer/">an "<em>authentic</em>" experience</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our priority has always been to ensure that everything in the game feels authentic</em>," said senior project manager at Stormind Games, Salvo Fallica. "<em>The details are absolutely key in keeping the immersion of the player</em>," added Hangar 13's lead writer Matthew Aitken.</p>
<p>We've seen plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hangar-13-digs-into-mafia-the-old-country-gameplay-narrative-and-more-at-pax-east/">gameplay footage</a> and heard a lot from Hangar 13 about how much work they've put in to this release. We'll see in August if this is a strong return for the series or not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> fans believe they've now worked out the truth behind recent teases that suggested something was going on with Rockstar's beloved cowboy franchise — but it's not what many fans had been hoping for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, John Marston actor Rob Wiethoff teased that he had "exciting news" to share that was "absolutely killing" him to keep quiet, while chatting with fans during a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lbextu/i_wonder_what_this_could_mean" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">livestream</a>. Wiethoff suggested that, whatever the news was, fans would hear about it by the end of this week — and that he wouldn't be the only one sharing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mystery deepened when Red Dead Redemption 2's Arthur Morgan actor Roger Clark subsequently confirmed that he was also aware of the news, but couldn't yet say more. Immediately, fans began to speculate that the pair were involved in some kind of announcement regarding the future of the franchise, such as the reveal of an upgraded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> — something that has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-nintendo-switch-2-by-end-of-2025-and-theres-a-rumored-next-gen-upgrade-patch-too">previously been reported as in development for Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With fan hopes at fever pitch, Wiethoff released a statement earlier this week clearly designed to manage expectations. In it, John Marston's voice actor said he "possibly misled some people" in regards to how exciting the announcement was, and said he did "not make announcements for Rockstar games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I do have something I'm really excited about, I truly am, and I think you will be too," Wiethoff said. "I really do think so, but I possibly misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just please recognize – and I know that you know this, but let me remind you, I guess – I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that, I'm just reminding you I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/cyberboiuk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@cyberboiuk</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Mctannen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Mctannen</a> <br>Rob Wiethoff has clarified that his announcement has nothing to do with rockstar. <a href="https://t.co/WmlWJD1GSQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WmlWJD1GSQ</a></p>— jon🚬 (@jonbranham_) <a href="https://twitter.com/jonbranham_/status/1935043619754250697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the big mystery announcement? Well, fans have now <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> confirmation of a Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2 cast reunion, which is set to take place at the National Gaming Expo in Tampa, Florida from August 8 to August 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Was this the announcement [Wiethoff] was so excited for?" wrote one fan on reddit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think so," added replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It would be great if they waited for this convention to reveal there's going to be SOME kind of update, remastering, DLC, a next chapter etc," said a third. "It's definitely wishful thinking on my part."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 originally launched for PS4 and Xbox One back in October 2018, and arrived on PC a year later. Fans have long hoped for a revamped version designed to take advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but, more than five years after those consoles launched, a re-release or remaster is yet to arrive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Rockstar has been busy during this time building Grand Theft Auto 6, which after its recent delay will now launch on May 26, 2026. Surely there's time to pop out a Red Dead Redemption 2 patch before then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>In the 12 years since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, two of the three main characters, Franklin Clinton and Trevor Philips, have reappeared in Grand Theft Auto Online, while Michael De Santa has only been mentioned. But if the actors behind these iconic characters get their way, they'd reunite GTA 5's trio for one last heist. </p><p>Earlier this month, Steven Ogg (Trevor), Ned Luke (Michael), and Shawn Fonteno (Franklin) made a joint appearance together at Comic Con Brussels (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-5s-michael-trevor-franklin-want-gta-6-return-in-final-score-story-dlc-3216565/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>). At the 12:40 mark in the video below, the actors spoke about their desire to reunite in a DLC for GTA Online called The Final Score, which was named by Luke. The trio stressed that Rockstar doesn't currently have any plans to bring them back together, and urged fans to campaign for it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkGCcdAhJUM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KkGCcdAhJUM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rockstar has yet to shed light on whether GTA Online will continue following the release of Grand Theft Auto 6 next year.

With its relatively simple gameplay, Rematch is an enjoyable game to watch and play. play. Of course, with a growing player-base comes questions about what's next for the game, and the developers found time to address them. </p><p>Over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/534353549843235107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, the team behind Rematch went through a laundry list of updates, how they're working to prevent lag that affects gameplay, and addressed the potential of crossplay down the line. However, they also assured players they're taking one thing at a time.</p><p>"We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone who joined us during the Early Access launch and shared valuable feedback," the statement read. "Seeing players from all over the world enjoying Rematch and expressing their excitement online has been incredibly rewarding."</p><p>The team had initially wanted to implement a crossplay feature, but "unforeseen technical complexities" prevented it from being ready on time. They added that they understand players' frustration and are going to get it working soon.</p><p>"It's very important for us that our players are able to enjoy Rematch with their friends, so along with bugfixes, crossplay is our absolute highest priority. We're committed to delivering this feature swiftly, and we'll share a more precise deadline as soon as possible."</p><p>Here are also issues they're looking into for the game:</p><ul><li><strong>Core gameplay:</strong> Simple fixes like improving the sliding tackle, tweaks to goalkeeper mechanics, to the dribbling system and wall contact.

The idea would be that as they move forward, test servers will be at work so they can try out new features and improvements in a live environment.</li><li><strong>Competitive features:</strong> They are currently designing a tournament system with a leaderboard system for players above Elite ranking. There's also a club creation system in the works that will be aiming to provide more variety for competitive players.</li><li><strong>Social components:</strong> While crossplay is their top priority, other features are also being worked on such as being able to spectate your squad’s game when you join a squad. This will allow players to team up and rematch with teammates they enjoyed playing with, and more.</li><li><strong>Casual play features:</strong> Aside from a new quick play game mode and a rotating game mode queue, AI-controlled bots will be used so that players are able to train with and against the computer in both workshops or in dedicated game modes.</li></ul><p>"Please remember that we are not a huge team, and that these features take time, so don't expect all this by the end of the year! We will communicate on a more precise roadmap for upcoming seasons as soon as we have better visibility on when we can deliver on these intentions."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s major 11.2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a> will add a highly-requested feature fans have been waiting years for–the ability to lean.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, as spotted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/new-lean-emote-on-patch-11-2-ptr-377340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, the /lean emote is finally being added to Blizzard's MMORPG. It's the first major emote addition since 2008, when a large list of emotes were added as part of the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Lean is something players, and particularly roleplayers, have wanted for quite some time, as the ability for NPC characters to lean against terrain was added during 2018's Battle for Azeroth expansion. In 11.2, characters can use the lean emote to prop up against a wall and give off that oh-so-important mysterious adventurer vibe or practice being a mime and just lean in mid-air against nothing at all.</p><p dir="ltr">When compared to all the major new content coming with the Ghosts of K'aresh update, including a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Ecological Succession world activity, and an encounter against a Stormwind city-sized raid boss (the biggest boss in WoW's history, according to Blizzard), the addition of a new emote doesn't sound like a big deal. It is, however, a major win for the game's roleplayers, a community within WoW that Blizzard has stated (like in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">interview about WoW's 20th anniversary</a>) it is looking to do more for. Maybe players will get fully-animated hugs or high-fives next?</p><p dir="ltr">While it's the first time in a long time Blizzard has added an emote, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-patch-9-1-5-will-remove-or-change-a-long-list-of-crude-emotes/1100-6496685/" data-ref-id="1100-6496685">changed or removed some emotes entirely in 2021</a> in the wake of a state of California lawsuit that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-will-pay-54-million-to-california-after-settling-lawsuit/1100-6520018/" data-ref-id="1100-6520018">later settled</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, however, took various steps in its games while the lawsuit was still ongoing to make its communities more welcoming, including in WoW. Emotes like /kick, /moan, /rear, /smell and others were removed entirely, while some, like /drool and /whistle, were made so they could no longer target specific players.</p><p dir="ltr">The new lean emote is just one of Ghosts of K'aresh's new social features, as the update will also add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls'-like asynchronous multiplayer functions</a> to WoW's endgame Delves. WoW's 11.2 update does not yet have a release date and isn't yet available for testing on the game's public test realm, but players are already theorizing based on datamining that a new Void-themed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-are-convinced-a-new-way-to-play-demon-hunter-is-coming-soon/1100-6532569/" data-ref-id="1100-6532569">Demon Hunter specialization</a> could be coming soon.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I'm here to tell you that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a>'s free-roam mode is great when there isn't someone yapping in your ear about how "bad" and "empty" it is.</p><p dir="ltr">Since its release a few weeks ago alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the latest installment in the vaunted kart-racing series has had a few more ups and downs than expected. For all the praise the game has accrued--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/">it received a 9 from GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>--Mario Kart World has also gotten its fair share of knocks and detractors, and a great deal of the criticism that's been aimed at it recently has centered on its free-roam mode. Those criticisms claim that the mode (and the world it makes available to players) is largely barren and what activities do fill it are lackluster.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode drops players onto the large interconnected roadways of the newest game. If a player wanted to, they could drive from Acorn Heights, the northernmost track in the game, all the way down to Dino Dino Jungle at the southern tip of the continent. All the while, they can zoom past Toads in cars, buses, and trucks on the highways that connect these courses to one another. Along the way, there are even P-Switches that toggle challenges and races, warp pipes that transport players to hidden rooms, collectable Peach medallions in out-of-the-way spots, and stickers to collect to garnish your player profile. It's simple, uncomplicated, and nice. The mode is exactly what it's been billed as, and I cannot really understand the heat it's getting.</p><p dir="ltr">While I've been basking in all free-roam has to offer, I'll be the first to admit that there isn't much else going on here. Challenges can often be pretty mindless, and while some can exasperate, most are over in a flash. The rewards for finding Peach medallions and question block panels are trivial and insignificant in the grand scheme of the game. Roaming around freely can feel like the gaming equivalent of consuming empty calories, and I recognize how this chafes against the expectations of players being dropped into a huge in-game world in 2025. But I think the fact that Mario Kart World's free-roam does away with the excess and frills is precisely the point of the mode, and it does my head in that there is an audience out there that isn't connecting with it because they want something else. This isn't the next Forza Horizon game, whose map will be dotted with countless side activities and missions for the player to do. It's Mario Kart World, and it's doing things its own way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518313"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World's free-roam mode features Rosalina's tour bus company and more.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518313-img_1392.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I think there's a clear distinction between the notion of a video game with a "free-roam" mode, which is what's on offer in Mario Kart World, and an "open-world" game, a phrase that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-not-an-open-world-game-nintendo-says/1100-6532034/">Nintendo has explicitly stated it avoided</a> invoking throughout the game's development. The latter is a game like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Cyberpunk 2077, which are entirely different experiences you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6618/">also get on the Switch 2</a>. Hell, if we want to pit Mario Kart World against a proper open-world racing game, look no further than Forza Horizon 5. There are hundreds of other examples that you could find to fit that mold across gaming's history, but that won't change the core argument here: Mario Kart World is not an open-world game, and we're better off leaving it that way than arguing for it to become something it was never meant to be.</p><p dir="ltr">I say this because I've relished the quiet nights that I've squeezed out of Mario Kart World's free-roam mode. I've never taken a proper road trip, but I imagine the ability to make that space for peace and quiet is what it's all about. I've been conjuring those very vibes on the regular by aimlessly hitting the open road in World, going wherever it may take me, and taking pictures of the charming little world Nintendo has spun from this historic franchise. This is a place where I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">play as a cow</a>, pick up a burger from a fast-food restaurant operated by Yoshi, and park next to a Shy Guy seated on a bench. It's a world with hitchhiking Toads, random campsites, and a tour bus company apparently run by Rosalina. Some guy on the internet <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/04/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2/" rel="nofollow ">claims there are UFOs</a> to be found in free-roam, and others are taking over semi-trucks and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tahk0_/video/7516248904929725727?q=mario%20kart%20world%20area%2051&amp;t=1750311855590" rel="nofollow ">storming the gates of an in-game Area 51</a>. Sometimes, enjoying games means taking it on its own terms and appreciating the tiniest of moments and details, or just making your own fun, rather than expecting it to deliver some huge creative swings.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, free-roam also allows me to sidestep the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/these-mario-kart-world-tips-could-help-you-win-more-races/1100-6532281/">frankly ridiculously competitive nature</a> of Mario Kart World--which is more intense than it has ever been, thanks to a slew of new advanced maneuvers--and explore the sights of magnificent locales like I've never been able to before. Go to the Great ? Block Ruins in free-roam and really take in the view of the dilapidated skyscraper-sized block. Try to make sense of it, and if you can't, just bask in it. I know I sure did.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518315"></a><figcaption>Sometimes, free-roam mode is perfect for a chill, late night drive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4518315-img_1393.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm sure I'll be called a mark or some kind of Nintendo apologist, but the simple truth is this: Mario Kart World fully delivers on a vibes-based free-roam mode, and I prefer that to any of the half-dozen overstuffed open-world titles available at any given moment. And hey, I love some of those games quite a lot, but a break from them is just as welcome as having more of them to play. Games that big can feel grand and adventurous to start before devolving into laborious trudges and when everything is an open-world RPG, it begins to feel like nothing is special. It's rare then to get a marquee title from a major developer and publisher like Nintendo that does away with the excess and cuts right to the chase, making Mario Kart World a breath of fresh air. Y'know, through the scent of exhaust fumes and Yoshi burgers.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, what else might you possibly want or need from an open-world Mario Kart game that you can't already get in the larger package of World? If you want to race, hit a grand prix or Knockout match. Want some challenges? Well, free-roam's already got those in spades, but there's an additional set of Time Trials that have long been a staple in the series. Want some competition? Go online and do some good ol' fashioned versus battles. If you want collectibles, the game's already got 'em!</p><p dir="ltr">When you really think about it, what's an actionable feature that could tangibly make Mario Kart's free-roam a richer experience? Side quests? Possible interactions with roaming NPCs? One-on-one races with rivals? I can see some of that working in this game, but by and large, I don't think any of it is the silver-bullet fix that'll enrich Mario Kart World for the players disgruntled by its implementation of free-roam. I think what they might be looking for is simply a different kind of game.</p><p>So yes, Mario Kart World's free-roam mode is not the most robust offering. If you come to it expecting the next great open-world title, you're likely to be sorely disappointed. What you get instead is so much better though, so much more <em>freeing</em>, and in a field awash with overstuffed and overstimulating titles around every corner, I'm grateful that Mario Kart World eschews those trends and stays in its own lane where it (and I) remain unbothered.</p>

But I assure you, it makes a certain kind of sense considering that a) four of Aftermath’s five founders are based in New York City, and b) the office of current <a href="https://defector.com/the-most-unbelievable-bits-from-nyc-mayor-eric-adamss-indictment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disgraced clown mayor Eric Adams</a> has actually made an effort where video games are concerned, alongside <a href="https://esd.ny.gov/industries/digital-game-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a push from New York state</a> that includes $25 million in tax credits for projects made in New York.</p><p>In 2022, the Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/306-22/mayor-adams-takes-steps-transform-new-york-city-global-hub-digital-games-industry#/0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">established</a> a Game Development Industry Council that included figures from Microsoft, Take-Two, Avalanche Studios, Games for Change, Game Developers of Color Expo, NYU Game Center, and Zynga. It also funded a $2 million bachelor’s game design degree program with the goal of, <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-city-nyc-eric-adams-bachelor-s-degree-game-dev-1848933337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Adams put it</a>, helping NYC “level up and finally become a leader in the digital gaming space.” There have been <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/12032024-minecraft-battle-of-the-boroughs.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/02082024-battle-of-the-boroughs.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mayoral <em>Minecraft </em>tournaments</a> for students with the goal of “addressing climate change while continuing to make our city the digital gaming capital of the world.” </p><p>This year, the Mayor’s Office also <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/mome/news/05282025-nyc-video-game-festival.page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosted an inaugural NYC Video Game Festival</a> in May to kick off “NYC Summer of Games,” a series of gaming-related expos, tournaments, exhibits, workshops and programs across the city. A lot of them are events that happen every summer anyway, but now there’s an umbrella over them.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the NYC Video Game Festival, our own Riley MacLeod, who was in attendance, says: “I caught the high school finals for the <em>Minecraft</em> tournament, where teams from a school in each of the boroughs had to build an environmentally-friendly version of Ellis Island and then give a presentation on it. As someone who’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worked in education and on educational games</a>, I thought it was actually really cool; it was fascinating to see what each team did and how they presented their design. Also, the emcee kept shushing the audience <em>just</em> like a teacher, which I found hilarious.”</p><p>Neither Mamdani nor Cuomo have spent much time outlining their plans in this regard (Aftermath reached out to the campaigns of both to learn more, but did not receive a reply as of this publishing), but Mamdani <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7ThzwqHprA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborated with leftist Twitch politics king Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker</a> earlier this year – and hilariously kept doxxing the duo because he couldn’t stop enthusing about specific NYC locations – while Cuomo, back in 2016 when he was governor of New York, <a href="https://www.pressconnects.com/story/news/local/new-york/2016/11/29/cuomo-music-video-games/94625582/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a bill</a> that would have created $50 million a year in tax credits for those who produce music or video games.</p><p>What really cinches it, though, is simple economics: If, per <a href="https://www.zohranfornyc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani’s plan</a>, rent is frozen, buses and childcare are free, and city-owned grocery stores bring down the price of food, New Yorkers will have more money left over to buy video games. Potentially a lot more. That makes him The Gamer Mayor, as far as I’m concerned. Given whose pocket Cuomo is in, the city will likely become more expensive on his watch, not less. And with <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/video-game-prices-might-increase-this-year-heres-why-i-dont-mind-paying-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game prices going up</a>, that's the last thing New Yorkers need. </p><p>Oh, and on top of landlords, Cuomo is <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/18/bloomberg-donation-cuomo-super-pac-00413966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being bankrolled</a> by billionaires, real estate and finance execs, and Donald Trump supporters – to the tune of over $8 million, which he's spending on smear ads. At this point, we're almost more in the territory of a Cuomo anti-endorsement than anything else, but <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/new-york-times-leads-the-movement-to-stop-zohran-mamdani.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if the New York Times can do it</a>, so can we. Also, I don’t think Cuomo even knows what Twitch is.</p><p>This does not, however, mean that Mamdani has Aftermath’s unilateral support in perpetuity. Even with a winning grin and the miraculous ability to, for example, talk with their hands endlessly and somehow not annoy me, politicians are not our friends. The second they take office, it is our job to hold them accountable. If they step out of line – if they go against the will of the people who elected them – they should not know a moment’s peace. Inevitably, because our political system is little more than a series of corrupt backroom handshakes, Mamdani will fail us one day. Maybe it will be over something relatively small, or maybe he’ll reveal himself to be a different person than we all thought he was. Regardless, while it will be tempting to parasocially leap to the defense of the nice man from all the videos, that won’t help anybody. Politics is neither a game nor a popularity contest; it’s a fight. Know your allies and know your enemies.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://elections.ny.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early voting</a> runs through Sunday, June 22, with the primary election taking place on Tuesday, June 24.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-trading-card-game-problems-scalpers"><h3>GameStop’s Expanding Trading Card Business Could Make A Tough Situation For Workers Worse</h3></a><p>“Unlike hardware, it has high margin potential,” GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen said to shareholders</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hades-2-update-scylla-sirens-new-song"><h3>New Scylla Songs!</h3></a><p>"Now we've got you in our tentacles"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online"><h3>Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025</h3></a><p>Kat Abughazaleh's Congressional campaign wants to reach people both locally and online</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/zohran-mamdani-mayor-nyc-adrew-cuomo-eric-adams-minecraft]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Easily one of the most useful items in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-compass-in-minecraft/1100-6524852/" data-ref-id="1100-6524852">compass</a>. Crafting one will point to your world spawn point, helping out if you find yourself lost during your adventures in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-games/2900-5289/" data-ref-id="2900-5289">survival game</a>.</p><p>However, compasses become obsolete if your base isn't anywhere near the world spawn point. Sure, you can use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-minecraft-cheats-and-console-commands/1100-6531935/" data-ref-id="1100-6531935">Minecraft console commands</a> to change the spawn point if you're the Minecraft server owner, or have admin permissions, but if that does not apply to you, you'll want to learn about how lodestones can alter the direction a compass points. That's where we come in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517822"></a><figcaption>A lodestone in the overworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4517822-lodestones.jpg"></figure><p>Lodestones alter the place that your compass points to. It can also be used in the Nether, the End, and the overworld, whereas compasses only usually work in the overworld. Lodestones in the real world are naturally-occurring magnets, and rare to find.</p><h2>How to find a lodestone</h2><p>You can find lodestones in chests in bastion remnants, but you can also craft them. To create your own, place one iron ingot in the center of your crafting table, surrounded by chiseled stone bricks. It used to be more expensive to craft a lodestone, as instead of one iron ingot, a netherite ingot was required.</p><h2>How to use a lodestone</h2><p>Once you have your lodestone block, place it on the ground where you want the compass to point towards, take out your compass, and use it on the block. The compass will get the same sheen as enchanted armor gets, so you'll know whether it's worked or not.</p><p>If the lodestone is broken or in a different dimension than the compass, the compass will randomly spin. If the lodestone is destroyed while its paired compass is in a chest or storage item, then the compass will not register that the lodestone is destroyed until it is retrieved. Placing a lodestone back in the exact place as the original lodestone will prevent unpairing in this situation.</p><p>For more tips and hints, visit our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Remedy released a patch today that including UI fixes and changes to how much unlockables costs. The studio re-organized unlockables into two categories: operational requisitions and essentials. Operational requisitions now include only cosmetics like sprays and armor sets while essentials includes gear and weapons. Essentials are now easier to unlock, according to the studio.</p><p>Remedy also detailed how they plan to change the "games' first hours" by better communicating how the crisis kits work and giving players better information on what to do within each mission. In addition, Remedy is giving new players deeper access to each job right off the bat, instead of limiting them to lower difficulties at the start.</p><p>The studio said it had been breaking down data and have more ideas on how to improve the overall experience but will need more time to execute.</p><p>"Today’s patch is just the beginning," the studio wrote. "These are some of the most immediate changes, but we are actively discussing and planning broader improvements to the game based on what we are hearing and seeing."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak was highly anticipated by fans of the Finnish studio, especially after strong showings with single-player adventures like Control and Alan Wake 2. While the gameplay is enjoyable, the number of problems quickly piled up. Many are still hopeful that Remedy can turn FBC: Firebreak into a fun and satisfying experience.</p><p>"As the game has launched on two different subscription services, I expect some players will likely try it, only to be quickly turned away by a subpar first impression and write Firebreak off without the lack of investment that might keep them around for longer," Mark Delaney wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/#:~:text=Firebreak%20is%20a%20first-person,distance%2C%20and%20a%20lot%20more." data-ref-id="1900-6418376">GameSpot FBC:Firebreak review</a>. "Hopefully, those who enjoy co-op PvE games do stick around past the early roughness, because there's something really fun to uncover. Sometimes the game gets in its own way by not tutorializing key points, like how to best deal with status effects and play roles dependably. But once you've gained that institutional knowledge, FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects."</p>

If you've been considering taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> for another spin (or even a first spin) but want to do it on device small enough you could feasibly play it while, say, spelunking, there's some good news: the "reimagined" mobile version of developer ZA/UM Studio's acclaimed RPG comes to Android devices on 5th August. And if you still need some convincing it'll work on a smaller device, there's even more good news, as the first two chapters are free.
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium - a sort of hard-boiled noir mystery presented using the conventions of a CRPG - tells the story of an amnesiac, alcoholic detective attempting to solve a murder while in the throes of existential crisis. And Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell enjoyed its verbose, improbably deep psychodrama enough that he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-the-year-2019-disco-elysium-is-about-outliving-history">named it one of his faves of 2019</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Edwin is far from its only fan. But ZA/UM - a troubled studio that's been involved an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">absolute mess of litigation and finger-pointing</a> since Disco Elysium's release - didn't exactly impress when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-is-being-reimagined-for-mobile-devices-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user">announced a "reimagined" mobile adaptation earlier this year</a>. "We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment," is how studio head Denis Havel put it.

<p>
In truth, though, the reality doesn't seem anywhere near as dubious; essentially, ZA/UM has ditched the original's isometric gameplay in favour of an approach somewhat closer to a visual novel, where players swipe through dialogue options presented against bold 2D artwork. The idea, the studio says, is to create an experience specifically tailored toward "short play sessions that should easily fit into your life". Such as, say, when you're spelunking.
</p>
<p>
When Disco Elysium's mobile version "debuts" for Android on 5th August (suggesting an iOS release may follow), it'll <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable&amp;pli=1">cost £9.99/€9.99/$9.99 USD</a>. But if you're not entirely sold on the idea of ZA/UM's reimagining, you'll be able to play the first two chapters for free.
</p>
<p>
As to what ZA/UM is doing next, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">that'll be C4</a>, a new RPG described as being "part espionage thriller, part psychedelic sci-fi". Meanwhile, a whole bunch of former staff (many who split acrimoniously) have announced new projects in a similar vein to Disco Elysium.
</p>
<p>
Over in the UK, there's Dark Math Games and Longdue - two studios comprised of former ZA/UM developers that both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors last year. Longdue is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">working on a "psychogeographic RPG" it's now unveiled as Hopetown</a>, while Dark Math is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">developing a detective RPG called XXX Nightshift</a>. Additionally, former Disco Elysium writer Argo Tuulik has also announced a new RPG, being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">made at his Summer Eternal studio</a>. And finally, Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov have also set up their own studio, and were previously said to be making a game with backing from NetEase.

			<p>Final Fantasy XVI just recently arrived on <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-series-x-720p-performance/">Xbox Series consoles</a>, which means that it's now available to play on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with Nintendo still left out of the equation. At least, for now, as series producer at Square Enix, Naoki Yoshida and creative director Kazutoyo Maehiro seem to have just dropped a hint that FFXVI could be coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Spotted and translated by a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-port-of-ffxvi-hinted-at-by-naoki-yoshida-and-kazutoyo-maehiro.1224171/">ResetEra</a>, in the most recent 'Letter from the Producer' live stream video for Final Fantasy XIV, towards the end of the stream, as Yoshida and Maehiro are discussing what players can look forward to in the world of Final Fantasy, such as FFXVI coming to Xbox, they joke that Nintendo is the only platform left out, to which Maehiro says he "<em>will do his best</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV Letter from the Producer LIVE Part LXXXVII" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zg-LRoukGVo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At face value, this is a joke between friends and co-workers, and is in no way an official confirmation that Final Fantasy XVI is coming to Switch 2. But it's not the first time a Switch 2 port of Final Fantasy XVI has been brought up.</p>
<p>There were rumblings about <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/much-requested-square-enix-ports-will-finally-be-announced-for-xbox-and-switch-2-its-claimed/">XVI coming to Switch 2 at the beginning of this year</a>, and now that we know Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming to Switch 2, there have <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-hints-the-entire-remake-trilogy-could-be-coming-to-switch-2/">been hints that the rest of that trilogy is coming to Switch 2 as well</a>.</p>
<p>Seeing Final Fantasy XVI on the Nintendo Switch is a pipe dream that was probably never going to happen, but if Final Fantasy VII Remake can work on the Switch 2, and maybe even the rest of the series, than so could Final Fantasy XVI.</p>
<p>Of course, if it won't look like it does on your PC, PS5, or Xbox Series device, but seeing a successful port of the game would be another example of how much more is possible on the Nintendo Switch 2 than its predecessor.</p>
