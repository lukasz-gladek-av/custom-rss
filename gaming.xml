<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/the-asus-rog-ally-runs-windows-eats-battery-and-needs-time-to-cook/">our review of the Asus ROG Ally</a> last year, many of our complaints centered on having to fiddle with an "awkwardly scaled" version of Windows. That's especially true when you compare the ROG Ally experience to Valve's Steam Deck and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/steam-deck-system-update-greatly-improves-older-lcd-displays-too/">its finely handheld-tuned SteamOS 3</a>.
</p><p>Those ROG Ally complaints may be moot in the future, though, as Valve has confirmed that it is working to officially support SteamOS 3 installations on Asus' handheld.</p>
<p>The first hint of the move came when support for "extra ROG Ally keys" popped up out of nowhere in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675200/announcements/detail/4361258795952118018">the latest SteamOS release notes</a> last week. Now, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">speaking to The Verge</a>, Valve's Lawrence Yang confirms that the note is indeed "related to third-party device support for SteamOS. The team is continuing to work on adding support for additional handhelds on SteamOS."</p>
<p>On the other side of the portable OS equation, Yang also said Valve is continuing to work on the drivers necessary for official "dual boot" support for Windows on the Steam Deck hardware. "There’s no update on the timing for dual boot support—it’s still a priority, but we haven’t been able to get to it just yet," Yang said.</p>
<h2>Valve time</h2>
<p>This is far from the first time Valve has spoken about officially distributing the latest version of SteamOS beyond the Steam Deck. Yang <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23499215/valve-steam-deck-interview-late-2022">said in 2022</a> that "not only are we excited to see other manufacturers making their own handheld PC gaming devices, we’re excited to see people make their own SteamOS machines, which could include small PCs that they put next to their TV."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Still, Valve's confirmation of specific work on ROG Ally support is the strongest sign yet that the company is making concrete progress in this effort. Don't get too excited about an imminent release, though—Yang told The Verge that the team is "making steady progress," but the software "isn’t ready to run out of the box yet." The same goes for a generic SteamOS installer that users could download and install on any generic device.</p>

<p>In the meantime, hackers and hardware manufacturers are finding their own ways to get access to SteamOS without a Steam Deck. Ars' Kevin Purdy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-linux-coders-turning-the-rog-ally-and-other-handhelds-into-steam-deck-clones/">ran through a cumbersome process with some very non-drop-in ISOs</a> to get SteamOS on his ROG Ally over a year ago. And earlier this year, Ayaneo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">announced that its Next Lite handheld</a> would use an adapted version of the Linux-based <a href="https://github.com/holoiso-eol/holoiso">Holo ISO</a> to "provide a close-to-official SteamOS experience" (as Holo ISO's makers put it).</p>
<p>We remain eager for the day when that "close-to-official" SteamOS experience on non-Valve hardware becomes an "official" one that could let more hardware makers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">ditch an expensive Windows license</a>. But given the company's <a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time">schedule-warping history with "Valve Time,"</a>&nbsp;we realize that day could still be quite far in the future.

                <p>Blizzard has just revealed more information on what players can expect in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a>'s Season 12, New Frontiers, when it launches on August 20. The latest season will introduce Clash--a new game mode--as well as more maps and the new support hero Juno.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 12 appears to be centered around Egyptian gods. Some skins for this season include Doomfirst as Bast and as Bast and Reaper as Anubis, to name a few. One of the new maps will reflect this by taking players to the Temple of Anubis. The other map, Hanaoka, was inspired by the Hanamura map introduced in the first Overwatch.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for Clash, it's being described as a fast-paced mode with players capturing multiple control points. It'll also feature dynamic spawns and streamlined map routes, making it easier for players to jump back into combat after dying.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 12 will also officially introduce Juno.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-adorable-new-hero-playable-this-weekend/1100-6525073/"> She was initially announced earlier last month</a> and comes with various weapons. These include the Mediblaster, her primary action that heals players and damages enemies. She also has a homing projectile, Pulsar Torpedos, that can heal allies over time and also damage enemies like her primary. Juno's ultimate ability lets her call down a beam from space that can heal players and increase their damage.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning that Season 12 will reset everyone's rank in competitive play. This is to help give players a fresh start and allow them to work their way up from the ground again.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though Blizzard is getting ready to launch Season 12,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-6v6-sort-of/1100-6525278/"> the studio has also revealed it's working on bringing back 6v6</a>, which was how the game initially was before Overwatch 2 launched in 2022.</p>

The Bullfroggy connected universe that is Two Point County continues to expand with the announcement of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, another irreverent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> sim from developers Two Point Studios. This one’s about museums, would you believe, with exhibition themes including the world of prehistory. Find a trailer propped below this paragraph like a freshly brushed-down Tugowaurus skeleton.

The basics appear to be as in the previous two games: you build an attractive, labyrinthine space in order to fulfil the needs and demands of people passing through, so as to earn cash. The theming is played for laughs, but there’s a relentless metrics-sating machine rattling away beneath. Individual relics you might display include dinosaurs that must be assembled fossil by fossil, primeval stone computers, and giant ice cubes containing not-entirely-dead cavemen. Each exhibit generates Buzz, depending on how well you’ve arranged the pieces, which translates to more donations from visitors, who range from meddling school children to furtive artefact thieves.
</p>
<p>
In terms of how it differs from previous Two Point management sims, here are some nuggets of precious amber excavated from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">Eurogamer’s preview</a>. Firstly, building is no longer constricted by rooms: instead, you’ll use partition walls, archways, floor materials, lighting types and decorations to structure and define each part of your museum. Hmm, I wonder if I can build another Toilet Maze? That was my finest achievement in the previous Two Point Campus, which Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-campus-review-a-relaxed-management-sim-bursting-with-silliness-and-seminars">enjoyed</a>. Such a shame that Two Point's in-game sense of humour doesn't extend to having NPC bladders explode.</p>
<p>You'll obtain new musuem artefacts by sending out fossil hunters and tomb raiders to explore a gradually revealed world map. You’ll also need these experts to keep the exhibits kempt and well-maintained once installed. Exhibits can also be “levelled up” through research to increase their earning potential.
</p>
<p>
At the risk of yet again sounding like a killjoy: it’s a mildly temperamental time to reveal a museum sim, in the UK at least. There’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/british-museum-contested-artefacts-benin-bronzes-b2394754.html">an on-going muddy reckoning in our cultural sector</a> with the fact that many prized UK museum exhibits are pillaged goods that should perhaps be returned to the descendants of the people we stole them from. With its comedy popsicle Bigfoots and literal lavalamps, Two Point Museum (which you can find on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/">Steam</a>) isn’t really trying or equipped to join that conversation. I’m not sure how the developers could go about it - the difficulty is with the concept of museums and archives in general. If you’d like to dig into such things, I recommend Ariella Aïsha Azoulay’s recent polemical tome <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/en-gb/products/857-potential-history">Potential History: Unlearning Imperialism</a>.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi said they could consider moving to Unreal Engine 5 for the final instalment in the series. However, the decision will be based on multiple factors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://cgworld.jp/article/202408-ff7reb-01.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CG World</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1823392560729194" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Genki</a>), Hamaguchi was asked if they were considering upgrading to Unreal Engine 5 for the next instalment in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series. The director responded that the team will “assess the pros and cons of the engine,” but he believes it is “possible.” He further explained that the decision is “similar to considering whether to switch from SVN to Perforce.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Hamaguchi elaborated by saying that Final Fantasy 7 fans currently want the team “to deliver the final game in the series in good form as soon as possible.” He mentioned that the team will “objectively” consider whether changing the environment will speed up the process or whether it’s best to develop everything in one go as it is.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aKJFzIPitY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">previous interview</a>, Hamaguchi mentioned that they were also considering moving from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5 for the previous Final Fantasy 7 Remake games. However, they scrapped that decision as many tools had not yet been developed for UE 5. &nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/witchfire-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>You ever watch a black metal music video and think, “This is cool and all, but what if those guys screaming around a candlelit pentagram had mid-20th century guns?” Me neither, but I can’t help but think the team at The Astronauts did to get inspired for Witchfire, their single-player roguelike extraction shooter that feels like a gaslamp fantasy movie with Mercyful Fate as the soundtrack. Its mix of hot-handed running and gunning and more slow-paced exploration and investigation meld into something that is more of a dream to play than a nightmare. Though some balancing of what can feel like downright unfair difficulty is certainly in order, and some of the more obscure features could be made to feel less esoteric, I am firmly caught in the spell of this black magic banger.</p><p>Though it’s drenched in dark gothic drip, Witchfire is actually about the fight against the evil influence of powerful witches taking an alternative version of our world into its doomed clutches bit by bit. This world’s Vatican calls on you, an immortal warrior for the Pope called a preyer, to hunt and kill one of these witches – a task much easier said than done. The story sort of fizzles out after that. Everything you walk past or interact with is teeming with place and sometimes even lore, but it’s all piecemeal world building stuff that isn’t always intelligible. But it does a great job at setting the overall Roman Catholic x Van Helsing vibe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Witchfire Horror Posters</h3></div></output><p>I really fell in love with Witchfire’s combat once I found the right guns for me out of the dozen available. It hits just the right stride between DOOM and Destiny, with fast-paced shooting that rewards chain kills and evasiveness and spells that are both powerful odds-eveners and clever utility pieces that helped me get out some gnarly binds all the time. Clearing monster camps manifests arcana, which is a random boon that helps flavor your particular run in the same way the many popular roguelikes do these days. I found that some of these boons were clearly more impactful than others, like ones that lowered my reload times or gave me bonus damage to enemies being afflicted by status elements. They are divided into specializations, and you can have a small effect on which specializations you can choose arcana from in a particular order, but it’s limited – not nearly on the level of the kind of God-boon manipulation in Hades, for example.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It hits just the right stride between DOOM and Destiny.</p></div><p>Besides having some truly satisfying sound design and clever artistic nods to real-world weapons, all of the guns feel pretty standard until you start unlocking special abilities by completing weapon-specific tasks like getting a certain amount of kills with it. Hunger, my go-to mid- to close-range heavy revolver, gained the ability to get empowered shots when I reloaded based on how many critical hits (i.e. weak point hits) I landed with the previous cylinder of rounds. Of the six or so I tried, each felt distinct and viable in their own right, but once I found this revolver and a shotgun that reloads when I hit a charged melee attack, I haven’t looked back.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Much of the meat of Witchfire is jumping into varied locations and finishing each map's main objective, like solving the mystery of the Wailing Tower or killing a gnarly boss in the Scarlet Coast. The map highlights other goodies like enemy camps that denote the difficulty of the monsters inside with increasingly more metal-looking skulls, or treasure chests and what they could hold should you want to trek towards them. These are usually your first guide for plotting any given trip out of the sanctum and into the fire, but these locales have plenty of things to find that won't be on the map – like walls that can be magically dissolved to reveal secret loot or passageways, or this nefarious spector that always seems to lead me into the waiting arms of something horrible. </p><p>I found that the time between dealing with sub-objectives is filled with navigating around and shooting up dozens of demonic denizens. As far as the regular footsoldiers of the witch go, you’ll be spending a lot of time clapping similar-looking baddies like various humanoid archers and cultists in rags, gunmen with long range and sharp aim, and knights who can turn into fireballs and leap long distances. This never really feels repetitive though, because these enemies get shuffled in with one another in dynamic groups that often require you to deal with lots of different types of threats at once. And these locations are filled with obstacles and verticality and very few corners that feel safe hunkering down in that you always have to be on the move or risk getting caught.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>More difficult monster camps will increase the quantity and variety of enemies, and is where you’ll see the scariest stuff. I stumbled across a camp of the highest, most horned-skull difficulty a few times during my travels and saw not only upgraded elite versions of monsters that I knew, but some brand-new horrors that I didn’t, like fully armored grenadiers and some floating menagere that resembled a balloon that’s also a picnic basket. These were a true test of my gear, stats, and skills that I still have a hard time passing. Being able to actively choose to engage with these high-risk challenges makes Witchfire feel more fair than frightening, but there’s also a few features that feel like insult to injury, like a roving band of monsters spawned by the exit portal that will follow you around the map and hunt you, getting stronger as time passes. Yes, they do make sure you stay on track and active during any given expedition, but they barge onto the scene largely unannounced, often being a nuisance when I was trying to engage an enemy camp or one of the weird puzzles on the map. Though killing these special hellions guarantees an ammo drop, a resource that becomes more precious the longer you stay in a map, they never stop coming, and never produce arcana - meaning you could kill them forever and never get any stronger even though they are -  and always feel like just one too many levers of discomfort.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of the treasure hunting and monster shooting I did on any given map was being watched by the Witch. With every mistake I made, the calamity meter rose.</p></div><p>The Gnosis level, my preyer’s general knowledge and insight as it comes to all things demonic, is the most obvious form of progression in Witchfire. It requires more relatively difficult tasks to be completed, like holding a large amount of currency at once, but when completed, higher Gnosis levels allowed me to unlock new access to rooms in my hideout, and also some previously locked or veiled doors in the available expeditions. The downside is that it raises the bar for all of the dangers you’ll find on expeditions. Suddenly, those floating demons I only saw in the most difficult of locations now show up more often in other locations as well. Traps change, more of the chests and items you find are cursed, the roving band of hunters includes more types of monsters, etc. It’s something I wish Witchfire made more obvious, because I certainly wish I knew this before I invested in my actual stats and gear.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All of the treasure hunting and monster shooting I did on any given map was being watched by the Witch. With every mistake I made, the calamity meter rose in the top left corner, and when it’s filled completely, some terrible fate befell me. This was usually in the form of several assassins coming to slay me as my sanity slowly drained, but my understanding is that that is one of a few fates. The reverse GTA star meter that punishes you for being bad adds some pressure to already dangerous circumstances, but in a way that can feel like the game is snowballing against you regressively. And what “mistakes” are feels hit and miss. Sometimes it's pretty clear: being caught in a trap, failing a puzzle, or being seen by specific enemies. Other times it's simply getting hit, assumptively also by specific sorts of enemies but when things get really hectic, it's unclear who I need to dodge in order to not make a bad situation worse </p><p>Whether I successfully extracted from the map via one of the many possible portals on it, or was brutally murdered while trying, I ended back at my cliffside HQ to restock and regroup. Here I can spend my volatile witchfire - this game’s “souls” - to improve my stats or buy items from the strange merchant who I guess is my roommate? I can spend the gold that I found in chests or by turning in random (probably cursed) baubles I found at a demonic mirror that I can direct to research weapons, spells, or other gear that it will produce at random while I’m out witch hunting. It’s still early in development and all of these things are expanding gradually, but the grind outside of fighting all of the available bosses and maxing your Gnosis, is pretty limited at this point.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But Witchfire has all the right ingredients in its cauldron for a genre-blending brew that is both unique and fun. Gunplay is an enchanting mix of kinetic cowboy guns and eldritch wizardry that really sings against the dangerous and plentiful soldiers of the ever-present Witch. Some of what it asks you to do is opaque and obtuse, both in a “fun to figure out” and a “frustrating lack of info that would have made a few hours of my game easier” kind of way. There’s hours of possessed chests to cleanse, secret passages to find, and bosses to conquer, and though the endgame grind looks rather unappealing off on the horizon, I have plenty still left on my list to see and do, and would be first in line for the next update Witchfire summons as the game continues on it Early Access journey.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Saber Interactive has teamed up with Twirlbound to assist them in making their second game, The Knightling. Their first game was titled Pine, an open-world action-adventure game. The Knightling is shaping to be a fantasy action-adventure game released on<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Steam</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Knightling - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lxYirnvx9_o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This game has players stepping into the shoes of a knight-in-training, where you get to quest, explore, and participate in combat and platforming in a semi-open world.&nbsp; The Knightling is set on a grand quest to find Sir Lionstone, his mentor and protector of the realm named Clesseia. To keep himself safe, he wields a gigantic magical shield that will aid him on his journey to try and find his mentor before it's too late.</p>
<p>On his journey through the magical lands of Clesseia, there will be plenty of battles with monsters and bandits. At the same time, he works to uncover long-lost secrets to the realm and figure out the powers of Sir Lionstone's giant shield to make his journey less perilous.</p>
<p>Sir Lionstone's giant shield is the only thing that The Knightling has to protect him on his arduous journey, where he has to slowly figure out the intricacies of the shield and how to unlock all of its magical power. The shield can block, parry, bash, and use great attack combos on your foes. Much like in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, the Knightling can use the shield to slide across the peaks and valleys of Clesseia, helping speed up travel across the realm exponentially.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-splits-embracer/">Saber Interactive</a> is a well-regarded publisher and developer worldwide, with 13 studios across the Americas and Europe. They have helped create and license games across all platforms globally, such as the highly anticipated Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, as well as games such as World War Z, and SnowRunner. In addition, they also helped develop games such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for Nintendo Switch, Crysis Remastered and Halo: The Master Chief Collection.</p>
<p>Saber Interactive has over two decades of experience, with Twirlbound founded in 2013. Pine was their first game, and it was an award-winning debut. As shown in the reveal trailer, they are now working on The Knightling, which is due for release across all platforms in 2025.</p>

<p>A new trademark has been filed by Techland for the Dying Light franchise. <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98693419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to a filing</a> on August 12, 2024 (h/t <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1823724772607582497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kurakasis</a>), Techland has registered a trademark for Dying Light: The Beast.</p>



<p>Obviously, with it just being a trademark filing there’s not much to say regarding what exactly Dying Light: The Beast is. Dying Light 2 launched in 2022 and was the last game Techland released. We know there is another game in development at Techland, but details surrounding that have been scarce.</p>



<p>As of writing the trademark has not been approved due to it just being filed on the 12th. Still, it seems like a forgone conclusion that it will be finalized in the near future.</p>



<p>Here’s the full filing per the US Patent and Trademark Office:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DYING LIGHT: THE BEAST™ trademark registration is intended to cover the categories of&nbsp;cases for mobile phones; cinematographic films featuring computer games; computer game cartridges; computer game discs; computer peripheral devices; digital music downloadable from the Internet; downloadable computer application software for mobile phones, namely, software for computer games; downloadable computer game instruction manuals; downloadable computer game software; downloadable computer software to enhance the audio-visual capabilities of multimedia applications, namely, for the integration of text, audio, graphics, still images, and moving pictures; downloadable electronic game programs; downloadable electronic game software; downloadable electronic game software for use on mobile and cellular phones and handheld computers; downloadable interactive game programs; downloadable interactive multimedia computer game programs; downloadable multimedia file containing artwork, text, audio, video, games, and Internet web links relating to interactive, video, electronic and mobile games; downloadable music files; downloadable video game programs; downloadable video game software; electronic personal organizer; fitted plastic films known as skins for covering and protecting electronic apparatus, namely, mobile phones; graphics cards; headsets for use with computers; mobile phone straps; mouse pads; recorded computer application software for mobile phones, namely, software for computer games; recorded computer game software; recorded video game software; recorded video game programs..</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Techland regarding the trademark filing. Should a response be received, this article will be adjusted accordingly.</p>

You and up to three friends will get to play as The Mandalorian and his allies as they embark on a series of missions. Each character comes with their own deck of cards and features unique tactics--meaning you'll have to work together as a team to overcome the odds and survive. Games typically run for up to an hour and are designed for players aged 12 and up.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>An intriguing aspect of the board game is its changing ruleset. As you play, you'll stumble upon new mission types or unlock new parameters. For example, you may discover that there's a traitor among your crew, and you'll have to figure out their identity before they put a stop to your adventures. You'll find everything needed to start playing right out of the box, including character standees, tokens, cards, and a game board.</p><p>There's plenty of other Star Wars content for you to check out, so if you want more interactive experiences to complement The Mandalorian Adventures, here are some notable TTRPGs, board games, and card games to check out.</p><h2>Best Star Wars Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pandemic-Tactical-Strategy-Z-Man-Games/dp/B0BG9XZKTG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: The Clone Wars Board Game</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Star-Wars-Empire-RPG/dp/B09H1BMC3Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Edge of the Empire Sci-Fi RPG</a> -- $30 ($<del>40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Star-Wars-Age-Rebellion/dp/B09H19LV3J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Age of Rebellion TTRPG</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Risk-Star-Wars-Clone/dp/B00061I4Z6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Risk: Star Wars The Clone Wars Edition</a> -- $135</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Technical-Schematics-Players-Games-Collectors/dp/B09XJCVM1H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UNO: Star Wars Technical Schematics Card Game</a> -- $22 ($<del>24</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monopoly-Players-Inspired-Families-Exclusive/dp/B0B2F3VT9N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monopoly: Star Wars Return of the Jedi Edition</a> -- $25</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Lucas-Films-Trivia-Party/dp/B0B5YMK6M1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Say What You See (Trivia Party Game)</a> -- $10 ($<del>11</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mandalorian-Questions-Officially-Licensed-Merchandise/dp/B093Y4P3D6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Mandalorian Trivia Quiz</a> -- $7 ($<del>10</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals-games-controllers-nintendo-consoles/1100-6525715/">Best Nintendo Switch Game Deals This Week - Zelda And Mario Games For Big Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/horror-movies-new-releases-4k-blu-ray-halloween-2024/2900-5645/">Biggest Upcoming Horror Movie Blu-Ray Releases Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-pixel-remaster-collection-north-america-release/1100-6525641/">Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster Collection Anniversary Edition Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-steelbook-case-up-for-preorder-comes-with-free-4k-blu-ray-disc/1100-6525668/">Borderlands Movie 4K Steelbook Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-preorder-mario-and-yoshi/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Up For Preorder At Target</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-manga-box-set-gets-big-limited-time-deal-comes-with-treasure-chest-case/1100-6525318/">The Legend Of Zelda Manga Deluxe Box Set With Treasure Chest Is On Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-versus-marvel-comic-book-omnibus-amazon-preorder/1100-6525549/">DC Versus Marvel Finally Returns In October With A Massive Omnibus Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jeff-vandermeer-absolution-southern-reach-annihilation-preorder-guide/1100-6525451/">Snag 11 Jeff VanderMeer Books For $18 - Catch Up On Southern Reach Before Absolution Releases</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Activision sure is dragging out its reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Zombies mode. But if you're sucker for the undead stuff, there's more where last week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-zombies-mode-gets-a-first-trailer-and-story-details">trailer</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-purely-round-based-zombies-mode-gameplay-detailed">gameplay reveal</a> came from, with developer Treyarch having now offered a tour of Zombies' Terminus map.
</p>
<p>
Terminus Island is one of two maps that'll be available at launch (the other being the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls), and Treyarch calls it "one of the largest round-based Zombies maps ever created". Black Ops 6's Zombies mode takes place in the early 90s - five years after the events of Black Ops Cold War's Zombies mode - and Terminus Island serves as a prison for some familiar Requiem faces. After their liberation early at the start of the story, players can explore the prison itself before moving out to investigate its tropical island surroundings.
</p>
<p>
There's a secret research facility specialising in "weird science" (in case you were wondering where the zombies might spring up from this time), as well as the ocean, and assorted smaller islands - all of which players will visit as part of Terminus' main quest. It's described as a "living world" full of scripted encounters, ranging from zombies smashing out of vats and prison guards still trying to control the undead threat, to less fortunate souls being chomped on.
</p>

<p>
Treyarch's trailer also shows off the new Tentacle Trap - which can be placed above doorways to gobble up zombies as they pass through - and there's even a look at "something bigger" players might encounter out on the water as they sail from island to island in their Tactical Rafts.
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything in Treyarch's latest Zombies reveal. Expect plenty more to come (including Zombies gameplay on 28th August) ahead of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's 25th October arrival on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, and certain tiers of Game Pass.

			<p>Today, Blizzard announced more details about <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overwatch</a> 2 Season 12. First and foremost, the game's roster will be expanded with a new support hero, Juno from Mars.</p>
<p>Juno's versatile Mediblaster and Pulsar Torpedoes allow her to simultaneously heal her allies and damage her enemies, making her a fantastic support hero. Her Hyper Ring ability accelerates team movement for quick engagements and retreats, while her high mobility, enhanced by Martian Overboots, allows her to navigate the battlefield with unparalleled agility. Players may then unleash the power of her Orbital Ray and power up their teammates to break through tough strangleholds and fortified defenses.</p>
<p>There's also a new game mode called Clash, which pits teams against each other in a relentless battle for dominance over multiple capture points. With dynamic spawns and streamlined map routes, Overwatch 2 heroes can spend more time in the heat of battle and less time running back to the front lines. Clash mode delivers fast-paced, strategic gameplay with new challenges and opportunities for glory.</p>
<p>Two new maps have been included, too: players will return to ancient Egypt and discover a whole new side to Overwatch's first map, Temple of Anubis, and uncover the dangerous AI that caused the Omnic Crisis, sealed away in the Throne of Anubis. They will also uncover new secrets of Shiramura Castle while exploring the streets of Hanaoka, inspired by the stunning aesthetics of the beloved Hanamura area.</p>
<p>Season 12 will also bring some balance tweaks. Blizzard is reducing Health on multiple damage and support heroes. Lifeweaver is also getting notable updates to improve the quality of the Petal Platform and how it can be countered, as well as changes to Healing Blossom and Rejuvenating Dash. The competitive mode is getting a ranks reset to give everyone a fresh start and a new chance to work their way up the ladder. As mentioned in a previous developer update, the Avoid as Teammate feature is being improved. Finally, Blizzard listened to community feedback on group respawn in Quick Play and has new improvements in store for that feature as well.</p>

<p>Last but not least, Overwatch 2 will join Game Pass on September 17, providing various perks to subscribers who have successfully linked their Battle.net account. Starting on September 17, users will get a one-time grant of 30 Mythic Prisms to spend on Mythic unlocks, as well as six hero skins - Cardboard Reinhardt, Turtleship D.Va, Cyberdragon Hanzo, Street Runner Genji, Bee Mercy, and Cleric Lifeweaver. These items are theirs to keep, but they must log in and ensure their accounts are linked by October 21 to claim them.</p>
<p>Additional in-game collectibles will be continuously available as long as you have an eligible Xbox Game Pass account linked to your Battle.net account. These include an array of items via continued access to select Overwatch 2 Shop cosmetics from previous seasons, as well as a stackable XP booster.</p>

            <p>The next advance in video game graphics technology is not ray-tracing or tray-racing or any variation thereof - it's janky stop motion and rubbish plastic dolls, and it actually began about 30 years ago, when I watched the Adam and Joe show for the first time. If you never watched the Adam and Joe show, they used to do home movie recreations of famous films like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i84waFSxX94">Titanic</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qga7yGat2KA">Saving Private Ryan</a> using stuffed animals and action figures. I found these "Toymovies" hysterical as a kid - I suspect they are less so now. Probably, they are full of jokes we might tentatively class as "of their time". The point is, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/reptilian-rising">Reptilian Rising</a> is sort of Toymovie: The Game. </p><!--more-->
<p>Created by Gregarious Games and Robot Circus, it puts you in charge of squads of wonky plastic miniatures fighting evil reptilians on cardboard table-top dioramas. The characters range from Cleopatra through (three versions of) Churchill to off-brand riffs on Back To The Future's Marty McFly. The devs have just released a new trailer, following which I gave <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1625460/Reptilian_Rising/">the Steam demo</a> a whirl, and while I have a few reservations, I could see myself enjoying this. </p>

<p>The reservations mostly concern the humour. This is one of those retro parodies that falls over itself to pile reference atop allusion atop in-joke. It's charming when it comes to the recreation of a tabletop wargame - the levels look exactly like the ones I knocked together for my dysfunctional High Elf army as a budding Warhammer player, and there's a nice, fat cassette player on one map with buttons you can press to stop the music. But the overegged dialogue voice-acting is a little yeesh, especially given that there aren't many lines per character. I get it, St George - you're a braying blue-blooded spoof. Please put that line about ye olde butt-kicking on cooldown.</p>
<p>I was tempted to stop playing, after a few moments of St Georgian patter. But sunk cost thinking prevailed - and it proved to be no fallacy at all, for I started having fun. Beneath the whimsy, Reptilian Rising is quite a sober tactics game. On the map I played, I had to seize control of crystals that summoned waves of hooded reptile cultists and cyborgs; once claimed, I could spend Time Energy at crystals to summon additional miniatures of my own.</p>
<p>Time Energy can also be spent on character upgrades like resistance to stun, and there are unpredictably spawning power-ups to lure you out of formation. You've also got to worry about a boss spawning after a countdown, unless you smash all the glowing purple dice. The overall picture is of a tactics game where you have to expand your position under varying pressures, rather than methodically whittling down a finite selection of foes. As for the characters, they fulfil familiar roles: Einstein is your artillery, armed with a beam cannon, while Not-Marty McFly gets a hoverboard for quick flanking. The off-map Reptilian overlord, who reminds me strongly of Bowser in the Bob Hoskins Mario movie, occasionally gives enemies orders that alter the odds - ordering them to focus fire on St George, for example. He has it coming, the bellowing nuisance.</p>
<p>It's no Into The Breach, but it entertained me enough that on finishing a demo mission and breaking off to write, I <em>almost</em> kept playing instead. If I'd recommend the developers do anything, other than varying the dialogue more, it's come up with a proper unboxing animation for each new miniature you harvest, rather than having them appear in a gust of Tardissy SFX. Let us rip the cardboard. Also, maybe a simulation of authentic wear and tear? I kind of want my Einstein to look like the dog has tried to eat him.</p>
<p>Reptilian Rising doesn't have a release date yet. While we're talking figurines, let me nudge you towards rad Celtic oddity <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judero">Judero</a> and the work of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-sluggish-morrs-and-dujanah-developer-jack-king-spooner">Jack King-Spooner</a> in general. If Reptilian Rising is Adam &amp; Joe, King-Spooner's creations have more in common with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jas8OABbn0Y">Mad God</a>.</p>

It’s a genuine cultural phenomenon and it’s getting a second season, as you might expect. But buried in the popular series is a small but direct reference to<em> Fallout 4 </em>that went unnoticed by the show’s director and most of its staff. And the person who snuck it in assumed nobody would spot it once the show was live. He was wrong.   </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/jonathan-nolan-and-the-writers-didnt-catch-it-but-boy-reddit-caught-it-fallouts-makeup-department-hid-a-sneaky-easter-egg-in-one-episode-that-fans-jumped-on-immediately/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/jonathan-nolan-and-the-writers-didnt-catch-it-but-boy-reddit-caught-it-fallouts-makeup-department-hid-a-sneaky-easter-egg-in-one-episode-that-fans-jumped-on-immediately/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span><em>,</em> <em>Fallout’s</em> makeup department head Michael Harvey said that the series’ creator and director, Jonathan Nolan, wanted the show to feel authentic to the games. But, he didn’t want anything to be ripped directly out of a <em>Fallout </em>game. </p><p>“[Nolan] explicitly told me, use the game as a reference,” Harvey told <em>PC Gamer.</em>  “Lean into the world for what it is, and take the elements from that world.” But, “Don’t carbon copy anything,” Nolan told Harvey. </p><p>However, when costume designer Amy Wescott dressed up a character in a way that made them look nearly identical to an NPC from <em>Fallout 4</em>, Harvey saw a chance to sneak a little Easter egg into the show. </p><p>“So I took that character and that likeness and literally made it one of the characters from the game, and I figured, you know what? It was such a [minor] character. Nobody’s ever going to catch it,” said Harvey.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d031a6754810e33bdff170c5fee2fae1" data-recommend-id="image://d031a6754810e33bdff170c5fee2fae1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows Rink and Cricket next to each other.

The writers didn’t catch it. But boy, Reddit caught it, and they went wild for it,” explained Harvey. “They went nuts over it, and they’re like, ‘We know exactly who that character is. We can tell you what game, what map, and what that person was’.” </p><p>If you are wondering, the character Harvey snuck into the show was Cricket, a minor NPC vendor from <em>Fallout 4. </em>In the live-action series, she is named Rink and appears on screen for just a few seconds. But that was more than enough for fans to spot her. </p><p> “That was my one little Easter egg that I was hoping nobody would catch right away,”  admitted Harvey. “[Fans] jumped on that so fast. So, kudos to the level and the depth that these fans will go.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
