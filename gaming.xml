            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talsorian-games-announces-cyberpunk-legends-rpg-lite-card-game-set-in-night-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Talsorian Games has announced a new card game in the world of <em>Cyberpunk</em>. <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> is an official coop card game where you and your friends can tell your own stories in the dark future urban hellscape that is Night City.</p>

<h2>The <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://presale.nightcrewgames.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> is an RPG-lite, narrative-focused co-op card game set in the world of the <em>Cyberpunk</em> TTRPG. Specifically, it is set in the 2020s, the time when Night City legends like Johnny Silverhand and Alt Cunningham walked the streets.</p>

Each of these classes comes with their own class deck alongside a character avatar card and Health, Damage, and Leader tokens.</p>

<p>From there, your group undertakes different missions in a campaign drawn from one of three different scenario decks. These missions involve unraveling complex mysteries, coordinating strategic combat against daunting foes, and making narrative choices with consequences. Every character class will have its moment to shine between talking, hacking, puzzling, and fighting.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for <em>Cyberpunk Legends</em> is that it offers a TTRPG experience with little prep, rules or DM. The rules are simple, requiring just five minutes to learn. In addition, all of your actions are resolved with cards; no dice required. Ever wanted the thrill of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> but can't get a group together? Have you run out of stuff to see and do in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/cyberpunk-2077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>? This narrative card game is for you.</p>

The game will be available via a Kickstarter campaign and will be sold at an MSRP of $50. It is unclear at the time of writing if the crowdfunding campaign will include additional expansions or stretch goals.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-feels-like-a-new-game-on-the-switch-2.1209690/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/681222/fortnite-nintendo-switch-2-hands-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While you could play <em>Fortnite </em>on the original Nintendo Switch, it was a less than ideal situation that made the game feel more like a rough around the edges tech demo than a polished piece of software. Because of the Switch’s hardware limitations, <em>Fortnite </em>could only run at 30 frames per second max, which could make it tricky to pull off well-timed shots. Character models were often so simplified that they barely looked like their counterparts on other consoles. And a combination of dropped frames, simpler textures, and overall lower resolution gave the island a choppy, muddy aesthetic quality that was tolerable, but far from beautiful.</p><p>Though it was constantly being patched, <em>Fortnite </em>felt dated on the original Switch in a way that made it hard to justify Battle Passes or get excited about new design changes to the island. But, similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on"><em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em></a>, <em>Fortnite</em>’s Switch 2 update revitalizes the game by addressing almost every one of its core issues and highlighting all of the new bells and whistles Epic has been developing for it.</p><p>Even in the <em>Fortnite</em>’s main menu where all of the game’s various modes, shops, and inventory screens are displayed, there was a sluggishness to how things moved that could be attributed to the OG Switch’s hardware. 30 fps was fine for choosing which skins you wanted to wear and selecting colorways for your weapons. But if you tried scrolling through your inventory of characters too quickly, you could see (and hear as the fan kicked on) the console struggling to keep up. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/680893/nintendo-switch-2-eshop-faster">the new eShop</a>, there’s a fluidity to <em>Fortnite</em>’s menu navigation on the Switch 2 that immediately makes the game feel more modern and like a platform designed to keep you poking around making adjustments to your avatar because it’s fun.</p><p>On the original Switch, it was common to see <em>Fortnite </em>characters whose in-game models looked very different than the rendered icons displayed in your locker due to a lack of proper lighting and things like clothing physics. Because of <em>Fortnite</em>’s toy-like aesthetic and the fact that you’re not meant to be staring at your character head-on while playing, Epic could get away with simpler models on the first Switch. But on the Switch 2, you can see how much work the studio’s designers have put into making its version of Poe Dameron look like Oscar Isaac, and Lewis Hamilton’s braids actually move like pieces of hair that have weight to them.</p><p>Before I was usually only able to check out the lobby for a couple of seconds before being pushed onto the Battle Bus because of how long the console spent stuck on its loading screen. But during my first Switch 2 Battle Royale, what shocked me most at first was to find my avatar standing in a lobby with ample time to mess around emoting at other players and checking out what kinds of skins they’d slapped on. I actually <em>wanted</em> to watch people dancing and playing instruments because there was time to do so without having to rush and get ready before everyone started shooting. And once the match had properly begun, I found myself way more interested in running around to look at waterfalls and watch NPC wander through neighborhoods as the sun set because of how much more visually impressive the island is with the update’s improved lighting and textures.</p><p><em>Fortnite </em>still looks pleasantly cartoony on the Switch 2, but the game’s boosted frame rate and resolution give its visuals a gloss of reality that makes everything feel more high stakes. It was thrilling to see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/scarlet-witch-joins-fortnite-as-doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-arrives-in-theaters">the Scarlet Witch</a> sprinting through the woods trying to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659347/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-season-battle-pass">shoot Force Lightning</a> at a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673925/fortnite-dance-with-sabrina-launch-date">Sabrina Carpenter</a>. Technically speaking, the characters weren’t running any faster than they could have on the old Switch, but the action felt more intense because there was far more visual information coming in.</p><p>There were still a handful of moments where <em>Fortnite</em>’s glitchiness rendered its head. Even though the Switch 2 version has better draw distances to help you see things that are far away, occasionally, I could see the train chugging along at a chopped and stuttering pace. Character selections also sometimes wouldn’t immediately be updated after I selected them, and I’d have to wait until I was in a match to see which skin I’d equipped. At a glance, those sorts of bugs seemed to have more to do with how <em>Fortnite </em>is streamed to consoles as opposed to being reflections of the Switch 2’s hardware. But they weren’t so persistent enough to make the game feel broken or like it wasn’t a massive upgrade over the original Switch.</p><p>One of my personal bugaboos about skin-forward, free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>is a concern that I’ll end up spending real world money on costumes that I don’t ultimately want to use all that much. It’s why I’ve been picky about buying skins and leery when it comes time to sign up for a new Battle Pass. <em>Fortnite</em> on the Switch 2 can’t solve for buyer’s remorse, but the game’s updated models make me want to try more of them out instead of sticking to my favorites who look better with their masks on.</p><p>To gamers on other platforms, this might all sound unremarkable. But the difference in quality between the Switch and Switch 2’s iterations of <em>Fortnite </em>is so stark that feels it fair to say that Epic has finally given the Nintendo fans a version of the game as it’s meant to be played — one that’s vibrant and makes you understand why it might be worth spending a few V-bucks. And if the game’s forthcoming mouse control support is anywhere nearly as well-implemented as these visual changes, <em>Fortnite </em>could be one of the best new(ish) games you can play on the Switch 2 right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It looks better and runs smoother, but perhaps the most enticing thing Nintendo has added for the new system is Zelda Notes, an assortment of voice and text logs from different characters that you can read on your phone while you play. Many of them are from the princess herself, and actually do a lot to flesh out our hero, who is typically a silent protagonist. One entry has Zelda recounting the time the two went to Eventide Island, and how Link, having been there before and being stripped of his gear, expected the same to happen to Zelda, and thus covered his eyes so he wouldn’t see anything indecent. That, my friends, is a gentleman.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>‪Link came along to protect me, but he suddenly covered his eyes the moment we landed. Fortunately, it seems all the monsters vanished with the Calamity… Regardless, when I asked him what he was doing, he said last time he was here, he had been stripped of…ahem…all his possessions when he arrived. He…could have mentioned that possibility before I set foot on the shore…‬</p></blockquote><p>That’s my Hero of Time. Or whatever we’re calling him these days. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is a huge game, so the prospect of going back to it feels a little daunting, even with all the Switch 2 enhancements. But I am looking forward to what other story secrets fans might find in the Zelda Notes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-nintendo-switch-2-review-update.1209678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-nintendo-switch-2-review-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the Nintendo Switch 2 finally in my hands, naturally the first thing I set out to do was play the stuff that didn’t run great on the original Switch, just to see how much of an improvement the new console is. One at the top of the list was Hogwarts Legacy: an ambitious open-world game that really struggled on Switch. First, let's look back at why I loved it the first time around, when I reviewed it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hogwarts Legacy is Close to Unplayable on the Switch 1</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before booting up Hogwarts Legacy on the Switch 2, I replayed through the first hours on the original Switch to see how it ran, and the result was pretty awful. This thing runs like a wounded animal, with extremely low-rez characters and environments, unstable framerates, and extremely long load times every time you fast travel. Exploring the Hogwarts campus, which is one of the best parts of this adventure on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or PC, is especially irritating anytime you try to walk through a door and find it locked while it takes a couple seconds to load, sometimes even showing a little loading icon after a while. It got to the point where I’d sometimes think a door wasn’t interactable, until it suddenly swung open after I’d started to walk away.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The gap in performance between this version and the versions available on other platforms is so huge that I honestly can’t even recommend playing it, even if you’ve got no other recourse. There’s just no way to experience all the things Hogwarts Legacy does really well when it’s chugging along like this.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Switch 2 is a Massive Step Up, Even If It Still Lags Way Behind the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Modern PCs</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully the Switch 2’s significantly more powerful hardware fixes a whole heck of a lot of this. It’s still not at parity with the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, or high-end PCs, but at least feels akin to what I remember the Xbox Series S feeling like – not 4K or anything, but more than good enough, especially considering that it all runs on a mobile device. (That’s pretty shocking.) I still noticed some pop-in and had a bug at one point that required me to reset, which are all the kinds of issues I saw in other versions, but it’s an absolutely massive improvement over the Switch 1 and plays great in docked and handheld mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">There Are Some Neat Updates Since the Last Time I Played</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also just a bunch of things added to Hogwarts Legacy since the last time I played, including a photo mode, which feels very important in what is essentially a Harry Potter Isekai life sim, and the ability to reset your skill tree selections so you don’t lock yourself into some rookie build. Plus, my personal favorite upgrade: they removed all the annoying platform-exclusive stuff, like the side quest that was only available on PS5, and added some new cosmetics to collect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the Switch 2 specifically, Hogwarts Legacy also supports the new mouse mode, which allows you to swap between traditional joystick controls and using one of the Joy-Cons like a mouse if you prefer to aim that way. The mouse controls work surprisingly well, and I was able to aim in combat without issue. Still, I can’t really see myself using this over the standard joystick mode, just because it’s sorta uncomfortable to hold the Joy-Con on its side for extended periods of time and there’s really nothing wrong with just doing it the old way. But it’s definitely a neat option to have!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">I Still Really Like This Game</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It really stood out to me how much I still enjoyed playing this after over two years. Hogwarts remains one of the most detailed settings I’ve ever seen in a game, and I could lose hours exploring the grounds and practicing my spellcraft. Combat is also surprisingly interesting considering how lame it looks in the movies. They actually made whipping around a stick a lot of fun, as you juggle enemies in the air, parry and counter enemy attacks, and consider whether or not to just murder people with very illegal curses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main story is definitely still a weak point, with a pretty generic and uninteresting goblin villain and lots of vague talk about ancient magic. However, the characters you spend the journey with, from your fellow classmates to the professors who lecture you each day, more than make up for that shortcoming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still bothered by all the stuff that bothered me about it two years ago, especially enemy variety, which somehow feels worse than I remember it being (boy, oh boy, does this thing make you fight spiders a lot). And some technical issues are still alive and well after all this time, which isn’t great. But this is still an incredibly good game that gave me almost everything I wanted as a Harry Potter fan. The fact that it’s now available on a device you can play on the subway without major sacrifices is just insane, and it makes me want to play through it all again the next time I get on a plane.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/our-first-impressions-after-48-hours-with-the-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>As an included freebie with the Switch 2 system, this would merely be tedious. As a game with a $10 asking price, it's a little insulting.</p>
<h2>GameChat is cute, but screen-sharing is rough</h2>
<p>After a lengthy initial setup, starting a casual GameChat session with people on your Switch 2 friends list is pretty simple (though, oddly, there seems to be no way to add new people to a GameChat after it starts). The system's internal microphone does a pretty good job picking up your voice even across a big room, and the head-tracking feature for the camera does a good job keeping you in frame even as you move.</p>
<figure>

      </figure>

<p>GameChat struggles a bit when it comes to screen sharing, though, sending a grainy video of your gameplay at a rough-to-watch rate of about 10 or 15 fps. This is fine if you're just glancing at what your chatmate is doing occasionally to offer some hints or support. Just don't expect it to replicate the experience of watching your favorite streamer on Twitch or anything of the like.</p>
<h2>The internal storage doesn’t go very far</h2>
<p>The Switch 2's 256GB of built-in storage is plenty if you're mainly using it to play upgraded old Switch games; even an epic like<em> Tears of the Kingdom</em> is only about 20GB with the upgrade pack. But high-end games designed specifically for the Switch 2 can be a lot bigger: 48GB for <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, nearly 60GB for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and a whopping 69.2GB for <em>Split Fiction</em>, to cite a few examples. If you plan to download games like these, you'll need to invest in a MicroSD Express card before too long.</p>
<h2>Switch games run a lot better</h2>
<p>We'll have more in-depth coverage of this in the near future, but for now, suffice it to say that Switch 2 upgrades make a lot of the less performant Switch games much more bearable. This can be especially true for late-era Switch software that pushed the old hardware to its limits; after seeing <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> running at a silky smooth 60 fps on the <em>Switch 2</em>, it will be hard to go back to playing the original version ever again.</p>

                <p>The Blue Shell is one of the most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-the-agony-and-the-anguish-of-the-blue-shell/1100-6506941/" data-ref-id="1100-6506941">iconic and divisive items</a> in all of Mario Kart, and with the release of Mario Kart World, fans are digging into new intricacies and strategies. It turns out MKW has introduced a new way to avoid the hated item. And unlike many other methods, this one doesn't require you to hold onto a specific item to pull it off.</p><p>Giant Bomb's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3lqxay5ct5k2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb noted</a> that you can you can avoid the Blue Shell with a clever use of the new Rewind feature. Your kart simply rewinds a few seconds and the Blue Shell detonates in front of you, with plenty of space for you to swerve around it. That does make it a trade-off, since you'll lose a little ground by rewinding while the other racers will continue on--but it's much less of a penalty than getting hit by the shell, which also makes you lose all your items and momentum.</p><p>In our own testing, we found that you need to carefully time your use of the Rewind, because if you hit it too early, the shell will simply follow you backwards. But if you hit it just as the shell finishes its spin, you'll be safe. Best of all, since the Rewind can be triggered at any time, that gives you evergreen access to a way to avoid the Blue Shell.</p><p>Typically, most ways to avoid the Blue Shell require items, most notably the Super Horn or the Mushroom. This is one of those advanced strategies that should put players on an even playing field, and makes the Blue Shell much less daunting than it has been in the past.</p><p>For more guides on Mario Kart World, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-rainbow-road-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532118/" data-ref-id="1100-6532118">how to unlock Rainbow Road</a>.</p>

            <p>
After replacing Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario back in 2023, Nintendo's recasting spree continues. Samantha Kelly has confirmed she's been ditched as the voice of Princess Peach and Toad after 18 years - but she wasn't informed by Nintendo until yesterday, when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> released onto <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> without her in the roles.
</p>
<p>
Kelly has portrayed Princess Peach since 2007's Mario Strikers Charged on Wii, and her voice has featured in over 50 Mario titles since then, culminating in last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. However, she doesn't appear in Nintendo's latest Mario title, Mario Kart World, and Kelly has now confirmed she only found out she'd been replaced after its arrival. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo let me know yesterday that they decided to recast these roles," Kelly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/">explained in an Instagram post</a> shared earlier today. "I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them... Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy. I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever."

<p>
Kelly's recasting mirrors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-says-charles-martinet-no-longer-video-game-voice-of-mario">Nintendo's decision to replace much-loved voice actor Charles Martinet</a> back in 2023, after he'd portrayed the likes of Mario, Luigi, and Wario for over three decades. At the time, it said the decision was made "after carefully considering a variety of factors", but unlike Kelly, Martinet was given a public send-off and crowned Mario Ambassador. However, Martinet later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charles-martinet-still-doesnt-actually-know-what-a-mario-ambassador-is">admitted he didn't know "anything" about the Mario Ambassador role</a>. "I will learn," he said elsewhere, "we'll all learn what exactly that is."
</p>
<p>
Following Martinet's departure, Nintendo dodged questions about his replacement until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/internet-briefly-thinks-its-identified-marios-new-voice-actor-until-he-says-no">Kevin Afghani announced he'd taken over the role</a> shortly before the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-bros-wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>. Afghani is again credited in Mario Kart World, but it's unclear who is now portraying Princess Peach and Toad. Additionally, Takashi Nagasako, who had previously voiced Donkey Kong for over 20 years, is missing from Mario Kart World's credits.

Here’s each one with a brief explanation of what they do:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Banana Peels</strong>: As one of the franchise’s original power-ups, you can always count on Banana Peels showing up. You can place these on the ground, and any players who touch them will wipe out. </li><li><strong>Blooper</strong>: You need to see the track to race on it, right? Well, use a Blooper to squirt ink on your opponents’ screen to briefly block their sight.</li><li><strong>Blue Shell</strong>: No item is more dreaded than the Blue Shell. This shell will track down and hit the leading racer, potentially causing chaos to additional racers along its path.</li><li><strong>Bob-Omb:</strong> You can really frustrate other players with a Bob-Omb. Use this power-up to set the little fella on the track so that it blows up when someone drives nearby.</li><li><strong>Boo</strong>: The Boo power-up makes you a tricky little devil. Using this item will steal another player’s item and turn you invisible briefly.</li><li><strong>Boomerang Flower</strong>: If you’re a good shot, then the Boomerang Flower can be an excellent item to have. It grants you multiple boomerang throws that can hit your opponents during the throw and on the item’s way back to you.</li><li><strong>Bullet Bill</strong>: If you need a good recovery item, Bullet Bill’s got you covered. Using this power-up transforms you into a Bullet Bill so you can dash forward while hitting any opponents in your way.</li><li><strong>Coin</strong>: The more coins you hold (up to 20), the higher your max speed becomes. As such, you’ll want to use these when you get them to, you know, get more vroom vroom.</li><li><strong>Coin Box</strong>: I think we all know what Coin Boxes do in a <em>Mario </em>game. Use this item to let you jump and hit the box for coins.</li><li><strong>Coin Shell</strong>: If you want to go faster, you need coins, and that’s where the Coin Shell comes in handy. This shell fires ahead while dropping coins for you to pick up.</li><li><strong>Feather</strong>: The Feather is a must-have for defensive play. If you learn how to master the timing on this power-up, you’ll be able to jump in the air and avoid items sent at you from other racers.</li><li><strong>Fire Flower</strong>: As one of the original power-ups from Mario canon, we all know what a Fire Flower can do. Use this item to fire off balls of fire at your foes and wipe ‘em out.</li><li><strong>Golden Mushroom</strong>: Speed is the name of the game, and Golden Mushrooms are all about it. A Golden Mushroom gives you unlimited turbo boosts for a brief period after use.</li><li><strong>Green Shell</strong>: If you’ve got a good aim, then a Green Shell can be your friend because this item will fire off ahead or behind you to hit an opponent. And if it misses, it’ll bounce off walls to create a hazard for additional drivers.</li><li><strong>Hammer</strong>: If you want to be a disruptive pest, then Hammers are for you. This power-up lets you throw hammers at your opponents with the added benefit of sticking in the track briefly as an obstacle. </li><li><strong>Ice Flower</strong>: Using the Ice Flower is cold as, uh, ice. Be a pain in the ass by freezing other racers to make them slide around the track with poor control.</li><li><strong>Kamek</strong>: Everyone loves the wizard Kamek and his magical spells, right? Well, you’ll like him better when you’re not on the receiving end of this power-up, which summons the blue-robbed foe to turn your opponents into random enemies.</li><li><strong>Lightning</strong>: Similar to the Blue Shell, the Lightning power-up is historically one of the franchise’s scariest items, letting you shrink other racers. Its duration has been nerfed a bit in this game, but it still slows folks down enough for you to make a little bit of a push ahead.</li><li><strong>Mega Mushroom</strong>: Do you like to get big and crush your foes? The Mega Mushroom lets you do just that by making your character massive so you can streamroll over anyone in your path.</li><li><strong>Mushroom</strong>: If you need a quick boost of speed, you’ll want a Mushroom. This item grants you a quick burst of speed.</li><li><strong>Red Shell:</strong> If you’ve ever played a<em> Mario Kart</em>game, you already know Red Shells are one of the best overall items. This homing shell will track down the closest foe ahead of you and wipe ‘em out.</li><li><strong>Super Horn</strong>: The Super Horn is a useful offensive and defensive tool. It sends a shockwave out that can wipe out enemies or destroy incoming projectiles.</li><li><strong>Super Star</strong>: Any <em>Mario </em>fan knows what a Super Star can do. Use this item to become invincible for a brief period while also granting you the ability to hit your foes with your kart to wipe them out.</li></ul><p>That’s a lot of power-ups! You can start using them by picking up a copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/110926/switch-2-teardown">full teardown of the new console</a>, iFixit is giving the Switch 2 a 3 out of 10 repairability score thanks, in part, to a battery that’s once again “glued in with powerful adhesive” and flash storage modules and USB-C ports that are soldered to the main board.</p><p>Nintendo continues to rely on the tri-point screws the company has been using to assemble its consoles and handhelds for decades, and on the Switch 2, many are hidden behind stickers that get damaged in the process of removing them to access the screws. The company has never released repair parts or manuals for the original Switch, and there are currently none available for the Switch 2, so you’ll need third-party alternatives to reassemble the console.</p><p>Components like the headphone jack, speakers, microphone, and microSD reader on the Switch 2 are easy to remove. As are buttons that are soldered to breakout boards, and the console’s cooling fan that’s held in place by three screws.</p><p>But iFixit describes removing the Switch 2’s battery as an “absolute mission” and “just as bad as the original Switch.” Lots of isopropyl alcohol and a “whole set of pry tools” were needed to remove it, and in the process the foam Nintendo glued to the battery was left disintegrated making a future battery swap a difficult and messy endeavor. </p><p>The Switch 2’s gamecard reader, which was modular and relatively easy to remove and replace in the original Switch and Switch OLED models, is now soldered to the console’s mainboard as it is on Switch Lite. iFixit also found three different types of thermal paste used in the Switch 2 which in the original Switch would solidify over time making it hard to remove and less effective at preventing the console from overheating.</p><p>Even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681274/ifixit-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-teardown-potentiometer-joystick">new Joy-Cons on the Switch 2 are harder to disassemble</a>, which is problematic because the joysticks are using the same potentiometer technology as the original Joy-Cons that rely on a resistive material that can wear away over time. That’s one of the causes of the original Switch’s notorious joystick drift issue and this time around it’s going to be even harder to do repairs or replace the sticks altogether with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR alternatives</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a chonker! Nintendo’s biggest gaming handheld yet looks familiar on paper, but makes a stronger impression in person. We’re not ready to review the new $450 gaming console just yet. That’ll take a lot more testing and game time to get familiar with all of its little changes, improvements, and quirks. Players spent more than eight years with the Switch 1. It’ll take more than eight hours to get a good handle on its successor.</p><p>But in the meantime, we’re already really enjoying our time with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-preparing-ship-late-delivery-target-1851783714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-preparing-ship-late-delivery-target-1851783714">Switch 2</a></span> outside of a few annoying shortcomings and design choices that haven’t yet won us over. Calling it just a bigger, stronger Switch might sound boring, but in practice, it totally rocks. Here’s what we love and hate about the Switch 2 after our first day with it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-recommend-id="image://b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-recommend-id="image://b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The single biggest physical design difference with the Switch 2 is that the Joy-Con now snap onto the side of the console with magnets instead of sliding along a metal track, and it feels so, so satisfying. They effortlessly click in and are easy to remove without having to scrape metal on metal. The triggers to release them are also a lot easier to press than the tiny black buttons on the original Switch, too. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really nice to have a Nintendo console that actually works with my big dumb 4K TV. Previously the Switch, for a few reasons, felt like an old relic I was plugging into my modern TV. But now, I have a Mario machine that takes advantage of the modern features of my big TV and produces a super sharp image. I can’t wait to play Nintendo games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and more at smoother framerates and higher resolutions. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Games load noticeably faster on Switch 2. These aren’t lightning-fast PS5 SSD speeds, but they’re a big leap compared to the old hardware. Loading <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>takes only 7-8 seconds on Switch 2, roughly half what they took on the original Switch. Fast-travel in those games is roughly twice as fast as well. Even games without official Switch 2 updates are vastly improved. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a></span> takes 30 seconds less on Switch 2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a></span>,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</em></a></span> have all had their load times buffed, too<em>.</em></p><p>I also tested<em> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It was roughly 18 seconds to get from starting the game to the first menu in each, which doesn’t sound all that impressive until you remember the latter takes place in a sprawling, interconnected map and lets you immediately start driving from the start menu. - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-recommend-id="image://cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-recommend-id="image://cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always underrate how nice a giant screen is for gaming, especially when it’s just two feet from my face. The Switch OLED was marginally bigger and felt like having a weight lifted when I upgraded to it from my OG model. That feeling is magnified with Switch 2, which includes a much bigger screen with a smaller bezel and rim of plastic at the top and bottom. It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always found the Switch to feel like a kids’ toy that just so happened to play games. That’s not the case with the Switch 2. It feels incredible to hold. The buttons feel perfectly pushable, and the outer coating on the console and Joy-Con feels lovely. Not too slippery, not too rough. It also has a nice heft to it and feels substantial. It feels like a  high-end tech device and not a toy, and I really appreciate that. -ZZ</p></div><div><p>It’s been years since the Switch eShop felt anywhere close to borderline usable. It chugged like a ‘90s Windows PC loaded up with malware. Menus were sluggish, icons wouldn’t load, and half the time I just gave up looking for stuff to play and went back to my PS5 or PC instead. But on Switch 2, the eShop is once again snappy and responsive. The search bar returns way better results, and I like that the store has given wishlists and personal recommendations more emphasis on the left action bar. I also like that things are slightly more spaced out, making the whole experience feel a little less cramped. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Similar to the console and Joy-Con, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a wonderful thing to hold and use. The buttons feel just clicky enough without feeling cheap or being too loud. The new GL and GR buttons are a great addition that will be useful in more complicated games. And the entire controller, like the Switch 2 console, just oozes high-end, luxury vibes. And it better, as it cost me nearly $100 after taxes and shit. -ZZ</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While the eShop got a nice refresh, the rest of the Switch 2 interface, sans new features like Game Chat, looks basically identical to that of the old hardware. The home screen is still a single row of game icons surrounded by a sea of white space (or black if you use the system’s only other menu theme option). The coming back from standby screen is also the exact same, with a news bar on the left, the time at the top right, and a small icon of the last active app in the middle. </p><p>Would it kill Nintendo to add some more color options, menu themes, or background art? - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For as nice as the controllers feel, they are still a horrible way to play games. The stick is in the wrong place! I’ve been annoyed about this since the OG Switch and it still sucks here, too. The sticks themselves also feel tiny and too soft.</p><p>Actually playing with one single Joy-Con is an experience I’ll avoid like the plague on Switch 2. If I have to use them, I’ll attach them to the included Joy-Con grip and use both. And that will only be if my Pro Controller is missing for some horrible reason. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-recommend-id="image://a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-recommend-id="image://a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I miss the old days of the original Switch when I could see all my Twitter friends and their Nintendo accounts, and I could easily shoot them a friend invite. Now I have to share my friend code. I can’t even look up people’s usernames. </p><p>It feels like such a strange old relic to have to rely on friend codes in 2025. Why can’t I link up my Discord and see other Discord buddies with Nintendo Online accounts? Ultimately, once we are friends, this problem isn’t a big deal, but it’s still not great. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The eShop is great now on Switch 2! It loads so fast, and you can quickly navigate it. However, as I did this last night, I quickly noticed that the shop was filled with all the same slop as before. And checking out the upcoming releases revealed a big tidal wave of low-priced garbage coming down the pipeline. A reminder that, while the Switch 2 is a new console, it is bringing with it a lot of baggage. -ZZ</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She pulls out her cape and turns herself and nearby teammates invisible. This lets those impacted to avoid detection from enemies. This skill is mostly used defensively, especially during boss battles. When the Duchess is invisible, this lets her take the time to revive downed teammates without being interrupted, or just take the pressure off and heal.</p><p><strong>While invisible, she can still be targeted</strong>, particularly by projectiles that home in on their targets. Area-of-Effect attacks will still hit her as well, along with grabs if she happens to get caught in one. Hitting an enemy will reveal her location, too; so make a big splash before coming out of invisibility.</p><h2 id="h318563"><a id="4"></a>A look at the Duchess’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p>Surprisingly, the Duchess’s highest stat isn’t Dexterity, but is instead Intelligence—although her Dexterity is still above average. This means that daggers are her best option as they take advantage of her rapid-fire attacks. Daggers are also great at inflicting status effects, so if you come across any rare ones like Bleed or Scarlet Rot, those will be a boon for your run. The more hits dished out, the faster status effects build up.</p><p>Despite being a melee character, she can put her high Intelligence to use with staves to inflict long-range magic damage. Speaking of long-range damage, bows scale well with dexterity, so you can use her as a backup ranged character if you can’t get in close..</p><p>“Successive attacks negate damage” is a really useful buff that’ll be incredibly helpful if you come across it. Because the Duchess inflicts so many small cuts without losing stamina, she can end up becoming tankier with this buff active, sometimes not even having to dodge out of enemy attacks.</p><p>Regardless of how you play her, the Duchess is well-worth unlocking and using on your next expedition.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are a lot of little tricks and mechanics high-end players use to maximize their speed and efficiency in races, after all. But look, even if you’re just playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>casually, you should at least practice drifting reliably to help you round corners and curves without slowing down. </p><figure id="" data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And there’s so much more new stuff now, too, including riding on rails and walls. Mastering these additional movement features and knowing when to use them can help you shave off a lot of time during a race, often by granting you access to shortcuts or letting you bypass parts of a track altogether. In some cases, riding a wall may even save you from falling off a track and losing your place!</p><p>No one says you have to take competitive racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em> seriously, of course.

So, practice up!</p><h2 id="h234785"><a id="2"></a>Be a coin fiend</h2><p><strong>Every coin you pick up in <em>Mario Kart World</em> will increase your max speed</strong>. You can hold up to 20 coins, which is a step up from the usual 10 in previous games, but you’ll also lose three every time you get hit by a projectile. With this in mind, actively seek them out during the entire race in an effort to stay as close to the coin cap as possible. </p><figure id="" data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To help with this, there’s always a chance that you’ll snag a power-up like the Coin Box or Coin Shell to give you a solid influx of coins, so make sure you use those when they come up.

Because of this, it’s usually a good idea to aim for double item boxes on a course so that you can snag two items at once, giving you two chances at disrupting other players or providing yourself with additional protection from incoming projectiles.</p><p>Of course, if you see someone else aiming for the double item box ahead of you, it may sometimes be better to snag a nearby normal item box instead so that you don’t risk a chance of getting nothing at all. I don’t want to think you’d get sniped in the butt by a red shell just because your greed left you without protection.</p><hr><p><br><em>Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The only machines involved were our personal computers (<a href="https://kim-hu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim, the artist, lives in Germany</a>, so we had to electronically mail her our design ideas), and I guess a few at our merch providers, who had to print and then mail the shirts. That's it!</p><figure><figcaption>Not us!</figcaption></figure><p>The proceeds of this shirt are split between us, a website run by humans, and Kim, an artist who is also a human. <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you buy the shirt from us</a>, the people who actually made the shirt, you're directly supporting us both, and that's great! If you buy the shirt anywhere else, you're being scammed. </p><p>A quick google search for "Destroy AI shirt" will eventually bring up our own listing, sure, but it also brings up results for scores of the same design on skeevy bootleg websites, the kind who have used Twitter bots and other nefarious tactics to find, replicate then try to mooch off Kim’s work.</p><p>I have no idea how many people have actually bought a shirt from these places, if any, but the fact our design briefly surfaced outside our regular ecosystem of readers and fans (through stuff like social sharing), and that these sites are selling the design in a huge variety of colours and even on other items (like hoodies) makes me curious.</p><p>I'm not going to link any of them, but I do want to talk about one in particular, which in the process of using some kind of bot to scrape the work also used AI to generate an explainer text for...our shirt that wants to destroy AI:</p><blockquote><p>The Destroy AI Shirt isn’t just a piece of clothing; it’s a statement. Designed for those who dare to challenge the growing power of artificial intelligence, this shirt features a dynamic graphic of a character holding a weapon, dismantling a robot. The message is clear: a call for independence from the digital world, where humans regain control over technology. This graphic design draws inspiration from movements that critique the excessive reliance on AI and emphasize the need for balance between technology and humanity.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>"Balance"?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doug Jung, the writer for films like Star Trek: Beyond and The Cloverfield Paradox, and TV series like Mindhunter has been selected to be the showrunner for Amazon MGM Studios upcoming TV adaptation of Mass Effect.</p>
<p>The news comes from a new <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/mass-effect-doug-jung-tv-series-showrunner-1236423704/">Deadline</a> report, confirming that Jung will lead the show's development and begin working in collaboration with Dan Casey, who has been writing for the show for the past year.</p>
<p>The very first time we heard about a Mass Effect TV series in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/">works was in 2021</a>, and at the time, Amazon was only just securing a deal with EA and BioWare to make the series. Then, last November, we learned that<a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/"> Fast and Furious 9 writer Dan Casey</a> had joined the project as a writer and executive producer, though the show was still missing its showrunner.</p>
<p>Now that Jung has filled that position, hopefully the series can actually start to make some serious progress and be out sometime in the near future. It's still unclear what direction the adaptation will take, if it'll be set in some part of the Mass Effect universe we don't get to see in the games, or if it'll follow along Shepard's journey, and be something more akin to HBO's The Last of Us, which sticks very close to the story in the games, save for a few changes in how the story is dolled out.</p>
<p>Who knows how this series will pan out, but one thing that Mass Effect fans can take solace in is the fact that it's a TV series adaptation, instead of a film adaptation. Part of what players love about Mass Effect's story is the small character moments that happen in between the main plot's bigger and bombastic events.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be impossible to convey the feeling of Mass Effect in a film, but it would be far more difficult simply due to time constraints. A premier TV show, however, can practically take as much time as it wants, if the series is a success. There's easily a version of a Mass Effect TV show that takes the characters from the games we all love, and takes them on endless adventures we would have never seen in the games. That's the hope, at least.</p>

Beyond the PSN and Musk hacks, he “triggered a U.S. Air Force alert by forcing a passenger jet to make an emergency landing,” according to the trailer. Seconds after that revelation, an FBI agent attests that Kivimäki revealed he had law enforcement sent to the families of FBI agents by making fake emergency phone calls, an act known as “swatting,” because “he thought it was fun, and he enjoyed hurting or seeing people suffer.” The teaser even features an unidentified man, presumably a victim of Kivimäki’s hacks, who vows to kill him the second the two are in the same location. </p><p>The documentary will not only have victims of his hacks, fellow hackers, SWAT team members, and FBI agents, but also the incarcerated Kivimäki himself. The first of four episodes will be released in September, but brushing up on the news of Kivimäki’s hacking spree will give you a better understanding of the criminal at the center of the doc more than any teaser could.

If you’re interested in the latter, you’ll want to pick up a USB-C camera, and I’d argue that the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-camera-123682/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-camera-123682/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a></span> is the all-around best option. With 1080p resolution, a sleek profile, and a useful privacy shutter, this accessory is well worth the $55 for anyone looking to jump into Game Chat with all the bells and whistles.</p><h2 id="h236151"><a id="3"></a>Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel</h2><figure id="" data-id="000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-recommend-id="image://000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-recommend-id="image://000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re into motion controls, you may get a kick out of having a wheel for your Joy-Con 2 controllers while playing games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. There are a handful of perfectly fine third-party options available, but the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-set-of-2-120834/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-set-of-2-120834/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel</a></span> is gonna be your best choice—especially at launch. The Joy-Con 2 controllers snap in using magnetic force for a stable connection, while the matching color schemes of the two included wheels ensure you can tell who’s who during two-player fun. These little wheels will run you $25—but if you think you’ll get some use out of them, they’re a worthwhile accessory to have around.</p><h2 id="h236152"><a id="4"></a>Spigen Dual Grip Cover</h2><p>It’s totally reasonable if you find the fairly thin Nintendo Switch 2 a little uncomfortable to hold in handheld mode for extended periods. Luckily, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/46DeG2m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/46DeG2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spigen Dual Grip</a></span> can alleviate a lot of that discomfort by making things more ergonomic for you. This lightweight polycarbonate grip cover covers all of the parts of the Nintendo Switch 2 needed to ensure you can have a comfortable grip on the device without compromising your ability to place the console into its dock or use the kickstand. The Spigen Dual Grip will run you $30, but you’re getting a much better grip on your console without making any sacrifice in efficiency, so I’d say it’s worth the investment for anyone frequently using their Nintendo Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><h2 id="h236153"><a id="5"></a>Samsung microSD Express Card</h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes packing a lot more storage than its predecessor (256GB this time around), but if you’re the type to keep a smorgasbord of games on your console at once, you may want to expand your storage capacity with a microSD Express card. You can’t go wrong with the official Nintendo-branded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card</a></span>. Though you can certainly find both larger and cheaper microSD Express cards, this choice comes from one of the medium’s most trusted brands and doubles your overall storage for only $60. Hell yeah.</p><h2 id="h236154"><a id="6"></a>Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</h2><p>If you’re the kind of person who uses your Switch 2 Joy-Cons frequently — and especially if you have more than two — a good Joy-Con charging dock is important. And the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</a></span> is a rad choice. Your Joy-Cons snap into the dock magnetically from any angle, and they’ll charge to full in around 2 hours. LED lights let you know when they’re charging (orange) or fully charged (blue), and the multiple RGB lighting modes can add a bit of flair to your desk or entertainment center. That’s some pretty cool shit.</p><h2 id="h236155"><a id="7"></a>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</h2><p>Cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 are plentiful, so you should always pick one that meets your unique needs both in terms of looks and functionality. However, perhaps the best case on the market is the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</a></span>, which offers impressive protection, high-quality materials, and tons of storage inside. This chunky case even has a spot to store your Nintendo Switch 2 dock so that you can transport your docked console experience anywhere you want to go. </p><figure id="" data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll find six slots for game carts, storage for a Pro Controller, and a large mesh compartment for all of your cables. The only downside is that this big boy costs $85, so opting for a smaller, and thus cheaper, case may be a better bet if you only need protection for the handheld portion of the console.</p><p>It goes without saying that there are plenty of other accessories out there to score for your Nintendo Switch 2. But hopefully, this short list helped you get a feel for some of your best options. Now, get off here and go play some video games.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Literally. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some, the emphasis on combat encounters may be surprising, as Silent Hill is a series that has tended to focus on environmental storytelling and psychological horror over combat. However, this latest trailer — the first we've seen to offer a meaningful glimpse at gameplay and combat — coupled with a new interview with producer Motoi Okamoto, suggest that our protagonist may have to endure a more physical experience. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game features unique combat," Okamoto <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said in a post on PlayStation Blog</u></a>. "The encounters are as challenging as the obstacles that Hinako must overcome in life. The combat will have a heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year’s Silent Hill 2."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last sentence surprises me, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake</u></a> itself involved significantly more combat that the original game — or, indeed, any other game in the series bar perhaps <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-homecoming"><u>Silent Hill Homecoming</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okamoto said that tougher combat, with the visuals and music's "juxtaposition between beauty and terror," along with the "terrible beauty of the game’s monster design," makes for a terrifying adventure. Even the puzzles are apparently "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering." Yikes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f is not a sequel to any of the existing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/silent-hill"><u>Silent Hill games</u></a>. Instead it will offer a standalone story "independent from the series." That came from publisher Konami itself, which finally confirmed on X/Twitter that the latest instalment of the horror series — which is usually, if not always, based in a sleepy resort town on east-coast America — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-a-completely-new-title-that-people-who-have-never-played-the-series-can-enjoy-konami-says"><u>will be "a completely new title" that "people who have never played the Silent Hill series can enjoy</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f takes us to 1960s Japan, where we'll follow Hinako Shimizu, a teenager struggling under the pressure of expectations from her friends, family, and society. The story was written by Ryukishi07, creator of the When They Cry visual novel series. As displayed at the beginning of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/silent-hill-f-official-japanese-trailer"><u>Japanese-language reveal trailer</u></a> back in March, it is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan"><u>the first Silent Hill game to get an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.
