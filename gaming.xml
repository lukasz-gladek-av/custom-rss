            <p>Actress Ashly Burch has responded to the leaked AI Aloy footage, which made the rounds earlier this week.</p>
<p>The footage in question showed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-experimenting-with-ai-powered-playstation-characters-ironically-chooses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate">Sony employee engaging with an on-screen AI version of the Horizon lead</a>. The employee asked the AI Aloy a number of questions, such as "how are you", to which the character replied she was ok, but "dealing with a sore throat", before she shared some Horizon lore.</p>
<p>Now, Burch - who along with starring as Horizon's Aloy has featured in a series such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a>, Borderlands and The Last of Us - has shared her thoughts on the leaked footage.</p>

<p>"I saw the tech demo earlier this week," Burch said in a video shared on her social channels, adding Horizon developer Guerrilla had been in contact with her to say the "demo didn't reflect anything that was actively in development".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sony "didn't use any of [Burch's] performance" for the demo. "So none of my facial or voice data," Aloy's actress said. "Guerrilla owns Aloy as a character."</p>
<p>But still, "I feel worried," Burch continued. "Not worried about Guerrilla specifically, or Horizon, or my performance, or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form.</p>
<p>"Game performance as an art form."</p>
<p>Burch went on to speak about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal">current SAG-AFTRA strikes</a>, of which AI is a big part of the discussion. "We're asking for protections," Burch said. "What we are fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form. You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you're using this AI double."</p>
<p>Burch added she doesn't feel worried because the technology exists, or even because game companies want to use it, reasoning "of course they do - they always want to use technological advancements". </p>
<p>
"I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone's performance attached to it. That does have someone's voice, or face, or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse," the actress said. "They wouldn't have any protections. Any way to fight back. </p>
<p>"And that possibility... it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me."</p>

<p>Burch stated she loves this industry and the creative art form. She wants there "to be a new generation of actors", and for there to be "so many more incredible game performances" from those actors.</p>
<p>"I want to be able to continue, to do this job, and if we don't win, then that future is really compromised," Burch said. "I'm genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast, certainly not Guerrilla, because again, I don't think... the technology isn't the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn't the problem. The problem is we are currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections."</p>
<p>Burch closed by stating she supports the strike, and always has. "Fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and longevity of this career we all love so much."</p>

Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-generative-ai-model-muse-isnt-creating-games-and-its-certainly-not-going-to-solve-game-preservation-expert-says">Microsoft trumpeted the announcement of Muse</a>, a new "generative AI breakthrough" designed to aid "gameplay ideation". Also in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/artificial-intelligence-is-an-oxymoron-theres-no-such-thing-says-take-two-boss">Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick opened up about his views on AI</a>, calling the concept of artificial intelligence "an oxymoron".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Microsoft-owned Activision recently came under fire for its use of generative AI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">admitting some in-game content in Call of Duty has been created using the technology</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/627954/star-of-providence-review-nintendo-switch-pc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Star of Providence</em> is like a retro game I would have loved as a kid. But the roguelike bullet hell shooter is also a modern twin-stick shooter, and the melding of the two eras results in a fun, fast, and challenging experience.</p><p>In <em>Star</em>, you control a ship and explore randomly generated dungeons. As you navigate room by room — similar to an old-school <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game — you’ll pick up powerful weapons to fight the many enemies you’ll stumble across in your dungeon crawling.</p><p>The weapons are a delight, filling your screen with bullets and lasers. Sometimes, you’ll get cool effects like the ability for your bullets to phase through one side of the screen and appear on the other. But enemies can also spew out huge amounts of bullets, and that means many rooms turn into chaos as you weave through attack patterns to line up a perfect shot. The game’s narrow aspect ratio makes rooms feel pretty small, too (though I appreciate how it adds to the retro vibe).</p><p><em>Star’s</em> controls are tight, so it always feels like you can thread the needle to escape danger. A useful dash can get you out of rough spots. And you can deploy bombs to clear bullets from a room, but they can take a while to recharge.</p><p>As you explore dungeons, you’ll have to make a lot of typical roguelike-y choices, like what to buy at a shop or what upgrades to pick. Arguably the most important choice is what weapons you’ll pick up along the way: they’re much more powerful than your basic gun, but they also have a limited amount of ammo. But I found that made for some fun strategy. Do I buy a weapon right when I come upon a store but risk running out of ammo before I really need it? Or should I try to survive a floor without it and instead buy the weapon when I’m about to take on the floor’s boss?</p><p>Speaking of bosses: they’re awesome. They’re typically giant, taking up a good portion of the square screen, and they spew bullets in all sorts of unpredictable and nail-biting patterns. I’m a particularly big fan of the <a href="https://starofprovidence.wiki.gg/wiki/Daemon">huge green skeleton with horns</a>.</p><p>Perhaps my favorite thing about <em>Star</em> is that everything is <em>fast</em>. Rooms typically take just seconds to clear, meaning you can zip through a whole dungeon floor in a few minutes. The game’s map lets you instantly teleport to rooms you’ve previously been to as you’re exploring a floor. Even boss fights usually only take a minute or two. And when you want to start a new run, all you need to do is go through a door at your home base.</p><p>There’s a constant sense of forward momentum that I think more games should emulate. That actually might be where <em>Star</em> is most like the old-school games it’s inspired by: jumping into the action is almost as easy as adding another quarter to an arcade machine.</p><p><sub>Star of Providence<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Developer Red Thread Games has announced its next game which is titled Hello Sunshine, and it looks like one inspiration could be The Iron Giant. The teaser shows you character, who is the last employee of the Hello Sunshine corporation, who is looking for something to quench their thirst. Unfortunately, the bottle they find is empty so they chuck it and, inadvertently, wake up a hostile robot. Luckily, a friendly robot comes in to save the day. A release date is yet to be confirmed, and Hello Sunshine seems to be PC only at the moment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hello Sunshine — official teaser trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XI-HO3uoCmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hello Sunshine is a survival RPG in which you and the robot are journeying along a road to reach the tower at the end of it. That tower holds the fate of the entire world. There is a day and night cycle in the game as well. In the day, the sun’s heat can be deadly so staying in the robots shadow gives some relief. During this time scavenging for supplies and looking for puzzle pieces is the key focus, while at night you will need to make camp while the robot recharges, crafting supplies and carrying out any repairs for the robot. You will be able to craft smaller robots to help with scavenging and other tasks. As an employee of Hello Sunshine you can complete tasks that improves your employee rank, which in turn unlocks bonuses such as vending machines and rest areas, which will be needed in this desert. Hello Sunshine will also feature co-op.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dustborn-review/">Dustborn Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Dustborn review, Gareth said, <em>“While some of its gameplay diversions miss the mark, Dustborn is an excellent example of how to craft engaging characters and wrap a story around them. The game is filled with surprisingly natural sounding conversations, whether they’re serious and detailed or funny and light. It’s very rare that I encounter characters that are so believable in a game. Quite the achievement considering one of those characters is a gruff, bearded New Yorker with dwarfism who heals people by reciting poetry, who I honestly wish I got to spend more time with.”</em></p>

<p>Ideally, you'd expect any Super NES console—if properly maintained—to operate identically to any other Super NES unit ever made. Given the same base ROM file and the same set of precisely timed inputs, all those consoles should hopefully give the same gameplay output across individual hardware and across time.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://tas.bot/wiki/Main_Page">TASBot community</a> relies on this kind of solid-state predictability when creating <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/how-a-game-playing-robot-coded-super-mario-maker-onto-an-snes-live-on-stage/">tool-assisted speedruns</a> that can be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/inside-tasbots-semi-secret-probably-legal-effort-to-control-the-nintendo-switch/">executed</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/how-a-robot-got-super-mario-64-and-portal-running-on-an-snes/">robotic precision</a> on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/how-to-beat-super-mario-bros-3-in-less-than-a-second/">actual console hardware</a>. But on the SNES in particular, the team has largely struggled to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/">emulated speedruns</a> to sync up with demonstrated results on real consoles.</p>
<p>After significant research and testing on dozens of actual SNES units, the TASBot team now thinks that a cheap ceramic resonator used in the system's Audio Processing Unit (APU) is to blame for much of this inconsistency. While <a href="https://snes.nesdev.org/wiki/SNES_Development_Manual">Nintendo's own documentation</a> says the APU should run at a consistent rate of 24,576 Hz (and the associated Digital Signal Processor sample rate at a flat 32,000 Hz), in practice, that rate can vary just a bit based on heat, system age, and minor physical variations that develop in different console units over time.</p>
<p>Casual players would only notice this problem in the form of an almost imperceptibly higher pitch for in-game music and sounds. But for TASbot, Allan "dwangoAC" Cecil says this unreliable clock has become a "constant, pervasive, unavoidable" problem for getting frame-accurate consistency in hardware-verified speedruns.</p>

<p>Cecil says he first began to suspect the APU's role in TASBot's SNES problems back in 2016 when he broke open his own console to test it with an external frequency counter. He <a href="https://tasvideos.org/Forum/Topics/17018?CurrentPage=4&amp;Highlight=444216#444216">found</a> that his APU ran just a bit faster than Nintendo's specifications, an inconsistency that could cause the console to throw out unpredictable "lag frames" if and when the CPU and APU load cycles failed to line up in the expected manner. Those lag frames, in turn, are enough to "desynchronize" TASBot's input on actual hardware from the results you'd see on a more controlled emulator.</p>

<p>Unlike the quartz crystals used in many electronics (including the SNES's more consistent and differently timed CPU), the cheaper ceramic resonators in the SNES APU are "known to degrade over time," as Cecil put it. <a href="https://www.symmetryelectronics.com/getmedia/921363e7-f4b0-4839-ab33-e8e6365a248a/ceramics_resonators_app_manual.pdf">Documentation for the resonators used in the APU</a>&nbsp;also seems to suggest that excess heat may impact the clock cycle speed, meaning the APU might speed up a bit as a specific console heats up.</p>

<p>The TASBot team was not the first group to notice this kind of audio inconsistency in the SNES. In the early 2000s, some emulator developers <a href="https://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=52693#Post52693">found</a> that certain late-era SNES games don't run correctly when the emulator's Digital Signal Processor (DSP) sample rate is set to the Nintendo-specified value of precisely 32,000 Hz (a number derived from the speed of the APU clock). Developers <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030914232710/https://alpha-ii.com/Info/snes-spdif.html">tested actual hardware</a> at the time and found that the DSP was actually running at 32,040 Hz and that setting the emulated DSP to run at that specific rate suddenly fixed the misbehaving commercial games.</p>
<p>That small but necessary emulator tweak implies that "the original developers who wrote those games were using hardware that... must have been running slightly faster at that point," Cecil told Ars. "Because if they had written directly to what the spec said, it may not have worked."</p>

<h2>Survey says...</h2>
<p>While research and testing confirmed the existence of these APU variations, Cecil wanted to determine just how big the problem was across actual consoles today. To do that, he <a href="https://nextcloud.tas.bot/index.php/apps/forms/s/TJDiEwP6J7HFfYbPRw4A7dHN">ran an informal online survey</a> last month, cryptically <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tas.bot/post/3lj47u3fga22n">warning his social media followers</a> that "SNES consoles seem to be getting faster as they age." He asked respondents to <a href="https://forums.nesdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=24610">run a DSP clock measurement ROM</a> on any working SNES hardware they had lying around and to rerun the test after the console had time to warm up.</p>
<p>After receiving 143 responses and <a href="https://docs.getgrist.com/fpwWkqDcnxXR/SNES-SMP-speed/p/1">crunching the numbers</a>, Cecil said he was surprised to find that temperature seemed to have a minimal impact on measured DSP speed; the measurement only rose an insignificant 8 Hz on average between "cold" and "hot" readings on the same console. Cecil even put his own console in a freezer to see if the DSP clock rate would change as it thawed out and found only a 22 Hz difference as it warmed back up to room temperature.</p>

<p>Those heat effects paled in comparison to the natural clock variation across different consoles, though. The slowest and fastest DSPs in Cecil's sample showed a clock difference of 234 Hz, or about 0.7 percent of the 32,000 Hz specification.</p>
<p>That difference is small enough that human players probably wouldn't notice it directly; TASBot team member Total estimated it might amount to "at most maybe a second or two [of difference] over hours of gameplay." Skilled speedrunners could notice small differences, though, if differing CPU and APU alignments cause "carefully memorized enemy pattern changes to something else" between runs, Cecil said.</p>
<p>For a frame-perfect tool-assisted speedrun, though, the clock variations between consoles could cause innumerable headaches. As TASBot team member Undisbeliever <a href="https://undisbeliever.net/blog/20250313-smpspeed.html">explained in his detailed analysis</a>: "On one console this might take 0.126 frames to process the music-tick, on a different console it might take 0.127 frames. It might not seem like much but it is enough to potentially delay the start of song loading by 1 frame (depending on timing, lag and game-code)."</p>

              Cecil's survey found variation across consoles was much higher than the effects of heat on any single console.

<p>Cecil also said the survey-reported DSP clock speeds were also a bit higher than he expected, at an average rate of 32,078 Hz at room temperature. That's quite a bit higher than both the 32,000 Hz spec set by Nintendo and the 32,040 Hz rate that emulator developers settled on after sampling actual hardware in 2003.</p>
<p>To some observers, this is evidence that SNES APUs originally produced in the '90s have been speeding up slightly as they age and could continue to get faster in the coming years and decades. But Cecil says the historical data they have is too circumstantial to make such a claim for certain.</p>
<p>"We're all a bunch of differently skilled geeks and nerds, and it's in our nature to argue over what the results mean, which is fine," Cecil said. "The only thing we can say with certainty is the statistical significance of the responses that show the current average DSP sample rate is 32,076 Hz, faster on average than the original specification. The rest of it is up to interpretation and a certain amount of educated guessing based on what we can glean."</p>

<h2>A first step</h2>
<p>For the TASBot team, knowing just how much real SNES hardware timing can differ from dry specifications (and emulators) is an important step to getting more consistent results on real hardware. But that knowledge hasn't completely solved their synchronization problems. Even when Cecil replaced the ceramic APU resonator in his Super NES with a more accurate quartz version (tuned precisely to match Nintendo's written specification), the team "did not see perfect behavior like we expected," he told Ars.</p>
<p>Beyond clock speed inconsistencies, Cecil explained to Ars that TASBot team testing has found an additional "jitter pattern" present in the APU sampling that "injects some variance in how long it takes to perform various actions" between runs. That leads to non-deterministic performance even on the same hardware, Cecil said, which means that "TASBot is likely to desync" after just a few minutes of play on most SNES games.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rasteri/TAStable">Extensive research from Rasteri</a> suggests that these inconsistencies across same-console runs are likely caused by a "very non-deterministic reset circuit" that changes the specific startup order and timing for a console's individual components every time it's powered on. That leads to essentially "infinite possibilities" for the relative place where the CPU and APU clocks start in their "synchronization cycle" for each fresh run, making it impossible to predict specifically where and when lag frames will appear, Rasteri wrote.</p>
<p>Cecil said these kind of "butterfly effect" timing issues make the Super NES "a surprisingly complicated console [that has] resisted our attempts to fully model it and coerce it into behaving consistently." But he's still hopeful that the team will "eventually find a way to restore an SNES to the behavior game developers expected based on the documentation they were provided without making invasive changes..."</p>
<p>In the end, though, Cecil <a href="https://bishopfox.com/blog/youre-doing-iot-rng">seems to have developed an almost grudging respect</a> for how the SNES's odd architecture leads to such unpredictable operation in practice. "If you want to deliberately create a source of randomness and non-deterministic behavior, having two clock sources that spinloop independently against one another is a fantastic choice," he said.</p>

			<p>Shortly after their slew of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA also shared brief new clips for a trio of highly anticipated upcoming action games: Lost Soul Aside, Stellar Blade, and Tides of Annihilation. All of them are made by Asian developers, and they will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to guarantee exceedingly high frame rates, up to over 500 FPS in Lost Soul Aside.</p>
<p>The latter game has been in development for a long time. We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-amazing-ps4-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered it</a> nearly seven years ago, when it was being developed for the PlayStation 4 Pro. Unlike other long-delayed games, though, there's a very good reason - it all started as a one-man project of Yang Bing before it gained a lot of attention and support. At long last, Lost Soul Aside will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-launches-on-may-30th-on-pc-and-playstation-5-new-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on May 30</a> for PC and PlayStation 5, making it the first single player game published by Sony Interactive Entertainment to release day and date on the two platforms. The action title, which still runs on Unreal Engine 4, also supports ray tracing; you can find detailed system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-pc-system-requirements-rtx-5070-ti-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>Strictly in order of release, the next game is Stellar Blade from Korean developer Shift Up. This one (also published by Sony Interactive Entertainment like Lost Soul Aside) launched a year ago on the PlayStation 5 to excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews</a>, though developer and publisher have both since been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-and-stellar-blade-developer-gets-sued-for-trademark-infringement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> for trademark infringement.</p>
<p>As seen in the brief footage, Stellar Blade, which is also powered by Unreal Engine 4, runs at up to 371 frames per second with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.&nbsp;The PC release is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> at some point in June. We don't have the official system requirements yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade | 4K NVIDIA DLSS Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I6rVjbzIwc8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, we have the most recently announced game: <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-is-a-stunning-action-adventure-game-set-in-a-fantasy-london-inspired-by-arthurian-myths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tides of Annihilation</a>. This action/adventure title inspired by Arthurian myths is in development at Eclipse Glow Games with the Unreal Engine 5, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tentatively slated for a 2026 launch</a>. In the trailer, we see it running at up to 359 frames per second with the aid of NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tides of Annihilation | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHuUw_UyyRs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, all these trailers were captured on the new NVIDIA flagship GPU, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GeForce RTX 5090</a>. Moreover, they will have selected Performance Mode at 4K resolution to maximize frame rates. Still, even with these small caveats, they are impressive frame rate figures. We'll still have to wait to actually play the games before judging their smoothness, though, as stuttering could nonetheless mar even a high frame rate experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Last night, OpTic Gaming’s Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez published a lengthy video exploring the ‘curse’ that lingers over OpTic Texas in the Call of Duty League. Hours later, the team suffered another loss, hitting a map record of 0-18, which is one of the worst records in the history of Call of Duty esports.</p>



<p>Not only that, but in the series against the LA Theives, the most dominant team in the CDL right now, OpTic’s Kenny secured the lowest KD in competitive COD history. Curse or not, something has to change for OpTic Texas, which is on an unrivalled bad luck run.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-top-to-bottom">Top to Bottom</h2>



<p>Last year, OpTic Texas claimed the Call of Duty League Championship, the most prestigious award in the ecosystem. The team netted the first world title for OpTic in Call of Duty in several years, and everyone lauded this incredibly talented team.</p>



<p>Fast forward to today, and the fans are rebelling against the same roster, which has put up one of the worst records in competitive history. In the last batch of matches played, OpTic Texas has gone 0-18, failing to secure a single map in six fixtures.</p>



<p>It was noticed shortly after the recent match finished that Kenny had dropped a 0.3 KD ratio, which is, according to statistics aggregation platforms, the lowest kill-death ratio in Call of Duty esports history. That’s a record set by a two-time world champion, which just seems bizarre at this point.</p>



<p>In the round of Hardpoint against LA Thieves, Kenny set a woeful record, pulling just <strong>11 kills </strong>in what was a complete thrashing from the Thieves.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/">recent video published by HECZ</a>, the OpTic Texas team was all smiles as they pondered what could be wrong, with the entire office believing that a curse was upon the squad. Fans worldwide are pleading for a change, but nobody has a solid grip on what needs to be altered to get OpTic Texas winning maps.</p>



<p>What’s worse is that in just a few days, Major II will unravel in Texas, backed by OpTic. The team will start in the worst position at its home event and will have just <strong>one chance </strong>to stay in the running.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to change at OpTic Texas?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-suikoden-series-is-as-relevant-as-ever.1135287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Few series continue to influence entire industries three decades down the line – fewer still if we’re talking about relatively obscure Japanese role-playing games. <em>Suikoden</em>, however, fits that bill. The recently-remastered JRPGs in which you’re able to recruit 108 characters to your cause are about far more than collecting ‘em all. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, Aidan Moher, freelance writer and author of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/aidanis.fun/post/3ljpuq32vqc2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming book <em>Suikoden 1 &amp; 2</em></a>, takes us to class.</p><p>We begin by discussing the many reasons why Moher felt these games in particular were worthy of an entire book, including their pre-9/11 historical context and the specific team-based nature of their development. Then we discuss news from the eye of the pre-GDC storm: Next week, thousands of game developers will convene in San Francisco to network and exchange knowledge, but <a href="https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a growing number of non-US-based devs are dropping out</a> due to Trump’s hostile policies and erratic governance.&nbsp;</p><p>After that we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/playstation-ai-aloy-horizon-talk-character" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> both introducing new unwanted AI features in the same week. Whose is worse? We’ll let you decide. Lastly, we design the one product that should include generative AI: a fucked-up private jet for rich people that definitely works just fine.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually hire exactly 108 writers, reporters, and heck, maybe even some kind of battle chef to work at Aftermath.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> [The book talks about] how these things were important in the mid-90s as we were entering into a period of geo-political turmoil. We were only a few years away from 9/11 and everything that entailed. And so looking at the series contextually, we were able to have that conversation with the context of being adults who understand all of that better than we did when we first played it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>As somebody who hasn’t really played these games, I know them as the series where you can collect 108 potential party members. How does that tie into what you’ve been talking about so far: these themes of war and how it impacts people?</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> I think there’s two interesting angles on that: The first is that <em>Suikoden </em>bucked the trend of so many RPGs that look at exceptional people doing exceptional things. You’ll go in, and it’ll be princesses or brilliant scientists or knights who get turned into frogs; I’m describing <em>Chrono Trigger</em>. I think <em>Suikoden </em>is so remarkable because it does something the original <em>Star Wars</em> movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things.</p><p>With a huge cast of 108 recruitable characters, not all of them have a big impact on the story. Not all of them are usable in combat. But they all fill a role in this community that you build. And so you have people who are rising up. They’re sort of powerless. There’s one woman you recruit sorta late into the game, and she’s in a poor town. She just washes clothes. She’s a washer woman. But she joins your party because she recognizes she can bring something to the community that does not exist. So she’s there with former generals of the enemy, powerful magic users – everybody across that gamut.&nbsp;</p><p>That is what war is, that is what conflict is in societies: Everybody has a role to play, everybody can bring something to that. You couldn’t do that with just a cast of nine people. You’d have to give them each a defined role in the game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think what the Final Fantasies of the world do is, they get you really invested in your main character. You have this sunk cost fallacy of “Well, if my main character’s in there, he’s the important one. He’s where I put all my gear, all my stuff, all my things.” It gets in the way of storytelling, I find. In <em>Live A Live</em>, you get a completely different perspective because they don’t give you enough time to have that sense of possession over your character. <em>Saga Frontier</em> is like a bunch of little eight-hour RPGs that all intersect with each other. Oh, <em>Chrono Cross</em>! That has 49 characters in it. It’s not the same [as <em>Suikoden</em>], but you get a lot of perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there’s something powerful about this thing that really limits a lot of RPG storytelling, which is “You’re the special boy.” It makes the investment in a character hurt more, like with Aerith [from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>], but it also means you can’t have characters really die or live. <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, in the second act, whether or not you get those characters [after the world ends] is one of the reasons why it’s one of my favorites. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> – all these things. There’s a malleability to RPGs that you don’t usually see. <em>Suikoden </em>is weird, and I like a weird game.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aidan: </strong>It is a weird game, and it allows you to have that sort of agency within that experience, because it’s weird. It allows you to explore war in the way that you want to or what makes sense to you. That’s how you construct your party. A lot of people nowadays get caught up in the idea that there’s 108 characters, and you’ve gotta get all of them, and the only correct way to play the game is to collect every character.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The Pokemon mentality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Aidan:</strong> Exactly. And you get a special ending if you collect all 108 characters; there’s incentive for it. But [creator] Yoshitaka Murayama’s intent was always for people to go through the game and miss characters. So Nathan, you, Chris, and me would all end up with a different assortment of community – a different community we built up around ourselves. That was always the intent. Conflict and community is what you build up around yourself.</p><p>Secondarily to that, and kind of getting back to what Chris was talking about with scope, Jason [Schreier] likes to liken <em>Suikoden </em>to <em>Game of Thrones</em>, the <em>Game of Thrones</em> of JRPGs. But <em>Suikoden</em> actually predates the first <em>Game of Thrones</em> book, which I think is really remarkable. And I think it speaks to a lot of what was going on not just in video games, but epic fantasy at the time – that we were seeing this big explosion of scope where bringing in many, many viewpoints and looking at conflict through many eyes became important to fantasy. </p><p>In the ‘80s we saw a lot of sword and sorcery-style adventure fantasy. Raymond Feist, Terry Brooks. And then in the ‘90s we started to get the <em>Wheel of Times</em> and <em>Game of Thrones</em> that tried to do the same thing <em>Suikoden </em>was doing, which was [to] show that this is complex. There are many, many different sides and motivations. Sometimes they’re at odds. Sometimes they cross over. Sometimes they cross over for a little bit, and then they get pulled apart. I think that holds up really well in these games – even now, even though they’re 30 years old.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification"><h3>Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This</h3></a><p>I thought it was just, you know, a learning app</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/14/people-can-fly-is-developing-project-delta-based-on-a-sony-owned-ip/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer People Can Fly has confirmed that they have entered into an agreement with Sony Interactive Entertainment, producing a prototype of a new video game codenamed Project Delta that is based on an IP owned by Sony.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of unknowns here, of course, and while the wording seems to imply that PCF is creating a new game based on established IP – and this is also described as ‘work for hire’ contract – it can also be read to mean that Sony will own the IP of whatever PCF create. At this point, Project Delta is just a prototype project, though Sony is funding the production at this stage – as is typical for this kind of work – and it’s obviously hoped that they will get the greenlight at each stage of development to continue.</p>


<p>Given the codename of Project Delta, though, why not rampantly speculate that this is a SOCOM reboot? Delta would obviously be an allusion to Delta Force, which is a unit of SOCOM.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as part of an investor report, with People Can Fly a publicly listed company on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It’s similar to why we have such detailed disclosures and roadmaps from independent studios like CD Projekt Red and Remedy Entertainment.</p>
<p>The company has numerous codenamed projects in development though recently had to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">step back from self-publishing efforts with Project Victoria and Bifrost, leading to layoffs</a>. However, they are working on Project Gemini with Square Enix, Project Echo with Krafton and has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/28/people-can-fly-confirmed-as-gears-of-war-e-day-co-developers/">confirmed as co-developed on Gears of War E-Day</a> (formerly Project Maverick).</p>

<p>Here’s a translation of <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-raport-biezacy-nr-4-2025-zawarcie-pda-z-sony-delta-final.pdf">PCF’s investor report</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Management Board of PCF Group S.A. with its registered office in Warsaw (the “Company”) hereby informs that on March 13, 2025, the Company entered into a production agreement (Prototype Development Agreement) (the “Production Agreement”) with Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC, with its registered office in San Mateo, California, United States of America (the “Publisher”), regarding cooperation in the production of a prototype of a new video game codenamed Project Delta (the “Product”), based on intellectual property rights belonging to Publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>The Production Agreement provides that work on the Product will be carried out in the so-called work-for-hire model, i.e. work performed by the Company as a developer on behalf of and for the Publisher, in return for which the Company will receive an agreed remuneration from the Publisher.</em></p>
<p><em>In accordance with the Production Agreement, work on the Product will be divided into stages (milestones). Detailed terms of cooperation between the parties regarding the implementation and payment for subsequent stages (milestones) have been specified in the annex to the Production Agreement (milestone schedule).</em></p>
<p><em>The scope and provisions of the Production Agreement do not differ substantially from the provisions of production agreements typically concluded for such projects.</em></p>
<p><em>The conclusion of the Production Agreement is in line with the update of the Company’s Strategy and the People Can Fly capital group announced by the Company on 31 January 2023, according to which if attractive opportunities for cooperation with renowned partners in the work-for-hire model arise, the Company will take advantage of them.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/630176/ashly-burch-sony-ai-horizon-aloy-tech-demo-sag-aftra-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Ashly Burch, the award-winning voice and performance actor behind <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>’s Aloy — one of the most prominent characters on PlayStation today — has some news and some very strong thoughts about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype">the leaked Sony experiment that saw her character voiced and performed by AI technology</a> instead of her or any other human being.</p></div><p>The video, originally shared with <em>The Verge</em> by a tipster and later pulled off YouTube by a copyright enforcement company that counts Sony PlayStation as a client, was of an internal prototype — not necessarily something that’s in production for actual games. Burch says <em>Horizon</em> developer Guerilla proactively confirmed to her that it is <em>not</em> actively in development. Nor did it use her voice or facial data, Guerilla claimed. </p><p>But Burch says having seen the demo, she is worried, and not just about her own career. “I feel worried about this art form,” she says. You can watch her video immediately below, or scroll down for a transcript. </p><p>The transcript:</p><div><blockquote><p>Hi. Let’s talk about AI Aloy. I saw the tech demo earlier this week. Guerilla reached out to me to let me know that the demo didn’t reflect anything that was actively in development. They didn’t use any of my performance for the demo, so none of my facial or voice data. And Guerilla owns Aloy as a character.</p><p>So all that said, I feel worried. And not worried about Guerilla specifically or <em>Horizon</em> or my performance or my career specifically, even. I feel worried about this art form. Game performance as an art form.</p><p>We are currently on strike. SAG-AFTRA is on strike against video games because of AI. Because this technology exists, because we know that game companies want to use it, we’re asking for protections.</p><p>So currently what we’re fighting for is that you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form. You have to compensate us fairly and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double.</p><p>And I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Because of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements.</p><p>I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it. That does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse.</p><p>They wouldn’t have any protections. Any way to fight back. And that possibility… it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart. It scares me.</p><p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances.</p><p>I want to be able to continue, to do this job, and if we don’t win, then that future is really compromised.</p></blockquote></div><p>In a slightly longer TikTok version of the video, which we’ve embedded above to replace the original Instagram copy, Burch adds that “I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast, certainly not Guerilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology is not the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike, and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.”</p><p>It’s unusual for performers who have such a close relationship with game companies to speak out like this, but we’re also in an unusual moment: as she points out, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24213808/video-game-voice-actor-strike-sag-aftra">video game actors are on strike right now, specifically because of AI</a><em>, </em>and the very idea that a company like Sony is explicitly building and demonstrating ways to potentially replace actors like Burch is exactly what the striking workers fear.</p><p>In addition to starring in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, Burch has had minor roles in other Sony games including <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em>, but is otherwise best known for playing Chloe Price in the <em>Life Is Strange</em> games, Tiny Tina in <em>Borderlands</em>, and from the live-action D&amp;D roleplaying series <em>Critical Role</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21177373/ashly-burch-interview-mythic-quest">Apple TV Plus’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, where she also serves as a writer.</p><p><em><strong>Update, March 14th:</strong></em> <em>Swapped Instagram video for Burch’s longer uncut TikTok video and added its additional context.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Nintendo Power was a popular staple of '90s gaming culture, offering not just insight into upcoming Nintendo video games, but also various comics based on many of the Big N's franchises. One of its most popular comics was Super Mario Adventures, which ran in the magazine from 1992 through 1993. The comic strip followed Mario and Luigi as they attempt to rescue Princess Toadstool from the clutches of Bowser. If you've ever wanted to revisit the comic, the full Super Mario Adventures series is available as a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standalone graphic novel</a>, and right now, it's on sale for <strong>one of the best prices we've seen in years</strong>.</p><div title="6530137 - Super Mario Adventures Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3258" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530137 - Super Mario Adventures Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura\/dp\/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Super Mario Adventures (Paperback)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura\/dp\/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Adventures-Kentaro-Takemura/dp/1421588641?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$10.55 (was $17)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Super Mario Adventures is a full-color graphic novel inspired by the video game series.

            <p>
Fireproof Games - the studio behind eerie puzzle box adventure The Room and its equally stellar sequels - has announced a launch date for its paranormal VR mystery Ghost Town. It's coming to Meta Quest on 24th April, with a PCVR/PSVR2 release due later this year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town, if you're unfamiliar, whisks players back to 1983, where they'll take on the role of ghost hunter Edith Penrose. Edith runs a successful paranormal detective agency in London with her flatmate and, as Fireproof puts it, "she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual."
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing - and so begins a quest to locate his whereabouts, first taking her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, and later through the supernatural underbelly of London.

<p>
All this unfolds across "large navigable environments" where players will interact with fully motion-captured characters, both alive and dead. "Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," Fireproof explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p>
<p>
Fireproof's The Room series was an absolute pleasure, blending cleverly tactile head scratchers with some deliciously sinister atmospherics - and the studio's most recent game, 2020's The Room VR: A Dark Matter, was a particular highlight. So I'm genuinely excited to see how Ghost Town plays out. And with a <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">24th April release on Meta Quest</a> now confirmed (and PSVR2/<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">PCVR</a> to follow), there isn't much longer to wait.

            <p>
It's been almost a year since Saber Interactive last shared an update on its long-in-the-works and reportedly troubled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> remake. But despite the ensuing radio silence, it's now insisting, "Everything that we have talked about is still in development."
</p>
<p>
A Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announced-for-ps5">first announced for PlayStation 5 and PC</a> back in 2021, with developer Aspyr at the helm. Since then, however, the project has been dogged by rumours of difficulties behind-the-scenes, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-in-serious-trouble-and-delayed-indefinitely">report in 2022 claiming it was "in serious trouble"</a> and "delayed indefinitely".
</p>
<p>
Shortly after that report, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-aaa-project-has-switched-studios-following-report-of-kotor-trouble">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine developer Saber Interactive had taken over development duties</a>, but still nothing has been seen of the project since its initial unveiling. More <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-reportedly-not-in-active-development">reports of its apparent demise</a> surfaced in 2023 - although those were quickly rebuffed - and the project's future was called into question again last year when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-to-sell-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-developer-saber">Saber Interactive split with parent company Embracer Group</a>.

<figcaption>Here's how the KOTOR remake was announced back in 2021.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p82vauAdgv8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Saber's most recent comments on KOTOR came last April, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kotor-remake-alive-and-well-says-saber-interactive-ceo">company boss Matthew Karch insisted the remake was "alive and well"</a> - but with almost a year of radio silence now past since then, doubts have begun spreading through the fan community again. All of which brings us to the present, and Saber's latest tacit assurances the KOTOR remake remains in development.
</p>
<p>
Following this week's news that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-already-in-the-works-and-its-promising-an-even-more-immersive-experience">Saber is now starting up development on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 3</a>, studio chief creative officer Tim Willits <a href="https://x.com/TimWillits/status/1900374508113961250">took to social media to reassure fans</a> that it's other announced games remain unaffected. "Saber Interactive is one of the largest independent developers in the world," Willits wrote. "We are working on numerous games across many different genres. Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share."
</p>
<p>
That, then, bodes well for the ever-elusive KOTOR remake, but it's far from the only game previously confirmed to be in development at Saber. The studio is also working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-carpenters-toxic-commando-is-a-co-op-fps-with-80s-vibes-action-humour-and-horror">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-park-survival-will-revisit-locations-from-1993-film-but-also-introduce-new-ones">Jurassic Park Survival</a>, both scheduled to launch this year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-new-turok-game">new Turok</a> and Avatar: The Last Airbender games also on the way.
</p>
<p>
And as for the newly announced Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 3, that sounds like it's still some considerable way out. The studio has said it still plans to support Space Marine 2 "in the coming years" while it continues work on its "even more immersive" sequel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gdc-2025-travel-visa-san-francisco-donald-trump-mahmoud-khalil<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As far as statements of intent go, it’s hard to make a more definitive one than what the Trump administration has done to Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil: <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-protester-mahmoud-khalil-immigration-arrest-5ae6eeb3ac95f190a505abebc4ee0944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">snatching a legal US resident</a> away from his family, stripping him of his rights, and detaining him with intent to deport, all for the non-crime of exercising his First Amendment rights by helping lead protests against Israel’s genocide of Palestinians. This follows previous weeks in which the Trump administration passed down <a href="https://aftermath.site/kennedy-center-nea-trans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous anti-trans edicts</a>, made moves to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-quest-conquer-canada-confusing-everyone-rcna195657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annex Canada</a>, imposed tariffs that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/14/investing/stocks-trump-wall-street-tariffs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threaten to crash the US economy</a>, and began an ongoing project to <a href="https://aftermath.site/elon-musk-treasury-protest-diablo-path-of-exile-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismantle the federal government</a>. You can understand, then, why some game developers would be hesitant to enter the United States, even if it means missing out on career-defining opportunities.</p><p>The annual Game Developers Conference takes place next week in San Francisco, and while the event has received <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/27/23679081/gdc-2023-price-affordability-game-developers-conference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ample criticism for prohibitively high prices</a> and other accessibility issues over the years, it remains an important event for developers from all over the world to gather, network, and share knowledge. But as of the past few weeks, some developers are canceling their plans to attend.</p><p>"I had flight tickets, hotel, and pass all lined up and decided to cancel last week due to the possibility of being turned around at the border for being trans – which according to a recent <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/5189226-texas-bill-transgender-rights-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">memo</a> can be considered fraud," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/loa-gunnars.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lóa Gunnars</a>, an independent game designer and educator based out of Reykjavík, Iceland told Aftermath. "I’ve been planning [to attend GDC] for about four months, and [it] would have been my 10th year there. ... GDC is incredibly valuable to me. I studied game design [at] NYU, and GDC is my main way of staying connected to the North American game industry, a place where I meet old friends and make new connections."</p><figure><blockquote><p>In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In other cases, more specific headlines generated by the Trump administration’s smash-and-grab tactics have developers un-packing their bags. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rami Ismail</a>, an indie developer, speaker, and consultant formerly of Vlambeer, told Aftermath that immigration agents' abduction of pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil solidified his decision to keep his distance from a conference he's been critical of in the past.</p><p>"I can barely get into the US under the Democrats," Ismail said. "The Republicans are straight up disappearing people, mate. I'm Egyptian. I know what disappearing is: Little van shows up, gone you are. In the Republican US, they could grab me and make me go away, and nobody would be able to do shit even if they tried. I think if anyone with Western privilege would be worried about going to Egypt, they should now be equally worried about going to the US. These things are random, unfair, and without recourse."</p><p>Others, like <em>Subnautica Below Zero</em>, <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry</em> writer <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jillmurray.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jill Murray</a>, who is based in Montreal, are maintaining a healthy distance from the increasingly bad ol’ US of A out of senses of both solidarity and self-preservation.</p><p>"[The breaking point] was seeing how afraid trans and BIPOC friends were of crossing the border. I take it seriously and don’t really want to go where they can’t go," Murray told Aftermath. "My biggest personal factor is that I’ve been self employed for a very long time, and that can make me face more questioning. With a trade war on, it doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry."&nbsp;</p><p>Vivid Foundry founder Tanya Kan and game trailer maker Gary J Kings, two developers who are residents of Canada, kicked off a discussion of the difficult choice many international developers face in regard to GDC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garyjkings.bsky.social/post/3lk6w64e4os2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Bluesky</a>. Both cancelled their plans this week after hearing the story of Becky Burke, a British tourist who’s been <a href="https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article301877574.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detained in an ICE facility for two weeks</a> due to visa issues, unable to voluntarily return home. Burke’s father has called the situation <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2025/03/11/british-tourist-detained-us-canada/82267160007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a nightmare.”</a></p><p>"[Burke's] case highlights the system's cruelty by detaining her in inhumane conditions,” Kan told Aftermath. “From there we looked at other factors and came to the conclusion that the political climate was devolving too rapidly for us to not feel anxious whilst needing to be in our top form at GDC."</p><figure><blockquote><p>It doesn’t feel like the risk is warranted – even if I’m facing mounting pressures to network, given the overall situation of the industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Trump’s escalating trade war with Canada – the goal of which sure seems to be annexation of a sovereign nation – has many Canadians bunkering down on their side of the border.</p><p>"The straw that broke the camel's back was the President's constant and repeated economic and military threats to Canada, including tariffs and especially annexation," BancyCo co-founder <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminrivers.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Rivers</a> told Aftermath. "Since a vast swath of Canadian businesses have decided to remove American products and pivot to non-American services, and citizens are increasingly opting out of travelling to the US, we thought it was only prudent to do the same. So instead of attending events like GDC or PAX, we've opted to spend our marketing budget on events in Canada, Europe, and Asia."</p><p>Rivers by no means relishes having to steer clear of a country where many friends reside, but in times of political upheaval, safe is far preferable to sorry.</p><p>"We know that American friends and colleagues don't support what the government is doing, and we'll dearly miss meeting them at events like GDC,” he said. “But it seems insane to travel to a country that has all but declared you its enemy, and in which random innocent travelers are already being detained, so we've opted to not cross that border for the foreseeable future."</p><p>Conditions, unfortunately, do not look to be improving, even in supposed liberal strongholds like California, which finds itself under the shaky stewardship of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/14/gavin-newsom-steve-bannon-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">right-wing-guest-hosting</a> podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom. What, if anything, can GDC and other, similar events do? Most developers believe the obvious answer is the best, fraught with logistical concerns though it might be: move.</p><p>"It might help a bit if the GDC talks were live [streamed] so at least it’s possible to follow along online conversations. But even when they did for covid it just [wasn't] the same; active participation during talks and the mingling between events are the important bits," said Gunnars. "A more central Europe conference [might be GDC's best bet]? I’m not sure why GDC Europe never held the same appeal."</p><figure><blockquote><p>I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.</p></blockquote></figure><p>“It would be nice to see the industry decide to convene elsewhere on a rotating basis,” said Murray. “I hope there’s an opportunity here for other conferences to grow, and for international organizers to reach out to each other and combine resources and ideas to capture some of that magnetic mass attraction GDC has always had. I don’t think the industry in the US has had to grapple with the possibility of becoming less central before, but I think it’s a real possibility now.”&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how quickly things are accelerating, the fact is that the current climate in the US didn’t come out of nowhere. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chhopsky.tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Pollock</a>, a developer who's worked on series like <em>Call of Duty</em> and has, at various points, resided in Brisbane, San Francisco, and Vancouver, told Aftermath that she’s faced visa issues when it comes to entering the US since 2020. She’s not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>"Every year we hear the same story from developers from all around the world that two things hold them back from GDC: the cost of visiting SF and difficulty with US visas,” Pollock said. “Plenty of other North American industry conventions successfully rotate through cities and venues. SIGGRAPH, NANOG et al have had successful events in Canada. … If GDC is willing to break away from its home venue and look towards Toronto or Vancouver, I think they'll find that organizing events internationally isn't nearly as difficult as people might think. The game industry is already a global community; our premiere conference should reflect that."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-suikoden-book-boss-fight"><h3>The Suikoden Series Is As Relevant As Ever</h3></a><p>"It does something the original Star Wars movies did really well, which is showing normal people doing exceptional things"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification"><h3>Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This</h3></a><p>I thought it was just, you know, a learning app</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
