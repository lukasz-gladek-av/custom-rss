            <p>Careful, Doom fans - details of Doom: The Dark Ages have leaked ahead of its release next week.</p>
<p>As posted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kiyzhc/doom_the_dark_ages_screenshot_leak/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, some players have received their discs ahead of the 15th May street date, which means details are popping up all over the place now, including information about the plot, menus, combat, weapons, beastiary, and more.</p>

<p>"Hey dudes, I got lucky and got the [Collector's Edition on] the 8th and just finished this amazing game, what a trip. This will have spoilers, so it's up to you if you want to get spoiled," one player wrote, before individually linking dozens and dozens of screenshots with spoilers a-plenty.</p>
<p>The early shipping has also identified something else, too; it seems as though even with a physical disc, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kighkz/doom_the_dark_ages_the_entire_game_in_the/">PS5 players have to be connected to the internet and download the entire game to their consoles</a> before they can play.</p>
<p>As reportedly verified by <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html">ppe.pl</a>, "the disc for Doom: The Dark Ages contains nothing but the data necessary to trigger a download of the game from the internet. This means PS5 owners hoping to step into the Doom Slayer’s boots should be prepared to download over 80 GB - the full size of the game."</p>
<p>"Literal waste of materials," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kighkz/comment/mrelxmr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">responded</a> one commenter. "This is just profoundly stupid."</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Eurogamer's Doom: the Dark Ages review</a>, Chris D. awarded it four stars out of five, writing: "It's all so simple, so joyously, generously straight ahead. You're a powerful goody, you're surrounded by powerful baddies, and you have to finish them all off. Everyone knows where they stand, and they all seem pretty happy with the roles they're playing. And it's kind of lovely."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Amazon's hit Fallout show will run for five or six seasons.</p>
<p>That's according to actor Aaron Moten, who revealed in an interview at Comic Con Liverpool that when he signed on for the role of Maximus, he was told to expect the show to run for "five, six" seasons in total.</p>

<p>"When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the end point," Moten explained (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fallout-tv-show-six-five-seasons-of-story-planned/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"That endpoint hasn't changed, but it is season five, season six, type of endpoint. We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters."</p>
<p>Given Fallout's rich lore across several games, this may not be a complete surprise, but it's good news nonetheless, as it assures Fallout fans that the show was created with longevity in mind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/11/wolf-hawkfield-revealed-for-new-virtua-fighter-project-and-a-new-focus-on-storytelling/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/virtua-fighter">New Virtua Fighter Project</a> still deep in development, the team at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio shared a new glimpse of what they’ve been working on, and revealed a returning character.</p>
<p>Wolf Hawkfield is back, and he’s sporting a whole new look, which Art Director&nbsp;Ryo Shibasaki digs into.</p>
<p><iframe title="ART DIRECTING VIRTUA FIGHTER | English Subtitles" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_5IqA9CuD9Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s not much more news about the next Virtua Fighter, but Producer Riichiro Yamad talked more about how this game will delve much deeper into the characters and their backstories, including returning legends from previous entries. It won’t be origin stories, necessarily, but will reveal some of the motivations that they have for fighting, what happened to them between games, and tie in with the character designs in general. This is all something that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio wanted to bring into the series,</p>
<p>Art Director Ryo Shibasaki also spoke about how Hawk’s design is that of a wrestler who still performs, evolving his look to be cool and with a “heel” atmosphere to him. He definitely looks the part, with the ammo belt belt, the heavy tattooing, and the older looking face and skin that really gives that ageing wrestling star vibe.</p>

<p>Prior to this, the last we saw of the game was Akira and Sarah Bryant going fighting, and with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/07/new-virtua-fighter-project-pre-development-concept-video/">a pre-production video in January</a>, a pair of Akira battling.</p>
<p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has become a lynchpin studio for Sega over the last few years. You’ll know them best as the studio behind the hugely popular <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-latest-trailer-reveal-naval-combat/">Yakuza/Like A Dragon</a> series, but as broad as that series has become, they’ve also handled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/">recent Super Monkey Ball games</a> as well. Given that Yakuza’s own combat was a hand-me-down from Shenmue, which was in turn fed a branch off from Virtua Fighter, this makes them the perfect team to take the series’ reins.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the team confirmed that, after a well-received revamp of the last game for PC, Virtua Fighter 5 REVO is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At the beginning of the month, things weren’t looking good for gaming site <em>Giant Bomb</em> after its <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">content was put on hold</a> amid reports of editorial interference from its parent company, Fandom. Today, some feel-good news: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/giantbomb.bsky.social/post/3lou2vs2v2c2t"><em>Giant Bomb</em> announced</a> it is now an independent, employee-owned entity.</p><p>“Giant Bomb lives! Fandom has sold the site to us,” the outlet wrote on Bluesky yesterday evening. In a <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/join">post on its website</a> about the new development, the <em>Giant Bomb</em> says it’s “not serving an algorithm or executives,” and that it aims “to lean into what’s always made Giant Bomb special, and that’s the people you see and hear on our content, and our extremely passionate community.”</p><p>The site also announced a <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/get-premium/">new subscription model</a>, which it says “will go directly towards maintaining and growing Giant Bomb and paying the fine folks that you see on our programming week after week.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Games media has changed dramatically since Giant Bomb launched in 2008, and our new model aims to evolve with the times. We want people to be able to see our content whether they’re able to support us monetarily or not, so the large majority of what we put out will be available for free. That’s how Fortnite works, right? The kids love Fortnite. Dan Ryckert skin coming soon!</p></blockquote></div><p><em>Giant Bomb</em> sums up its new monthly ($9.99 per month) and annual ($99.99 per year) subscriptions:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you sign up today, you’ll get ad-free RSS feeds for all of our podcasts and access to premium-only Discord channels (like behind-the-scenes, Town Hall Q&amp;As, and more). We are going to launch very simple and we will grow and adjust from there. This all finally came together literally hours ago, and we couldn’t even update the language on the sign up page yet. The perks are a little different from what’s listed there, so If you have any questions, reach out on social and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can. For example, our Discord verification process might be slow, so bear with us for now!</p></blockquote></div><p>The news feels like a pleasant combo-breaker after the May 1st one-two punch news of <em>Giant Bomb</em>’s content pause and <em>Verge</em> parent company Vox Media’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant">sale of gaming site <em>Polygon </em>to Valnet</a>, a media company that’s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250425504752/en/Valnet-Inc.-and-its-CEO-File-Lawsuit-Against-The-Wrap-News-Inc.-for-Defamation-Unfair-Competition-and-Other-Illegal-Actions">suing <em>TheWrap</em></a> over its <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">damning report</a> of accusations of “almost sweatshop-level” working conditions.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What had been a closed beta test for Funcom's upcoming Dune Awakening is now available to everyone who has pre-ordered the game, not just those lucky enough to have bagged a code.</p>
<p>In a message posted to social media, Funcom confirmed that has "had heard [the] feedback" from fans surprised a pre-order wasn't enough to secure a beta key, and now anyone who has ordered the MMO "can now also access the beta" which is live now and due to close tomorrow, Monday 12th May.</p>

<p>"We heard your feedback on this, "the studio said.

<p>Dune: Awakening has been in closed beta for over a year now, but with its full release now looming following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-delayed-for-last-minute-changes-from-beta-testers">brief delay</a>, this final, large-scale beta blowout will run from 9th-12th May. The studio is calling it Dune: Awakening's "largest beta yet... with a huge number of new players joining compared to previous closed betas".</p>
<p>It's likely the studio acquisced after players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1kfzht6/have_people_been_informed_that_they_are_in_the/">game's subreddit and Discord complained</a> about not getting access to the latest beta despite having pre-ordered the MMO.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/664492/clair-obscur-expedition-33-twist-spoilers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>is my favorite game of the year so far, with an exhilarating battle system, excellent exploration, and a haunting soundtrack. But I’m not the only one who loves it: the game has become a huge hit, with more than 2 million copies sold just 12 days after <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3loiolfljys25">its late April release</a>. “It feels very surreal,” says Guillaume Broche, Sandfall Interactive’s CEO and creative director.</p><p>According to Broche, the game is performing “far beyond expectations” and that the team was not expecting it to “blow up” as fast as it did. “We are still in denial, basically” he says. Lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen adds, “I’m going to wake up tomorrow and this is all a joke, right?”</p><p>A major part of <em>Expedition 33</em>’s success is its gripping story. It kept me coming back to the game every moment I could just to see what happened next. The opening hits you with a gutpunch. Playing as Gustave, voiced by <em>Daredevil</em>’s Charlie Cox, you learn about the tragic circumstances of the world, its characters, and the annual “Gommage” that makes everyone of a certain age disappear in a flurry of petals when a giant being called the Paintress paints a new, lower number on a giant monolith.</p><p>Gustave is one of the next Expeditioners that will strike out and attempt to take down the Paintress, and that team also includes Maelle, a teenager who he is responsible for. But he also loses an ex, Sophie, to the Gommage after the Paintress paints a 33.</p><p>It’s a powerful, emotional opening, and it got me interested in <em>Expedition 33</em> right away. But there was a key scene later on that shifted the game’s story from good to great for me — and I got to talk to Brocke and Svedberg-Yen all about it.</p><p><strong>Spoilers ahead. Don’t scroll past this picture unless you want to read about a major plot development.</strong></p><p>If you chose to keep scrolling, the moment I’m talking about is at the end of Act 1.</p><p>The mysterious white-haired man who massacred much of Expedition 33 earlier in the story appears after an intense boss fight. Without warning, the man stabs Gustave with a gigantic sword, and after a brief battle, stabs him again, killing him — and all right in front of Maelle, who is trapped in a dome of magical energy that renders her helpless.</p><p>When it happened in my playthrough, my jaw was on the floor. <em>Expedition 33</em> had so far portrayed Gustave as the protagonist, and I figured he had the plot armor to make it all the way to the end so that he could get closure on losing Sophie. (Heck, they cast Charlie Cox, who also plays a Marvel superhero, to voice him!) But within hours of the game’s opening, Gustave was gone.</p><p>“It’s where the story needed to go,” Svedberg-Yen says. For the narrative and themes that the team was going for, “it’s what was most organic.”</p><p>“One of the main themes of the story is very obviously grief,” Broche says. In order to make a game about grief feel true, the team wanted players to “go through the horror that the characters are going through,” he adds. “It just made sense to inflict the pain on the player as strongly as the characters receive.”</p><p>Broche says that actually playing as the character creates a deep link and attachment. “Losing that is the hole that the characters in the game experience basically every year with the Gommage, and it’s something here that just felt true to the game and the narrative.”</p><p>The scene is brilliantly crafted to make the death feel impactful. After the boss fight and before the white-haired man’s appearance, I had relaxed — I figured I would get a nice, post-fight cutscene of celebration before moving on to the next thing. But the surprise of what happened next and the powerful performances from the motion capture actors and the voice actors made the scene memorable and powerful.</p><p>I was particularly struck by the killing blow: after the white-haired man stabs Gustave, the game goes into slow motion to pause on that moment, on Maelle’s horror, and on Gustave’s armband emblazoned with “33,” which Sophie put on him shortly before she Gommaged.</p><p>To me, it felt reminiscent of Aerith’s death in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, but Broche and Svedberg-Yen say that wasn’t intentional. “If people find some similarities, it’s not actually conscious from us,” Broche says. (Svedberg-Yen said she hasn’t actually played <em>FF7</em>, so I apologized for spoiling Aerith’s death.)</p><p>Gustave’s final words are powerful, too: “For those who come after, right?” It’s a motto used by the Expeditioners to acknowledge the purpose and futility of their mission, and throughout act one, it becomes something of a catchphrase for Gustave. But in the moments before the killing blow, he seems to know what’s coming, and he says it as he gives a heartbreaking look to Maelle — who will have to grapple on her own with whatever comes after — before making his final attack. “That’s his whole character,” Broche says of the line.</p><p>The motto itself has broader meaning, too. “We really wanted to hone in on the idea that they are part of a larger tradition, that they are one expedition in a chain,” Svedberg-Yen says. “So we really wanted to figure out a way to encapsulate that.”</p><p>Like the rest of <em>Expedition 33</em>’s most impactful moments, what makes the scene work is a combination of elements — writing, performance, music, and more — that merge together to create moments I can’t stop thinking about, even when they don’t feature a dramatic and unexpected death. “When we think about the storytelling, it’s all the teams together — that whole package — that really made it come alive,” Svedberg-Yen says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, if there’s one issue that continues to crop up, it’s performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-revisited-profound-problems-have-yet-to-be-addressed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry has run an extensive analysis on Oblivion Remastered on all console platforms</a> and found the game to have significant problems across the board. DF’s Thomas Morgan said of Virtuos’ Unreal Engine 5 overhaul:</p><blockquote>No platform is spared of issues: whether it's PS5, PS5 Pro, or either Xbox Series machine, all struggle with traversal hitches while roaming the open world. Secondly, there's major sub-60fps frame-rates, where I've also discovered that performance slowly degrades with more playing time - quite possibly down to a memory leak. And finally, software freezes are the icing on the cake, with all PlayStation and Xbox platforms crashing to the system menu on loading a save one too many times.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">How does this manifest itself in-game? According to DF, a “charged” playthrough with more continuous play time behind it performs worse than a fresh boot. Cycling through saves also introduces bugs in the charged play through, Morgan revealed. And this is particularly curious: this also leads to the camera position being too high while riding horseback. You can fix this by resetting the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The discovery of performance degrading over time as a result of a potential memory leak is of particular concern. The crashes on loading a save too many times is a significant issue, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hope of course is that Bethesda addresses these problems sooner rather than later, especially as players spend more time with the expansive fantasy role-playing game and are more likely to run into these performance problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a dire position for any remaster to be in and developer Virtuos needs to address the game's stability - the crashes - as a priority,” Morgan continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Foundry asks some tough questions in its analysis, suggesting Oblivion Remastered was “rushed to market.” There also seems to be a discrepancy between versions, with a hotfix released for Xbox Series X so far unavailable for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a damning assessment of Oblivion on console, but what about PC? DF had already issued its analysis of the PC version, calling its performance “dire.” It’s worth checking out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-oblivion-remastered-is-one-of-the-worst-performing-pc-games-weve-ever-tested" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DF’s analysis in full</a> for more.</p><div id="ranking-the-best-races-in-oblivion" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3><h3>Ranking the Best Races in Oblivion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the performance issues, Oblivion Remastered is a hit. It became the third best-selling game of 2025 in the U.S. after just one week on sale, having shadow-dropped on April 22. Oblivion Remastered trails only Monster Hunter: Wilds and Assassin’s Creed: Shadows at the top of the 2025 sales chart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oblivion Remastered, developed by remake specialist Virtuos using Unreal Engine 5, has a long list of visual and feature improvements. It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation, and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology. The changes are going down well with fans, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>some of whom believe Oblivion Remastered would be more accurately described as a remake</u></a>.

Right, sorry parents that proudly put their kids' borderline impressionist drawings on the fridge, there's a new bare minimum you have to meet. If you're not turning your child's drawings into full on video games, then I'm sorry to say you're not doing a good enough job. This doesn't apply to Artur Latkovsky, though, who is quite literally doing that with his game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/odd-dorable">Odd Dorable</a> (I'm sure I don't need to explain the name to you), a game where every single bit of art in the game was made by his four-year-old daughter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, here's the thing: the art is very obviously something drawn by a four-year-old. You're not going to boot Odd Dorable up and think "wow, she's only four and she drew this?" It so clearly was! And yet, it is immediately, infinitely charming because it is raw, unfiltered art made by someone that doesn't have any preconceived notions of, well, presumably just about most things.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1kee9op/i_am_working_on_a_game_made_from_my_daughters/">I am working on a game made from my daughter’s drawings</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/acem13/">u/acem13</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/">indiegames</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Latkovsky describes it as an "open-world exploration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game" where you have to help a princess find all her lost candies. I can't quite tell you what those puzzles will be like, details are pretty light, but given the involvement of a literal child in the developmental process, I'm going to assume they're not going to be all that complicated. 
</p>
<p>
The real hook here is the improvisational nature of it all. Latkovsky explained in a Reddit post that he even tries to get art drawn by his daughter on concrete into the game. Another example is that his daughter drew a dinosaur with fairy wings who is guarding a space rocket, so of course that gets added in. I mean, isn't this every child's dream? To tell someone all of the ridiculous ideas you have and they make them real? Good stuff, even if the kid is technically being paid in candies according to Latkovsky.
</p>
<p>
It'll also be quite a short game, capping out at around an hour, purposefully designed to be "digestible", so don't expect too much from it when it apparently arrives in September this year. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3690890/Odd_Dorable/">here</a> if you're as charmed as I am.

            <p>
Horror asymmetric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary later this year, an amount of time so large it really makes you think "man, most live service devs should have had the foresight to make their game a decade ago, huh?" With that anniversary approaching imminently, developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/behaviour-interactive">Behaviour Interactive</a> held a year nine anniversary broadcast where there was one reveal that'll have you going "yeah that makes sense" and another where you'll say "ok, sure."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The first one is that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> villain Springtrap is coming to the game as a new killer, an addition that feels so obvious I'm not sure why it's taken this long. It seems like they're taking some cues from the movie for this one, as Matthew Lillard is actually reprising his role as the character from the film adaptation. Details like Springtrap's moveset and a release date are being withheld for an incoming livestream, but there's a legendary outfit planned alongside the Yellow Rabbit version from the film. Oh, and of course there'll be a map based on the Freddy Fazbear's restaurant too.

Here's the weird one: it's another collaboration, this time with The Witcher of all series. No, you won't be running around as Geralt or anything, it's coming in the form of a few costumes. Survivor Vittorio Toscano is getting an outfit based on Geralt's, with other outfits planned based on characters like Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. This one's just a bit odd! The Witcher games aren't horror, so it just feels a bit like suits swinging around properties they own just because they can.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that, a few other updates are planned throughout the rest of the year, with June seeing a rework of The Archives and adjusted gamma settings, alongside other updates further down the line allowing for more spectators in custom matches, rebalancing for map and key items, and a few other bits and pieces.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new chapter coming in 2026 where you (yes, even you) will be able to take part in a choose-your-own-adventure style activity to vote on different aspects of a new killer and survivor. TLDR: Lots on the way!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-the-board-game-buying-guide-and-expansions.1186233/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-the-board-game-buying-guide<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-monster-hunter-games">Monster Hunter franchise</a> is a phenomenon, accumulating critical and commercial acclaim and spanning dozens of main titles and spinoffs. The secret to its success is an addictive gameplay loop, where you battle huge and terrifying monsters to gain loot that, in turn, lets you acquire better gear and hunt bigger, badder beasties. It’s an easy loop to replicate on the tabletop and that’s exactly what Monster Hunter World: The Board Game does. Just like its parent franchise, however, it comes in a variety of flavors, so here’s what you need to find your feet in this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video game board game</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not one for blurbs, you can scroll through all the items in this article right here. However, if you'd like to know more about what's available and what comes in each box, read on for the goods.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Core Boxes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the core boxes is a standalone game, containing four hunters and four monsters for them to hunt. However, they can also be combined, allowing you to mix and match characters and their prey from different sets. The majority of the components in each box are specific to the hunters and monsters unique to that set, but there is some overlap, and each set contains a few extra cards that are only used if you’re combining with its opposite number. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As such, you’re probably best off with a single core box to start with and, if you get into the game, you can start by adding some of the smaller expansions, listed below, doubling up on a second core set in the event that you develop a passion for the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s not really any difference between the core sets in terms of quality. Both feature the same ruleset, the same compulsive loop and the same stratospheric levels of production quality, with gigantic monster miniatures that tower above the hunters for an awesome sense of scale. But the look and feel of each is quite different, so you’re best off just going whichever one appeals most aesthetically, or ties in with fond memories from the video game series.</p><p id="ancient-forest-core-box"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Ancient Forest - Core Box">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Ancient Forest</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220571"><div id="220571" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game: Ancient Forest</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you might expect from the title, the setting for this collection is a primeval forest. The game boards are a lush green and brown and the monsters are clearly inspired by dinosaurs and tropical animals. There’s the lizard-like Great Jagras, the furred and scaled Tobi-Kadachi, the fearsome tyrannosaur Anjanath and the huge dragon Rathalos. Setting out to take them down are the classically-armed hunters Great Sword, Sword and Shield, Dual Blades, and Bow.  </p></div><p id="wildspire-waste-core-box"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Wildspire Waste - Core Box">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Wildspire Waste</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220572"><div id="220572" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Wildspire Waste</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Wildspire Waste is a little more esoterically-named but the monsters and boards make clear that it’s a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Wildspire_Waste">badlands-type setting</a>, with a mixture of rocky outcrops, desert and swamp. The included creatures are the heavily-armored Barroth, monstrous swamp-fish Jyurados, the bird-like Pukei-Pukei, and underground behemoth Diablos which bears more than a passing resemblance to its demonic namesake. The hunters in this set are a little more bizarre, wielding Charge Blade, Switch Axe, Heavy Bowgun and Insect Glaive respectively.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Retail Expansions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As is often the case with Kickstarter-driven games, there were a slew of expansions available to pre-order at the same time. Most of these are still available at retail, however Nergigante is very hard to find and Teostra is  exclusive to the publisher, Steamforged games – both of them are currently available directly from their website.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nergigante, Kushala Daora and Teostra are all Elder Dragons, a new type of monster for you to hunt. They come with additional quest content for the base game, but perhaps most appealing of all they offer an extra, five-star difficulty level that’s a grade above any of the base game monsters, and the included miniature is a whole level bigger than any of their core box counterparts, too. That gives you an extra, mega-boss challenge to overcome and extends your campaign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While getting to fight an ultimate boss in a longer campaign might sound like the ideal way to extend your base game content, all these expansions are expensive, and many have features that only work with one core box or the other. For example, Daora has one special crafting weapon that fits a hunter from the Ancient Forest, and another for a hunter from the Wildspire Wastes. As such, picking up the second core set might well be your best first stop if you want additional content for your game.</p></div><p id="hunters-arsenal-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Hunter's Arsenal - Expansion">Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Hunter's Arsenal Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220573"><div id="220573" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Hunter's Arsenal Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This offers six new hunters, as usual named after their weapons, which are a mixture of the traditional and peculiar. You can choose from the Light Bowgun, the Long Sword (which is very long indeed), the Gunlance, the Hammer, the Lance and the Hunting Horn (which looks nothing like a horn). While cool dragons and other monsters are obviously appealing, in terms of adding variety to your games, this box gives you the biggest bang for your buck as you get six different new toys to play with, and six new upgrade paths to explore, rather than just one beastie. However, you’ll need both core sets to be able to fully utilize all six.</p></div><p id="nergigante-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Nergigante - Expansion">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Nergigante Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220574"><div id="220574" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Nergigante Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do want one single dragon to add to your campaign, this might be your best bet because it allows you to craft additional weapons for all the currently available characters, including all those from the core sets and the Hunter’s Arsenal. He’s also delightfully odd, a spiny colossus who grows vicious spikes to impale the hunters wherever he’s damaged.</p></div><p id="kushala-daora-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Kushala Daora - Expansion">Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Kushala Daora Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220575"><div id="220575" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World The Board Game: Kushala Daora Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Kushala_Daora">Kushala Daora</a> is a wind dragon, who buffets the hunters with powerful storms and he’s also got the biggest miniature in the range, with a foot-wide wingspan. As if beating such a behemoth wasn’t a tough enough fight in the first place, you’ll also have to fight through strong winds and tornado blasts just to even close with your quarry.</p></div><p id="teostra-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Teostra - Expansion">Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Teostra Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220576"><div id="220576" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World: The Board Game - Teostra Expansion</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the dragons, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/teostra">Teostra</a> might be the most familiar simply because it’s the classic fire dragon everyone knows and either loves or fears, possibly in equal measure. As you might expect that means a lot of ranged punishment from blasts and fireballs for anyone that dares trespass onto the dragon’s lair.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Exclusive Expansion</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This was originally only available as part of the Kickstarter campaign for the game. Expect to pay a hefty premium if you want to pick one up second-hand. However, there’s currently another chance to snag one thanks to the more recent Kickstarter campaign for the new Iceborne boxes, detailed below.</p></div><p id="kulu-ya-ku-expansion"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Kulu-Ya-Ku - Expansion">Monster Hunter World - Kulu-Ya-Ku Expansion</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220577"><div id="220577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World - Kulu-Ya-Ku</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This bizarre creature can pick things up in its dextrous claws, such as rocks to throw at intrepid hunters. In mechanical terms this not only gives it a missile attack but its ability to use tools makes it unpredictable, ensuring you’ve got to pick the right spot from round to round in order to score maximum damage. It looks a lot like an ornithomimosaur - an ostrich-mimic dinosaur - so looks right at home in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Ancient_Forest">Ancient Forest</a> although it can be used with either core box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Upcoming Content</strong></h2></div><p id="monster-hunter-world-iceborne"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Monster Hunter World Iceborne">Monster Hunter World Iceborne: The Board Game</h3></p><div catalogid="6a25ec10-0bf9-4524-b923-a0b682daa70e" id="220578"><div id="220578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Monster Hunter World Iceborne: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the success of the initial lineup detailed above, publisher Steamforged Games ran a second Kickstarter for a new iteration of the basic design called Monster Hunter World: Iceborne. While it features the same core mechanics it has a range of new concepts, so it’s only partially compatible with the original boxes: you can port monsters and hunters from one to the other in arena games, but you can’t shunt a campaign from one setting to a different one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Iceborne content follows a similar, but slightly different path to the original campaign.

			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-unreal-engine-6-info-shared-by-epics-tim-sweeney-preview-versions-in-2-3-years-goal-is-to-go-multithreaded/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> earlier this week, Epic Games founder, president, and largest shareholder Tim Sweeney was featured in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive interview with Lex Fridman</a>. The highlight of the conversation was the unexpected mention of Unreal Engine 6 progress, but in the four-hour-long chat, Tim Sweeney also addressed some of the feedback on the Epic Games Launcher, which is often criticized in comparison to Valve's Steam client. Sweeney admitted to the launcher's faults, but also stressed that Valve has had a lot more time to mature its platform.</p>
<p><em>I think one of the reasons that people characterize the Epic Games launcher as clunky is because the Epic Games launcher is clunky and we need to improve this. There's a lot of work going on there and, you know, I wish we'd gotten better at addressing quality of life features and prioritize them above all of the other features.</em></p>
<p><em>Steam has 15 years of built-up work by many of the best programmers in the whole industry working on that. It's a much larger team working on Steam and a lot more time working on it, so we've had to make a lot of prioritization decisions about what do we support with the Epic Game Store and when.</em></p>
<p><em>A lot of the time, it's been supporting commercial features like merchandising, offering multiple versions of a game for sale, and offering upgrades from the regular edition to the deluxe edition and other things that partners work.</em></p>
<p><em>Other priorities have been quality of life and launcher load times and other things. And we've not put enough emphasis on the quality of life features.&nbsp; We've recognized this very clearly multiple times, and we've gone through multiple refactorings. But that's definitely been a disappointment to us and to a lot of users. One thing it took us a while to realize was it's not in uniform.</em></p>
<p><em>Depending on your proximity to a CDN and the size of your game collection, it can be either awesome or really clunky. And the users for whom it's really clunky are the people behind a large part of the complaints. I should also say that the Steam launcher, for a long time, from my memory, but also just looking online, was also very clunky in the beginning.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point, it should be clarified that the Epic Games Launcher can no longer be considered at its beginning, having launched in December 2018. There's still a lot of room for improvement on the client, that's for sure.</p>

<p>In the briefing, Zakeel Gordon, Executive Producer, Gavin Verhey, Principal Designer &amp; Set Design Lead for FINAL FANTASY, Dillon Deveney, Principal Game Designer, and Daniel Holt, Senior Game Designer, showed off cards featuring characters and moments from all 16 FINAL FANTASY games! There's so much to do through, so I'm highlighting my favorite cards from the briefing.</p>

<h2>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy 1 Cards Bring Jobs To The Game</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-1.jpg?itok=HZ_n2507 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-1.jpg?itok=BhLM8qCA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These artifacts, which create heroes when you cast them and auto-attach, also each give an added creature type to the wielder of the equipment! There's so much room to play in this space, and I love how evocative it is!</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy II Cuts A Dash With Firion</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-2-magic-the-gathering.jpg?itok=f3aZQkwn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-2-magic-the-gathering.jpg?itok=hBIagxQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Among the cards shown that align with<em> FFII</em>, I'm really loving just how aggro and equipment-heavy you can get with Firion, Wild Rose Warrior! And the artwork from Yoshitaka Amano on the second Firion card is just... showstopping.</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy IV Jumps In With Dragoons!</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-4.jpg?itok=ugWa0dND 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-4.jpg?itok=-PkJyJtZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I think that Jump mechanic on Kain is just so damn cool, and perfectly captures the feeling of Dragoons in the&nbsp;<em>FF&nbsp;</em>world. And check out this alt-art card for Cecil (not to mention the incredibly powerful ability on his card).</p>

<h2>Final Fantasy VII Has All The Heavy Hitters</h2>

Cloud's ability to search up equipment is so good, Tifa's Landfall ability can make her pretty huge with the right lay-up, and this is one of 77 Golden Chase Chocobo cards which will only be available in Collector Booster packs! I confirmed via the press briefing that this Chocobo will be the&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;serialized card in the set.</p>

<h2>So... Many... Cids!!!</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/untitled-presentation.jpg?itok=94r0CtN_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/untitled-presentation.jpg?itok=dCM8CRI8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are so many more cards to go over from the reveals today, but in the interest of time we're going to leave you with... all of these Cids!!! Showing up in almost every game, these mechanically identical Cids each got their own art treatment tied to the games they show up in! Love him!</p>

<p>That's all for now, we'll keep adding more images along the way as we track the thrilling release of <i>Magic The Gathering Final Fantasy!</i></p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a> is still trudging along, it seems, as yesterday publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gearbox">Gearbox</a> announced that a new expansion is on the way, Alloyed Collective. In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/524216645064853111?l=english">post over on Steam</a>, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a> team explained that alongside updating the game's previous bit of DLC, Seekers of the Storm, they've brought on some "additional folks that are familiar with Risk of Rain to help us build out the next DLC." Alloyed Collective is apparently still a while away from being ready, but it sounds pretty jam packed.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This one brings in six completely new stages, which range from "cliffside scrapyards to machinery-choked fortresses and buried caverns" in Solus-controlled territory. Two survivors are being added in, one a returning one (presumably from the first game), the other being fresh meat, though details are slim on both. You'll be able to take control over seven new drones, with a new station allowing you to modify them to your own needs. There's seven new enemy types too, lots of sevens! And one 15, as there'll be 15 new items to find as well.

<p>
With the world being as it is economically, it's also worth noting that if you've got a group of people you like to play the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> with, only one of you needs to buy Alloyed Collective to play with the new stages, items, and monsters. They just won't have access to the new survivors, or be able to permanently unlock new items or logbooks.
</p>
<p>
Seekers of the Storm wasn't exactly well-received at launch due to there being a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">whole bunch of bugs</a> that made the game quite unplayable. Fingers crossed we don't see a repeat of that! Hopefully with new team members being brought on board and no release date in sight means the devs are able to get this bit of DLC out more comfortably.

                <p dir="ltr">To say that the team behind Magic: The Gathering's upcoming Final Fantasy collaboration set is excited to launch would be an understatement.</p><p dir="ltr">"As we drove up to the convention center, there's this giant hotel-sized screen that says 'Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy on it," principal designer and set design lead Gavin Verhey said during a press preview event for the upcoming set. "We all just looked at each other and said, 'This is it, this is what we've been waiting for. It's finally happening.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Moments like this are what Verhey, executive producer Zakeel Gordon, principal game designer Dillon Deveney, and senior game designer Daniel Holt have dreamed of throughout the four-year history of the set's development. As the team reminisces about their time working on the expansion, both in Square Enix's offices in Japan and the Wizards of the Coast headquarters in Renton, Washington, our Zoom call lights up with smiles and laughter at the simple mention of cards like Summon: Bahamut, names like Yoshitaka Amano, and countless other references.</p><p dir="ltr">For these four people, the release of Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy is a culmination of hard work, a celebration of both Magic and Final Fantasy, and ultimately, a declaration of victory. GameSpot sat down with the panel for a lengthy chat about Final Fantasy's foray into Magic: The Gathering, which begins on June 13.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491944-absolutevirtue_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491944" data-ratio="1.3971539456662" data-width="773" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491944-absolutevirtue_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491944"></a><figcaption>Absolute Virtue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491944-absolutevirtue_en_hrr.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>The design process</span></h2><p dir="ltr">"I was designing cards at 2 AM" is a common phrase out of Verhey's mouth. In this particular case, he's talking about Absolute Virtue, the powerful boss from Final Fantasy XI, and the card that appeared during the panel. Gordon, Deveney, and Holt knowingly nod along, anticipating where the story is going.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was trying to design Absolute Virtue, and I could not figure out what to do," Verhey says, "and I fell asleep at my desk--like an adult. Suddenly, I woke up and thought, 'Ah! Protection from everything! It literally popped in my head as I was waking up from sleeping. I typed it into the file and thought, 'Well, that's probably not going to stick,' but then I showed it to everyone, and they just loved it. They thought it was amazing."</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say every conversation went so swimmingly; Deveney used the word "spirited" to describe some of the conversations between himself and Holt. "We only have so many design slots in the [pre-constructed Commander] deck for new cards," Deveney describes. "Who gets that? Who makes the cut?"</p><p dir="ltr">Deveney specifically recalls a discussion around the Final Fantasy XIV pre-constructed deck, which in itself was a Herculean task to create. "Truth be told, this is a game that's been running for 10-plus years, with 14 years of content; we could probably make a whole set of just that one game," Deveney says. "I've been playing the game since launch, and Daniel said he was playing it, so our perspectives were different."</p><p dir="ltr">Deveney says that difference in perspective helped the two of them fine tune the FF14 Commander deck to be as authentic to the game as possible. Sometimes Deveney would want a character that Holt didn't think was all that important; other times Deveney wouldn't take no for an answer. "One character in particular, I had to say 'Daniel, if they don't make it in, I will be very upset, because someone will get very upset with me if they don't make it in.''</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491937-bahamut.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491937" data-ratio="0.69857697283312" data-width="1546" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491937-bahamut.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491937"></a><figcaption>Summon: Bahamut</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4491937-bahamut.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A focus on Commander</h2><p dir="ltr">With so much history to parse through, and only so much space to go around in an expansion set, choosing what products received which cards or designs led to some more "spirited" discussion. "We look at the whole product as one experience, but then we have to look at each individual piece--main set, Commander, etc," Deveney says. "Sometimes I ask myself 'If this is the only thing a fan buys, what do they expect to see?'"</p><p dir="ltr">For Commander specifically, which Daniel Holt was primarily focused on, it allows him to explore the four games receiving pre-constructed decks--FF6, FF7, FF10, and FF14--as their own unique stories. As Holt puts it, "in the Commander decks we got to go super deep."</p><p dir="ltr">"The Commander decks were almost each their own Universes Beyond product in the way we approached them," Holt continued. "Final Fantasy VI is its own world, FFVII's its own world. They don't cross. Each allows us to add different things; for example, elves only appear in certain games but not in others, so we did some elf reprints in the deck for the game where they're found.</p><p dir="ltr">"With Final Fantasy VI, we had a graveyard recursion theme, but it's not from death, it's 'lifting your allies up.' We twisted some of the reprints to be a little more themed that way. There were a lot of creative restrictions, but also we were able to create really cool things because of it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491946-kefka.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491946" data-ratio="0.69857697283312" data-width="1546" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491946-kefka.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491946"></a><figcaption>Kefka, Court Mage // Kefka, Ruler of Ruin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491946-kefka.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Works of art</h2><p dir="ltr">One interesting fact mentioned during the press preview was in regard to some of the artists who contributed to the card's art: Nine of them, well known for drawing Final Fantasy art throughout history, were given the option to draw whoever or whatever they wished. This opened up some interesting opportunities; even though Amano has drawn Kefka before, he'd never drawn Kefka's final form in his entire career--until now.</p><p dir="ltr">This led to what Verhey describes as one of the coolest moments of his life. "We're in Japan, and we happened to be at the Square Enix office when Amano's Kefka piece arrived. No one had seen it yet, and it came in this black art briefcase provided by Amano himself."</p><p dir="ltr">"They set it on the table, and we all just went silent, staring at an original Amano work…but at a distance, because none of us wanted to get too close and risk messing it up somehow," Verhey continues. "Nobody sneeze, no one do anything that could put a mark on this."</p><p dir="ltr">Deveney says that most of the artists drew characters they'd been familiar with, but a few took the opportunity to branch out and try something new. "There were a few artists that were just like, 'Oh, I would love an opportunity to play with this other game's toy, because I didn't work on it and that sounds really fun,'" Deveney explains. "They were like, 'Oh, I've always wanted to draw this character!'"</p><p dir="ltr">As iconic as Final Fantasy artwork is, the soundtracks to each of these games is just as well-known. Implementing music into a physical card game, of course, is very hard to do, but the team did try to make it work. As Deveney puts it, "those discussions totally happened."</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll say that there are two or three cards that you might be happy to see have 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' references to famous song titles--or moments where you can hear those songs playing--that we were able to get into the set," Deveney says. "There's a larger discussion about music rights and how it's a little bit different with every industry, but yes, we were able to get a few things in there that are very intentionally referential."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491947-travelingchocobogold_en_serialized.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491947" data-ratio="1.3971539456662" data-width="773" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491947-travelingchocobogold_en_serialized.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491947"></a><figcaption>Traveling Chocobo (Gold Serialized)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491947-travelingchocobogold_en_serialized.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Choosing a Headliner</h2><p dir="ltr">Recent Magic sets have incorporated a Headliner--one specific card that acts as a "chase" card, with a limited number of printings and each one individually numbered. The last set, Tarkir: Dragonstorm, used Mox Jasper--the dragon-focused Mox gem--as the Headliner, with special art from original Mox artist Dan Frazier.</p><p dir="ltr">For Final Fantasy, the team knew it wanted to pick something every FF fan knows. Sure, they could have made the Headliner a character like Cloud or Sephiroth, but fans of FF7 would appreciate it to the fullest; fans of other games might not enjoy it as much. That's why, for Zakeel Gordon, the choice was simple: a chocobo, specifically Traveling Chocobo.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Chocobo was the flagship character that we wanted to push to the forefront, because it's represented in the vast majority of games," Gordon said. "If you are a fan of the franchise, but you only have a connection to certain games, you will recognize a Chocobo no matter what." The team did pull from a specific game for the card--multiple variants depict multiple colored Chocobos from Final Fantasy VII--but even if a player isn't familiar with chocobo racing, they'll know what the bird is.</p><p dir="ltr">What is odd about this serialized Chocobo, however, is the number of printings--where previous Headliners saw 500 copies made, the golden Traveling Chocobo will only see 77 printings. This was intentional, as the team wanted the card to feel even more special. "77 is, I think, the perfect medium for where we've been doing serialization recently, Gordon explains, "where it's a little bit less rare than the "one-of-One Ring," but it's a little bit more rare than an "X of 500." And, in the spirit of Final Fantasy 7, two sevens just felt like the right number."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491948-0043_mtgfin_cptbonus_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491948" data-ratio="1.3971539456662" data-width="773" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491948-0043_mtgfin_cptbonus_en_hrr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4491948"></a><figcaption>Zidane Tribal as Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4491948-0043_mtgfin_cptbonus_en_hrr.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Through The Ages</h2><p dir="ltr">One final big feature in this new expansion is Final Fantasy: Through The Ages, a bonus sheet of 64 cards--four cards for each of the 16 mainline FF games. All 64 cards are reprints of previously-released Magic cards, but the art depicted on each card comes from the authentic Square Enix archives. It's a history lesson in cardboard form, and Dillon Deveney says they had a lot of material to parse through--over 5,000 pieces of art, to be precise.</p><p dir="ltr">"We'd ask all kinds of questions," Deveney said, "What do we think is the most bespoke thing that someone would want to see about this game? What's the best version of this art? What's the best version of this character? Should we go with a sketchy concept or fully finished illustration? Would this be a good land or an enchantment or an artifact? We went through <em>everything</em>."</p><p dir="ltr">Multiple cards from the bonus sheet were shown during the PAX East panel, including FF9's Zidane Tribal as Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer and FF2's Firion, Swordmaster as Sram, Senior Edificer. Previously, FF7's Yuffie Kisaragi was unveiled as a reskin of Yuriko, the Tiger's Shadow.</p><p dir="ltr">"The bonus sheet was a place where we could balance each game perfectly," Gordon said. "We allotted a 'budget' to each game: There will be four cards, we're going to have a protagonist and an antagonist, and then we'll find two moments; one maybe is more story-driven, and the other may be a little bit more mechanically driven."</p><p dir="ltr">--</p><p dir="ltr">As the panel signed off on the preview, host and former MTG broadcaster Richard Hagon said that even though this is still Magic: The Gathering, there's something about the Final Fantasy set that feels different. "You can absolutely play wonderful games of Magic with this set, the cards are there, the designs are there. But, the feelings are unique and special, and that is what people are going to remember for a very long time." As the panel enthusiastically nodded, that feeling definitely came through from the minds behind the set. Now, all that's left is for the players to pick up and play.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasy will be available June 13 at local game stores and big box retailers.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a> creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dean-hall">Dean Hall</a> is alleging that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/unity">Unity</a> are threatening to revoke all licenses for workers at his current studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/rocketwerkz">Rocketwerkz</a>, the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/icarus">Icarus</a>. The developer made this claim in a lengthy post on Reddit saying that Unity are doing based on "bogus data about private versus public licenses." Hall shared what he claims is an email from Unity dated May 9th where they explained that the Unity Compliance Team has flagged Rocketwerkz's account as according to their data, the developer "currently [has] users using Unity Personal licenses when they should under the umbrella of your Unity Pro subscription."

<p>
According to Hall, when they asked Unity for more details, the evidence they provided included five email addresses that have supposedly "been logging in with Personal Edition licenses." Hall then noted that two of these email addresses had @rocketwerkz addresses, one being an employee who uses Unity Personal but does not work on a Unity project at the studio, the other being an external contractor who was provided a Pro licence at the time of their work.

The third was supposedly a personal email address of an employee, who Hall also says is provided with a Pro license, but the Rocketwerkz CEO says the second two were obscured email domains of employees at a separate company in Dunedin, New Zealand, neither of which have worked for Hall's company. Hall notes that Dunedin is where Rocketwerkz is based. 
</p>
<p>
If what Hall is saying is to be believed, it's likely that this is the reason employee emails from another company have been provided as evidence. However, that would obviously raise some questions as to how this happened in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Unity do not appear to have offered an official statement on the situation at this point in time, but I've reached out for comment.
