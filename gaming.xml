According to Earhardt, Usha Vance said J.D. is "going to kill me for saying this."</p><p>The Apple Valley High team has won <a href="https://www.startribune.com/high-school-video-gaming-e-sports-minnesota-varsity-league-apple-valley/600344040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four consecutive <em>Valorant</em> championships</a>, recieving a shoutout from <a href="https://x.com/AVHSEsports/status/1768367862899478770" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar</a> too. Walz wrote to the Apple Valley High team in 2022 that "With esports on the rise, I am extremely proud of you and the role you have taken on to grow esports participation at Apple Valley High School and in Minnesota. You are at the helm of transforming a hobby into a potentially life-changing career in a new and innovative realm of sports."</p><p>Meanwhile, when <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-son-trump-phone-call-b2590681.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump called Vance</a> to offer him the VP slot, Vance apparently told his seven-year-old son to "shut the hell up for 30 seconds about Pikachu."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Usually bugs are either game-breaking, amusing, or incredibly inconvenient annoyances for players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-review-mother-knows-best/1900-6418072/" data-ref-id="1900-6418072">Diablo 4</a>'s latest bug has proven to be both beneficial and popular. So much so that Activision Blizzard has already indicated that it won't be releasing a fix for the duration of the game's fifth season, Season of the Infernal Hordes.</p><p>Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-season-5-legendary-tempering-recipes-bug-patch-1851614747" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Diablo 4 allows players to upgrade their gear with Legendary Tempering recipes each season. Essentially, that system allows players to decide which affixes they want to attach to their gear. It was only introduced in the fourth season of Diablo 4, and it was supposed to reset the recipes for Season 5. However, the bug has allowed all of last season's Legendary Tempering recipes to remain in place. That's made leveling a lot easier than in the past.</p><p>Although Season of the Infernal Hordes launched today, sharp-eyed Diablo 4 players noticed the bug right away. Once the word got out, Bilzzard eventually had to respond to it. And fortunately, the company doesn't plan to do anything about it. Global community development director Adam Fletcher confirmed that the bug wasn't intentional before adding that the company is "letting this one slide."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1820883605180277022" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are aware of the reports that new seasonal characters are having their tempering recipes carried over from their last seasons seasonal character. <br>This isn't the original design or intention so I wouldn't expect this for future seasons but we are letting this one slide for…</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1820883605180277022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless, Fletcher made it clear that the reset of tempering recipes will resume when the next season, Vessel of Hatred, arrives in October. In the meantime, it sounds like players are going to enjoy playing Season of the Infernal Hordes with more powerful gear than they would normally get to have.</p>

The new activity is the Infernal Horde, a Vampire Survivors-inspired mode where you must battle it out with an endless onslaught of enemies for a chance at big rewards. There is also a new season storyline and quests to complete and new Seasonal Journey objectives. There are seven chapters of objectives to complete, with a small bundle of rewards to earn for completing each chapter. These chapters cover all activities from level 1 to 100.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346469-chapter1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4346469" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346469-chapter1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4346469"></a><figcaption>Chapter 1 features simple, early game objectives.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346469-chapter1.jpeg"></figure><p><strong>You must complete nine of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dubious Allegiance: Meet with Istel in Zarbinzet and increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 1</li><li dir="ltr">Begone Devils: Defeat 100 Demons throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Test of Mettle: Defeat 5 Elite Monsters</li><li dir="ltr">Spoils of Hell: Open 1 Tortured Gifts during a Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Risk and Reward: Buy 5 pieces of equipment from the Purveyor of Curiosities</li><li dir="ltr">Into The Breach: Complete 1 Hellbreach</li><li dir="ltr">Trouble in the Wilds: Complete 3 World Events</li><li dir="ltr">Tiny Clarity: Upgrade your Potion to tiny at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Forager: Collect 50 Bundled Herbs from Harvest Nodes, Cellars, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Tanner's Apprentice: Collect 50 Rawhide from salvaging Armor, defeating Monsters, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Prospector: Collect 50 Iron Chunks from salvaging Weapons and Jewelry, Mineral Nodes, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The objectives for Chapter 1 are all basically freebies. You would have to actively try to avoid most of these to not earn them quickly while playing the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor (battle pass XP)</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Cache, contains consumables like Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials like Herbs and Gem Fragments</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Equipment Cache, contains a Legendary Weapon and Boots for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete eight of 10 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Enemy of My Enemy: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 3</li><li dir="ltr">Ruins Reclaimed: Clear 1 Stronghold</li><li dir="ltr">Den of Evil: Complete any 5 Dungeons found on your map</li><li dir="ltr">Seething Wounds: Complete 5 Hellbreaches</li><li dir="ltr">Path to Strength: Unlock 5 Aspects in the Codex of Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Prelude of Doom: Defeat 5 Harbingers during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">A Master at Work: Complete 1 World Events with Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Stuff of Legends: Collect 100 Veiled Crystals from salvaging gear at the Blacksmith or other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Expanded Repertoire: Learn 1 Recipe of Magic rarity or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Miracles of Alchemy: Craft 5 Elixirs at the Alchemist</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 is also mostly composed of objectives that are relatively simple to complete. Three quick objectives to knock out are <strong>Ruins Reclaimed, Den of Evil, and Path to Strength. </strong>Ruins Reclaimed tasks you with completing a Stronghold, something you will want to do anyway, since some Nightmare Dungeons are locked behind Strongholds. Den of Evil and Path to Strength are directly tied to each other, since completing a dungeon for the first time unlocks a legendary aspect.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Cache, contains elixirs and whispering keys</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Equipment Cache, contains a legendary weapon, helm, and ring for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete nine of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The Mother's Chosen: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 5</li><li dir="ltr">Champion of the Lost: Clear 3 Strongholds</li><li dir="ltr">Cinder Spender: Open 10 Tortured Gifts during Helltides</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken Offerings: Obtain 5 Caches from the Tree of Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Purging the Infernal: Complete 10 Hellbreaches</li><li dir="ltr">Hard Fought Victory: Complete 1 Legion Events</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Ancients: Unlock 10 Aspects in the Codex of Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Hardened by Battle: Reach level 40</li><li dir="ltr">Deeper Evil Within: Complete 10 Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Capable Craftsman: Learn 1 Recipe of Rare rarity or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Basic Needs: Temper 5 Affixes onto Gear at the Blacksmith</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 is primarily a continuation of objectives in the previous two chapters, which makes it easier to complete some objectives. Completing Dungeons, Hellbreaches, and Strongholds will all have some progress carried over if you completed the earlier objectives, with the same being true for unlocking Aspects. <strong>Forsaken Offerings </strong>is one of the more time consuming objectives, since obtaining 5 caches requires you to complete Whispers worth 10 points total five times, which could be time consuming if you aren't going out of your way,</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache, contains Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache, contains summoning materials for world tier 3 bosses</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Equipment Cache, contains a legendary weapon, chest armor, and amulet for your class.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346470-chpater4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4346470" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346470-chpater4.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4346470"></a><figcaption>Chapter 4 features objectives focused around the early part World Tier 3.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4346470-chpater4.jpeg"></figure><p><strong>You must complete nine of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Against All Hatred: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 7</li><li dir="ltr">Blessing of the Strong: Equip Sacred Legendary items in every slot</li><li dir="ltr">Grim Claim: Obtain 20 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing whispers</li><li dir="ltr">The Depths of Fear: Use 5 Nightmare Sigils to create and complete Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Touching the Eternal: Unlock 25 Aspects in the Codex of Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">A Deathless Heart: Defeat 10 Aether Fiends</li><li dir="ltr">The Way Down: Acquire 5 Infernal Compasses</li><li dir="ltr">Eternal Champion: Enhance Infernal Compasses with Abyssal Scrolls</li><li dir="ltr">The Hordes Falter: Defeat the Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Echo of Varshan in World Tier 3</li><li dir="ltr">Stem the Tide: Defeat 666 Monsters at Max Threat Level during a Helltide on World Tier 3 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 is where you will have moved on to World Tier 3, increasing the difficulty, unlocking Sacred Legendary items, and unlocking the new activity, Infernal Hordes. While there are a few continued objectives, like unlocking Aspects and obtaining caches from the Tree of Whispers, many of these objectives are focused on World Tier 3 activities. You will need to do the Infernal Hordes and completing Nightmare Dungeons is important for powering up your Paragon Board, so the only objective here to ignore if you want to is defeating Varshan in World tier 3, since you might want to save your summoning materials for World Tier 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Power and Sacrifice Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache, contains Infernal Hordes Compass, Elixirs, and a Scroll of Amnesia</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache, contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Equipment Cache, contains a legendary weapon, gloves, pants, and ring for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Slayer__Chapter_5_">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete eight of 10 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Through Bile and Brimstone: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 12</li><li dir="ltr">Heir to Transcendence: Equip an Ancestral Legendary in every item slot</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat 20 Helltide Commanders during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li><li dir="ltr">This Is No Dream: Complete a Tier 21 or higher Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Tempered by Hellfire: Reach level 75</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Strip Their Souls: Defeat Aether Diends, Aether Lords, and Infernal Demons</li><li dir="ltr">Corruption Consumed: Collect 666 Burning Aether from Hellbreaches and Infernal Hordes in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">Excommunication: Defeat The Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes Tier 2</li><li dir="ltr">Vanquishing Hell's Best: Defeat Champion Monsters in World Tier 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Slayer moves you into World Tier 4, the highest difficulty. Some of these objectives, like completing the Tier 21 or higher Nightmare Dungeon, are very simple to complete, since that's one of the lowest tiers available in World Tier 4. A lot of these objectives are related to Infernal Hordes, so that is where most of your time will be spent. None of these are particularly difficult, although you might want to skip <strong>Echoes of the Ancients</strong>, since you may have unlocked all of the Aspects for your class that you want to use.</p><p dir="ltr">Slayer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Cache, contains Infernal Hordes Compass, Elixirs, and a Scroll of Amnesia</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Summoning Cache, contains boss summoning materials for World Tier 4 bosses</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Equipment Cache, contains two Ancestral Legendaries and an Ancestral Unique for your class</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Champion__Chapter_6_">Champion (Chapter 6)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete eight of 10 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Champion objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Holding Back the Hells: Increase Mother's Gift reputation to Rank 17</li><li dir="ltr">Forgiveness: Defeat Lord Zir in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">Harbinger of Ice: Defeat The Beast in the Ice in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">The Gathering Fires: Acquire 6,666 Cinders during Helltide in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">Collapsing the System: Defeat 10 any Ladder Bosses in World Tier 4</li><li dir="ltr">The Brink of Madness: Complete a Tier 30 or higher Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Death to the Wicked: Defeat The Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes in Tier 3</li><li dir="ltr">Preamble: Complete Artificer's Tier 1 or higher in The Pit, located at the Artificer's Obelisk in Cerrigar and activated with Runeshards</li><li dir="ltr">Ancient Craft: Temper 20 Affixes onto Ancestral Gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Infernal Hordes: Destroy 25 Aetheric Mass in World Tier 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Champion takes us even further into World Tier 4, with tougher objectives and fights. If you have the materials, the two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">boss fights</a> in this list aren't overly difficult, especially if you have a few friends to help you at. Completing the first tier of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-how-to-masterwork-gear/1100-6523762/">The Pit</a> is also pretty simple and being able to Master Work your gear will make everything else much easier.

While many of these will take a ton of time to work through, there are a few that are good to focus on and a few you could potentially skip. <strong>Glyphmaster </strong>and <strong>Horadric Smith</strong> are both great ones to focus on, since increasing your Glyph levels and Masterworking your gear will both make you more powerful, making other objectives easier to complete. <strong>The Bigger They Are </strong>is a great one to ignore, since depending on what time of day you play, you might not be able to participate in world bosses.</p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Cache, contains Infernal Hordes Compass, Elixirs, and a Scroll of Amnesia</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Crafting Cache, contains Crafting Materials</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Summoning Cache, contains Stygian Stones and other boss summoning materials</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Equipment Cache, contains two Ancestral Legendaries and two Ancestral Uniques for your class</li><li dir="ltr">Infernal Player Title</li><li dir="ltr">Antagonist Player Title</li></ul>

The service launched with all of <em>The Simpsons, Star Wars</em>, and most Marvel movies, as well as a large collection of classic Disney films, shows, and animated shorts. In the five years since it started, Disney+ has grown more and more, as Disney has added Hulu shows, more original content, Fox-owned properties, and licensed shows like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.disneyplus.com/series/doctor-who/1ml73V6phgyZ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/doctor-who/1ml73V6phgyZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Doctor Who</em></a></span> to the service<em>.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>But all that content doesn’t come cheap and over the last few years, the price of Disney+ has increased almost every year.

That means an ad-free Disney+ subscription will cost twice what it did in 2019 at launch, when Disney offered just one plan with no ads for $7 a month. </p><p>Hulu with ads is going up to $10 a month and without ads it hops up to $19. Finally, ESPN+ will cost $12 a month starting in October. Disney is also adding “Playlists” which will be always-on channels within the app streaming content like news, old movies, and TV shows.

			<p>Final Fantasy XVI release on PC could be imminent, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Following the release of the latest NVIDIA GeForce Game Ready driver, which introduced support for soon-to-be-released games such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-nvidia-geforce-game-ready-driver-out-now-hunt-showdown-1896-gets-dlss-level-zero-extraction-launches-with-dlss-3/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a>, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1elhiea/comment/lgsrnjc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> that the new release also features a game driver profile for Square Enix's latest main entry in the series. With the inclusion of the game's profile, there's little doubt that the game's release shouldn't be too far off in the future.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI's imminent release on PC shouldn't come as a surprise for those who have been following the game, as it was said multiple times in the past few months that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-release-pc-complete-edition/">PC release wasn't too far off in the future</a>. A playable demo is also scheduled to release before launch, so it definitely seems like it won't be too long before we are finally able to experience Clive's adventure with high framerates, as the game supposedly runs at 1<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-pc-runs-at-100fps-on-high-end-hardware-says-yoshida/">00 FPS and above on high-end hardware.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PlayStation 5. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-season-5-class-tier-list/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>With the launch of Season 5 of Diablo 4 and the ARPG in its best state ever, now’s a fantastic time to level a new character to 100. You can jump straight into the seasonal storyline, which introduces Infernal Hordes or farm Helltides to level quickly. I did both! Before you start, however, here’s our Diablo 4 Season 5 class tier list!</p>



<h2 id="h-our-class-tier-list-for-diablo-4-season-5">Our Class Tier List for Diablo 4 Season 5</h2>



<p>With five classes to choose from and many possibilities regarding viable builds, there’s never been a better time to test out a lesser-player class in Diablo 4 than in Season 5. If you’re accustomed to playing the same class and build, why not try something different this time around? I say as I play Barbarian again!</p>



<p>Here’s our class tier list for Season 5 in Diablo 4:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>S-Tier</strong>: Rogue and Sorcerer</li>



<li><strong>A-Tier</strong>: Necromancer</li>



<li><strong>B-Tier</strong>: Druid</li>



<li><strong>C-Tier</strong>: Barbarian</li>
</ul>



<p>As a Barbarian main, it pains me to place Barbarian on the lowest rung of the tier list. But following Blizzard’s infinite wisdom in nerfing many of my beloved Barb’s skills into the ground, it’s still a viable class to play but certainly not the most powerful this season.</p>



<p>That said, Rogue and Sorcerer, on the other hand, prove themselves to be the most capable and powerful characters in Season 5. They’re viable for leveling and end-game content, with the Sorcerer’s Lightning Spear build taking center stage. I saw it firsthand during a Helltide and, despite playing my Barbarian, nearly swapped to a new character then and there!</p>







<h2 id="h-which-class-should-you-play-first-in-season-5">Which Class Should You Play First in Season 5?</h2>



<p>If you insist on following the meta and wish to push end-game content, such as the Infernal Hordes and Pit, I highly recommend playing a Rogue this season. They’re nimble, potent, and boast high survivability, thanks to numerous buffs and enhancements. Furthermore, some of the latest unique, such as The Umbracrux, ensure you’re lightning-quick and striking down Elite and Boss enemies quickly and efficiently!</p>



<p>Alternatively, if you prefer magic, the Sorcerer is a good choice. It offers numerous viable builds, and as mentioned, the Lightning Spear is a capable and powerful playstyle!</p>



<hr>



<p>While choosing a class to play in Season 4, don’t forget to look ahead toward the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vessel of Hatred release date</a> later this year!</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's October release date is inching ever closer, with Activision growing looser-lipped by the day. Which brings us to the company's latest reveal: a first look at Black Ops 6's Zombies mode, courtesy of a two-and-a-half-minute cinematic trailer, ahead of a full gameplay breakdown this Thursday, 8th August.
</p>
<p>
"After being imprisoned for over five years at a remote outpost in the Philippine Sea, the former members of Requiem stage a daring breakout," explains Activision in a bout of scene-setting <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-lost-soul-requiem-terminus-team-intel">over on the Call of Duty blog</a>. "They are aided by the unexpected arrival of a mysterious Filipina smuggler and a former adversary. Unfortunately, their bid for freedom from Terminus Island coincides with another chaotic dimensional outbreak... Welcome to Black Ops 6 Zombies."
</p>
<p>
That daring breakout is what we see in Black Ops 6 Zombies' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z0Ni2JIqzw">first cinematic trailer</a>, which introduces the mode's new characters - former Requiem stuff members Grigori Weaver, Mackenzie "Mac" Carver, Elizabeth Grey, Oskar Strauss, and Stoney Maddox (AKA Raptor One) - alongside their liberators, Maya Aguinaldo and Dr. William Peck.
</p>

<p>
There's a bit more detail on each of the characters in Activision's announcement post, but the key takeaway is Black Ops 6 Zombies continues the Dark Aether storyline, picking up five years after Requiem's senior staff were arrested by Project Director Edward Richtofen. But Activision notes it's not just the Terminus Island outpost that's about to be overrun with undead: the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls, on the other side of the world, is also facing its own zombie outbreak.
</p>
<p>
So that's your story, but what about gameplay? As it happens, Activision will be sharing the juicy stuff very soon. It'll be updating its blog this Thursday, 8th August, with a post from Zombies developer Treyarch, promising an "in-depth gameplay overview, information about your pre-match preparation options, full details on Round-Based Zombies gameplay, and a bestiary of the undead."
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launches for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC on 25th October. It'll be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">day one release on Game Pass</a> too - but, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">Microsoft announced last month</a>, not if you're on the subscription service's revised basic tier.

Interestingly, the mode-specific labeling could suggest that Bungie <em>might</em> add ways to attune to weapons tied to other ritual activities, such as Crucible, Gambit, Strikes, and maybe even dungeons and raids in the future. Time, of course, will tell.</p><p>Otherwise, the attunement system will function much the same as it did in <em>Into the Light</em>. <strong>Players will only be able to attune to a single weapon at a time</strong>, but upon attunement, they should notice a significant uptick in the weapon’s drop rate. According to Bungie, <strong>attuned weapons will have their drop rate increased by 60 percent, </strong>which is up from 50 when the feature was first introduced in <em>Into The Light. </em>So it should actually be <em>even</em> easier to pick up any weapons that players may be missing.</p><p>Besides that, BRAVE weapon attunement appears like it’ll function largely the same. The caveat there being that <strong>BRAVE weapon attunement will only impact drop rates within Onslaught</strong>, the cooperative horde mode introduced alongside the arsenal. If you were looking for a reason to mindlessly shoot scores of aliens, you now have a way better chance of getting a god roll Recluse than you’ve ever really had before.</p><p>With that being said, it’s time to attune to your favorite weapons and get to grinding. This latest patch also brings back the Solstice seasonal event, meaning there’s plenty of fresh activities to break in your new BRAVE weapons and even better loot waiting at the end of it all. If that weren’t enough, we’re also <em>still</em> in the middle of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s first episode “Echoes,” and while Saint-14 is clearly haunted by whatever’s happening to him, there are some very cool Battlegrounds to fight through and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-echoes-planetary-piston-hammers-1851613479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-echoes-planetary-piston-hammers-1851613479">great gear to collect</a></span>.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/epyx-summer-olympics-paris-2024-c64<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of my earliest video gaming memories is destroying my young body playing <em>Summer Games</em>, released in 1984 for pretty much every home computer available at the time.</p><p>I remember being four years old playing it on my grandparent's brand new Commodore 64 and, being a stupid kid who couldn't read properly yet, glossing over what little text the game put in front of me. For example: the first thing it asks you to do is pick which country you're playing as. I, being a kid, would scan this screen going "uh huh, France, Britain, Canada, Mexico and...Egypt".</p><figure></figure><p>I could read, but I've always had a tendency to speed-read/gloss over things. If I'd taken time to spell that out I'm sure I would have noticed that it read "Epyx". But within the context of an international sporting event video game's menu screen, alongside a bunch of actual countries and their actual flags, my brain read the outline of the word, thought it was "Egypt", then went about its business. For <em>years</em>.</p><p>There is of course no such country as Epyx; that's the name of the studio responsible for the game, as well as a succession of other 1980's classics like <em>Barbarian </em>and <em>California Games</em>. In hindsight, it's pretty funny Epyx put themselves into the game to such an extent. But I didn't know that at the time, and so almost as often as I'd choose a real country I'd choose Epyx, because damn, their flag looked <em>amazing</em>.</p><p>Also amazing: the Epyx national anthem. Because why make a fake country for the Olympics if you aren’t also going to give it a banger of an anthem:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Summer Games (Commodore 64) - Epyx anthem" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nrgqaqLJ7iE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I didn't have access to this game at home, only at my grandparents’ house, and they lived four hours away, so I'd only end up playing this game once or twice a year. Enough to stay familiar with it (and get <em>really </em>good at it), but obviously not enough to correct my glaring geopolitical fuckup.</p><p>Imagine my surprise when, while coincidentally visiting their house during the opening ceremony for the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, I saw "Egypt" parade past the crowds with a flag that did not feature a kneeling statue, nor a nightclub-inspired colour scheme. Perplexed, I ran to the C64, fired up the game and...ah. Ah shit.</p><p>This was pretty embarrassing for a kid who was now eight years old, and should have known the difference between a video game developer and a <em>civilization that stretches back thousands of years</em>. That shame didn't last, though; next time I actually played the game I proudly selected Epyx, and every time the Olympics rolls around in the real world I still think of them fondly.</p><p>Even in 2024, <em>40 years</em> after I first played the game, I thought of Epyx as I watched the opening ceremony for the Paris Olympics. Imagined representatives of their team huddled in the rain atop a ferry making its way down the Seine. Dreamt of hearing their stirring anthem blaring loudly from the aquatic centre's loudspeakers after winning relay gold. Pictured the headlines in the Epyx Tribune back home, a nation proud of its athletes, who may not have won as many gold medals as the traditional powerhouses, but whose flag and anthem were at least the <em>coolest</em>.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Between its animated adaptations and video game collaborations - which so far includes the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania-dlc-will-let-you-play-as-richter-belmont">Dead Cells</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-castlevania-collaboration-coming-to-vampire-survival-game-v-rising-in-may">V Rising</a> - Konami's legendary Castlevania series is alive and well and shows no signs of stopping (although an actual new game would also be nice, Konami). And up next is Dead by Daylight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-adding-dungeons-dragons-and-castlevania-chapters-this-year">previously announced</a> Castlevania chapter, which is now confirmed to be launching on 27th August, with a public test build arriving today.
</p>
<p>
Castlevania's Dead by Daylight colloboration sees Dracula joining the asymmetrical multiplayer horror game as a new Killer, and he'll be accompanied his power-granting castle, as both are "inextricably linked". Developer Behaviour Interactive notes any time Dracula is the featured Killer in a trial with an original map, players will see his castle looming over proceedings.
</p>
<p>
Dracula is officially Dead by Daylight's first shape-shifting Killer, and is able to transform into a bat and wolf alongside his vampire form. The bat is "quiet as a creeping shadow" and can gain ground "with a blink", which, more practically means bat-Dracula has the Undetectable status effect, can move faster, ignore vault points, and teleport to any vault points within 32 meters. Survivors become invisible, but their scratch marks can be seen.

<p>
Dracula's wolf form, meanwhile, has increased movement speed and a "keen nose for fresh blood". Which is to say, pools and scratch marks are more apparent, and Survivors leave a trail of Scent Orbs behind them - which can be collected to charge a powerful pounce attack. And in vampire form, Dracula can cast the Hellfire spell, creating pillars of flame ahead of him or across low obstacles, that "sear flesh and render bone to ash".
</p>
<p>
Dracula - who comes with the Wretched Fate, Human Greed, and Dominance perks, as detailed in <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/465">Dead by Daylight's latest public test build release notes</a> - is joined by a new survivor, vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, first seen in 1989's Castlevania 3: Dracula's Curse. Trevor's Eyes of Belmont perk reveals the Killer for a set amount of time when a generator is completed, and his Exultation perk upgrades a held item rarity to the next tier whenever a Killer is stunned with a pallet. And finally, there's his Moment of Glory perk, which activates after opening or rummaging through two chests and automatically heals one health state when injured after a set amount of time.
</p>
<p>
Dead by Daylight's Castlevania Chapter is available now for public testing on PC, but it'll get its full release across all platforms on 27th August, when it'll cost around $7.99 USD.

Introduced in season 4's loot overhaul, Tempering recipes let players pick and choose which affixes to add to their gear. The more you play, the better the recipes you unlock. They’re supposed to be part of each season’s progression, but apparently something went awry with season 5 and players who collected them over the last few months still have access to all of their Legendary Tempering recipes on level 1 characters. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-uber-unique-harlequin-doombringer-season-5-1851611416&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-uber-unique-harlequin-doombringer-season-5-1851611416">Here’s How <em>Diablo IV</em>’s 8 Uber Unique Items Are Changing Next Season</a></span></p><p>Players immediately began to notice and wonder aloud on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1eloiim/all_tempering_manuals_already_unlocked_on_season_5/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1eloiim/all_tempering_manuals_already_unlocked_on_season_5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Diablo IV</em> subreddit</a></span> to one another if it was a bug. “It seems tempering manuals from season 4 have carried over to season 5,” wrote one player. “I already have legendary manuals in everything on my level 19 character.” It’s made leveling for those who played during last season, Loot Reborn, super fast. “Makes leveling so easy,” another player chimed in. “Max damage tempers + resource tempers.”</p><p>Global community development director Adam Fletcher weighed in on Twitter and confirmed this was unintentional but said players don’t have to worry about it being reversed any time soon. “We are aware of the reports that new seasonal characters are having their tempering recipes carried over from their last season’s seasonal character,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1820883605180277022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1820883605180277022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span>. “This isn’t the original design or intention so I wouldn’t expect this for future seasons but we are letting this one slide for Season 5.”</p><p>So if you already unlocked a full suite of Tempering recipes last season, you’re in luck. Grinding to the end game of Season of the Infernal Hordes should be a breeze. It remains to be seen how players fair against the new horde mode bosses. There’s two months to master them before <em>Diablo IV</em>’s<em> Vessel of Hatred</em> expansion drops in October. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
