			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/what-to-do-before-the-war-within-pre-patch-update-in-world-of-warcraft/">pre-patch</a> for the latest WoW expansion has been released, introducing the Warbands system to the game. For those who want to get stuck into the game but aren't sure what Warbands are, this guide will explain everything you need to know about the system.</p>
<p>While this <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24061008/the-war-within-warbands-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature is specific</a> to The War Within expansion for World of Warcraft, it has been released early to let players begin gearing up and preparing for the upcoming battles on August 26.</p>
<h2>What are Warbands?</h2>
<p>Warbands allow players to have account-wide progression across the characters in the Warband. Whether your characters are Horde or Alliance, in The War Within Renown, you gather one character that will transfer to all of your characters. There will also be a Warband bank to store items between all characters.</p>
<p>The most important thing to note about Warbands is that the characters are region-locked. For example, if you play across the EU and NA, you won't be able to put characters from both regions in the Warband. You can only have EU characters in an EU Warband and vice versa. However, suppose you have characters across multiple realms. In that case, you can have them all grouped in a Warband, eliminating the need to mail items and currencies between characters, which can be incredibly time-consuming.</p>
<p>Here is all of the shared content available across your Warband characters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achievements</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
<li>Transmogs</li>
<li>Currencies</li>
<li>Warbound Gear</li>
<li>Flight Paths</li>
<li>Dedicated Bank Space</li>
</ul>
<p>Warbands are one of the most valuable additions to World of Warcraft, as they allow players who use alts to progress faster through the game. For example, suppose you're running Mythic+ dungeons across multiple characters as soon as you unlock the Keystone Dungeon teleporters on one character. In that case, you'll then have access to them on your other characters.</p>
<p>The biggest pro of Warbands is that it converts character-specific WoW elements into account-wide elements so that players' achievements can be acknowledged. With the addition of the Warband-specific bank, players will gain access to five tabs with 98 inventory slots on each tab. It's important to note that if you want to utilize the bank, you must purchase the tabs for more gold per tab.</p>
<p>Warbands also introduces a new keyword for gear. This is "Warbound until Equipped," which means the gear can be transferred between characters. However, once equipped, it becomes Soulbound, and can no longer be transferred between your characters.</p>
<p>That's everything you need to know about Warbands in World of Warcraft and how you can utilize them in the upcoming expansion for WoW, The War Within.</p>

Ultimately, budget issues and Verbinski’s insistence on an R-rating led to the project falling through. With new budget issues facing the Netflix adaptation attempt, I’m sure fans are feeling a bit worried.That might not be the only issue facing Netflix’s <em>BioShock</em>, as the schedule of director Francis Lawrence may also cause issues. </p><p>While Lawrence remains attached to the project, the director has an ever-growing list of other films on his plate. As discussed by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/francis-lawrence-begins-filming-the-long-walk-adaptation-bioshock-movie-on-hold&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/francis-lawrence-begins-filming-the-long-walk-adaptation-bioshock-movie-on-hold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VG247</em></a></span>, Lawrence is currently shooting an adaptation of Stephen King’s <em>The Long Walk</em>, and will also helm the next <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel movie. Those are both closer on the horizon, but farther off projects like sequels to<em> I Am Legend</em> and <em>Constantine</em> could also mean <em>BioShock </em>may be in need of a new director before long. </p><p>With or without Lawrence, it seems that <em>BioShock </em>isn’t anywhere near shooting, let alone premiering in a theater near you, so fans will just have to wait and cross their fingers that even a smaller version of <em>BioShock </em>on the big screen will remain true to the game.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/7-days-to-die-difficulty-settings-explained/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>You have so many settings to tweak in 7 Days to Die before delving into the game for the first time. It can feel overwhelming. Here’s a complete rundown of the 7 Days to Die difficulty settings, along with which you should choose!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-7-days-to-die-difficulty-settings">What Are the 7 Days to Die Difficulty Settings?</h2>



<p>7 Days to Die launches into 1.0 with six difficulty settings, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Scavenger</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 50</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 200</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Adventurer</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 75</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 150</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Nomad</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 100</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 100</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 150</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 83</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Survivalist</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 200</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 66</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Insane</strong>
<ul>
<li>% Damage by Zombies: 250</li>



<li>% Damage by Player: 50</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Primarily, the various difficulty settings in the game alter the amount of damage you do to zombies and the amount of damage you take from zombies. You’ll absolutely notice the change in combat difficulty when increasing from Scavenger to Insane, for example.</p>



<p>Everything else about the game world remains the same, no matter the difficulty setting you choose!</p>







<h2 id="h-which-difficulty-is-right-for-you">Which Difficulty is Right For You?</h2>



<p>How much of a masochist are you? Playing on Survivalist or Insane is a sure way to wind up in a ditch somewhere before you visit the trader for the first time. But if you’re an experienced player, it might be the only challenge you eke out of the game these days.</p>



<p>For new players, I recommend playing no higher than Nomad. It’s essentially “Normal” in other games, though 7 Days to Die does recommend you play on Adventurer to start, which provides a slight buff.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 appears to be safe from the video game strike.</p>



<p>When news broke that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game voice actors and performers</a> were going on strike on July 26, many gamers started to wonder about what it would mean for major games in development. Specifically, what would it mean for GTA 6? </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto 6 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c12j12N4yVU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816829359878975818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ethan Gach of Kotaku</a>, not much at this moment.</p>



<p>Gach was told by a rep for the studios that GTA 6 is “exempt”  from the strike. </p>



<p>“While not struck, this game is produced by a struck company,” SAG-AFTRA says of work on GTA 6. “If you have been engaged under a daily contract for this game, you can show solidarity with your fellow union members by choosing not to sign new contracts on the game. However, you may work the game and will not be disciplined for doing so.”</p>



<p>Currently, GTA 6 is scheduled for a fall 2025 release. There had been rumors of a delay to 2026. However, at this moment, those remain just that, rumors.</p>

<p>Do you think GTA 6 will ultimately be delayed because of the video game strike?

A spokesperson for the group representing game publishers in the labor negotiations confirmed this to <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>.</p><p>"I can confirm GTA VI is exempt," the representative said, adding that any game that was in development prior to September 2023 is exempt as well. Live-service games are unaffected by the strike situation, too, so content for games like Fortnite should continue to release normally.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strike began today, July 26, at 12:01 AM</a>. It's the first time SAG-AFTRA video game actors have gone on strike since 2016, when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">work stoppage lasted for about one year. </a></p><p>SAG-AFTRA and game publishers like Warner Bros., Activision, Disney, and others, negotiated for about two years prior to the strike being called. The key sticking point appears to be regulation of generative AI technology.</p><p>The actors' union says protections against AI are necessary because without it, game companies could train AI to replace human talent. "We strike as a matter of last resort. We have given this process absolutely as much time as we responsibly can. We have exhausted the other possibilities, and that is why we’re doing it now," SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez said, as reported by <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sagaftra-video-game-performers-ai-strike-4f4c7d846040c24553dbc2604e5b6034" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Associated Press.</a></p><p>For its part, the video game publisher representative, Audrey Cooling, said the video game companies have offered "meaningful AI protections." Cooling added, "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA actors covered by the strike include more than 2,500 performers who do things like voiceover, motion capture, and stunts, along with singers and dancers, among other jobs.</p><p>In January, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sag-aftra-approves-ai-voice-acting-for-video-games/1100-6520224/">signed a controversial agreement</a> with AI voice software company Replica Studios. The agreement, which essentially approved AI voice acting in video games, was criticized by voice actors, many of whom <a href="https://x.com/blumspew/status/1744854178869211228" rel="nofollow ">claimed they were never consulted</a> about the agreement.</p><p>As for GTA VI, the game is slated to release in 2025, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">pretty much every Rockstar Games title in the past 10 years has been delayed.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-yasuke-apology-sucks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week Ubisoft, the company behind the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> series,<a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> felt the need to issue a lengthy statement</a> in response to complaints about its upcoming <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p><p>The game, set in 16th-century Japan, has been embroiled in a number of controversies since its reveal a few months back, from<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a minor scuffle over a flag in an art book</a> to<a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-earns-ire-of-japanese-people-with-inaccurate-architecture-costumes-and-etiquette/#:~:text=In%20terms%20of%20Japanese%20architecture,%2C%20with%20non%2Duniform%20borders." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> some more valid concerns over the game's architecture</a> (which is normally a series strongpoint) to<a href="https://x.com/mrjeffu/status/1815993456579461156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a minor conservative party trying and very much failing to make the game a political scapegoat</a>.</p><p>Then, you know, there's a lot of people's main issue: that one of the game's two protagonists (Yasuke) is a black man,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> despite him being an <em>actual historical figure</em></a>, which instantly makes him more historically-accurate than...any other <em>Assassin's Creed</em> protagonist, ever.</p><p>Normally the guys complaining about a black man in a video game are the same ones crying foul over historical accuracy, so this is a wonderful example of just how uninterested these guys are in...actual historical accuracy,<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-no-there-are-women-in-battlefield-v-1826275455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as I've written about previously</a>:</p><blockquote><p>To truly present something “accurate” to the time period would probably result in a game you wouldn’t really enjoy playing. What we often see in a “historical” FPS action game is just the visual trappings. And that’s okay—it’s a mass-market action game, not a history lesson.</p><p>What angry dorks mean when they say “historical accuracy” is not a game that’s accurate to the time being presented, then, but accurate to the aspects of that time (or the popular historical re-telling of it) that are sympathetic to their current political and cultural beliefs.</p><p>It doesn’t bother them that a randomly-created soldier with no training can jump behind the controls of a complex fighter aircraft, or expertly handle a cross-section of enemy weapons. They don’t care that the streets of European cities aren’t recreated 1:1, or that uniform details aren’t strictly adhered to, or that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>’s war is fought to time limits and kill counts.</p><p>Those things are acceptable compromises. It’s a video game, and those are video game things that the Second World War just needs to accommodate with its representation in order to work. Yet introduce something as relatively harmless (it has zero impact on gameplay!) as women or black soldiers where historically there were none, and suddenly the sky is falling.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>The perfect response to dealing with shitheads like this is to simply live your life pretending they don't exist.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Their opinions are ill-formed, bigoted and unsuitable for mainstream consumption, and so should be ignored at all costs</a>. Let them howl at the moon all they want, let their furious emails wash against the walls of your inbox, these people simply are not worth your time.</p><p>Those of us in the media learned that lesson a <em>long </em>time ago. A decade ago, in fact, when Gawker's Max Read wrote "<a href="https://www.gawkerarchives.com/how-we-got-rolled-by-the-dishonest-fascists-of-gamergat-1649496579" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How We Got Rolled by the Dishonest Fascists of Gamergate</a>", an evergreen piece on the dangers of confusing a bunch of angry tweets with a movement of any significant size or importance. You do not, and should not, have to listen to these pricks!</p><p>Yet here we are, in 2024, and Ubisoft hasn't learned a damn thing. While the apology appears at first to be mostly addressed to the series' Japanese fans (<a href="https://x.com/JusticeKazzy_/status/1815820378482303058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of whom, being actual fans of a series that has long played loose with history, won't care!</a>), it also touches on the matter of Yasuke's place in history, which is a <em>wild </em>thing to commit to public record.</p><p>As Trone Dowd<a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-apology-yasuke-racist-trolls?s=03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> put so well on <em>Inverse</em></a>:</p><blockquote><p>...by issuing this weird, non-explanation for the very normal creative decision to tell its version of a popular historical figure’s story, Ubisoft only lent legitimacy to bad faith complaints seeped in racism. The vocal minority didn’t take issue with the many historical inaccuracies of the series past. For nearly two decades, they seemed perfectly satiated by a prompt telling them Assassin’s Creed is “inspired by historical events and characters,” not painstakingly recreating them. But these gamers launched a cultural battle once they knew they’d occasionally have to step into the shoes of a Black figure in Japan.</p><p>Ubisoft didn’t have to explain its creative decisions. It shouldn’t spoon-feed obvious answers to a delusional movement based on bigotry. But it did. And by doing so, it’s validated a straw man argument bolstered by people who have no zero interest in the quality of the game and the simpletons who’ve decided to fall for their grift. Instead of smothering it with logic and standing firmly by its artistic vision, Ubisoft has needlessly poured gasoline onto a smoldering fire. And now, the most annoying trolls on the internet will likely never shut up about it.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This fucking sucks. Ubisoft, you should know better, and for everyone creatively involved in the game who had no part in issuing this spineless statement, I'm sorry you're having to continue putting up with this.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-remasters-leaked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Two&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>remasters appear to have been leaked by merchandise spotted by eagle-eyed attendees at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered-branding-seen-at-sdcc.937002/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra thread created by user Mama Robotnik</a>, cards bearing the legend "<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver I &amp; II Remastered</em>" were spotted at Comic-Con. The cards also bear the logo of developer Crystal Dynamics, along with a QR code.</p>
<p>Scanning the code takes you to a page on which you can sign up for the newsletter of Dark Horse Comics, whose logo is also featured on the cards. Per a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soul-reaver-remasters-seemingly-confirmed-by-a-statue-at-comic-con/1100-6525310/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GameSpot report</a>, the cards were next to a statue depicting&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver</em>'s main characters Raziel and Kain, and Dark Horse will be handling that statue's launch in August.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=RrjIgwa7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-defiance-raziel.jpg?itok=N5Yk-HNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The last proper&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>game was 2003's&nbsp;<em>Defiance</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Per GameSpot, Dark Horse wouldn't say anything about the remasters, and the cards depicting the games' names had been taken away by the time the publication's staff arrived at the relevant booth.</p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics is one of the studios that survived the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter">great Embracer purge</a> of the last year or so, and the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>is still firmly under the studio's stewardship.</p>
<p>Remastered versions of&nbsp;<em>Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>and its direct sequel would be a good way to test the waters for a potential new project, but honestly, I'd just be happy to see Raziel and Kain return again.</p>
<p>Who'll be handling the remaster is another matter entirely; Crystal Dynamics' logo being on the Comic-Con cards would seem to imply they'll be working on the games, but it could equally be a different studio entirely, as was the case for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered">this year's&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=9dA-ocMU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tomb-raider-remasters-soul-reaver.jpg?itok=v03DEyLz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We've already had three remasters of beloved PlayStation-era platforming-heavy action-adventure games this year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's anyone's guess right now, but Aspyr would seem like a fairly obvious choice, although that studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-aspyr-response">work with the&nbsp;<em>Battlefront&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> might give Crystal Dynamics and Embracer pause for thought.</p>
<p>In any case, it looks like the revival of the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain&nbsp;</em>franchise might be imminent after twenty years of dormancy. We don't talk about&nbsp;<em>Nosgoth</em>. Stay tuned for more!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/26/fall-in-love-with-sexy-household-objects-in-date-everything<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>In Date Everything, those looking for romance don’t need to look any further than their refrigerator, smoke alarm, or dining room table. That’s because this wacky sandbox dating sim by developer Sassy Chap is all about forming relationships with everyday household objects that, it turns out, are actually pretty hot.</p>

<p>The game bestows players with special “Dateviator” glasses that allow them to speak with objects and see them in their true, absurdly attractive forms. Dozens of objects await your affection – even elements like air and water can be courted – and branching dialogue can lead to three relationship resolutions for each character (Love, Friend, Hate). Whatever you decide will be reflected in the ever-changing 3D overworld that is your house.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlxxzmOXRf0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Date Everything boasts over 100 voiced characters played by performers that include Felicia Day (<em>Critical Role</em>, <em>Supernatural</em>), Johnny Yong Bosch (<em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</em>, <em>Bleach</em>), and Grey DeLisle (<em>Scooby-Doo, Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>). Given the huge amount of speaking roles, Date Everything boasts 1.2 million words and 70,000 voiced lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Date Everything looks delightfully silly, but it unfortunately doesn’t have a release window. It will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-gets-swathe-of-discounts-ahead-of-closure">Microsoft announced a raft of discounts on Xbox 360 digital games</a> back in May.

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-resurfaces-with-new-footage-and-geforce-rtx-logo/">Lost Soul Aside</a> gameplay footage was shared today, providing a new look at the game by Ultizero Games that has been in development for quite a long time.</p>
<p>The new footage, which was shared today during a presentation held during Chinajoy 2024, showcases a tutorial fight as well as a fight against a new boss and a new weapon. Sadly, the game doesn't seem to be in great shape, as gameplay looks clunky and not particularly inspired. Hopefully, things will be improved before the game launches on a yet to be confirmed release date. You can check out the footage below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/lost-soul-aside-chinajoy-2024-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>.</p>

<p>Lost Soul Aside began development as a solo project by Yang Bing, who later created the development studio Ultizero Games to complete the development of the game. Inspired by Final Fantasy Versus XIII, which eventually became Final Fantasy XV, the game will be a character action game in the vein of Devil May Cry, where players will have to deal with powerful enemies using a variety of combat techniques.</p>
<p>Despite having been in development for a long time, Lost Soul Aside still lacks a release window. We will let you know when the game releases as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>As reported <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/dynasty-warriors-origins-details-story-battles-with-largest-number-of-soldiers-in-series-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gematsu</a>, Koei Tecmo showed off 13 minutes of new footage for Dynasty Warriors: Origins, revealing cinematic story beats, combat, and key mechanics.</p>



<p>The new gameplay demo is already on YouTube across multiple channels, featuring story-driven gameplay. The cutscenes showcase familiar characters from previous games like Zhang Jiao and Guan Yu. </p>



<p>The combat revealed some of the special abilities that players will have, and more realism compared to past titles in the series. Notably, there are also shots of blocking mechanics and camera angles. </p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/koeitecmoeurope/status/1816722641673179583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, Koei Tecmo summarized the story, emphasizing that it takes place “a year before the Yellow Turban Rebellion.” It also centers on a single protagonist with amnesia.</p>

</div></figure>







<p>Developer Omega Force first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-revealed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> at PlayStation’s latest State of Play event in May 2024. However, that only included a purely cinematic trailer, and did not reveal gameplay footage of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>



<p>The new ChinaJoy 2024 demo also reveals coordinated enemy AI, and a map where players can select a battlefield. It further reveals how players can briefly assume control of popular characters nearby. Fans also widely praised the music, which plays a large role in the series’ beloved attitude.</p>



<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins still doesn’t have a concrete release date at this time, though it will launch in 2025. It will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>Paradox Interactive isn’t doing to great right now. The company <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024-correction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released its second quarter financial</a> results on Thursday, and with it came the revelation that Paradox Interactive’s profits have fallen from $27.1 million to just $2.6 million year over year.</p>



<p>That drop of 90% can be attributed to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-cancels-life-by-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of the life simulator</a> Life By You. A write down of $19.3 million is included in the profits, leading to the collapse.</p>



<p>As far as year-over-year revenue, that fell 22% to $53.3 million from $68.3 million.</p>



<p>In his comments on the financial reports, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester says that he, and the company, have mixed feelings about where things stand right now.</p>



<p>“On the one hand, our core business has performed very well, but on the other hand, we made the difficult decision to cancel the release of Life by You, as the game would not be able to meet our expectations,” he said. </p>



<p>“Looking at the quarter’s results, we’ve released several strong expansions with good quality to our core games, which has a positive impact on the top line and provides a good cash flow from operating activities. The bottom line is sadly weighed down by the write-down of Life by You. It is painful but gives us a strong motivation to further improve our operations.”</p>



<p>In addition to the cancellation of Life By You, Paradox has been trying to get back into the good graces of players after the launch of Cities: Skylines 2. The game has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagued by various problems</a> since release, and the game’s console release has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-release-window-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been delayed time and time again</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hotel-barcelona-preview-a-game-by-2-japanese-legends-that-has-you-fight-alongside-yourself<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Overcome challenges with unique gameplay systems.</h2></div><section><p>Created as a collaborative effort between Japanese gaming legends SWERY and SUDA51, Hotel Barcelona has a unique premise in which your present and past self fight alongside each other. It is an action game in which previous defeats can lead to victory.</p><p>The backstory has a simple, The Purge-adjacent premise: While once a luxury hotel, today Hotel Barcelona is a place where serial killers gather from all over the United States. It is a nightmarish place where the nastiest criminals come and do whatever they want.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I got to play a stage set at a camping site where I had to deal with a devilish homicidal maniac named Jacob. His face was covered by not only a hockey mask, but also a football face guard, reminiscent of Friday the 13th killer Jason Voorhees. </p><p>Hotel Barcelona’s base is an orthodox 2D action game. You place as Justine and can use both melee and long-range attacks to defeat enemies, until you reach a giant boss at the end of the stage. Collecting resources along the way allows you to permanently upgrade your character. Like a roguelite, Hotel Barcelona has a high difficulty and expects you to retry stages over and over. Those stages unfold over multiple branching paths, with healing items and stat buffs that can be obtained along the way. Hordes of normal enemies will stand in your way, and there are some additional foes hiding behind tufts of grass for surprise attacks as well. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When you die, you have a chance to make upgrades before embarking on your next run, with the ghost of your previous run fighting alongside you.</p></div><p>Luckily, Hotel Barcelona, due out later this year for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC,  introduces the Phantom mechanic to help you on your way. When you die, you have a chance to make upgrades before embarking on your next run, with the ghost of your previous run fighting alongside you. While you can’t control this phantom, it will attack enemies based on your previous life when you were controlling them, and it also draws aggro from your enemies. Since the phantom only repeats a previous run, its attacks can often miss as well, but since there are so many enemies on screen, it is often helpful. You can stack up a maximum of three phantoms based on your previous three lives alongside your current run.</p><p>You can use tactics such as staying behind the phantom to use it as a shield, or by luring enemies into your phantom’s attacks. I tried to be the decoy myself too, but this proved difficult as there is no skill that has the enemies focus on Justine’s attacks.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The special attack gauge decreases as time progresses, demanding the player to stay aggressive the whole time in order to fill the gauge.</p></div><p>Hotel Barcelona puts an emphasis on offensive tactics rather than defensive, with a gauge for special attacks that can be filled by gathering enemy blood. Once the gauge is full, a devastating attack against all enemies on screen can be utilized. This attack is not only effective against normal foes, but deals a lot of damage against a boss as well. The special attack gauge decreases as time progresses, demanding the player to stay aggressive the whole time in order to fill the gauge.</p><p>Jacob is a fierce boss with frequent wide range attacks. There’s not much you can do if you fight him by yourself, but your phantoms can lure or attack him, giving you a fighting chance. While I still wasn’t able to defeat him during my playtime, effective use of upgrades, special attacks and the Phantom mechanic should make it possible in the long run.</p><p><em>Written by Ryuichi Kataoka</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Valve has unveiled changes to how demos work on Steam, as the company is aiming to make them easier to discover. These updates will see demos redesigned to be more like standalone games on the platform, giving them their own store page separate from the main game's hub. The benefit to this is that the demo page can contain separate screenshots, trailers, and details on these slices of the full game to help set them apart and give potential players more accurate information. You'll also be able to add demos to your collection without needing to download it straight away, and when it's uninstalled, it'll also be removed from your library.</p><p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/6233628070477025191" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Valve</a>, these changes are driven by developer and player feedback, and players can expect to receive alerts for demos of wishlisted games. Pages for demos will include buttons to install the content, leave user reviews, and be redirected to the game's main page. Valve also plans to list demos more frequently on Steam's most-visited pages and include them alongside free-to-play games to "better balance them" with paid products.</p><p>The company also clarified that the Steam icon for game demos is not based on a dinner plate, but is instead a reference to ancient CD-ROM technology from a bygone era of gaming. "That classic icon, my friend, is from the days when demos were commonly distributed through the post office, contained in a bound package of game journalism printed on dead trees and imprinted on circular media known as Compact Discs," Valve explained.</p><p>Overall, these plans are designed to increase the visibility of demos, which will come in handy during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-25-steam-next-fest-game-demos-you-need-to-download-right-now/2900-5474/" data-ref-id="2900-5474">Steam Next Fest</a>. This is a week-long celebration where fans can try out demos from hundreds of games and give early feedback to developers, and the next instance of it will kick off on October 14. Next week will also see the launch of Tower Defense Fest on July 29, for PC gamers looking to try out previews of games in that genre.</p>

		<p><em>Image credit: SAG-AFTRA</em></p>
<p>The US Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) has called a strike by voice actors on work with key video game publishers and developers, pushing back against proposed contracts that would enable the use of AI generated voices and performances in video games. However, work can continue on games deep into production… for now.</p>


<p>The ten companies facing the strike are Activision, Blindlight, Disney Character Voices, Electronic Arts, Epic Games, Formosa Interactive, Insomniac Games, Take 2 Productions, VoiceWorks Productions, and WB Games.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher said, “We’re not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse A.I. to the detriment of our members. Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live — and work — with, we will be here, ready to negotiate.”</p>
<p>Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland added in a separate statement, “The video game industry generates billions of dollars in profit annually. The driving force behind that success is the creative people who design and create those games. That includes the SAG-AFTRA members who bring memorable and beloved game characters to life, and they deserve and demand the same fundamental protections as performers in film, television, streaming, and music: fair compensation and the right of informed consent for the AI use of their faces, voices, and bodies. Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year – that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to AI, and the public supports us in that.”</p>

<p>As a rebuttal, a spokesperson for the video game producers group said, “We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA’s concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p>
<p>It could take a while for the effects of this to be truly felt. Per Kotaku’s <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1816797825444753673">Ethan Gach</a>, games that have been in development for more than a year, and live service games can continue with union actors, though new and early projects cannot. Given that games can now very easily take 5 years to complete, there’s plenty room for this strike to escalate, especially as motion capture is a time consuming endeavour.</p>
<p>Given the timing, SAG-AFTRA has said that actors can take part in San Diego Comic Con panels which run through this weekend. Ordinarily all promotional work would also be halted, from awards shows to conventions and even social media posts.</p>
<p>The strike comes <a href="https://deadline.com/2023/09/sag-aftra-approve-strike-video-game-industry-1235555756/">ten months after members voted to authorise a strike</a>, and in the wake of the 2023 strike by SAG-AFTRA actors for TV and film, in which the use of generative AI and digital recreation were key points. Where the TV and film strike was also concerned with residual payments and the like, it’s the threat that generative AI poses to almost the entire video game voice actor industry that is really in the limelight here.</p>
<p>Generative AI has come on leaps and bounds in the last few years, and while still a million miles away from what we would traditionally think of as being AI – that’d be a self-aware computer, as opposed to what would more accurately be called ‘Machine Learning’ – it is already capable of synthesising a person’s voice from relatively few audio samples. There’s still things like needing to be able to convey emotion and the nuances of a performance and reading, but developers have already been using generative AI for things like the announcer in extraction shooter <a href="https://gamerant.com/the-finals-beta-criticized-ai-voices-voice-acting/">The Finals in open beta</a>, where a somewhat robotic performance is fairly in keeping with the tone of the game, and other titles have also used AI as placeholder until the latter stages of development.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-overhauls-steam-demos-with-separate-store-pages-and-more.937614/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-overhauls-steam-demos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has announced a new Steam update which will overhaul the way demos work on the storefront, so you should start seeing some changes to demos soon.</p>
<p>The update isn't a client-side one, so you won't have anything new to download. Rather, it's bringing a new suite of tools that devs and publishers can use to make demos "an even more powerful and flexible marketing tool", according to Valve.</p>
<p>First up, demos can now be added to your library without downloading them; a new "add to library" button has been added to demo pages beside the "download" button, so you can set them up for downloading later if you prefer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-page.jpg?itok=d2bYZrna 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-page.jpg?itok=f0X3bvQw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can now add Steam demos to your library to play them later.</figcaption></figure><p>It's now possible for publishers to create a separate store page for their demos if they wish. At the moment, any demo listings on Steam simply redirect to the main game's page, but in future, you might start seeing distinct pages for game demos.</p>
<p>As a result of this, it's also possible for user reviews to start appearing on separate demo pages, which should be a good way to give players a better idea of whether a demo is worth installing or not. Hey, it's all valuable storage space!</p>
<p>Valve says that demos will also start appearing more often on Steam store lists like New &amp; Trending, New on Steam, and "relevant tag and category pages".</p>
<p>In essence, this means that when developers and publishers launch a demo on Steam, it'll be treated more like a full free game (in terms of listings and visibility, at least) than a straightforward demo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-trending.jpg?itok=pZCDwax9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steam-demo-overhaul-new-trending.jpg?itok=xf6Gv9MG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may well start seeing demos on Steam's New &amp; Trending page soon.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a developer and you're wondering what else you might need to know as a result of this demo overhaul, make sure to check out Valve's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563" rel="noopener" target="_blank">full announcement</a> for some extra details, plus an amusingly-titled "infrequently asked questions" section.</p>
<p>This demo overhaul follows on from a newly-introduced Steam feature in the form of new game recording tools, which were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-game-recording-beta">introduced in beta back in June</a>. Given that Steam players once again <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/steam-player-count-record-sale">broke the platform's concurrent user total</a> during this year's summer sale, it seems these features are still in high demand.</p>

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss the downsides and upsides of the video game battle pass.
</p>
<p>In a week where PlayStation live-service hopeful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-next-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass">Concord trumpeted the fact it won't sell you a battle pass as a marketing beat</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-studio-u-turns-on-controversial-real-money-battle-pass-changes">Apex Legends dialled back (some of) its battle pass changes</a> following fan fury, we consider the options available to video game makers hoping to ensure their latest releases keep being played - and paid for - well after release.</p>
<p>Would more people play Concord if it was a free-to-play title with a battle pass? Or is it better served by being a £40 launch? Not everyone can promise they'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-will-never-charge-money-for-dlc-or-updates">never sell post-launch content, as Stardew Valley's creator did</a> this week. But there's clearly a balance to be struck to ensure players don't feel fleeced, particularly when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-will-have-a-battle-pass-limited-to-cosmetics-report">full-priced launches like Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> are getting in on the act too. Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remnant-ii-gets-third-dlc-delay-announcement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Remnant II, a 2023 game, has been announced to receive its third and final DLC. This announcement accompanies the game's first anniversary, which has been over a year. The DLC will be titled The Dark Horizon and released in September 2024.&nbsp; This DLC will take players back to the depths of N'Erud, where a peculiar phenomenon has taken over the surrounding area, and it's up to you to uncover it.</p>
<p>Originally, Gunfire Games, the developer behind Remnant II, wanted all three DLCs released by the game's first anniversary. However, they have since decided to delay the third DLC. They do this to make the DLC as polished as possible and "deliver you the best possible experience you deserve."</p>
<p>The Dark Horizon, the third DLC, is set to be the most expansive of the three that Remnant II will receive. Players can expect to see more of "the Remnant greatness you've come to expect." In addition to the DLC in progress, they are creating a brand-new game mode that will be free to everyone who owns Remnant II.</p>
<p>While the upcoming game mode has minimal details, Gunfire Games has revealed that a new progression system will be specifically tailored to it. The developers say they will reveal more information about this game mode and The Dark Horizon DLC "soon."</p>
<p>Gunfire Games&nbsp;<span>has&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4364635226638976270" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed their sadness</a> in having to delay the DLC, going on to say, "While we're not happy about delaying this DLC release -- one you've been itching to jump into already—</span>we feel very lucky to see your ongoing support and loyalty to the Remnant franchise." While they go on to express their joy at the positivity pouring out from the Remnant community, Steam's reviews suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Both currently released DLCs have mixed reviews, while Remnant II has a primarily positive rating. Regarding The Forgotten Kingdom, players felt that the DLC was more of the same as the base game and couldn't distinguish the difference between the two. In addition, because it lacked a proper end-game, players struggled to see where this DLC slotted in.</p>
<p>Compared to The Forgotten Kingdom, The Awakened King receives slightly better reviews. While players found boss fights enjoyable, they said the area needed to be tuned better. The reasons for tuning were split; some said the bosses were too strong, while others said they were too weak. In addition, players felt it recycled content and assets from the base game rather than giving the DLC its flair.</p>
<p>While Gunfire Games does not specify a specific date for releasing more information on the new DLC, they promise that it will be soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/top-esports-games-india/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Esports is experiencing rapid growth in India, garnering increasing interest from the younger generation as a viable career path. Mobile gaming prevails as the dominant sector within the Indian esports landscape, with most gamers favouring this platform over PC or console gaming.</p>



<p>As a result, games such as BGMI, COD Mobile, and Free Fire hold greater prominence than Dota 2 or LoL. Furthermore, the best Indian esports teams actively engage in mobile gaming competitions, recognizing this platform as pivotal for engaging the audience. Let us now explore some of the top esports games in India.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bgmi">BGMI</h2>



<p>The battle royale game developed by Krafton is arguably one of India’s most popular esports titles. The game has a turbulent history, as it first replaced Tencent’s battle royale title when PUBG, along with a host of other Chinese applications, was banned from the country in 2022. Later, BGMI was banned from India in 2022 and returned to Android and iOS stores in May 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="OFFICIAL LAUNCH of BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE INDIA | Download Now" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZO2-ytt8W84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Since its triumphant return, BGMI has regained its former glory and surpassed it, hosting some of India’s most intense and watched esports competitions in recent months. The game’s revival has been nothing short of a spectacle, with top tournaments like the BGMI Masters Series, BGIS, Skyesports Champions Series, and more drawing in massive audiences.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-nbsp">Valorant&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Despite the overwhelming dominance of mobile gaming in India, Valorant has managed to carve a niche among the best esports games in India. The game’s unique 5v5 FPS tactical shooter format, coupled with Riot’s strategic promotional efforts, has piqued the interest of Indian gamers. The introduction of an Indian hero, Harbor, has further bolstered the game’s popularity, promising an exciting future for Valorant in the Indian esports scene.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="VALORANT CONSOLE ANNOUNCE // Gameplay Trailer - VALORANT" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GAkFklRvhjU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Valorant is one of the few non-mobile games that has made its mark in the country, and Riot will soon make an effort to make their other premier esports game, League of Legends, one of the top esports games in India. Some Valorant competitions where the best Indian esports teams play include the Valorant Challengers Series, Skyesports League, and more.&nbsp;</p>







<h2 id="h-pokemon-unite">Pokemon UNITE</h2>



<p>Back to my point of the top esports in India residing in mobile games, Pokemon UNITE is the next game on the list. Pokemon UNITE burst into the Indian esports scene in 2021, and many players jumped onto the free-to-play MOBA Pokemon game. Since then, it has become a favourite at esports competitions in the country. The famous esports tournaments for this game include Pokemon UNITE Pro League, Pokemon UNITE Championship Series and more.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="🎊 The Pokémon UNITE 3rd Anniversary is here! 🎊" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xLc1kEIIlJM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2">Counter-Strike 2</h2>



<p>Counter-Strike has always been a fan favourite in the Indian esports scene, with CS: GO being one of the most popular esports games in the country. Counter-Strike is close to most Indian gamers’ hearts as it is one of the first multiplayer games that most gamers come across, thanks to the country’s cybercafe culture.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Counter-Strike 2 - Official Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c80dVYcL69E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>However, Counter-Strike 2 is still relatively new, and there have been hardly any esports competitions in India until now. At the same time, Valve’s first-person shooter has much global history in the esports scene, and the game will pick up in India in the coming years. Popular esports CS2 competitions include Skyesports Championship, Skyesports Masters, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-cod-mobile">COD Mobile</h2>



<p>Lastly, we have COD Mobile, Tencent’s popular mobile port for Activision’s flagship first-person shooter. COD Mobile took India by storm when it was released, setting staggering first-week download records. Naturally, the game became a staple in Indian esports tournaments, boasting intense action and top-notch first-person gameplay for mobile gaming titles.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty®: Mobile - Official Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4b8FRUDNZo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>COD Mobile fans have several tournaments to watch in India, including the Call of Duty Mobile India Cup, Call of Duty Mobile India Challenge, Snapdragon Pro Series and more.&nbsp;This diversity makes it one of the top Indian esports.</p>



<h2 id="h-honourable-mention">Honourable Mention</h2>



<p>When compiling a list of the top esports games in India, one cannot overlook Garena’s Free Fire, a beloved title in the esports community. Despite its ban, announcing an India-specific version of Free Fire on the horizon has reignited hope and anticipation among fans.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Free Fire Official Trailer | Free Fire Official" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oq2Rz2I11l0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

                <p>Epic Games has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/epic-s-new-game-strategy-for-mobile-stores" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it will be removing Fortnite and its other games from the Samsung Galaxy Store in protest today, claiming that Samsung is engaging in anticompetitive practices.</p><p>Epic Games said that Samsung's decision to block sideloading by default on Samsung Android devices stifles competition in the Android app distribution market. Due to the restriction on sideloading, Samsung users are only allowed to install apps from the Google Play Store and Galaxy Store.</p><p>However, Epic Games has a new solution in mind. Due to the European Union passing the Digital Markets Act, Epic Games is now able to create its own storefront for Android worldwide and iOS in the EU. The storefront will only be charging game developers with a 12% processing fee and nothing on third-party payments.</p><p>Additionally, Epic Games revealed that its mobile games will go to AltStore on iOS in the EU, and it will announce support for at least two other third-party stores soon.</p><p>Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-calls-out-apple-for-arbitrary-rejection-of-its-new-app-store/1100-6524733/" data-ref-id="1100-6524733">recently called out Apple</a> for "arbitrary" rejections of its new app store, claiming that Apple was misusing its app-review process by delaying competitors for as long as possible. Fortnite has been removed from iOS since 2020, but it looks like it may be coming back eventually.</p>
