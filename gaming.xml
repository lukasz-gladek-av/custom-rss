              <p>Looking to grab a new laptop, but don’t want to drain your savings doing it? You’re in luck because Dell has an incredible deal running on one of its most versatile models right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">The 15.6-inch Dell Vostro laptop is currently sitting at $600 on Amazon, a massive 70% off its usual price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving almost $1,400 on a machine that is powerful enough to handle both work and play well. Of course, deals like this don’t stick around for long, so we recommend acting fast to get your orders in before it expires or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Finish, Powerful Specs</h2>
<p>This sleek laptop flaunts a matte finish for that classic, premium look. The screen is a 15.6-inch Full HD display that pushes brilliant, sharp visuals while keeping them easier on the eyes. You’re getting narrow borders for a larger screen real estate, plus a 120Hz refresh rate that keeps everything smooth, even when you’re playing fast-paced games. The keyboard is also full-sized, featuring a 10-key numeric keypad. Typing for longer hours is going to be comfortable; just note that it’s not backlit.</p>
<p>For power, you have a 13th Gen Intel 5-core processor that outperforms older chips like the i5-1145G. It’s made for resource-intensive tasks, so working with heavier apps and pushing some creative boundaries won’t be an issue. Pair that with 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and you’ve got yourself a full-fledged multitasking companion that’s ready to take on your most productive, busiest days. There’s a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD storage built in. This is enough space to house all your important data, media content, and even games. SSD is also much faster than HDD, so you can expect significantly faster boot times than traditional drives.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, plus a ton of ports to connect all your essentials. These include USB 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 1, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C (data only), HDMI 1.4, SD 3.0 card slot, headset jack, and a Flip-Down RJ-45 Ethernet port. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there, whether you’re planning to use it for work, studies, or streaming.</p>
<p>Altogether, this is a great chance to grab this powerful laptop for significantly less. Just be sure to grab the deal quickly, as it might wrap up soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">We don’t expect to see another one this massive before Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>

<p>Use these Effortless Tower monthly codes for October 2025 in Roblox to gain some much-needed Skips in the game, allowing you to ease past the levels that you get stuck at.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effortless Tower is one of the many obby (obstacle course) games in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-prison-pump-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>, where players are tasked with simply getting from one point to another without hitting any of the obstacles in the way. Although many obby games on Roblox tend to be quite challenging, Effortless Tower offers a more enjoyable difficulty, making it a better option for players looking simply for a fun experience. There are over 5000 levels in Effortless Tower, each offering a different kind of challenge. Some, however, can be too difficult to surpass for some players, and this is where the Skips that can be acquired through codes come into the picture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players progress through the levels by simply moving around, jumping, and climbing, and each level is harder than the previous one. The game also offers players the option to teleport to the previous checkpoint with just a single clip, making it a very beginner-friendly gameplay experience.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of Bayonetta, Devil May Cry, and more feels that unique gameplay mechanics are more important than graphics in action games. </p>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bayonetta-director-hideki-kamiya-says-pretty-graphics-alone-dont-do-much-for-him-a-good-action-game-needs-mechanics-no-other-game-has/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya discussed the progress 3D action games have made lately and what he feels is most important in the genre for players and developers. Kamiya has been at the forefront of action games for a very long time and has delivered some of the biggest games in the genre. </p>



<h2 id="h-hideki-kamiya-wants-to-see-unique-experiences-which-only-that-one-game-can-offer">Hideki Kamiya Wants to See Unique Experiences Which “Only That One Game Can Offer”</h2>



<p>Kamiya first spoke about how he approaches new games, revealing that he will work on creating “a unique gameplay mechanic that can only be experienced in that game.” He elaborated with examples of systems he developed for games like Bayonetta and Okami. Bayonetta had a Witch Time system that slowed time whenever the player dodged an enemy’s attack. Okami has the Celestial Brush system, which lets players “directly affect the game world by drawing.”</p>



<p>The Bayonetta creator explained that as a player, he wants to “get excited by the unique experiences which only that one game can offer”, rather than improved graphics.&nbsp;Kamiya then praised how far 3D action games have come. He first spoke about how there weren’t many 3D action games for some years, but recently there has been a surge in “a lot of stylish, combo-based action titles.” He concluded, stating, “It’s amazing to me that someone can just start making a game and end up with something of that quality.”&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Through two separate Nintendo Direct presentations, producer Masahiro Sakurai has waxed informative about his team's next project, Kirby Air Riders, for a combined one hour and 49 minutes. During today's Direct, Sakurai confirmed that, when the game launches in November, what you see is what you get--there will be no downloadable content coming post-launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement came toward the end of the presentation, just as Sakurai was getting ready to sign off. "Just so you know, we're not planning any DLC. Everything is here," Sakurai said. He then confirmed that there are no plans to continue the Kirby Air Riders format going forward, saying he's "not planning on making this an ongoing series."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589678-kirby-air-riders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589678" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589678-kirby-air-riders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589678"></a><figcaption>Kirby Air Riders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4589678-kirby-air-riders.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I've thrown everything I have into this game from the start," Sakurai continued. "So, I hope you don't miss this opportunity."</p><p dir="ltr">The full Direct livestream showed that Kirby Air Riders players will not be lacking for content, however, as multiple new modes, characters, costumes, and more were presented throughout the hour-long broadcast. Among the announcements were a story mode called Road Trip, multiple new characters, and My Machine, where players can build and customize their own air riders to take into races.</p><p dir="ltr">The Direct also confirmed that multiple key features from the original Kirby Air Ride would return in Kirby Air Riders. All nine tracks from the original Kirby Air Ride will be included in this new game, bringing the total number of tracks to 18, while Top Ride--a mode where players race from a top-down perspective rather than the traditional on-track view--will also be included.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide/1100-6534089/" data-ref-id="1100-6534089">Kirby Air Riders</a> is set to launch November 20 exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

PDS Black, one of the development teams under the Paradox umbrella, has a rigorous system in place to address feedback and provide post-release support. Deciding when to move on and allocate resources into the next thing, however, continues to be tricky.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”It has to happen,“&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;producer Maria-Lucia Dzediti told Game Developer during an interview at Tokyo Game Show. “Sometimes it’s circumstances that decide it rather than us wanting to. You have a super creative and passionate team, they would love to keep working on the same thing for three years if it meant having a perfect, flawless experience. But it’s about prioritizing.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to game breaking bugs, the team seeks to address them as soon as possible. As for “nice to have’s” suggested by players, the team usually considers them for future work plans, including free patches, since they are committed to releasing at least one free patch for every paid release. These patches address, among other things, past community concerns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">”We basically keep a backlog and our community team is super good at finding that on the forums, prioritizing it, keeping an active backlog and then updating with every release,” Dzediti said. “We have a collection of these. And then, I don't know, it's like playing darts, you just shoot. We have an internal process where we prioritize these and see what works best with the staffing we have for a particular release at a certain point in time, and try to put them in there.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/survey-shows-young-players-feel-pressured-to-conform-to-gender-and-racial-stereotypes" target="_self" data-discover="true">Survey shows young players feel pressured to conform to gender and racial stereotypes</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There are always things to tweak in a huge, complex game">There are always things to tweak in a huge, complex game</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But as QA manager Riad Deneche told Game Developer, the team reviews this internal process after every release, as there are “always things to tweak.” This is due to the fact that the team considers the DLC support of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;to be live service, which constitutes different development considerations from making the base game. Every DLC brings an opportunity to learn and bring in, as Deneche said, new ways of working that are more focused and efficient.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Back on September 9, PDS Black released&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coronations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, adding to the extensive DLC for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Players quickly scrutinized it, however, primarily due to a bug that caused a problem with oaths. The developer issued a fix to address this and other issues within 24 hours of release, while also including an apology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coronations</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;was not up to the standard you deserve, and that’s on me,” reads a post penned by Deneche in the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/update-1-17-0-1-a-long-overdue-apology.1858561/">Paradox forums</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. “As the QA manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the QA vision we have set out. It is clear we didn’t give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-secrets-of-dead-cells-smart-constraints-unlocking-the-vault-3" target="_self" data-discover="true">The secrets of Dead Cells' smart constraints - Unlocking the Vault #3</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked about what said standard constitutes, the QA manager said that it’s important for the team to keep a “certain stance of quality that people expect from our games.” This stance includes the technical standard of a game running well and not having any major issues, as well as the fun factor. QA, for example, doesn’t just test functionality but also fantasies, as it’s fundamental for a game like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;to ensure that historical niches work properly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“[The players are] very dedicated people, they can’t expect any less than us also being dedicated [to] the game itself,” Deneche said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Working in parallel with several DLCs at the same time has taught the team many lessons throughout the years. One of them has been to not focus too narrowly, to look at the big picture, deciding on different priorities based on the scope of each release, considering the testing involved. This is important considering that everything added to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;intertwines with a myriad of existing and forthcoming DLC.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dead-or-alive-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away-at-58" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Once you keep adding content to the game, you have to make sure it works with what you already have in the game, and the thing you'll be adding in five years from now,” Dzediti said. “The team that was there when we released the live game, you don't know when you're going to release a game that this is what keeping it alive five years into is going to look like.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“But it's what we're learning and what we're trying to do. And I think a lot of it we're doing by listening to the community because they play it more than we do, honestly.“</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Committing to the dev diary">Committing to the dev diary</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the ways in which the team has been listening to the community more closely is with dev diaries, which started with the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roads to Power</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;DLC back in September 2024. This has allowed PDS Black to share materials and ideas with the community early on in development and ask them for feedback, which in turns lets developers observe how players react to possible fantasies or different ways of expanding the map, for example.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“The earlier we do it, the more sort of creative freedom we have to create the freedom in time, because the reality of game development is you have to do it in a short time, and that's the challenge,” Dzediti said. “I think both us here and the whole team back home wish we could take all that feedback and turn it into something, you know, concrete within the time we have, but sadly, it doesn't always work out.”</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

            <p>Valve has taken a sledgehammer to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> skins market in a "small update", which allows players to trade five regular Covert skins for a fairly rare cosmetic for your knives and gloves.</p>
<p>That might not sound like a big deal, in fact, it probably sounds like a nice way of allowing casual players to cycle out older skins they don't like for something fancier. Here's the rub: Counter Strike 2 skins are tradable on the Steam market, and knife / gloves skins have historically sold for some serious money.</p>
<p>To understand why, you need to know the primary method of earning skins. In Counter Strike 2, players open weapon cases for skins. These are for the most part loot boxes containing weapon skins, and the rarest golden prize you can get from these cases are knife and gloves skins. Different weapon cases can give different varieties of knives and gloves, for example the Prisma 2 case drops the Stiletto knife with a random camo on it.</p>

<p>So prior to the small update, if you wanted a <em>really</em> cool looking knife, you had to pay real money for these weapon cases and try your luck on getting a knife. Alternatively, you could buy a knife you wanted. For reference a knife I like - the Stiletto Slaughter - sold for roughly £671 on October 9.</p><p>However, Fast forward to today, and that same knife sold for as low as £222. That's because of the update. You can now trade up five covert rarity skins for a knife, which has suddenly increased the supply of knives on the market, thus leading to a sudden drop in price across the board for knives.</p>
<p>As a result, on a macro level, the entire Counter Strike 2 skin market cap has dropped by 28.11 percent <a href="https://app.pricempire.com/trending?_gl=1*1khbnp4*_ga*MzQ0NzE4NTIuMTc1MTM3MDcwNA..*_ga_5YMSVJKHTZ*czE3NjEyMDkwMDUkbzkyJGcxJHQxNzYxMjEwOTUxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">according to CS2 market analytics website Price Empire</a>. In other words, that's almost $2bn in less than a week. All because Valve made acquiring certain cosmetics in its popular game easier.</p>
<p>So, that's a shocking figure, but is this a good thing? It certainly depends on what position you're in. If you're a normal player with a few cool skins, and have felt priced out of getting a knife skin due to the pricey market surrounding them, this is certainly a great update for you. It's not so great if you're someone who invested money into Counter Strike 2 cosmetics rather than, y'know, stocks, a savings account, etc. In fact, it's potentially devastating for people who decided to invest a chunk of their wealth into Counter Strike skins over the years.</p>
<p>So pour one out to the Counter Strike 2 players who have found their inventories drop by like 30% plus, and if you've got an old Counter Strike account you've not opened up in a while, why not boot the game back up and see if you can get a fancy knife!</p>

<figure data-uuid="3e8d957c9bbec"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3e8d957c9bbec/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> has more amiibo that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> — that was already true when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">they were revealed during the September Nintendo Direct</a>, but a second one (that just aired) has unveiled three more.</p>
<p>Meta Knight and Shadow Star, King Dedede and Tank Star, and Chef Kawasaki and Hop Star will be joining the pricey set of amiibo in 2026. Meta Knight will swoop in on <strong>5th March 2026</strong>, with King Dedede and Kawasaki to follow later in the year.</p>
<p>Like Kirby and Waddle Dee, these three are much bigger than your standard amiibo, but not only that, you can swap each of the characters between vehicles. They attach via magnets, meaning they clip on rather nicely indeed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Oh, and in the case of at least the Tank Star, you can change the positioning of the tracks and wheels, which will transform the vehicle in-game. Neat!</p>

<figure data-uuid="7a0f89b0cba84"><a title="Kirby Air Riders amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a0f89b0cba84/kirby-air-riders-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, of course, the price — nothing official has been revealed, but given that retailers are listing Kirby and Waddle Dee at $49.99 in the US, we have to imagine that these other three will also retail at the same price. That means if you want all five, you'll have to cough up around $250 plus tax. Ouch...</p>

<p>Tarnished Edition pushed to 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="b6a5ec64ea5f2"><a title="Elden Ring" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6a5ec64ea5f2/elden-ring.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware are delaying the planned launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a> on Switch 2 until next year.</p>
<p>Originally scheduled to arrive on Nintendo's console before the end of 2025, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">a post</a> from the game's official X account apologises to players and says the delay into 2026 is "to allow time for performance adjustments."</p>

<p>While development on #ELDENRING Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.<br>
We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>FromSoft's game was playable at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/gamescom">Gamescom</a> back in August, although various outlets (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/video-uh-oh-elden-ring-on-switch-2-has-issues-in-handheld-mode">including ourselves</a>) reported disappointing performance on Nintendo's system, especially in handheld mode, with frame drops and stuttering especially noticeable in the more open areas.</p><div><figure data-videoid="DE5HpSoUj-c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DE5HpSoUj-c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed60ecbbuqpizw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>The game launched elsewhere back in February 2022 to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/elden-ring">glowing reviews</a>, and was followed by the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/elden_ring_shadow_of_the_erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC in 2024, which will be included in the Tarnished Edition.</p>
<p>It's unsurprising, perhaps, that such an ambitious game might struggle on handheld hardware, but we'd hoped for a smooth, consistent experience on Switch 2 despite the familiar caveats of running a full-fat, cross-platform, home console game like this on portable hardware.</p>
<p>However, although it's disappointing to see this one slip into next year — at least for those of us who had holiday plans involving a trip to the Lands Between — if the devs need more time to make this edition not-quite-so-tarnished, so be it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware and Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/ww/pressrelease_detail.html?tgt=20251023_eldenring_tarnishededition_postponement">announced today in a press release</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Elden Ring, titled Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, will no longer be released in 2025 and has been delayed into 2026.</p>



<p>A statement from FromSoftware cites the reason for the delay as the game needing more time "<em>for game performance adjustments</em>." A more specific release window beyond 2026 was not provided.</p>



<p>"<em>While development is progressing wholeheartedly towards release</em>," the statement begins, "<em>it was deemed that more time is required for game performance adjustments and the decision to change the release date was made.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Further announcements will follow once a specific release date has been determined. We offer our sincere apologies for inconveniencing players who have been eagerly awaiting the release of this title. Thank you for your patience and support as we continue to make performance adjustments</em>."</p>



<p>Frankly, this delay isn't the biggest surprise. Besides the fact that the quality bar for technical performance in FromSoftware games is rocky at best, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">there were already reasonable concerns</a> with how this new version would run on the Nintendo Switch 2. Yes, it's more powerful than the first Switch and definitely has a shot at running Elden Ring with some degree of stability, but it's no surprise to learn that FromSoftware needs more time to try and figure that out.</p>



<p>And based on their track record, even when it arrives it'll likely do so with its fair share of performance issues anyways. Of course, we hope that's not the case, but FromSoftware can't even put out games on current-gen consoles and PCs without significant performance issues.</p>



<p>Elden Ring also isn't the only major title that won't be hitting its initial 2025 release window on Nintendo Switch 2. Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">recently delayed indefinitely,</a> while Gearbox continues to fix and resolve the performance issues the game had on other platforms and addressing what we can only assume to be serious performance issues on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>For now, if you want to take Elden Ring with you on the go, the only option remains PC handhelds like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steam-deck-portable-console-for-power-users/">Steam Deck </a>or the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing significant emulation improvements for several PS4 exclusives.</p>



<p>The new version of the emulator, which can be downloaded from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://shadps4.net/downloads/">its official website</a> by setting the Update Channel to Nightly, brings many current PlayStation 4 exclusives closer to a fully playable state on PC while also booting games that did not launch in <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-0-11-0-unreal-engine-games/">previous versions of the emulator</a>, a crucial step for further emulation improvements.</p>



<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProteinGaming-97">ProteinGaming</a> showcases how games like Ratchet &amp; Clank 2016, God of War III Remastered, The Order: 1886, the P.T. demo, Infamous: Second Son, Uncharted: Nathan Drake Collection, Gravity Rush and others run under the new version of the emulator on a system powered by an i5-12400F CPU, RTX 4060 GPU and 32 GB RAM. </p>



<p>While some games, like The Order 1886, are nowhere near playable, others have seen considerable performance improvements, like God of War III Remastered, Gravity Rush 2, and The Last Guardian. So, it may not be long before these games become fully playable on PC, even without an official port.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SHADPS4 0.11.1 Release - Huge Upgrades for PS4 Exclusives on PC!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G71o1fh_Rmg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While PlayStation 4 games becoming playable on PC would be more than enough for most players who never had the chance to try out these games on the original hardware, improved emulation could also lead to graphics and performance improvements. </p>



<p>Bloodborne, whose emulation was further improved in the new version of the ShadPS4 emulator, not only can be made to run at 60 FPS on PC, its visuals can be enhanced significantly with the <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-project-update/">Remastered Project visual overhaul</a>, which introduces, among other improvements, dynamic shadows and is set to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-pc-remaster-addressing-low-quality-meshes/">get another critical improvement down the line.</a></p>



<p>More information on the ShadPS4 emulator, an up-to-date compatibility list and more can be found on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website.</a></p>

A new day, a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">city builder</a>! Today the particular entry in this far reaching genre we're talking about is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/farthest-frontier">Farthest Frontier</a>, because it's leaving early access after more than three years in development. If you've never heard of it before, the simple answer is that Farthest Frontier is a medieval city builder. The longer answer includes all the things it does.
</p>
<p>
For one, there's apparently more than 190 buildings you can build, as you start your old timey town as just that before eventually growing it into a living, breathing city. Quite literally, as apparently villagers in the game live out their days in real time. You could pick a random villager, watch them as they head to work, see them delivering things to various townspeople. Sounds neat!

<p>
You can grow up to 12 different kinds of crops, all of which have specific needs from making sure the soil is appropriately fertile, to needing to prevent temperature-related damage, to good old fashioned diseases. There's invaders to be fought off too, if you don't have the game's pacifist mode turned on, requiring you to properly equip your village and its people to defend themselves.
</p><p>
In terms of the big 1.0 features, progression has apparently received a big revamp with a new 142-point tech tree. There'll be even more buildings, plus decorations and landmarks to build, and even a bridge system. You'll also find a new policy system, which according to a press release adds "more agency to civic management." Not to mention some updated animations, including for those aforementioned villagers.
</p>
<p>
If all of this sounds like it's up your alley, well, again, it's out today! And available to pick up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1044720/Farthest_Frontier/">here</a>! Go nuts!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you play <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> and enjoy trading skins for financial gain, you’re either real happy right now or, um, quite the opposite. Valve recently pushed an update to the game’s controversial marketplace that appears to have wildly shifted the value of some folks’ inventories, gutting the worth of some players’ stockpiles of skins while skyrocketing that of others. It’s <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981369304252645391">a dramatic shift</a> triggering a $1.75 billion decrease in value to the market.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The CS2 skins market cap lost $1.75 BILLION following the Knife Trade Up update‼️ <a href="https://t.co/wHPCF9wfGq">pic.twitter.com/wHPCF9wfGq</a></p> <p>— Pricempire.com (@pricempire) <a href="https://twitter.com/pricempire/status/1981296976487452888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In an update that makes an otherwise ordinary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">assortment of tweaks</a>, Valve altered the way <i>Counter-Strike</i>’s skin game works (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). The update allows folks to “trade up” what were previously seen as borderline worthless cosmetics, referred to as “red” by the community. These skins were previously worth around $10, but as of the new changes, folks can trade them up for skins worth four digits. That’s quite the shift.</p>

 <p>Turmoil ensued as these changes rocked the skin market. <a href="https://x.com/ThatBoyAqua/status/1981167900900909382">One player lost $1400</a> “in the span of 30 minutes” as the changes mucked up the value of their inventory. Of course, as such things go, others gained a ton of money, <a href="https://x.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980">sharing screenshots</a> of the massive jump in value of their inventory.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*formerly $10 skins lmao <a href="https://t.co/XeBcWqJ03O">pic.twitter.com/XeBcWqJ03O</a></p> <p>— Serifaz 🌸 (@Serifaz_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“At this point just go and gamble at a casino 😂” reads another post. But perhaps the most ridiculous shift in value was @smileybeef’s now nearly four-million-dollar (yes, you read that right) batch of “worthless red skins.” “How do I explain this to the IRS?” they said. To which <a href="https://x.com/0scarrrrrrrrr/status/1981220176012967986">one user replied</a> “Can you please launder it harder by buying me a Steam Deck?” <a href="https://x.com/bigballs232/status/1981189348071768429">Another chimed in</a> saying “everytime I refresh the market they get more expensive some are at like 3600%.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do I explain this to the IRS <a href="https://t.co/Cg7ldLw23U">pic.twitter.com/Cg7ldLw23U</a></p> <p>— psp1g (@smileybeef) <a href="https://twitter.com/smileybeef/status/1981141120051781834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I believe the technical term for this kinda stuff is “fucking nuts.”</p> <hr> <p><strong>Update 10/23/2025 11:30 AM:</strong> <em>This piece previously misstated the value of the change in the market.&nbsp;</em>Kotaku <em>regrets the error.</em></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, my new sleep paralysis demon, started out as one of the most disappointing Mega Evolutions introduced in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>. The ethereal, alien-like starfish is one of the original 151 Pokémon and a longtime favorite among many fans. Folks had been asking Game Freak for a Mega Evolution for years, and numerous cool fan art concepts have been circulating on the internet for a long time, dating back to before </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was announced. What we got, however, is one of the goofiest-looking new forms in the game, one that many deemed unfitting of the original Pokémon’s mysterious design. However, after a lot of immediate backlash, Mega Starmie has reached the “so bad it’s good” status that Game Freak probably intended.</span></p>   <p><span>Mega Starmie’s big change is that it grows in size and its extremities become long enough that it can imitate human movement. So this gorgeous, jewel-wearing starfish turns into a freaky gremlin that runs around the battlefield like it’s in a Hanna Barbera cartoon. I admit, I hated its design when I first saw it. I’m not sure I’d say I’ve come around on it, but I can’t deny that it was an absolute beast during my playthrough that wiped the floor with so many of my foes’ teams. It was helpful that when it underwent this transformation, it was able to use its creepy-crawly legs to get across the battlefield more quickly, since its slow movement speed is one of its standard form’s weaknesses. And now that the initial shock is wearing off, players are starting to see the absurdity of Mega Starmie as endearing instead. It’s a meme Pokémon, but its human-like proportions have made it easy to graft onto just about anything.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Starmie containment breach<br>made in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blender</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/b3d?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#b3d</a> <a href="https://t.co/AjcGqSD01j">pic.twitter.com/AjcGqSD01j</a></p> <p>— cgchefs (@cgchefs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cgchefs/status/1979677950598643881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the fajitas come out sizzlin <a href="https://t.co/fq3ASwVALs">pic.twitter.com/fq3ASwVALs</a></p> <p>— DOMROM (@DomRomArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/DomRomArt/status/1980829381846298962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">「待ちなさぁ～い！」 <a href="https://t.co/FRcVlWBiRE">pic.twitter.com/FRcVlWBiRE</a></p> <p>— いとた (@itota_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/itota_art/status/1980605381534777800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">Gm! <a href="https://t.co/8fnH1M7heO">pic.twitter.com/8fnH1M7heO</a></p> <p>— Pokémon Daily Post💫 (@PokeDailyPost) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokeDailyPost/status/1980544589908844591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">入浴中のメガスターミーのラテアート<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon_LA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemon_LA</a> <a href="https://t.co/5sZJF12j8R">pic.twitter.com/5sZJF12j8R</a></p> <p>— じょーじ (@george_10g) <a href="https://twitter.com/george_10g/status/1979868926919291357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Yeah, it might not be the Mega Evolution anyone expected, but it got people talking, and now Mega Starmie has somehow become a breakout…star…from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222">The Switch 2 port of FromSoftware’s open-world RPG, </a><em>Elden Ring,</em> has been delayed from 2025 until sometime in 2026. In two different statements about the delay, the devs explained that the port needed more time to improve performance. When <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> on Switch 2 was first seen by the public, many weren’t impressed by its frame rate.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">the official <em>Elden Ring</em> Twitter account announced</a> that<em> Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2 was no longer launching in 2025 and had been delayed into next year to give the devs more time for “performance adjustments.”</p> <p><span>“While development on <em>Elden Ring</em></span><span><em> Tarnished Edition</em> continues wholeheartedly toward release,” posted the<em> Elden Ring</em> account, “we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.”</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1981359979119726764">Over on the official FromSoftware Twitter account</a>, the studio shared a lengthier message about the delay. Here’s the translated version of that statement:</p> <blockquote><p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition,</em> which was scheduled for release in 2025, we have determined that additional time is required for game performance adjustments, and we will therefore be changing the release to 2026. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to all users who have been looking forward to the release of this title. We will continue to make adjustments to deliver it in the best possible form, so we kindly ask for your understanding. Thank you very much for your patience.</p></blockquote> <p>Both statements make it clear that the open-world RPG, first released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022, is struggling to run well on Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. This was clear when the game was demoed at Gamescom earlier this year, and footage showed it chugging horribly. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">Bandai Namco reportedly even stopped people from recording footage</a> of the game to avoid it being posted online. <em>Nintendo Life</em> video producer Felix Sanchez, after playing <em>Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2, said: “It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible.” Looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco are going to keep tinkering on the port until next year. Hopefully, that helps it run better when it finally launches.</p>

<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar will help players discover new and upcoming games through a schedule of upcoming releases and personalized recommendations. </p>



<p>Personal Calendar is a store feature that will be available as a Steam Labs experiment. This will allow the company to gather feedback and make more improvements to this tool. It will show players not just recently released games but also upcoming games, and it has been filtered down to a collection that Steam believes the player is most likely to be interested in.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-steam-s-personal-calendar-work">How Does Steam’s Personal Calendar Work?</h2>



<p>Explained in a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507342099205587494" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>, this new Steam tool will find players with similar playtime to the user and then look at the games they have been adding to their wishlists. The system will also look at the games the player plays the most (relative to other players) and spend most of their playtime in.&nbsp;Which means that the games and demos players put in for a few minutes won’t be recorded; only those they sink their teeth into will matter.</p>



<p>Steam’s Personal Calendar system will be retrained daily to incorporate the latest data. It has a new calendar view that lists soon-to-release titles, filters them to the set we recommend most for you, and maps them across time so you can see them at a glance. This view will also include the player’s wishlisted games. However, the Calendar is weekdays-only, since very few games are released on weekends, and they needed as much space as possible to show upcoming games. </p>



<p>There are some customisation controls, including the ability to filter by tag and adjust the number of results. Also, the page will filter games based on your&nbsp;store content preferences, such as Early Access titles, ignored products, ignored tags, and the general level of mature content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new announcement confirmed that Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will no longer release for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and has been delayed to 2026. </p>



<p>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition’s development has been struggling slightly on Nintendo Switch 2, with the recent Gamescom 2025 demo not doing it many favours, as players pointed out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-struggles-on-nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">substantial framerate drops</a>. It seems that’s why the developers want to take more time before they deliver the final product. </p>



<h2 id="h-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-release-pushed-to-2026-date-still-unconfirmed">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition Release Pushed to 2026, Date Still Unconfirmed</h2>



<p>The announcement about the delay comes through a post on the official Elden Ring <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter). The post states that development for the Elden Ring Tarnished Edition is moving “wholeheartedly toward release”; however, they have decided to delay the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments.” The developers have apologized to the players for the delay and thanked them for their patience and support. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>While development on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> Tarnished Edition continues wholeheartedly toward release, we have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. </p><p>We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support. <a href="https://t.co/TsLrhAWIGc">pic.twitter.com/TsLrhAWIGc</a></p></div>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Overall, it’s a sound decision to delay the launch of the Elden Ring: Tarnished edition, as the game was genuinely suffering from very real performance issues. Players have reported framerates dropping to as low as 15 fps, while doing “the most simple stuff,” and when players “get to the outside world, and the framerate just tanks.” The added time will help developers to work towards optimisation and provide a more solid build for release. </p>



<p>In other news, Alex Garland <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-alex-garland-script-a24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote 160 pages</a> to pitch the Elden Ring movie. Additionally, Nightreign and Shadow of the Erdtree hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-and-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hit-new-sales-milestones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sales milestones</a> earlier this year.

Sakurai also confirmed that no downloadable content is planned, nor is <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> planned to become an ongoing series. <span id="more-1001557"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Headlining the presentation were the introduction of the story-driven Road Trip mode and the return of Top Ride, a mode originally introduced in the 2003 Nintendo <a title="Platforms > GameCube" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/gamecube">GameCube</a> game <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>. These game modes are just some of the features highlighted in this presentation, with Mr. Sakurai revealing how <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> expands its gameplay experience on <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,857 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> 2—including introducing a large roster of riders, the return of legendary machines, customizable features, online1 play and more. It’s time to get ready for a whole new level of fast-paced <a title="Genres > Action [3,138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>.</p><p>And as for the new features and details covered in the presentation, here’s what Mr. Sakurai revealed about what you can expect when the game lands:</p><ul><li><strong>Top Ride</strong> – A game mode originally introduced in <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>, Top Ride is all about <a title="Genres > Racing [292 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> from a top-down perspective and includes courses inspired by those available in Air Ride mode. Just as in other game modes, you can choose your riders and machines separately. You can also use Quick Spins and Boost Charges, plus Copy Abilities such as Flash, which causes the rider to surge forward with electricity—rivals that are hit will be in for a shocking surprise! There are also items exclusive to Top Ride to help you gain even more of an advantage over your opponents, including Kaboomb, Drift Flames, Drill Driver and more! Top Ride can be played online with up to eight players, or offline with other three players2 on a single system and four CPUs.</li><li><strong>Road Trip</strong> – In today’s presentation, Mr. Sakurai introduced a new mode called Road Trip. Hit the road and complete different challenges from Air Ride, City Trial and Top Ride including races, battles, and Field Events—all the while collecting machines and items you can use between challenges. But this is no random Road Trip. There is a story behind why Kirby, King Dedede, Bandana Waddle Dee, Starman and other riders are embarking on this journey, and it’s hinted at during the presentation …</li><li><strong>Paddock</strong> – In <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, there is a new way for friends to gather for online play in the paddock3. Acting like a lobby, this area lets players move around as a rider and set up matches, interact with friends and pick and choose which mode they’d like to play. It’s even possible for several matches to be happening within a single paddock. Players can also change the music. You can also send emotes, and work on character poses using the control sticks in combination.</li><li><strong>Swap <a title="Companies > Relay" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/relay">Relay</a></strong> – The presentation dove deeper into Air Ride mode, introducing a new type of race called Swap Relay. Here, you’ll select a machine for each individual lap and automatically swap machines as you complete laps. Find the right combos and experiment with different pairings of rider and machine. You can even relay with other players locally by handing off the controller like a baton!</li><li><strong>Transform Star</strong> – The Transform Star is both a star type flying machine and a bike type driving machine and is one of the new machines being introduced in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>! By rapidly moving the Left Stick you can swap between both types to keep your opponents on their toes.</li><li><strong>Checklist</strong> – The Checklist3 from <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> is back as well. As you clear certain objectives, a Checklist box gets flipped over. The more you achieve, the more unlockable content you can access. There are five Checklist tabs, representing Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, Road Trip and Online. Clicking on an unopened box which is next to opened box will take you right to that objective, all set up and ready to play. Rest assured that there are no riders or machines locked behind the Online tab, so completing that tab is not required. You can jump in immediately and start filling up your Checklist.</li><li><strong>amiibo</strong> – The presentation revealed more of the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> amiibo figures4, which are significantly larger than typical amiibo. Mr. Sakurai showcased <a title="Platforms > Meta [159 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a> Knight &amp; Shadow Star, King Dedede &amp; Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star. They, too, can swap riders and machines! Each rider, including those revealed in the three new two-part amiibo packs, is attached magnetically to their machine, and you can swap them out with other <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> amiibo, with the new combo appearing in the game as well! You will also be able to train up your amiibo Figure Player and increase their experience levels. The amiibo will launch on:<ul><li>Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star – March 5, 2026</li><li>King Dedede &amp; Tank Star – 2026</li><li>Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star – 2026</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        </li><li><strong>And So Much More</strong> – The presentation confirmed the return of all nine Air Ride courses from the original game, from Fantasy Meadows to Nebula Belt, bringing the total number of courses to 18. The presentation later offered details on a new City Trial power-up item called the Mega Cannon. It also covered Stadiums, as well as boss battles which teased the debut of a boss battle exclusive opponent called Robo Dedede—a boss who can transform between Dedede mode and Car mode! There are also returning Copy Abilities and even ways to collect and rebuild the legendary machines Dragoon and Hydra!</li></ul></blockquote><div id="carousel_1001701"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Mr. Sakurai also discussed some new online and multiplayer elements that will be available in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, giving players more chances to share the experience with friends and family:</p><ul><li><strong>Global Win Power</strong> – <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will feature a Class system and a new metric called Global Win Power3. First, your Class ranking is measured not with a letter grade, but with colors. The seven colors of the rainbow indicate your Class and help match you up with similarly leveled players online. Raising your Class level can inspire changes in City Trial, so keep an eye out. Each <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [622 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer game</a> mode also has its own Global Win Power ranking, which is based on your total number of wins. Although not directly related to your Class ranking, it will increase the more you play. Your Global Win Power is also displayed on your License.</li><li><strong>Licenses</strong> – Your online multiplayer experience starts with creating a License3. This is how others will be able to identify you when playing online and is viewable when competing against other players. You can customize it with glitter effects and stickers, as well as your own Street Name by pairing two pre-set terms together.</li><li><strong>Team Battles</strong> – Up to 16 players2 can play City Trial together and with Team Battles3, you can now split up the players into two teams of eight. Legendary machine parts can be shared between teammates—and whoever picks up the final piece gets to ride it! When ten or more players are competing, all players will be split into two of the same stadium and teams will compete for the high score.</li><li><strong>Hone Your Skills</strong> – As a single player, play Time Attack in either Air Ride or Top Ride modes and challenge yourself to get your best time over a set number of laps. Or play Free Run in either of those modes, too, and practice your moves or set your own <a title="Series > Persona [92 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>l Best in a pressure-free environment without any opponents in your way. In City Trial, you can use Free Run to explore Skyah without any time limits or obstacles.</li><li><strong>Expanded Roster</strong> – The presentation also revealed a few more of the characters you’ll be seeing in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> as playable riders. There’s the clever arachnid Taranza, the troublemaking duo of Lololo &amp; Lalala and more!</li></ul><p>The presentation further expanded on the ways you can customize your <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> experience, personalizing Air Ride machines, garages and even music.</p><ul><li><strong>Miles</strong> – How do you acquire customizable accessories? With Miles! You keep earning Miles while you’re playing—the more you play, the more you earn. You can then take this in-game currency to the Miles Shop where you can acquire machines, machine decorations, License decorations, and music tracks. You can even acquire customizable Headwear for your riders.</li><li><strong>My Machine</strong> – As you collect machines by playing, purchasing parts at the Miles Shop and completing Checklist challenges, you can add decals, accessories, patterns and effects to turn any machine into My Machine. Then take your personalized My Machine to the Machine Market where you can list it for sale for in-game currency and acquire machines designed by other players. The more your machine sells, the more expensive it gets (but don’t worry, you don’t actually lose the machine if it sells). In addition to decorating your machine, you can create your own custom garage to show off your unique rides. Invite friends from the paddock to come and hang, too!</li><li><strong>Gummies</strong> – New to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> are machine-shaped Gummies collectibles. They are shaped like the machines of opponents you’ve defeated—for every rival you place higher than in a competition, you’ll earn a Gummy of their machine. Inhale them, fire them into the sky and generally hold onto them as trophies of all the opponents you’ve defeated. Who knows, maybe you’ll become a Gummillionaire!</li><li><strong>My Music</strong> – Mr. Sakurai gave special mention to game composers Shogo Sakai and Noriyuki Iwadare, who worked on <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> and the <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> series respectively. Like <em><a title="Games > Super Smash Bros. Ultimate [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a></em>, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will have a My Music option that allows you to select what music you’d like to be playing during City Trial while you explore Skyah, including tracks from across the <em>Kirby</em> game series, bonus tracks and hidden tracks! There is also new music available on the <a title="Games > Nintendo Music [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nintendo-music">Nintendo Music</a>5 smart device app today!</li></ul><p>And that’s not all. <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will also feature announcer voices in different languages and styles to choose from that provide commentary during races and narration during the Road Trip story. Players can also enjoy customizable button-mapping, visual effect options and a new Main Menu that gives you easy access to game modes, collectibles and other extras.</p><p><strong><em>Kirby Air Riders</em>: Global Test Ride</strong></p><p>Want to experience <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> ahead of its launch? Nintendo Switch Online members can get hands-on with the game in the <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>: Global Test Ride event.

                <p>Elden Ring's Switch 2 port is not going to release on time. From Software and Bandai Namco have confirmed that the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition for Nintendo's console has been pushed to 2026.</p><p>Development "continues wholeheartedly," the developer said in a statement. But a delay was necessary to give the team time for "performance adjustments."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/" data-ref-id="1100-6534171">people who played Elden Ring on Switch 2 said it was in rough shape</a>, with the frame rate in particular getting called out for being poor. Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/" data-ref-id="1100-6534171">forbade media from showing footage of the game</a>, so we haven't actually seen it in action as of yet, however.</p><p>"We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support," the developer said about the delay.</p><p>The Tarnished Edition includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Author George R.R. Martin worked on Elden Ring's backstory and lore.</p><p>Elden Ring was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-10-best-selling-games-of-2022-in-the-us/1100-6510556/">No. 2 best-selling game of 2022 in the US</a> and sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fromsoftware/comments/1hew72p/elden_ring_has_sold_over_286_million_copies_as_of/#:~:text=Full_Data_6240-,Elden%20Ring%20has%20sold%20over%2028.6%20million%20copies%20as%20of,IP%20of%20modern%20console%20generation" rel="nofollow ">nearly 30 million copies as of the end of 2024</a> across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. No sequel has been announced, but the standalone multiplayer spin-off, Elden Ring Nightreign, came out this past May. It's not confirmed for Switch 2, however.</p><p>Assuming it releases in 2026, Elden Ring will join From Software's The Duskbloods in launching for Switch 2 next year. That is a new action-RPG exclusive to Switch 2 developed by From Software and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Wemade Max Co. and developer Madngine have released the first official trailer for Project Tal, a single-player, open-world action RPG inspired by Korean mythology. Though this trailer looks great, don't get too excited yet because the game is targeting a console and PC release sometime in 2027.&nbsp;</p><p>Madngine says Project Tal "reimagined Korea's traditional Tal masks," as well as the mythology and Korean folklore that surrounds these special masks. It infuses this mythology into a fantasy open world for players to explore, and today's trailer showcases some of that world alongside the fast-paced action combat against huge monsters and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Project Tal announcement trailer below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaHm2UjbxzY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see in the trailer, Project Tal features a companion system that ensures players aren't fighting alone in this dangerous world. Madngine says the companion system "dynamically responds to the player's combat style and environment" in a press release. Each NPC companion has unique abilities, combat roles, including up-close and ranged magic and melee prowess, and distinctive personalities.&nbsp;</p><p>"Project Tal combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG," Wemade Max Co. CEO Sohn Myun-seok writes in a press release. "With Madngine's technical expertise and artistic vision, we're creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage."</p><p>We'll have to wait until 2027 when Project Tal hits unspecified consoles and PC to see if that's the case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Here are some additional Project Tal screenshots:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/11/nexon-unveils-woochi-the-wayfarer-a-single-player-korean-fantasy-action-adventure-game">read about Woochi the Wayfarer</a>, another single-player Korean fantasy action game in development, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4/relentless-exhausting-exhilarating"><em>Game Informer's </em>Ninja Gaiden 4 review</a> to find out why it's an action game we recommend you check out. &nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you think of our first official look at Project Tal?

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> Direct stream brought a bit one hour drop of new information about Masuhiro Sakurai’s latest game, digging into changes both big and small for the game, revealing Top Ride and the brand new Road Trip mode, digging into specific menu settings, revealing a big set of Amiibo, and more.</p>
<p>A global online demo is set to take place at two points in November, on 8th-9th November and on 15th-16th November at 8AM-2PM UK time (UTC) on the first day, and then 12AM-6AM and 3PM-9PM on the second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct #2 10.23.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ZHYjYHHiBM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Top Ride, the top-down racing style, has returned alongside the more kart racer-style Air Ride, and the vehicular combat stylings of City Trial. Compared to the GameCube original, there’s now a follow cam and the ability for all players to have their own view of the world, which will really help with the scale and the scope of the many stages featured in the game. Additionally, since this now uses the full selection Air Ride vehicles, and has two control methods so you can race however feels more natural.</p>
<p>Air Ride is the main racing mode, though, and there’s some big news here as well. There’s nine original circuits for this game, but there’s also all nine of the original game’s circuits included as well, from Fantasy meadows and Celestial Valley to Sky Sands. You’ll need to earn these original circuits, but they’ve all been rebuilt in their original layouts with new graphics –&nbsp;given the faster cruising speed in this sequel, the lap times will be a bit faster.</p>

<p>City Trial is the vehicular combat mode, gathering up stat points to enhance your vehicle before a final Stadium battle takes place. A new Team Battle mode takes the 16-player lobbies and splits them into two teams to work together, and then everyone to face off in the same Stadium.</p>
<p>A new game mode, Road Trip, which combines Air Ride, Top Ride and City Trial together in a string of challenges to take on, going head-to-head with rival characters. It builds up to encounters with a mysterious figure that provides some narrative impetus to this game’s solo play.</p>
<p>Of course, a lot of this is meant to be enjoyed in multiplayer. There’s up to four player split screen, and when with two players you can choose the direction of the split-screen, which is neat. What’s good to hear is that Switch 1 controllers and the GameCube recreation controller will all be supported.</p>
<p>Heading online, you can do so socially, meeting up with friends in the Paddock, a lobby space where you run around, get to watch a big screen, select music and just hang.</p>
<p>For competitively minded players, you’ll have an online license that shows your Global Power Rating –&nbsp;literally a number of how many people you’re better than –&nbsp;and a coloured shape that acts as your rank. This rank is set individually per game mode, and can affect how City Trial matches play out. You’ll be able to customise your license with fresh backgrounds, and even sparkles.</p>
<p>Beyond all this, Sakurai-san regularly diverted to share new copy abilities, vehicles and riders. There’s a lot of characters to choose from here, including… Rock (the literal rock) and Rick, the hamster. There’s also a Transform Star vehicle, which swaps between star form and bike form modes (which feels a bit OP?), top speed Formula Star, jumping Hop Star, and so many more.</p>
<p>A full set of five Kirby Air Rider amiibo are on the way for Kirby, Bandana Waddle Dee, Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Chef Kawasaki, all with swappable Star vehicles. The Tank Star can also have its tracks reoriented. The amiibo let you save and train up an AI, but can also just be scanned to change the pose and models featured in your main menu cursor.</p>

<p>Here’s some more bullet point details:</p>
<ul>
<li>All localisation languages have both male and female announcers.</li>
<li>You can set a different announcer for matches and story narration.</li>
<li>Time Trial records are tracked per machine.</li>
<li>There are no online leaderboards.</li>
<li>City Trial has a Free Run mode to let you explore Skyah, test vehicles and more. Field Events won’t happen in this mode, though.</li>
<li>A Photo Mode is available throughout the game.</li>
<li>A Stadiums-only mode is available separate from City Trial</li>
<li>You can remove stadiums from City Trial, if you don’t like them, or set filters.</li>
<li>The VS. King Dedede Stadium has been reimagined as VS. Boss against the transforming Robo Dedede.</li>
<li>The Checklist returns with rewards for certain game missions and achievements, filling in a picture puzzle.</li>
<li>There’s a new vehicle decoration feature called My Machine.</li>
<li>A Machine Market lets you use earned currency to buy the designs of other players.</li>
<li>Riders can also be styled up with headware.</li>
<li>The earned currency is Miles from actively driving.</li>
<li>You’ll earn “gummies” from defeating rivals, and can mess around with them like a gummy-obsessed Scrooge McDuck.</li>
<li>The soundtrack comes from Shogo Sakai and Noriyuki Iwadare.</li>
<li>You can customise how likely tracks are to be played.</li>
<li>The main menu is themed after a desk</li>
<li>You can remap buttons, to the extend you could play the game one-handed.</li>
<li>Colour filters are in place to help with colourblindness.</li>
<li>You can change the FOV, reduce camera shake and more.</li>
<li>DLC is&nbsp;<em>not</em> planned for Kirby Air Riders – everything they want to put in the game is already there.</li>
</ul>
