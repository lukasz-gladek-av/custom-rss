		<p>A pair of behind the scenes videos have been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/out-of-words">Out of Words</a>, the delightful, hand-crafted co-op platformer from Kong Orange, WiredFly and Epic Games Publishing.</p>
<p>Out of Words stars Kurt and Karla, whose mouths have disappeared and need to adventure through the colourful world of Vokabulantis. A story about the first time they ever held hands, it’s a game to be played in co-op, whether locally or online.</p>


<p>However, not everyone is without a mouth, and they have a teasing older brother-like figure in the form of the rather mocking Prince.</p>
<p>The first of two videos sees Art Director Mikkel discussing how the character was designed, from how extravagant he is to some of the back and forth about visual details.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet a Real Stop Motion Prince | Out of Words Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9k2v5flAmUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The second goes further into the actual craftsmanship that goes into this game, with&nbsp;Senior Fabricator Sofie Kjær walking us through how the puppet is created, sculpting different expressions, hand positions, and painting the models to conjure the character into stop motion life.</p>
<p><iframe title="How We Made a Prince For Stop Motion | ASMR | Out of Words Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iv2agOnvLiQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s all really rather lovely looking. Out of Words is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> &amp; PC via Epic Games Store in 2026.</p>

		<p>It’s been an unexpectedly hectic week for me away from the video game shenanigans, but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been plenty of gaming in my life still. While this week’s biggest hitters have been put into other people’s hands, as you’ll see below, I’ve had one of next week’s biggest games on the go. I’m keeping that particular card close to my chest for now, but I’ve also had some enjoyably silly times in some tactical shooters, checking out Rainbow 6 Mobile’s launch and chatting to one of the developers, and also jumping into Rogue Point for some lighter, more arcade tactical shooter-ing with Miguel as my buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has continued to dig through his backlog and has been playing Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. “I’ve only just got to Hawaii” he says, which makes it sound like he’s following Ichiban’s story in real life…. before continuing “and I’m waiting for the game to open up so I can truly go exploring.”</p>

<p>There’s a big new horror game in town with Resident Evil Requiem and so <strong>Nic</strong> has been playing…. Resident Evil Village. But Steve? <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-review/">Requiem for our review</a> and he’s loved it! He’s started on the speed runs for it, while also checking out the Switch 2 port of Resident Evil 7… and still has found time to return to Breath of Fire 3 for some retro gaming, has the Legacy of Kain: Defiance remaster downloading, and has even snuck in some Steam Next Fest demos! Absolute mad lad.</p>
<p><strong>Ade’s</strong> been playing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta">God of War: Sons of Sparta</a>, but he’s not quite sure if he like it. Based on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-review/">Gamoc’s re-review</a>, though, he’s grabbed Echoes of the End in the sale and found that it’s really enjoyable. “It’s the kind of linear third-person action adventure that I absolutely love, but just doesn’t seem to get made much any more. Not an open world, soul, or rogue in sight, and I love it!”</p>


<p>Continuing to wrap himself up in the Wild West of Red Dead Redemption, <strong>Jim</strong> has just about finished the last few story missions, and has now passed through the veil and starting the Undead Nightmare expansion. “It’s a fun reframing of Rockstars open-world cowboy sim and – by 2010 standards – a rather meaty expansion that still has plenty of satirical humour.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuff</strong> has dipped into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marathon">Marathon</a> for the Server Slam, but says it “Seems a bit.. empty? Also very odd your team mates can extract without you.” He was abandoned by his fellows after just 15 minutes! Expect more in-depth thoughts on this soon, especially with the full release next week.</p>

<p>And we’ll round things off with <strong>Dom</strong>, who’s juggled <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/25/resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-review-a-stunning-port/">Resident Evil Requiem and its impressive Switch 2 release</a>, Overwatch, where he’s very happy that they’ve ditched the ‘2’, and Monster Hunter Stories 3 for review next week. That’s been most of it, but he’s also had a little bit of Lumines Arise, and made a wee start on Fallout 4’s Switch 2 port. How has that fared?</p>
<p><em>That’s us, but what about you? What have you all been playing?</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Developer Judged That ‘Continuing with Unreal Engine 4 Would Definitely Lead to A Better Game’]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-better-game-unreal-engine-4/</link>
            <guid>1448170</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Like the first two entries in the trilogy,<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong> <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em> will be powered by Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>. While this choice was somewhat expected, especially to get the game out in a reasonable amount of time, some have been disappointed by this confirmation, fearing that the third and final installment of the series will be less advanced than other games powered by <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong>.</p>



<p>According to the trilogy's director <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>, this will not be true. Quite the contrary, actually: <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong> will be a better game precisely because it uses <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-third-entry-is-progressing-very-smoothly-we-ask-director-naoki-hamaguchi-why-the-team-chose-not-to-switch-to-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Automaton</a></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> commented on how the confirmation of the game using <strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong> became a hot topic of discussion. <em>"But I think most people aren’t necessarily familiar with the actual differences between Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5,"</em> he said.</p>



<p><em>"Around the time we began developing Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Unreal Engine 5 was just entering its pre-launch phase. What makes Unreal Engine 5 groundbreaking compared to Unreal Engine 4 are two features: Lumen, its lighting system, and Nanite, which allows you to portray dense graphical detail,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said in regards to the perception that a higher version number means something is more advanced. While these represent the current trends in graphics pipelines, tying the game's development to the <strong>Unreal Engine 5</strong> roadmap may have risked slowing down the creation of the game.</p>



<p>As such, <em>"we decided early on in development of FFVII Rebirth to stick with Unreal Engine 4. We’re using a graphics pipeline built in-house, which also makes optimization and porting to various hardware more straightforward,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said.</p>



<p>Having such an established pipeline following the development of <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a></em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em></strong>, <em>"rather than rebuilding our pipeline from scratch in Unreal Engine 5, it’s far more efficient for us to use Unreal Engine 4,"</em> the series director said. <em>"With all of this in mind, we judged that continuing with Unreal Engine 4 would definitely lead to a better third installment for our customers."</em> </p>



<p>Considering how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> built upon pretty much every visual and gameplay feature of its predecessor, it's not surprising to learn that the development team is using the same approach for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong>. The experience with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> is definitely going to help the studio with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong> versions of the game as well, which will <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-30-fps-switch-2/"><strong>target 30 FPS whenever possible.</strong></a></p>

		<p>You do not have long to wait to sail through the skies in your ship because Enjoy Studio has confirmed that Everwind, its sky faring RPG, will be launching into Early Access on March 17th. The aim is to get the full 1.0 release out in 2027 for all platforms. The Early Access launch is PC only at first, but Enjoy Studio has confirmed it is looking at getting Everwind on consoles during the Early Access phase.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everwind - Early Access Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cv2lcemuOrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the announcement post regarding Everwind’s Early Access release, Enjoy Studio wrote, <em>“Whether you brave the skies alone or team up with up to 4 players, prepare to set sail toward a brand-new world filled with ancient mysteries and dangerous wildlife. Early Access is just the beginning. Throughout the year, we’re planning regular updates, expanding the world, refining systems, and introducing new content as we move toward full release. We’ll be sharing our complete roadmap soon so you can see exactly what lies ahead.”</em></p>
<p>Everwind is a co-op survival RPG where the hook is that your base is a flying island ship that you can take across a procedurally generated world. The world itself is filled with floating islands with each one having its own things to discover from ruins and caves, to animals that could pose a threat, and all sorts of resources to keep your ship flying. A detailed roadmap is going to be released at a later date which will give us a much better idea of what to expect through the early access journey.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/27/sprawl-zero-announced-and-its-looking-to-bring-back-the-vibe-of-early-2000s-fps/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Maeth has announced a prequel to its hardcore FPS Sprawl with the new entry Sprawl Zero looking to the first person shooters of the early 2000s as inspiration for both look and feel. In the original Sprawl players took on the role of Seven, a special ops super soldier that was trying to survive the Junta. In Sprawl Zero you play as Five, a cybernetically enhanced supersoldier who is part of the Junta and is on a mission to kill Silas, the leader of techno-religious group IMAGO-DEI.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPRAWL ZERO - REVEAL TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ju0rQ_aA-aQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From the announcement trailer, you can see that Maeth is really digging into the FPS style of a couple a decades ago. As Five, you have access to 40 weapons, Gravity Gloves, and a Gravity Shield to throw projectiles back at enemies. Enemies will work together to try and contain Five but levels have been designed with multiple pathways so you can find ways to outmanoeuvre enemy squads. There are different enemy factions and types to deal with as you hunt down Silas so you will need to adapt your approach to combat to counter different threats. Sprawl Zero will also feature an original soundtrack whose music has been inspired by the same games that the gameplay has.</p>
<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Sprawl Zero, but the platforms have been confirmed as PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

			<p><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> is officially out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2. Following a great reception from critics, the next crucial test to see if <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s latest game in the survival horror franchise is another success is the commercial one. It'll take some time to know for sure, but the very first indicator we have for any game, Steam player concurrency, is already looking good.</p>



<p>In just a few hours, Resident Evil Requiem has already crushed all previous all-time concurrency peaks from Resident Evil games. Right now, it stands at<strong> 267K players</strong> <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3764200/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to SteamDB</a>, and the figure is likely to rise further throughout this weekend, as people have more time to dive into the adventures of Grace and Leon.</p>



<p>For comparison, the second game in this chart is 2023's <strong>Resident Evil 4 Remake</strong>, which reached <strong>168K</strong> players. 2021's <strong>Resident Evil Village</strong> barely surpassed a hundred thousand (<strong>106K</strong> to be exact) simultaneous players, and 2019's <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> registered <strong>74K players</strong> at its height. That said, one might easily spot a pattern here: the newer games generally did better. The only exception to this was 2020's <strong>Resident Evil 3</strong>, which did worse than its predecessor, stopping at <strong>60K</strong> concurrent players on Steam. However, it was just one year after Resident Evil 2, and the game received significant criticism for its cuts (which <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-3-remake-last-escape-mod-restore-cut-content-add-things/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a modder is now trying to restore on PC</a></strong>). For the record, 2017's <strong>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</strong> only reached <strong>20K</strong> concurrent players.</p>



<p>The main reason is that <strong>Steam's player base has massively increased since 2017</strong>. As we outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-reaches-new-concurrency-record-42-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when Valve's platform hit its latest concurrency record (42 million users) last month</a>, <strong>there was a 139% increase</strong> from 2017's <strong>17 million</strong> concurrent users. Even with this caveat, though, the hype for Resident Evil Requiem is very real. Here's an overview of our extensive coverage of the game:</p>

            <p>Netflix’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-for-827-billion-including-the-developers-of-batman-arkham-mortal-kombat-and-mad-max">$82.7 billion proposal</a> to buy the parts of Warner Bros Discovery that include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> creators Avalanche, Lego devs TT Games, Mortal Kombat studio NetherRealm and Batman Arkham outfit Rocksteady has… fallen through.</p>
<p>Rival moneymonster Paramount Skydance has swept in with an even larger bid, submitted 24th February. They’re offering around $111 billion - $31 per share - for the entirety of Warner Bros Discovery, including its linear cable channels. </p>
<p>“That’s a lot of zeros!” I bawl, slamming my face into my eroded laptop keyboard as I contemplate my landlord’s proposal to raise the rent yet again, even though he hasn’t sorted all the mold growing behind the fixed wardrobe. When is somebody going to propose to buy me for a hundred billion dollars??? I’ve still got all my own teeth.</p>
<p>Warner Bros Discovery’s board had previously rejected an all-cash, $30 per share offer from Paramount Skydance for the whole company, but Paramount came back to the table with a higher bid earlier this month. </p>
<p>Netflix have declined to raise their own bid, despite having a few business days left to fight back. As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/netflix-declines-raise-bid-warner-bros-discovery-1236674149/">Variety</a>, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was in Washington, D.C. earlier Thursday in an effort to lobby Trump administration officials on the deal. </p><p>Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison and his dad Larry Ellison - who is funding the acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery out of his personal fortune - are themselves prominent supporters of Donald Trump, and have flaunted this connection as reassurance that their acquisition will make it through regulation. There have also been efforts on the US right to portray the Netflix acquisition as <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/netflix-warner-bros-maga-1236702805/">a leftwing takeover</a> (Warner own CNN, one of Trump’s favourite bogeymen; Netflix have published ‘progressive’ media like the Obama-backed documentary American Factory). </p>
<p>Naturally, the Democrat opposition in the US view the proposed Paramount-Warner merger with suspicion: as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/paramount-netflix-senate-judiciary-antitrust-1236738054/">Deadline</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/netflix-isnt-going-to-buy-warner-bros-after-all-meaning-paramount-is-set-to-take-hbo-warner-bros-games-and-the-rest/">PCGamer</a>, Democrat senator and Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee ranking member Cory Booker has invited David Ellison to testify in court.</p>
<p>In backtracking on the merger agreement, Warner Bros Discovery will have to cough up a $2.8 billion termination fee to Netflix, but Paramount have said they’ll cover this - in addition to offering a $7 billion breakup fee in the event that regulators shoot their own acquisition down.</p>
<p>"We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros' iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the US," Netflix’s higher-ups have said in a statement. "But this transaction was always a 'nice to have' at the right price, not a 'must have' at any price."</p><p>Assuming <em>this</em> acquisition goes through, the immediate impact of the merger will likely be felt by TV and film studios working under Warner and Paramount. These are established ‘legacy media’ companies and there’s a lot of overlap, which probably means we can expect layoffs. It’s less clear how Warner’s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">already much-reduced game division</a> will be impacted.</p>

            <p>Marathon's Server Slam kicked off yesterday, and attracted an healthy number of players on Steam. In the past 24 hours, the game <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4254230/charts/">brought in a peak of 143,621 concurrent players, solely on the PC platform</a>.</p>
<p>The Marathon Server Slam, the final public beta for Bungie's sci-fi extraction shooter ahead of its launch on the 5th March, is free-to-download and try out for anyone interested in the game. It's available on Steam, as well as PlayStation and Xbox. As such, while these early figures are impressive, they remain just a slice of the Slam's full popularity.</p>
<p>For context, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-already-has-servers-slammed-by-almost-100000-players-in-two-hours-as-weekend-playtest-starts">Arc Raiders' final public beta test also broke above the 100,000 concurrent peak milestone soon after its release</a>. It reached <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2427520/charts/">an all-time peak of 189,668</a>, so for those keeping track of the numbers as an indicator of launch success, the hope is that Marathon can stack an extra 40,000 or so over the weekend.</p>
<p>Indeed it's hard not to compare the two games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, while certainly not the first extraction shooter to make a big splash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">certainly brought the subgenre into the spotlight since its launch last year</a>. It has proven exceptionally popular, and arguably opened the door for other extraction shooters to tap into that engaged audience. Marathon, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">which has by no means had a hurdle-free development cycle</a>, may be able to emulate a similar success.</p><p>In terms of <em>very</em> early community reception, things appear to be positive. Typical Bungie gunplay quality is present, and the aesthetic while offputting for some has enraptured others. Best to keep an eye on the game over the weekend, and jump in yourself to see what all the fuss is about if you're so inclined! The Server Slam ends on the 2nd March.</p>

            <p>If you've ever thought it'd be cool to wander <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s version of medieval Europe with some mates, who might make your adventuring life easier by being slightly better at navigating the social waters of feudalism and swordfighting in a fashion that isn't just a blockless flailing of limbs, I bring good news. A group of modders have started work on a multiplayer mod for Warhorse's RPG, with an experimental version already available to give a go.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/modders-are-teaming-up-to-make-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-multiplayer-a-reality-with-visions-for-pvp-and-gta-style-rp-and-theres-an-early-playable-version-already/">GamesRadar</a>, a Polish modder going by Michal and the Reddit handle Ddesoo <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kingdomcome/comments/1r76m1y/kcd2_i_made_a_poc_online_mod_still_looks_like/">started posting</a> about their work on this KCD2 online mod last week. They look to have made some rapid progress in that time, while recruiting some folks with more modding experience to their cause.</p>
<p>Their initial build quickly evolved into a basic framework which allows two players to join a server together and see each other in-game as "ghost" NPCs which have synced up movement. These NPCs are growing less ghostly by the day, with the latest revision allowing them to equip proper armour and weapons, as well as cast shadows.</p> 
<p>If you fancy giving this early "experimental" iteration a go or having a look at its makeup, Michal and co have put it live on <a href="https://github.com/marczukmichal/kcd2-multiplayer/tree/feat-net">Github</a>, as well as setting up a <a href="https://discord.gg/FQVCXgH74N">Discord server</a>. You'll need a legit copy of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and to grab the game's <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/modding-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">official modding tools</a> via Steam.</p><p>While the modders have mentioned having some lofty long-term goals like PvP and GTA-esque roleplaying servers, it could take a while for their creation to get anywhere near those, since it's currently only at the proof-of-concept stage. As a couple of Reddit commenters have noted, getting over these initial hurdles often isn't the biggest challenge faced by ambitious modding projects like this - that lies in rounding everything into a shape which works consistently and reliably during the longer sessions players will want to be able to delve into uninterrupted.</p>
<p>For now, though Michal and co certainly look to be making promising early steps towards their Henry cloning goals. Maybe in a few years time I'll get to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">hop in with Edwin</a> and show him just how crap I am at defending myself when I inevitably piss off both the lords and serfs of some pleasant little town.</p>

            <p>Mere hours after releasing their newest GeForce Game Ready <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">GPU</a> driver, 595.59 WHQL, Nvidia have recalled it, amid <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/game-ready-drivers/13/582871/geforce-grd-59559-feedback-thread-released-22626/">widespread reports</a> of the update interfering with the cooling fans, core clock speeds, and even general game performance of users’ RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>The driver’s <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/resident-evil-requiem-geforce-game-ready-driver/">announcement post</a>, which still boasts of readying PCs for today’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launch, now carries an added warning: "We have discovered a bug in the Game Ready and Studio 595.59 WHQL drivers and have removed the downloads temporarily while our team investigates. For users that have already installed this driver and are experiencing issues with fan control, please roll back to 591.86 WHQL."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-unlaunches-its-geforce-595-59-driver-after-reports-of-fan-and-clock-issues">VideoCardz</a>, with a z, fan issue complaints seem the most prevalent. The 595.59 driver doesn’t exactly cause fans to spin off their mounts and fling themselves into the owner’s neck like a Ravenholm sawblade, but it is allegedly messing with the sensors that inform fans how hard and fast they need to spin to keep their GPU cool. That could potentially lead to overheating and a busted graphics card – a particularly unpleasant prospect when replacements have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pc-hardware-makers-zotac-warn-memory-shortages-raise-concerns-about-the-very-survival-of-graphics-card-manufacturers">made even more expensive by memory chip shortages</a>.</p>
<p>Other technical woes blamed on 595.59 range from unduly limited boost clock speeds on RTX 50 series models, crashes, and lowered performance in Unreal Engine 5 games. Yep, that’s a rollback sitch indeed. For what it’s worth, I’ve been playing (and did all my desktop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-requiem-pc-performance-best-settings">performance testing</a> for) Resi Requiem on the previous 591.86 driver, and didn’t have any problems at all. Not that there’s much of a choice, now that the newer version has been pulled, but is the potential for very, very, very slightly better-shaded flop fringes worth the risk of inflicting heatstroke on your PC’s priciest component? It is a very impressive fringe. But no.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to guess. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Thing</li>



<li>Person</li>



<li>Place</li>



<li>Animal</li>



<li>Work</li>



<li>Nature</li>



<li>Game</li>



<li>Concept</li>



<li>Idea</li>



<li>Food</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-contexto-hints-for-today-february-27-2026">Contexto Hints For Today, February 27, 2026</h2>



<p>Without giving away today’s Contexto answer, here are a few helpful hints to get you thinking in the right direction:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Hint 1:</strong>&nbsp;Bananas</li>



<li><strong>Hint 2:</strong>&nbsp;Lemons</li>



<li><strong>Hint 3:</strong>&nbsp;Primary color</li>
</ul>



<p>If they don’t help, then here are the nine closest words, going from tenth to second:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hue</li>



<li>Color</li>



<li>White</li>



<li>Bright</li>



<li>Pink</li>



<li>Red</li>



<li>Blue</li>



<li>Purple</li>



<li>Orange</li>

<h2 id="h-today-s-contexto-answer-for-game-1258-on-february-27-2026">Today’s Contexto Answer For Game #1258 On February 27, 2026</h2>



<p>If you’ve tried everything, and still can’t figure out today’s Contexto answer, then you can find it down below:</p>



<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Yellow</p>



<p>Yellow is a color like that of a lemon, gold or the Sun. It’s between green and orange in the spectrum, and complimentary to blue.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-contexto-game-after-1258">When Is The Next Contexto Game After #1258?</h2>



<p><strong>Contexto is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone, meaning the next game will start on February 28</strong></p>



<p>The Contexto schedule is very consistent, with a new game releasing at the same time every day.</p>

Think of these three chapters as our poem to all of you," the team explained, stressing that this marks "a much more cinematic approach to storytelling" that feels "quite different from our previous storytelling."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in a vast desert landscape, developer Everstone Games said the Hexi expansion represents the "biggest expansion since the game’s launch, and will offer up brand-new narratives, new bosses, fresh gameplay features, and martial art styles." We can expect three major maps, which, combined, boast nearly 20 sub-regions, 11 unique bosses, seven Jianghu Legacies, "dozens" of side quests, and "so much more." There's also a new path called Bamboocut-Dust, with two new martial arts for Umbrella and Roped Dart. Umbrella's Spring Dreamscape is "all about agility," while Rope Dart's Fleeting Clouds is "all about big, sweeping AOE attacks."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The stream showed off some of those aforementioned boss fights in detail;, including Jade Gate Pass' campaign boss, Guo Xin, the aging general and last grand protector who "remains at his post defending the land to the very end." He'll come at you with "sweeping combos and summon veterans to fight alongside him," so you'll need to use your deflects wisely to protect against his attacks. His second phase, on the other hand, boasts "sands swirl and time reverses" as the call of his army "jostles him back to his prime," enabling him to unleash his full power. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also get a sneak peek at Wandering Ark, which, I'm delighted to say, is exactly what it sounds like — a huge ship. Once a messenger, it's now obsessed with finding its way home through the desert. If you hang on after the main presentation finishes, there's also a good chunk of the battle against Hexi's Moongazing Maiden boss fight, too, where all the skills and weapons are related to the moon.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/27/hcgnhcbbkaabm-9-1772183218222.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While the stream focused primarily on the desert, we also paid fleeting visits to the upcoming Liangzhou and Qingchuan maps, too. The former is a city known for its fine wine and precious jade in our first snow mountain region, and the latter, your final destination, where you'll cycle through all four seasons on one map and find warring factions everywhere you turn. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Best of all, though, Everstone stressed that all your progress carries over from season to season, including character levels, talents, and arsenals, so there's "no need to start from scratch."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for goodies? Here's just some of what you can expect:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>30+ Lingering Melody</li><li>90+ Resonating Melody (includes pulls obtained via free Echo Jade earned through exploration)</li><li>100+ Appearances and items</li><li>Win exclusive Whirl of Radiance outfit (obtained through exploration)</li><li>100+ Exquisite Rewards, including Appearances like Burlap Sack, Bride's Bloom, War Drum and more, the White-Headed General Avatar, the Radiant Horizons Nameplate, and the Who Else? And Pluck Stars Emotes</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all!

			<p>I Hate This Place is based on the cult-favourite Image Comics series of the same name (with the alternative title being the slightly less marketing-friendly Fuck This Place) written by Kyle Starks. This comic features the adventures of a young lesbian couple who inherit a farmhouse, only to find that it is at the centre of a host of mysterious events. The resulting story contains ghosts, monsters, aliens, secret government operations, time travel and just about every other pulp horror trope you can think of. The game takes this inspiration and turns in a thoroughly fine adventure.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Hate This Place - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4P27Vxs3Sns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with your lead character, Elena, and best friend, Lou, attempting to carry out a ritual to summon the mysterious Horned Man – the main antagonist of the original comic books. This ritual immediately goes wrong and Lou disappears. The rest of the game sees Elena trying to track down what has happened to Lou, and in the process discovering much more about the mysteries of Rutherford Ranch.</p>


<p>Aesthetically, I Hate This Place benefits from a suitable cartoony design. Characters and locations look as if they’ve been lifted straight from the pages of a comic book, with text boxes and onomatopoeic sound effect words to match. The latter is used to show the amount of noise that Elena is making – a key aspect for the stealth sections in the game. Voice acting is, however, a little stiff and I found myself skipping the spoken dialogue and relying on the subtitles.</p>


<p>The environments surrounding Rutherford Ranch are relatively varied, with a treacherous swampland, a huge cornfield, threatening forest, cultist village, a mine, and various secret bunkers to explore. Each of these contains a mixture of enemies and environmental puzzles to solve, the latter of which involving a mixture of finding keys, activating switches, and examining notes to find clues for keycodes and passwords. Aside from the exploration, the game also features combat and base building mechanics.</p>
<p>Combat takes place through a mixture of melee and ranged attacks. Your baseball bat can be upgraded, but is mostly to be used as a last resort or restricted to less powerful foes. As you progress through the game you’ll find various ranged weapons or the blueprints to make them at your crafting table, from simple pistols to powerful automatic rifles and shotguns. These take a variety of ammunition, but your inventory is relatively generous meaning that you can carry a real arsenal into your adventures. The automatic rifle in particular proved particularly satisfying, and powerful enough to take down a late game boss before it could really get anywhere near me.</p>

<p>Alongside your health bar, you’ll also need to manage stamina and hunger. Stamina unfortunately continues to drain outside of combat which can make exploring the map more tedious than it should be whilst only really proving a hindrance when resorting to melee attacks. Hunger can be replenished through a range of consumables to prevent it negatively affecting your other stats. On the whole this became just another thing to manage and never really caused much of an issue as consumables are common items. I didn’t really need to resort to the various cooking recipes, instead living on crisps and tins of beans, which reminded me of my student days.</p>
<p>Alongside the items and equipment you find and scavenge you’ll also need to construct various buildings at Rutherford Ranch. At first this is restricted to a simple stove and crafting bench but later more elaborate blueprints can be found such as ammunition tables which can be set to passively work whilst you explore. This part never becomes too complicated but is a welcome addition to the game.</p>

<p>One part of the game that I found surprisingly underwhelming was the overarching story. I finished the game in just under 7 hours and completed most of the side quests – fortunately so, as a lot of the narrative is hidden within these. The main story ends quite abruptly and leaves quite a lot of questions unanswered. I also found that some side quests did not complete properly and I encountered a couple of crashes and bugs where I fell through the floor.</p>

	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I Hate This Place is close to being a really good fusion of base building and isometric shooter, but never quite nails the game feel. Stealth is mostly a case of sneaking through vents, combat is repetitive and becomes too easy with more powerful weapons, and the base building parts function more like an idle game. To top it off, the story kind of fizzles out and the game ends just as the mechanics start to get established. There is a fun pulp horror experience here, but it doesn’t meet its clear potential.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The bidding war on <strong>Warner Bros. Discovery</strong> is suddenly over: a few hours ago, <strong>Netflix</strong> <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/investor-news-and-events/financial-releases/press-release-details/2026/Netflix-Declines-to-Raise-Offer-for-Warner-Bros-/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially dropped out with a joint statement by its co-CEOs</a> (<strong>Ted Sarandos</strong> and <strong>Greg Peters</strong>), who clearly explained that matching the latest price offered by competitor <strong>Paramount Skydance</strong> would have meant the deal was no longer financially attractive for the streaming giant. They added:</p>



<p><em>We believe we would have been strong stewards of Warner Bros.’ iconic brands, and that our deal would have strengthened the entertainment industry and preserved and created more production jobs in the U.S. But this transaction was always a ‘nice to have’ at the right price, not a ‘must have’ at any price.</em></p>



<p>Just a couple of hours before this statement from Netflix's top executives, <strong>the Warner Bros. Discovery board had declared Paramount's latest offer "the superior bid"</strong>, giving Netflix four days to match it or abandon the negotiations. They quickly chose the latter.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-timeline-of-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war">The timeline of the Warner Bros. Discovery bidding war</h2>



<p>Let's rewind the clock. Warner Bros. Discovery, formed in 2022 through the merger of AT&amp;T and Discovery, <strong>officially went up for sale in the latter half of 2025</strong>. In October, the board <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-discovery-is-officially-up-for-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it was already reviewing interest from multiple parties</a>.</p>



<p>Just around five weeks later, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix announced a deal with the WBD board to acquire the Studio and Streaming assets for $72 billion (with a total evaluation of $82.7 billion)</a></strong>. Three days later, though, Paramount Skydance <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its own $108.4 billion all-cash "hostile" offer</a></strong>. <span>The WBD board&nbsp;<strong>initially recommended that shareholders reject the offer and accept Netflix's</strong>, but Paramount Skydance did not relent.</span></p>



<p>On February 10, 2026, Paramount upgraded its offer to include several key provisions:</p>



<ul>
<li>An agreement to <strong>cover the $2.8 billion breakup fee</strong> WBD would owe Netflix for walking away from their deal </li>



<li>A commitment to <strong>backstop a debt refinancing</strong> that would cut WBD's costs by <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> </li>



<li>A <strong>ticking fee of $650 million in cash per quarter</strong> if the deal was not completed by the end of 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>That started turning the WBD board's heads away from Netflix, but the final bid was made on Tuesday, February 24, <strong>upping the offer to $31 per share in cash</strong>. For comparison, Netflix's offer was $27.75 per share. This means Paramount will acquire the entire WBD (whereas Netflix wouldn't have purchased the linear cable networks) for <strong>$111 billion</strong>, making it objectively the superior offer.</p>



<p>It's hard to say how that will affect Warner Bros. Discovery's gaming division (which just <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-teases-return-to-biggest-franchises-in-2027-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that major releases are expected either next year or the following year). However, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we do know that Netflix did not factor WB Games into their offer at all</a></strong>, considering it to be "relatively" minor; on the other hand, Paramount does own <strong>Skydance Interactive,</strong> which has released several VR games, and <strong>Skydance New Media</strong>, <strong>Amy Hennig</strong>'s studio working on <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-once-again-now-arriving-mid-late-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amy-hennig-will-get-to-make-a-star-wars-game-after-all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">untitled Star Wars game</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Here's hoping they have a solid plan already in place for Warner Bros. Games.</p>

The online retailer has gone through something of a massive restocking mission this week, and at just the right time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Day Finds at Amazon</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest highlights from Amazon's selection include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8xdJ?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ascended Heroes - Elite Trainer Box</a>, now available and in stock for trainers to freely buy.

Listed for $40.64, Amazon has recently restocked the special edition set.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It includes two Prismatic boosters, a special metallic Eevee coin, and a foil Eevee card that features a unique Pokémon Day 2025 logo. That's absolutely worth picking up alongside the new 2026 collection, if I say so myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also want to call out availability on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q451rd?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames - Three Pack Blister</a>, for $32, alongside the Mega Lucario ex Figure Collection, and several of the Scarlet &amp; Violet Unova series, like the Poster Box, Tins, and Illustration Collection. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pokémon Day Finds at TCGplayer</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGplayer has also pulled out all the stops for Pokémon Day, and has several of the most popular Pokémon TCG sets in stock and at market price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of sealed sets, I want to highlight the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Perfect Order booster boxes</a>, which are currently available for <a href="https://zdcs.link/z642Ll?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$201.18 market price at TCGplayer</a>. That's a remarkably good price for the upcoming set releasing on March 27, and probably one of the best deals I've seen all year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring 36 booster packs, you're looking at about $5.50 per pack, which is as close to MSRP as I think we're ever going to get. Compare this to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjbY8?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Phantasmal Flames booster boxes</a>, which are currently going for $320 or more, this is a huge saving. I'd snap this up ASAP before prices spike again as we get closer to release day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My next best suggestion is to consider The Pokémon Center Exclusive Ascended Heroes ETB, which is currently available for just <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8lvM?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$246.84 market price at TCGplayer</a>. Considering this was selling for $400 just a few weeks back, I'd consider this one of the best deals available right now for the biggest Pokémon TCG fans out there.</p><p id="nintendo-switch-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nintendo Switch Games">Nintendo Switch Games on Sale Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon’s Woot store has been known to offer a bunch of deals in the past, but it might just have outdone itself this time around with its <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak1K2w?object_uuid=acfabc53-ecf7-4885-819a-243f4a127aba&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">brand new "Video Games For All!" sale</a> that includes a whole slew of Pokémon games on Nintendo Switch.

<h2 id="h-the-clue">The Clue</h2>



<p>When you first enter the office, you will notice a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">notepad</strong> sitting on a table. This notepad holds the key to the puzzle, but the indentations from the previous writing are currently invisible, and you need a specific item to show the solution.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-pencil">Where to Find the Pencil</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Chairmans-Office-Pencil-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Without the pencil, you will never discover the puzzle box's combination</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To reveal the code, you need to find a writing utensil. Proceed to the smaller <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">office in the back</strong> connected to the main room.</p>



<p>There is an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enemy</strong> lurkinghere. If you have enough ammo, defeat it to search in peace. If you are low on health or ammo, you can avoid the enemy, quickly grab the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Pencil</strong> from the desk, and retreat back to the main room.</p>



<h2 id="h-solving-the-puzzle">Solving the Puzzle</h2>

<p>Once you have the Pencil in your inventory, return to the main office. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Use the Pencil</strong> with the blank notepad.

<h2 id="h-the-reward">The Reward</h2>



<p>Inside the box, you will find the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Moon Quartz</strong>. This is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">three critical items</strong> required to escape the Rhodes Hill Care Center.

While this choice is often down to <strong>personal preference</strong>, the distinct gameplay styles of Grace and Leon mean that <strong>one perspective usually outshines the other</strong>, depending on who you are controlling.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-best-camera-settings" data-level="2">Best Camera Settings</a></li><li><a href="#h-grace-why-first-person-works-best" data-level="2">Grace: Why First-Person Works Best</a></li><li><a href="#h-leon-why-third-person-works-best" data-level="2">Leon: Why Third-Person Works Best</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-best-camera-settings">Best Camera Settings</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Camera-Options-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You can change between first-person and third-person camera at any time</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you want the most polished experience, I recommend <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">First-Person for Grace</strong> to maximize the horror atmosphere and <strong>Third-Person for Leon</strong> to master the combat, which are the exact same recommendations the game provides at the very beginning. </p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">You can change your camera options for each individual character from the Camera tab in the Options menu at any time during gameplay</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-grace-why-first-person-works-best">Grace: Why First-Person Works Best</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Grace-First-Person-Gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>First-person camera is the most immersive in Grace's segments</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For Grace’s segments, which lean heavily into atmosphere and exploration, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">first-person is the optimal way to experience the game</strong> for a few reasons:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Grace's segments, the camera often shifts to first-person during cutscenes. If you are playing in third-person, these transitions can feel abrupt and immersion-breaking. Staying in first-person ensures a seamless flow between gameplay and certain story beats.</li>



<li>A minor but noteworthy difference occurs during frantic escape sequences: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace can trip in third-person, but not in first-person.</strong> While this doesn't happen constantly, avoiding a stumble during a chase can be the difference between life and death in certain situations.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-leon-why-third-person-works-best">Leon: Why Third-Person Works Best</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Third-Person-Gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Third-person camera works best for Leon mostly due to combat</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Leon’s segments in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em>, on the other hand, are built around intense combat against a high number of enemies, making <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">third-person the superior choice for his segments.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Leon often faces much larger groups of enemies than Grace. The wider field of view provided by the third-person camera is <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">essential for keeping track of multiple threats</strong>, preventing you from being surrounded, and allowing you to respond quickly with a shotgun blast or a well-timed parry.</li>



<li>While first-person can be beneficial for precision aiming, Leon can find specific <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gun parts</strong> that allow him to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">aim down sights</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">in first-person</strong> with weapons other than sniper rifles, even while the general camera remains in third-person. This gives you the accuracy of a shooter without sacrificing the spatial awareness needed to survive some of the sticky situations he finds himself in often during the game.</li>

			<p>Surviving the nightmare in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/">Resident Evil Requiem</a></strong></em> requires more than just solid shooting skills. Whether you are navigating claustrophobic halls as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grace Ashcroft</strong> or engaging in intense combat sequences with Leon S. Kennedy, understanding some of the game's underlying systems is the difference between life and death, especially if this is your first entry in the series.</p>



<p>To help you understand and enjoy the game right from the get-go, we have put together the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">best tips for beginners</strong> based on a full playthrough of the game at the highest possible difficulty for a new game run: Standard (Classic).</p>

<h2 id="h-learn-when-and-how-to-fight">Learn When and How to Fight</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Stealth-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Stealth is often the way to go in Resident Evil Requiem</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although just one part of the experience, <strong>combat</strong> remains one of the core elements in Resident Evil Requiem. While <strong>Leon has much better tools for handling multiple enemies&nbsp;at once</strong>, <strong>Grace is not built for combat</strong>. She is a fragile investigator, and her resources and weapon selection are far more limited. As such, for her, the best strategy is to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fight enemies only when absolutely necessary</strong>.</p>



<p>When forced into an encounter, <strong>always aim for headshots or leg shots</strong> to stagger your enemy. Once dazed, move in for a <strong>melee attack</strong> to knock them down. This buys you precious time to either finish them off efficiently with easier headshots or, more importantly, escape the room entirely.</p>



<p>One very important element to consider for both Leon and Grace is <strong>stealth attacks</strong>, which grant you the chance of taking out an unsuspecting enemy. While Leon can do this repeatedly with his <strong>hatchet,</strong> Grace requires a <strong>Hemolytic Injector</strong>, which can be found by exploring locations or by crafting (<strong>1 Scrap + 60 Blood</strong>), so keep this in mind if you're running low on ammo, but have some of these Injectors on hand.</p>



<h2 id="h-master-the-map">Master the Map</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-East-Raccon-City-Map-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Using the map, you will never get truly lost, no matter where you are</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">level design</strong> in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> is <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">intricate</strong> as per the series' tradition, and it is easy to l<strong>ose your bearings</strong> in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center or the vaster Raccoon City. Thankfully, <strong>the map is your best friend.</strong></p>



<p>If you frequently feel lost, make sure to <strong>check your map frequently</strong>. <span>The game is generous with its&nbsp;<strong>map markers,</strong>&nbsp;and any locked door </span>you encounter, or item you leave behind, is automatically noted on your map. As such, if you ever find yourself lost,<strong>just open the map</strong> and look for rooms with a door outlined in red or any other icon: <strong>the solution is usually staring right at you.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-use-crafting-effectively">Use Crafting Effectively</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Crafting-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The crafting system has some nuances to understand to be used effectively</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The <strong>crafting system</strong> works differently for Leon and Grace. While the classic series' protagonist only needs to find <strong>items</strong> to craft additional ammo and healing items,  the FBI's inspector has to use <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Infected</strong> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Blood</strong> in conjunction with <strong>Scraps</strong> to craft items. </p>



<p>Already in the Rhodes Hill Care Center, Grace will find <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Blood Transfusion Bags</strong>, which allow her to recharge the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Blood Collector</strong>. When using Blood Transfusion bags, make sure to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">wait until the entire amount can be used</strong>. If you use a bag when your injector is nearly full, <strong>any surplus blood is permanently discarded</strong>. In a game where every drop counts for crafting healing items, ammo, and injectors, wasting blood is a mistake you should not make.</p>



<h2 id="h-learn-advanced-reloading">Learn Advanced Reloading</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Advanced-Reloading-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Reload Canceling is a very useful technique that can make battles more manageable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most useful expert techniques in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> that is not properly explained until later in the game is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Reload Canceling</strong>. </p>



<p>If you find yourself in a bind and can't afford to wait for a long reload animation to finish, you can <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cancel the operation at any time by pressing L2</strong>. This allows you to immediately transition to a shooting stance or reposition more easily if an enemy gets too close during a reload.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-adjust-aim-assist">Don’t Be Afraid to Adjust Aim Assist</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Aim-Assist-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Aim Assist can make the experience more enjoyable if you are not skilled at shooters</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> features intense action,<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> it is not a high-speed shooter</strong>. The focus of the game is the survival horror experience and its haunting atmosphere. </p>



<p>If you are not a veteran of the genre and find combat too challenging for you, do not hesitate to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">adjust the Aim Assist settings</strong> in the options menu. </p>



<ul>
<li>With <strong>Aim Snap</strong>, your character will immediately lock onto the nearest enemy. </li>



<li>With <strong>Aim Follow</strong>, your character will keep aiming at the enemy even when they are moving, making it easier to shoot them repeatedly without having to readjust your aim manually. </li>
</ul>



<p><strong>The effect in both settings can be tweaked with the Aim Assist slider, which ranges from 1 to 10.</strong></p>



<p>As there's <strong>no real penalty</strong> for using any of the settings above, you should use the tools provided to make the experience more manageable while you learn the enemy patterns if you're having trouble.</p>

<p>While the game introduces the mechanic early on, the tutorial doesn't tell you everything you need to know about it. Here is how to master the parry and save your skin in the most intense fights.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-basics-of-parrying">The Basics of Parrying</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Leon-Parry-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The core of Leon’s combat mechanics in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em> lies in his hatchet. By holding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">L2 / LB / L</strong>, you can enter a defensive stance to deflect incoming blows.</p>



<ul>
<li>Every time you parry an attack, your hatchet will lose sharpness. If it goes blunt, you lose your primary defensive tool until it's sharpened by holding <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">L2 / LB / L</strong> and pressing <strong>Square / X / Y</strong>. Sharpening takes some time, so make sure to do so while standing away from enemies.</li>



<li>Keeping <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">L2</strong> held down is the safest way to avoid taking direct health damage, but it is not the optimal way to play as it drains a lot of durability without providing any other advantage other than negating damage.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-perfect-parry">The Perfect Parry</h2>

<p>To truly master Leon's combat, you should always aim for a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Perfect Parry</strong>. This is achieved by <strong>pressing L2 / LB / L at the exact moment the enemy attack connects.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>A Perfect Parry leaves an enemy staggered and wide open for a high-damage follow-up or a  finisher, if its health is low enough.</li>
</ul>



<p>While this is one of the <strong>best moves</strong> in Leon's kit, it is also the most <strong>risky</strong>. Don't attempt perfect parries against powerful enemies you have never fought before, especially in Standard (Classic) difficulty, as you risk receiving a lot of damage. Instead, <strong>take the time</strong> to learn enemy patterns so as to attempt perfect parries with the highest confidence</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Which-Attacks-Can-Be-Parried-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The way the in-game tutorial frames the mechanic, you might think you can <strong>only parry enemies wielding weapons</strong> like debris, pipes or chainsaws. <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">That is not the case</strong>!</p>



<p>In <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem</em>, you can parry <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">barehanded attacks</strong> just as effectively as weapon strikes, and even nullify ranged attacks like thrown debris. Like for perfect parries, learn the enemy attacks to master this defensive mechanics and destroy the undead hordes coming at Leon as he makes his way through the Rhodes Hill Care Center and Raccoon City. Do note that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">some attacks cannot be parried</strong>, so learning the enemy attack patterns remains paramount for using Leon's parry effectively.</p>

			<p>Choosing the right difficulty in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a></em> is an important first step that can change the enjoyment of your first playthrough quite a bit, as some of the changes between the different difficulty settings have a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">deep impact on the experience.</strong></p>



<p>Here is the breakdown of the <strong>best difficulty settings</strong> to choose for your first run.</p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-standard-classic" data-level="2">Standard (Classic)</a></li><li><a href="#h-standard-modern" data-level="2">Standard (Modern)</a></li><li><a href="#h-casual-mode" data-level="2">Casual Mode</a></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-standard-classic">Standard (Classic)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Standard-Classic-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>If you're as much a zombie slayer as Leon, Standard (Classic) is your choice</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For those who have been playing the series for a very long time, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Standard (Classic) is the way to go</strong>. This mode is designed for veterans who want to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Resident Evil Requiem </em>at its best.</p>



<ul>
<li> Enemies are slightly stronger than in Standard (Modern), making every encounter feel more tense and dangerous.</li>



<li>Grace’s segments are more in line with classic entries in the series, requiring much tighter management of your limited supplies.</li>



<li>In this mode, Grace needs <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ink Ribbons to save at typewriters</strong>.</li>



<li>Autosaves during Grace’s gameplay are strictly limited, meaning death carries a considerable penalty.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-standard-modern">Standard (Modern)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Standard-Modern-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Standard (Modern) retains the series' intensity while providing a fai</em><em>r</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> amount of ease</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you are a complete newcomer to the franchise, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">I suggest trying out Standard (Modern) first</strong>. This mode provides a relatively smooth experience that doesn't completely gut the game's atmosphere.</p>



<ul>
<li>This mode lacks the Ink Ribbon requirement found in Classic, allowing for a smoother flow for those who don't want to manage save items.</li>



<li>High stakes are what the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Resident Evil</em> series is all about, and while this difficulty mode is not as challenging as Standard (Classic), it does a good job keeping some of the high stakes of the experience intact. </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode">Casual Mode</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Resident-Evil-Requiem-Casual-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Casual Mode is your choice only if you want to blaze through the story</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The easiest difficulty, <strong>Casual Mode</strong>, should be played only by <strong>absolute newcomers or those who wish to blaze through the story.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Combat encounters in this mode are easy and generally lack the signature tension of the series.</li>



<li>Ultimately, playing in Casual Mode strips the game of its core elements, creating a dissonance between the story's tense narrative and a way too high ease of gameplay, which feels like a disservice to the game's design. However, if you start on Modern and find it too intense, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">you can switch to Casual at any time after starting the game</strong>.</li>
</ul>
