			<p>The PC version of God of War Ragnarok doesn't offer many opportunities to scale beyond the PlayStation 5's Quality display modes, but with some choice mods, the latest entry in the series can look outright gorgeous.</p>
<p>A new 8K resolution video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Massihancer">Beyond Dreams</a> shows the game running with ReSTIR G.I. in Complete Ray Tracing and a custom ReShade preset which bring improved global illumination, ambient occlusion, enhanced FOV, Color grading, and more. In pretty much every scenario shown in the video, the mods make the game look incredible and much better than it does on PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>The PC version of God of War Ragnarok comes complete with the Valhalla expansion that was released for free on consoles last year. The expansion is a great addition to the experience, managing to introduce a roguelite tweak that works incredibly well, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>For a free expansion, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla offers quite a lot. The roguelite take on the base game's formula works extremely well, thanks to the excellent combat system, which truly shines in the extreme combat scenarios Kratos will have to conquer to confront his past and finally make a step towards the future. Its short length, which prevents the adventure from overstaying its welcome, and excellent accessibility with multiple difficulty settings that don't lock content behind them, also make the expansion one that all those who loved the base game should play.</em></p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 worldwide.</p>

			<p>Notorious Studios, the game developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/notorious-studios-founded-by-ex-wow-devs-wants-to-build-the-next-chapter-of-core-fantasy-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> by former members of the World of Warcraft development team, has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-early-access-debut-set-for-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery</a>, its PvPvE extraction action RPG, will be available during the upcoming Steam Next Fest with an Alpha <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2344320/Legacy_Steel__Sorcery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a>.</p>
<p>Chris Kaleiki, Founder and CEO of Notorious Studios, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Our goal was to build upon the foundations of RPG and MMO PvP into its own title, something we haven't quite seen before. We incorporated many of the lessons and learnings from building one of the biggest MMOs of all time (World of Warcraft) into Legacy. Based on feedback we've had from players already, I think we have something special here and we can't wait to share it with more and more players.</em></p>

<li>Actively dodge, block, sprint, attack, and cast in combat.</li>
<li>Level up each character to unlock new skills and traits.</li>
<li>The world is part of the battle. Warriors can charge through walls and hurl boulders, while priests can float over danger and away from enemies. Each class has unique ways of interacting with the environment.</li>
<li>Improve your reputation with vendors to craft the most impressive gear and get them to sell you the best stuff.</li>
<li>Upgrade your permanent dwelling with higher quality furnishings. Better facilities mean more benefits on your adventures.</li>

</ul>
<p>The game will launch in early access and remain there for around one year before the 1.0 release, which will feature more classes, maps, social features, Steam achievements, additional art, and balance polish. During early access, Notorious Studios plans to release a major update every few months containing new features and content, in addition to bug fixes as needed.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2%E2%80%99s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players.1005006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Destiny 2 has since switched to episodic content to try and make the game more successful after the latest expansion release failed to sell as well as they had hoped. As a result, Bungie has made the choice to switch up their technique entirely, now making all content released episodic, with three episodes being announced by the company. The first episode, Echoes, was released in June, and the second episode, Revenant, is beginning to be released this month. Act 1 of Destiny 2's Revenant has been released, but players quickly find themselves unhappy. Revenant is adding a lot of new content to the game, including updates to Onslaught, as well as new armor and weapons. However, one of the biggest features is the removal of content time-gating, something that fans have been annoyed with for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Revenant was released just yesterday, where players get to fight alongside Mithrax and take on Fikrul, who was one of the major villains in Forsaken, as well as in some other content from Destiny 2. The trailer seemed to be full of excitement and gave the players a lot of hype to work with, but as the content has been released, it seems that players are already disillusioned with what has been released. The whole concept of episodic content for the game was to make it last longer than the expansions did and so that there would be drawn-out storylines that players would get to progress through at a reasonable speed. However, that does not seem to be the case with Destiny 2's Revenant.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Revenant | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vm_UeYVOWFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the time-gates being removed from the content, it seems that there isn't much content there to begin with. In the first act of Episode 1, it seemed that players were unhappy with the meaningful narrative being time-gated, as it just didn't feel appropriate. However, players immediately began to express their disappointment in the new content, as players found out that there was just about an hour of meaningful content in the new Episode release. Granted, this isn't the entire episode and is only the first act, but the first act is comprised solely of three missions for players to complete in its totality. Players will now have to wait until November 19 for Act 2 to be released, and there's no guarantee that there will be any sizable content added in that part of the episode, either. The trailer seems to have overhyped the act, and players have been left incredibly disappointed.</p>
<p>Already, YouTube videos are coming out expressing their disappointment, and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1fz7mwf/there_is_no_way/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-can-be-finished-in-under-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Destiny 2 Subreddit</a> is brimming with commentary about the recent content added to the game. Considering how The Final Shape performed, the negativity surrounding their new system doesn't seem to be doing <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-to-compensate-artist-for-destiny-2-nerf-blaster-art/">Bungie any favors</a>, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-hours-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Piece of Cake Studios has announced the Early Access release date for spooky co-op heist horror game&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours</em>, and it's arriving later this month.</p>
<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC via Steam Early Access on October 24th, which should give you plenty of time to rustle up a few friends alongside whom you can take on its haunted corridors.</p>
<p>In said press release, Piece of Cake describes&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>as offering "a high-stakes heist" which is quickly "derailed by a chilling supernatural twist". You and your friends will have to explore your surroundings and find a way to survive the horror that is now stalking you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-hours-early-access-release-date-heist.jpg?itok=5MTBLk9z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-hours-early-access-release-date-heist.jpg?itok=wYeUpxK7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>is a spooky heist game with a supernatural twist.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're into games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/content-warning-sales-two-million"><em>Content Warning</em></a>, then you'll probably want to check this one out, as it looks like it'll offer a similarly terrifying experience for you and your co-op buddies (although you can play it alone if you prefer).</p>
<p>Piece of Cake is promising five unique monsters in the Early Access release, each of which will have its own "deadly abilities", alongside "surprising game mechanics and objects" which will allow you to either co-operate with or betray your friends.</p>
<p>Maps in&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>are procedurally generated, so you won't be able to learn them ahead of time, but the game will offer a variety of missions that come with different challenges.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, too, that this is all part of the Early Access release, so naturally,&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours</em>&nbsp;will be updated with more content as time goes on. In fact, Piece of Cake has already released the&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the next few months, which you can check out here.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-hours-roadmap-2024-2025.jpg?itok=EzgHipl- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-hours-roadmap-2024-2025.jpg?itok=Y3Q9hjBK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you can see, you'll get lots more&nbsp;<em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>content in the next few months.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Dark Hours&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208570/Dark_Hours/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on October 24th. It'll set you back $9.99, which doesn't seem too bad for a game that's designed to be replayed.</p>

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang will be holding a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264418/nvidia-ces-2025-keynote-rtx-5090-rumors">CES keynote on January 6th</a>, and now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-32-gb-rtx-5080-16-gb-rtx-5070-12-gb-ces-2025-launch/"><em>Wccftech </em>claims</a> that Nvidia will showcase a trio of next-generation RTX 50-series GPUs during Huang’s keynote.</p><p>Rumored specs of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255234/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-specs-leak">RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 leaked last month</a>, with Nvidia’s flagship RTX 5090 expected to ship with 32GB of GDDR7 memory and a 600-watt spec. <em>Wccftech </em>reports that the RTX 5070 will feature a 192-bit memory bus with 12GB of GDDR7 VRAM. The RTX 5070 is also said to have a 250-watt total board power spec, 14 percent higher than the RTX 4070. Hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1844012353895223499">kopite7kimi has corroborated</a> the report, suggesting the GPU will ship with 12GB of VRAM and the 250-watt spec.</p><p><em>Wccftech</em>’s report also points to a more powerful RTX 5080 than expected. The unannounced GPU will reportedly have a 32Gbps memory speed instead of the rumored 28Gbps and a maximum bandwidth of 1024GB/s instead of the 896GB/s that was rumored. If these specs are correct, then, <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/geforce-rtx-5080-rumored-with-32gbps-gddr7-memory-rtx-5070-reportedly-set-for-ces-2025-debut">as <em>VideoCardz</em> points out</a>, this could mean the RTX 5080 is faster and requires less power than the existing RTX 4090.</p><p>All three RTX 5090, 5080, and 5070 cards are said to be powered by a single 12VHPWR connector and will be based on Nvidia’s latest Blackwell architecture. <em>Wccftech</em> says Nvidia’s CES keynote will also focus on next-generation AI technologies for gaming with a “major surprise” expected.</p><p>Nvidia first announced its RTX 40-series of GPUs in September 2022, with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/20/23362653/nvidia-rtx-4080-4090-price-release-date">introduction of the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080</a>. While Nvidia doesn’t typically announce next-gen GPUs at CES, it previously announced its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24028636/nvidia-rtx-4080-super-4070-ti-specs-release-date-pricing">RTX 40-series Super cards</a>&nbsp;at CES 2024, with the RTX 4070 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4080 Super all having launched earlier this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, for most parents, it’s routinely assumed to be a safe online playground. The colossally successful portal for wildly popular user-created games has repeatedly been accused of doing far too little to protect its young users from exploitation, and from sexual predators. This is now underlined by a report from short-selling investigative firm Hindenburg Research.</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/roblox-hindenburg-research-report-pedophile-hellscape/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/09/roblox-hindenburg-research-report-pedophile-hellscape/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by <em>Fortune</em></a></span>, Hindenburg Research has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uploaded its latest investigation</a></span> under the title, “<em>Roblox</em>: Inflated Key Metrics For Wall Street And A Pedophile Hellscape For Kids<em>.” </em></p><h2 id="h20638"><a id=""></a>User Inflation</h2><p>The accusations within are, as the title might suggest, incredibly incendiary. This begins with suggestions that Roblox Corp’s share prices are inflated via “growth metrics it presents to Wall Street” that don’t represent reality. The company, which has made a loss every quarter since going public in 2021, is accused of “lying to investors, regulators and advertisers about the number of ‘people’ on its platform, inflating the key metric by 25-42%+.” It then adds, “We also show how engagement hours, another key metric, is inflated by an estimated 100%+.”</p><p>These purported figures are based on comparing the numbers Roblox states publicly to those provided by former employees who claim internal numbers are markedly different, accounting for multiple accounts and bots. The report goes as far as to describe this as being like “two sets of books for counting users: one for internal business decisions...and one used by the financial team that reports higher metrics to investors.”</p><p>Accusations of grossly inflated player numbers go a lot further. Hindenburg says its research has shown that <em>Roblox</em>’s second-most popular game, <em>Blox Fruits</em>, is “dominated by traffic from Vietnam,” where extremely popular Facebook groups were advertising methods to run over 20 <em>Roblox</em> tabs at a time, something players might be incentivized to do because they can sell the fruits of their labor for in-game currency.</p><p>Hindenburg says it hired a technical consultant who “monitored the top ~7,200 Roblox games across ~2.1 million Roblox servers, collecting 297.7 million rows of real-time player data.” From this extensive data, the investigative short seller concludes that rather than the average user playing 2.4 hours a day as Roblox’s data indicates, it was in fact closer to around 22 minutes. The report suggests this is in part due to bots, and in part thanks to its claim that <em>Roblox</em> “incentivizes developers to create ‘AFK’ games that artificially inflate engagement.”</p><h2 id="h20639"><a id=""></a>‘Pedophile Hellscape’</h2><figure id="" data-id="254a83f50410a853ae2333b554a3f534" data-recommend-id="image://254a83f50410a853ae2333b554a3f534" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image promoting Roblox game Adopt Me." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image promoting Roblox game Adopt Me." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Uplift Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="254a83f50410a853ae2333b554a3f534" data-recommend-id="image://254a83f50410a853ae2333b554a3f534" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image promoting Roblox game Adopt Me." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Following on from investigations by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wired</em></a></span> and the excellent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>People Make Games</em></a></span> in 2021, Hindenburg saves its most provocative language for the topic of child protection. It uses the words, “our in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.”</p><p>The report makes specific reference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://endsexualexploitation.org/roblox/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://endsexualexploitation.org/roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a 2024 report by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation</a></span> titled, “<em>Roblox</em> Treats Child Protection Like A Game.”</p><p>Here the report’s evidence becomes more anecdotal than analytical, but it still finds some damning evidence that suggests a broad lack of care when it comes to protecting children. Multiple accounts registered to variations on the name “Jeffrey Epstein” had usernames like “@igruum_minors” and “@RavpeTinyK1dsJE.” The most shocking reported element reads,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>After we found a username, we listed our age as “under 13” to see if children are being exposed to adult content. By merely plugging ‘adult’ into the Roblox search bar, we found a group called “Adult Studios” with 3,334 members openly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors.</p><p>We tracked some of the members of “Adult Studios” and easily found 38 Roblox groups—one with 103,000 members—openly soliciting sexual favors and trading child pornography.</p></blockquote><p>The “Adult Studios” group has been locked since the report’s publication.</p><p>The report goes on to detail games available in <em>Roblox</em> that seem like they should easily be spotted and blocked, with names like <em>Escape to Epstein Island</em> and <em>Run From Diddy Simulator</em>. Hindenburg also found games with a million visits like <em>Beat Up Homeless Outside 7/11 Simulator</em> and <em>Beat Up The Pregnant</em>, the latter described as one in which “users hacked pregnant women to death in a Wal-Mart parking lot with machetes or killed them with frying pans or a selection of guns.”</p><p>Further,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Posing as a child in Roblox’s “therapy” experience, our therapist introduced himself as a “rapper with only one p”. We were advised to run away from home and that he would come pick us up so we could move into his basement in exchange for paying rent with our body.</p></blockquote><p>The recurring theme in the report is that when registering accounts as children aged 8 or 9, there were no restrictions to adult-themed groups, or even groups that had been repeatedly moderated for “trading underage pornography.”</p><h2 id="h20640"><a id=""></a>Roblox Response</h2><p>Roblox Corporation has responded to Hindenburg’s report overnight. The company titles its reply, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_news/2024/Oct/08/hindenburg-statement-final.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://s27.q4cdn.com/984876518/files/doc_news/2024/Oct/08/hindenburg-statement-final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Roblox Refutes Misleading Claims In Hindenburg Report”</a></span> (pdf), and begins with wildly irrelevant statements like, “Every day, tens of millions of users of all ages have safe and positive experiences on Roblox, abiding by the company’s Community Standards.”</p><p>This is unquestionably true, but it doesn’t refute any claims made by Hindenburg. It’s a bit like a car manufacturer responding to reports that one of its cars keeps exploding by saying, “Millions of customers don’t blow up every day.” It then reiterates the company’s commitment to “proactive and preventative safety measures,” which one might argue aren’t something to boast about in the face of thousands of words of detailed evidence about how they aren’t working.</p><p>The response then moves on to asserting that Hindenburg’s financial claims are “misleading.” It points out that as short sellers, Hindenburg has a financial incentive here, and goes on to talk about “cash bookings” and “cash flow,” which it claims the report leaves out because the “facts simply don’t support their agenda.”</p><p>There’s then a section refuting the claims that Roblox reports deceptive user figures to investors, by quoting a section from their own accounts that openly explains how the user numbers are calculated, explicitly stating, “our DUAs [Daily Active Users] are not a measure of unique individuals accessing <em>Roblox</em>.” One might suggest that “Daily Active Users” isn’t a brilliant term to use in this light, but more significantly, it fails to recognize that the specific claim made by Hindenburg’s report was that the company uses <em>different internal figures</em> for its own business decisions than those it shares publicly. There is no mention of this in the reply at all.</p><p>It’s a very peculiar response, given the severity of the claims made by Hindenburg Research, especially with respect to the severe failings encountered when it comes to child protection. Simply stating that <em>Roblox</em> “has invested heavily in its Trust &amp; Safety efforts,” with no mention that there may still be room for improvement, or any expression of regret over the serious failings Hindenburg says it’s discovered, to me suggests ambivalence at best.</p><p>Roblox Corporation is the company whose studio head, Stefano Corazza, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">said earlier this year</a></span> that the abysmal fees paid to young users who create the games in <em>Roblox</em> are “a gift” for “15-year-olds, in Indonesia, living in a slum.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Saber Interactive and Stormind Games have revealed a terrifying new feature being added to A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, an upcoming survival title. It’s an expansion of the movie universe first established in 2018, putting players in command of a survivor trying desperately to live a silent life to avoid the brutal threat lurking in the shadows.</p>



<p>This new feature implemented by Stormind Games has been dubbed ‘Microphone Noise Detection’, and put simply if you make a single sound while playing, you’ll be instantly set upon by the game’s deadly creatures.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-survive-the-end-of-the-world">Survive the End of the World</h2>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was already freaky enough, with players needing to move slowly and gingerly to navigate a world torn apart by a terrifying invasion. In an environment where a single foot scrape or creaking door can spell death, the intensity of the gameplay never relents, which is superb for players who love a jumpscare or two.</p>



<p>The new mic monitoring feature sounds brilliant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Amplify the terror of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place</em>&nbsp;like never before with the optional “Microphone Noise Detection” feature. By activating your microphone, the game’s deadly creatures can detect every sound you make, bringing the horror right into your room.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given that it’s optional, you can just switch it off, no harm, no foul. But if you want that added challenge, it’ll be great to keep it switched on. It hasn’t been confirmed how sensitive it is, but I’m assuming that even a stifled gasp following a jumpscare would be enough to trigger it, bringing hell raining down upon you.</p>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead releases October 17 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Are you picking it up? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-switch-2-nintendo-just-released-a-100-interactive-alarm-clock-called-alarmo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With the gaming world waiting with bated breath for Nintendo to announce <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name">Switch 2</a>, the company behind Mario has once again surprised its fans with the announcement of a completely unexpected piece of hardware: an interactive alarm clock.</p><p>“Ever wish that you could wake up in one of the playful worlds from Nintendo?” the company asked in a note to press. “Well, it’s time to stop dreaming!”</p><p>The Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo is an interactive alarm clock designed to add “some Nintendo charm to your home and your daily routine.” Alarmo is due out early 2025 priced $99.99, with Nintendo Switch Online members in the U.S. and Canada able to buy it right now via the My Nintendo Store.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo Images</h3></div></output><p>Alarmo features motion sensor technology that responds to your movements, letting you snooze your alarm with motion alone and stop it by getting out of bed. You can pick from 35 scenes inspired by five Nintendo titles – Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, Pikmin 4, and Ring Fit Adventure – then set a time and let Alarmo do its work.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb from Nintendo:</p><blockquote>In the morning you’ll experience immersive sounds and music from the scene you picked. Rise to sounds of the Mushroom Kingdom with Mario and friends, begin your day’s adventure with Link and Princess Zelda, or start fresh with the Inklings from Splatoon 3. And those are just some of the experiences you can wake up to!</blockquote><blockquote>That’s not all – you can also check Records to see how much you move around in your sleep, set an hourly chime themed to your chosen title, and change between Steady or Gentle Modes for your morning alarm. In Steady Mode, the alarm will gradually get more intense the longer you stay in bed, whereas Gentle Mode offers a more consistent intensity level. There’s also Button Mode for a more traditional, tactile “hit the snooze button” alarm clock experience. You can even use sleepy sounds to wind down with soothing music and sounds at your set bedtime.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here's how it works. Before the alarm, a character from the title you selected waits patiently on screen. When the alarm begins, gentle sounds unique to the scene you’ve chosen begin to play. Then, a visitor arrives. After a few seconds, someone (or some thing!) from the scene you picked will appear. You can then wave your hand or move your body to make the clock quieter. Depending on the title you’ve choosen, you might also hear coins or other familiar game sounds when you interact with Alarmo.</p><p>Eventually, your visit will end and gentle sounds will play again until your visitor returns. (This will repeat a number of times if you stay in bed.) If you stay in bed too long, your alarm will get more intense and you’ll get a visit from someone "more persuasive," Nintendo warned. (Yes, it's Bowser.) When you get all the way out of bed, the alarm will stop and you’ll be treated to a brief victory fanfare.</p><p>Like releasing patches for its video games, Nintendo will update Alarmo with scenes from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons for free when they become available.</p><p>It's worth noting that Alarmo is only compatible with twin to king-sized beds, so it won't work with a single. It should be placed facing the center of the bed, within arm’s reach, and no higher than eight inches above the sleeper, Nintendo said. If there is more than one sleeper in the bed, Nintendo recommends using Button Mode for "the best experience."</p><p>And if you're worried about Alarmo spying on you in your sleep and telling Nintendo how much you toss and turn, the company insisted the device "does not communicate any information" to the Mario maker.</p><p>It's not the expected Switch 2 announce, but Alarmo is new hardware from Nintendo, which is always worth getting out of bed for.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Mini PCs are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer solid specs, great prices, and a footprint that’ll fit onto even the most cramped of workspaces. They’re usually pretty cheap, but they’re more affordable than ever thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a>. From the gaming-ready AceMagician lineup to the entry-level Beelink S12 Pro Mini, there are a lot of good price cuts for you to explore.</p><p>If you’re interested in gaming, mini PCs aren’t always the greatest option. However, there are two AceMagician models on sale right now that can serve as budget-friendly gaming rigs. You won’t be running games at max settings, but you should be able to run titles like Fortnite and Counter-Strike well beyond 60fps when the graphics are turned down.

                <p>You can find a lot of new gear on sale during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/v/">Amazon's Big Deal Days events</a>, but if you don't mind something being lightly used, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJT5DJ16?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">you can get a PlayStation Portal at a very attractive price</a>. As part of the Amazon Resale program, the PlayStation Portal is just $141 for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="nofollow ">Prime subscribers</a>. Normally, this costs $200 brand new and $176 for a refurbished version, so Prime members are getting a really good deal here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4381788-portal-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4381788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4381788-portal-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4381788"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4381788-portal-2.jpg"></figure><p>Amazon's Resale program typically does a very good job of making a preowned item look brand new, and in some cases, you could be getting a mint item because only the original box was opened. Even if it was briefly used, Amazon will clean it up.</p><p>This device has proven to be very popular since it launched last November and it sold out fairly quickly whenever stock was available. This is essentially a DualSense controller with an 8-inch LCD screen sandwiched between the joysticks, allowing you to stream games from your PS5 to it. Because of the DualSense-inspired design, it offers adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, and it supports a resolution of 1080p at 60fps. With a 3.5mm jack included, you can easily plug a headset in and enjoy your PS5 games in peace.</p><p>It's worth noting that you will need a stable internet connection to get the best performance out of the PlayStation Portal and a PS5 console for it to sync to. It's a well-designed device, and in ideal situations, you're getting low latency and lossless audio for reliably smooth gaming sessions.</p><p>A few other gaming deals to check out for mobile enthusiasts are also live right now at Amazon.

            <p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">upcoming game inspired by the film franchise of the same name</a> - is set to include an optional microphone feature that allows its creatures to detect any real-life noises made by the player.</p>
<p>It's called the 'Microphone Noise Detection' feature, and pretty much does what it says. Essentially, if players choose to activate their mic when playing The Road Ahead, any cough, sneeze or sudden announcement from a loved one that it is time for supper could give the location of your in-game character (a young asthmatic college student named Alex) away.</p>
<p>This, developer Stormind Games has said, will all help to bring the "horror right into your room", which sounds more than enough to scare the John Krasinskis out of me. </p>

		<p>SEGA has confirmed that the next game that will be getting the movie treatment will be Shinobi, which has been a dormant franchise since 2011. Shinobi follows the ninja Joe Musashi and the first game of the series released in arcades in 1987 with a home release following in 1988. Following on from that were a number of sequels and spin offs, with the last Shinobi game releasing in 2011 for the Nintendo 3DS. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/sega-is-making-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-shinobi-golden-axe-streets-of-rage-more/">A new Shinobi game</a> has been announced, but there are no details of what to expect with that.</p>

<p>The Shinobi movie is going to be directed by Sam Hargrave, who is most well known for directing Extraction and Extraction 2. He has also been a stunt and fight co-ordinator in a lot of blockbusters including some MCU movies like Avengers: Endgame, as well as Atomic Blonde. Ken Kobayashi has been called in to write the Shinobi screenplay, and his credits include Marvel’s Hit-Monkey and Sunny.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/12/09/shinobi-review-3ds/">Shinobi Review (3DS)</a></h2>
<p>In our last Shinobi review, Dan said, <em>“I’m aware that some of the cons come across as me being a bit of a whining baby. However, if Shinobi was designed so that every death was your fault I would be more than happy to plough on, honing my skills.As it stands though most deaths are caused by some cheap, annoying sequence of events like the one I described earlier, and when this is coupled with a control scheme that never feels right it drags a decent game down to something that feels totally average.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/off-the-grid-is-now-available-in-free-early-access/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The third-person Battle Royale shooter Off the Grid is now available for free early access for those on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via the Epic Games Store, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gunzilla-games-off-the-grid-a-battle-royale-game-set-in-a-cyberpunk-world/">announced by Gunzilla</a>, the title developer. Off the Grid takes you on a journey through Teardrop Island in a cyberpunk world that has been created in collaboration with Neill Blomkamp. Blomkamp has directed movies such as District 9, Chappie, and, more recently, Gran Turismo. This is his first venture in the video game world, and he has helped to create the dystopian cyberpunk world that players will get to explore in the Extraction Royale.</p>
<p>Off The Grid features both PvP and PvE elements, with the worlds colliding to create "the most extreme Battle Royale ever!" In this game, players will fight for their lives on a tropical island that has a dark and intense history of corporate warfare. Currently, there are a few locations, weapons, limbs, and game modes available for players to look through and utilize in the game while they're exploring Teardrop Island.</p>
<p>In this game, players are responsible for their survival by building up their character with high-value gear from the island, such as interchangeable cybernetic limbs mid-battle. There are plenty of cyber limbs and hundreds of weapon combinations to try out, making it a game that anyone can win. Alongside the usage of cybernetic limbs and weapon combinations, players will have devastating abilities that they can utilize, to ensure that they can climb to the top. As listed on the Off The Grid website, there are currently<a href="https://gameoffthegrid.com/#game-features" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> over 30 cyberlimbs</a> that players can use, each featuring their own unique abilities.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of Early Access, Off The Grid now has a new 4K trailer that showcases just over two minutes of footage, with cinematics and gameplay included. For those who are interested in the PvP prospect of the game, players will get to participate in a 150-player melee, where loot is available, and you can trade items with others to ensure that you get the best possible build.</p>
<p><iframe title="OFF THE GRID | Early Access Trailer - 4K" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sZ1iA9LgQPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The PvE aspect of the game features an extensive 6-hour narrative campaign, where you'll be able to complete the story while other players take part in a Battle Royale around you. In the campaign, you'll have to take on jobs for the three video game companies while searching through Teardrop Island to uncover its dark secrets and help Cobra uncover the missing pieces of his past.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-interactive-alarm-clock-alarmo-coming-early-2025.1004925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-alarmo-interactive-alarm-clock<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced Alarmo, a new interactive alarm clock full of Nintendo-themed sounds and visuals. It's due to land early next year, although you'll want to sign up for Nintendo Switch Online if you want an early chance at grabbing it.</p>
<p>According to a press release, Alarmo is "an interactive alarm clock designed to add some Nintendo charm to your home and your daily routine".</p>
<p>It's got a motion sensor that responds to movement; Nintendo says you can snooze it "with motion alone", and you can stop it simply by getting out of bed, with no button presses required.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-alarmo-clock-in-situ.jpg?itok=yPVZzlik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-alarmo-clock-in-situ.jpg?itok=ndFV9SDJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Alarmo is an alarm clock filled with Nintendo scenes and sounds.</figcaption></figure><p>The clock features 35 scenes inspired by five Nintendo games, and Nintendo says that you'll "experience immersive sounds and music" from the games you pick in the mornings.&nbsp;Here's the list of games that have inspired scenes and sounds on the Nintendo Alarmo.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-mario-odyssey"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon-3"><em>Splatoon 3</em></a></li>
<li><em>Pikmin 4</em></li>
<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ring-fit-adventure"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a></li>
</ul><p>Alarmo also lets you check how much you've moved around in your sleep via its Records function, and it features two different modes for your morning alarm: Steady and Gentle.</p>
<p>In Steady mode, the alarm will "gradually get more intense the longer you stay in bed", while Gentle "offers a more consistent intensity level". You'll have to be honest with yourself when you're picking which mode you think you'll respond to best.</p>

<p>If you'd prefer a classic alarm clock experience, you can also put Alarmo in Button Mode, which will let you hit the big button on the top to snooze the clock, just like in classic movies.</p>
<p>Linking a Nintendo Account to Alarmo will let you download extra scenes based on&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>&nbsp;</em>as well, so make sure to do that if you want to wake up to the sounds of a bustling&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>town.</p>
<p>Alarmo <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arrives early next year</a>, and it'll set you back $100 if you want one. Right now, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership if you want to pick one up, but you'll also be able to buy Alarmo at Nintendo's New York store, and you won't need a membership for that.</p>
<p>You can also read more about the clock via <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-14-nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-part-1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new Nintendo Ask the Developer feature</a>, which contains an interview with the developers behind the project.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced new hardware, but anyone waiting to see what the Nintendo Switch 2 could possibly bring is going to be quite alarmed. It’s an alarm clock. Called Alarmo.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo – Wake up to a world of games!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1pDMcREd58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Alarmo will be available exclusively to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers from later this week, with wider availability coming in mid-January 2025. Pricing hasn’t been revealed just yet.</p>
<p>Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo – to give it its full name –&nbsp;is pretty fancy for an alarm clock, that’s for sure. The face is a round LCD screen, and there’s a round dial at the top that features and RGB LED… and then there’s the motion sensor to see if you’re actually getting up and out of bed.</p>
<p>Alarmo features five different game themes –&nbsp;Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 3, Pikmin 4, Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Ring Fit Adventure –&nbsp;and will play music from these games to gently wake you up with accompanying graphics on screen. However, this is an interactive alarm clock, using the motion sensor to see if you’re moving around and getting up to add various game sounds on top of the music. Rolling around will lower the music volume, and fully getting up with turn the alarm off without needing to touch it.</p>

<p>There’s a few different modes, including Gentle Mode, Firm Mode and Button Mode, depending on what works for your morning routine. At night, it can play Sleepy Sounds to help you drift off. Your get-up-ability will also be tracked and rated (after a software update).</p>
<p>This is Wi-Fi connected (of course), with Mario Kart 8 and Animal Crossing themes coming down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hotline-miami-2-australian-playstation-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>has been removed from the Australian PlayStation Store after Sony apparently remembered that the game was refused a classification from the country's ratings board.</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/playstation/2024/10/09/hotline-miami-2-has-been-removed-from-the-australian-playstation-store-after-mistakenly-being-available/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Press Start</a>, Australian PlayStation users have been receiving notices informing them that the game is no longer available for purchase or download since it "has not received a proper rating from the Australian Classification Board".</p>
<p>Apparently,&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>was made available via PlayStation Plus Extra a few months back, and it was also released in Australia as part of a collection containing the two games, but it seems nobody bothered to make sure the second game's rating was intact first.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotline-miami-2-australia-playstation-kill.jpg?itok=knI5c4vS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotline-miami-2-australia-playstation-kill.jpg?itok=pUDQz9Zr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>was refused classification in Australia.</figcaption></figure><p>Those who downloaded the game directly as part of the aforementioned collection are getting a notice that confirms a refund, which could take a month or two to appear on a bank statement.</p>
<p>If you downloaded&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>via PlayStation Plus, on the other hand, you'll get a more curt message that simply confirms the game has been removed from the lineup, as well as the libraries of those who downloaded it.</p>
<p><em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>was originally released in 2015. It was <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hotline-miami-2-wrong-number" rel="noopener" target="_blank">refused classification</a> by the Australian game ratings board, and <a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/08/a-look-back-at-some-of-the-games-australia-has-banned/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to Kotaku</a>, that refusal was due to the presence of a scene that depicted sexual assault.</p>
<p>The original&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>wasn't refused classification, though; it was <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hotline-miami" rel="noopener" target="_blank">granted an MA15+ rating</a> for "strong impact" violence, as well as "mild impact" drug use and "moderate impact" themes and language.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hotline-miami-australia-classification.jpg?itok=MaR_hgOe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hotline-miami-australia-classification.jpg?itok=zg1i5Tj4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can still pick up the original&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami&nbsp;</em>in Australia, assuming you're over 15.</figcaption></figure><p>The Australian classifications board is known for its strict attitudes towards games. Many games have been refused classification in Australia, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rimworld-console-version-leaked-by-australian-ban"><em>RimWorld</em></a>&nbsp;(which was later <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rimworld-unbanned-in-australia-classified-r18">unbanned and classified R18+</a>),&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-final-cut-refused-classification-in-australia"><em>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-medium-banned-in-australia"><em>The Medium</em></a>, developed by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake studio Bloober.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like if you're in Australia, you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Hotline Miami 2&nbsp;</em>on your PlayStation anytime soon. At least you can still pick up the original, though!</p>

A motion sensor lets you snooze it by moving your arm or shut it off entirely by getting out of bed. It can even spy on you while you sleep to tell you how much you’re tossing and turning. Pre-orders for Switch Online subscribers are available starting today, but the devices themselves won’t ship out until early 2025. </p><p>Mario’s not the only one who will be nudging you to get off your lazy ass and start earning those coins. Alarmo will feature 35 scenes taken from games like <em>Splatoon 3</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, and more to start. Later, scenes from <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>will become available as free updates later on. </p><p> There are two main modes for Alarmo. The first is called “Steady Mode,” an alarm that gradually gets more and more intense the longer you stay in bed. The other is called “Gentle Mode” and provides a more consistent level of gaming cacophony. There are also buttons if you’re old like me and don’t want to put your wake-up routine in the hands of a robot. </p><p>Nintendo’s website walks you through a standard Alarmo sequence. Just prior to the alarm time, a character will pop up on the screen. Then, at the allotted time, sounds will begin playing. Eventually a character like Peach will arrive to patiently coax you awake. Snoozing will repeat the cycle, but if you keep snoozing, eventually Bowser will show up and lecture you on your poor grindset.</p><p>Alarmo certainly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks like it’s the mystery hardware</a></span> that FCC filings were recently discovered for.

<p>In September, an FCC filing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-device-filed-with-fcc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a device</a> was coming from Nintendo. Just weeks later, that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">device has been revealed</a> as Nintendo has officially announced its interactive alarm clock called Alarmo.</p>



<p>This new clock features a number of sounds and scenes from various Nintendo games while also reacting to body movement.</p>



<p>“Introduce a little play to your wake-up routine with Alarmo, the interactive alarm clock from Nintendo,” Nintendo said. “Start the day off right with fun animations, sounds, and characters from some of your favorite games. You can even snooze the alarm with gestures and end it by getting out of bed, thanks to Alarmo’s motion sensor.”</p>



<p>Nintendo says that it has 35 scenes from five games. Those games are Pikmin 4, Ring Fit Adventure, Splatoon 3, Super Mario Odyssey, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. More alarms will be available via free updates in the future, including Mario Kart 8 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The device can be used hands free with gestures being used to snooze the alarm or simply getting out of bed to turn it off. Should you not wake up when the alarm plays, you will be “visited” by characters from the specific scene you chose.</p>



<p>“If you stay in bed too long, your alarm will get more intense and you’ll get a visit from someone more persuasive,” Nintendo says while showing Bowser as an example.</p>



<p>The clock will also track sleep patterns such as movement in your sleep.</p>



<p>Alarmo will be available in the United States and Canada in early 2025 for $100. If you are a member of Nintendo Switch Online, however, you can buy it before the general public.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Nintendo alarm clock, Alarmo? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>It has been a stunning few months for the esports industry, with many tournaments surfacing and effortlessly pulling in millions of viewers of late. In a recent report published by Esports Charts, it was shown in cold, hard numbers exactly how well the esports market did during Q3 2024, with almost ten major events netting more than one million peak concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>We’ve seen plenty of concerns in the last year or two regarding the sustainability of the esports industry, but at least viewership doesn’t seem to be struggling too much.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mobile-madness">Mobile Madness</h2>



<p>In Q3 2024, mobile games shone brightly in the esports space. Indonesia’s MPL tournament stood at the top of the table this past quarter, netting a whopping 71.1 million watch hours. This tournament has so far beaten the likes of the LCK Summer, The International, and VALORANT Champs in both hours watched <strong>and </strong>peak concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>Talking about peak viewers, almost ten tournaments his one million peak concurrent viewers in these last three months, according to data <a href="https://escharts.com/news/top-esports-events-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Esports Charts</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>IEM Cologne hit 1.05 million viewers, while the Esports World Cup (the League portion of it) pulled in 1.12 million peak viewers. Up the chain, The International 2024 netted 1.5 million peak viewers, and the LCK Regional Finals caught the concurrent attention spans of 1.82 million esports fans.</p>



<p>The sweet spot was in the mobile space, though.</p>



<p>The EWC x MLBB Mid-Season Cup pulled in 2.3 million peak viewers, while the MPL Indonesia was just behind with 2.26 million viewers.</p>



<p>Time and again, mobile games are proving themselves to be a dominant force in the esports industry. Their accessibility combined with what’s typically an attractive free-to-play operating model means they’re able to capture massive audiences. While nothing will destabilise the ‘Big Three’ anytime soon, mobile games have earned their place <strong>near </strong>the podium.</p>

It's not the successor to the Switch, however: It's Alarmo, a Nintendo-themed alarm clock that uses familiar music and sounds to help you start your day.</p><p dir="ltr">Alarmo includes motion-sensing technology, which will allow users to snooze or turn off the alarm without physically touching it. The device will also keep a record of how often the user moves around during sleep, while also offering wake-up alarms in Steady and Gentle modes--Steady makes the alarm increasingly louder, while Gentle keeps it at one set volume.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Alarmo also includes scenes from five Nintendo Switch games--Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild, Pikmin 4, Splatoon 3, and Ring Fit Adventure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Nintendo has today unveiled Alarmo, an interactive alarm clock that will respond to your body's movements by playing video game sounds, thanks to its motion sensor technology.</p>
<p>On its debut this week (initially just for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, before wider availability next year), users will be able to choose from a total of 35 different alarms across five Nintendo games. These sounds include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>'s coin noises, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a>'s ink splats and Zelda: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s Parasail music, to name three.</p>
<p>More alarm options are also said to be on the way as free updates. As for turning it off, all you have to do is get up and out of bed. <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo-2670177.html">Nintendo</a> does note that if there is more than one person in the bed, however, the alarm clock may get a little confused.</p>
<p>"Alarmo can't detect a specific person, so if two or more people are sleeping in the same bed within range of the sensor, the alarm may stop when one person gets out of bed, but restart once it detects there is still someone in bed," the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Sound-Clock-Alarmo/About-the-recommended-environment-for-your-bedroom-2670178.html">team wrote</a>. "The alarm will stop completely once everyone is out of bed." There is a button mode, though, which may be handy (literally) for those times when it's more than just you in the bed.</p>

<p>While Alarmo is, at its core, an alarm clock, it also boasts a number of other features. For example, you will be able to check Records to find out more about your overall sleeping patterns. Additionally, it comes with a 'sleepy sounds' setting, which puts on some gentle music and such to help you relax.</p>

<p>At the other end of the scale, Alarmo also has a Firm Mode, which basically means your alarm sounds will get more intense the longer you stay lying in bed.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Online members will be available to purchase Alarmo later this week via My Nintendo Store, ahead of its wider launch in mid-January 2025.</p>
<p>Alarmo is likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-prepping-mystery-wireless-device-that-doesnt-look-to-be-switch-2">Nintendo's mysterious new wireless gadget</a> which popped up recently in US Federal Communications Commission filings that referenced a gadget - that wasn't <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> - which had an embedded motion sensor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
