            <p>Bungie have broken a silence surrounding their upcoming extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> to tweet <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907840558544072722">a short video full of cryptic symbols</a>. It's proven hard for fans to decrypt so far, but the developers have since followed up with a few more teasey posts, including one that certainly reads like a notice to fans that more information on the game will be revealed soon. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming," says a line of plain text in the marketing spritz. "Are you ready?" </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first post on Xitter to send fans into a flap was that spliced video of various symbols swishing around. Some users think you have to <a href="https://x.com/johnotron604/status/1907862522490769613">cut up the video</a> and piece it back together correctly before attempting to decode the symbols' meanings. But most of the Xitterati just immediately gave up and asked the social media's built-in AI Grok what the video meant. Grok didn't know. It said the post <a href="https://x.com/grok/status/1907844677363011806">was marketing</a>.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the studio's social media account shared more. It posted an animation showing a code being slowly decrypted, while warning of an <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907931118780788824">"unauthorized transmission"</a>. Alongside this was a link to an ARG website with a Twitch login. Currently the Twitch login just brings you to a page saying "Access Denied". It all basically looks like a fancy and playful way of saying "broadcast incoming", but who knows.  </p>
<p>Finally, the most recent post shows another animated image, depicting <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602">a snake with a written message alongside</a>. "The signal bleeds through their jamming," it reads. "Symbols not random. Not accident. Not noise. But VOICE." It compels the reader to "decrypt decrypt decrypt" and ends with a final hypey warning. "The signal is coming. The truth is coming. Are you ready? RISE RISE RISE."</p>

<p>Bungie have been fond of these ARG marketing tactics since the days of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a>. The last concrete news we got of Marathon was in a brief video from game director Joe Ziegler in which he reassured everyone that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">the game was still alive</a>. That was in October last year. He didn't share much about the actual game itself, however, beyond brief mentions of two playable character classes, one referred to as "stealth" and the other as "thief". </p>
<p>Marathon has had a troubled development so far. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people</a> last year, doubtless impacting the game's production. And director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">taken off the project</a> after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-the-text-messages-that-allegedly-got-a-former-bungie-executive-fired-according-to-a-court-document-written-by-sony">allegations of "predatory behaviour"</a> towards several women working at the studio. Marathon will be the studio's first release since being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sonys-purchase-of-bungie-is-now-complete">bought by Sony in 2022</a>, and Sony have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">somewhat ruthless</a> towards the makers of live service games lately. The stakes feel quite high.</p>
<p>As someone who enjoys the feel of Bungie's shooters (and who still counts the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-full-original-marathon-trilogy-is-now-free-on-steam-but-bungie-are-still-quiet-on-the-reboot">original Marathon trilogy</a> as good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> games) I'm interested to see how this reboot might play with the extraction shooter genre. But I'm also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-should-redefine-live-service-games-as-the-living-dead">like others</a>, dead tired of live service games. I think I just preferred Bungie when they made Halo. Anyway, we'll keep an eye out for more news on the feeds - both the real ones, and the ones that shout RISE at you a lot. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-will-release-on-pc-in-april-adding-a-grand-hub-mizutsune-and-new-quests">first big title update</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is upon us like a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles, and when I say a large, iridescent squirrel dragon covered in bubbles I am, of course, referring to the Mizutsune – a new Wilds monster last seen in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>.</p>
<p>It and a new, high rank version of the Zoh Shia are the title update’s headline additions. But it’s not <em>all</em> monster hunting. There’s also a new social area, the Grand Hub, wherein you can hang with your mates, bowl exploding barrels and do some arm-wrestling. With your mates, I assume. The changelog just says "Arm Wrestling Barrel". I assume you won't be arm-wrestling a barrel. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The update requires 6GB of storage space, or 16GB if you’re using the high resolution texture packs. If you’re wondering where to find the Mizutsune, you’ll need to reach Hunter Rank 21 to unlock a mission you can start by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete that mission, and the bubble-huffing rainbow lizard is yours for the slaying. There’s a Tempered version of the Mizutsune to fight after HR 41. As for the high rank Zoh Shia, you’ll need to be HR 50 to access the relevant story mission. 
</p>
<p>
Naturally, these munsters bring with them new weapon and armour crafting options. We can also expect new skills, status ailments, pop-up camp gear options, limited bounty categories, voice lines and poses. The Grand Hub becomes available after completing a tutorial mission that appears from HR 16.
</p>
<p>
It’s a bountiful rework indeed, with a bunch of balancing adjustments and fixes to wash down the extra critters, gear and quests. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-easing-up-its-vram-hogging-toughening-up-even-more-monsters">promised</a>, there have been some PC technical improvements as well, though it’s hard to gauge from the fleeting description just how much difference they’ll make: “Improvements were made to VRAM usage, and the DirectStorage version has been upgraded.”

            <p>In a recent episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/f_VP86VvwDk">Quad Damage podcast</a>, Arkane founder Raphaël Colantonio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arkanes-founder-is-open-to-the-idea-of-making-dishonored-3-just-dont-place-any-bets-on-it-actually-happening">spoke about his ideas for a new Dishonored game</a>. He, Harvey Smith, and Dinga Bakaba all had their own ideas for a sequel, he said, although the odds of any of them being developed are low as all three devs now work on different projects.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the podcast, the subject turned to Colantonio's thoughts on AI and the future of immersive sims. In short, he sounds optimistic. "If AI could really remember everything, and take meaningful human decisions like a Dungeons and Dragons Gamemaster, then that would actually be very valuable. Things we could not do. There would not be a team that is big enough to do this kind of thing."</p>
<p>"One of the things about immersive sims is that we are always trying, either to plan for everything that we think the player might do - and that's authoring, that's painful," Colantonio said. "Or, we're doing a lot of failsafes with systems that somehow fall back on their feet if the player does something we did not plan. There's always some stuff the players do that we haven't planned, so that's why you have the net under. But that net's a little janky. Sometimes it works, sometimes not."</p>

<p>"Everybody hates AI ... and for frankly good reasons. But there is space for AI to improve the tools," he continued.  "Not to do our job, but improve the tools. If you look at the way we made games in the nineties, it's pretty similar to how we make games today. The tools have barely evolved. I mean, they have, but it's still the same principles, the same ideas. If you need to make your level a little bigger, you still have to pull the props apart and add the middle prop that's missing there, make sure the textures match. It's an absolute pain."</p>
<p>He thinks that level designers spend a lot of time doing "grunt work", and that this could be improved if "there was an equivalent of a chatbot GPT embedded in some tools. And I'm sure it's going to happen tomorrow. You'll look at your building, and say: make it bigger. Make it wider. Change the style. And then it's done very fast. And then you become the director of that level."</p>
<p>The tools for making games Colantonio began his career with have evolved, he goes on, but not that drastically (as ever, the difficulty with genAI discussions is distinguishing between the current wave of new product announcements and older tools which make less showy use of automation and generation.) Meanwhile, team sizes and budgets <em>have</em> gone up dramatically. "We're throwing people at the problems. Making games with 1000 people doesn't make sense. It was not meant to be. There's nothing admirable about that. It's just a lot of money and a lot of people that are probably not having a fun job. I would rather go back to the way things were when teams were between 20 and 50 people."</p>
<p>WolfEye, Colantonio's current studio, indeed started with around 19 people, and now<a href="https://gamerant.com/wolfeye-studios-new-game-interview/"> sits at "50-60"</a>. They're currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wolfeyes-new-first-person-rpg-is-an-evolution-of-prey-and-dishonored-featuring-mechs-magnets-and-a-continuous-world">an unnamed first-person RPG</a> that harkens back to the immersive sims their alumni are famous for. "The ingenuity and gadgetry of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> and Prey with a 'real <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>' experience redolent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> and modern-day Fallout."</p>
<p>I've obviously made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-some-better-terms-for-genai-output-slop-is-too-benign">my own thoughts about GenAI known</a>, but I've still got some learning to do, and there's evidently a distinction between aiding artists and trying to replace them. And, hey, call me biased, but I'm more inclined to listen to someone like Colantonio than I am some LinkedIn bozo screaming about the future without giving me a reason to care in the present. That said, I'm concerned that he's still speaking mostly speculatively here, about "space for" and "tomorrow". And the sort of people gaining wealth and power in this space between "might" and "does" aren't necessarily the ones that share Colantonio's values. If WolfEye ever decide to make a new protagonist specialise in the ol' six-finger discount, I'm going to live with the rats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The free Title Update 1 for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> was released yesterday, bringing with it new quests where players compete for the fastest hunt time. However, Capcom has warned of potential cheaters, which will lead to account suspension and invalid completion times.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/arena-quests/">new Arena Quests, Challenge Quests, and Free Challenge Quests</a> allow players to take on monsters with either pre-determined or their choice of equipment, as they compete for the fastest times. Players will be rewarded with a position on the leaderboard and cosmetic pendants.</p>
<p>However, in a statement shared on social media, Capcom warned against cheaters and the use of external tools. "To ensure a fun and fair experience for our players, we will take action against accounts participating in fraudulent ranking activity, such as the use of cheating or external tools," it said.</p>

<p>"Accounts deemed to be in breach of this may be suspended, or have restrictions placed on them, such as being unable to receive rewards from these quests.</p>
<p>"Also, if cheating is confirmed in a multiplayer hunt by any member(s) of a team, the completion time for the quest will be deemed invalid and the right to rewards can be revoked for the whole party.</p>
<p>"Please take caution to avoid playing multiplayer with those who are engaging in prohibited activity, or those you suspect of such."</p>
<p>Capcom also requests any suspected prohibited behaviour is reported, by navigating to their Hunter Profile screen. It also noted these quests can be completed solo, or with Support Hunters, to avoid cheaters.</p>

<p>Potential cheating or use of external tools is most likely to be from PC players, though crossplay is enabled between PC and console players.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Capcom has noted it's aware of a game crash when players talk to Nata and select Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. This can be resolved by waiting for a while or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>It's also updated its <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">list of currently known issues</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular. Earlier this week, Capcom announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-rises-beyond-another-impressive-milestone-in-first-month">game had surpassed 10m copies since its release</a> on 28th February.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-content-update-detailed-ahead-of-next-weeks-release">new update is available now</a>, which on top of the new quests adds Mizutsune - first seen in 2015's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-generations">Monster Hunter Generations</a> - as well as other new features and gear.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As promised, CAPCOM has released the first major Monster Hunter Wilds update today. On Steam, the update is a 6GB download or 16GB if you have high-resolution textures installed. There are a lot of bug fixes, of course, but the main highlights are listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>New monsters can now be hunted after meeting certain in-game conditions.</li>
<li>Mizutsune has been added. Reach HR 21 to unlock an extra mission that can be started by speaking to Kanya in the Scarlet Forest Base Camp. Complete the mission to unlock Mizutsune.</li>
<li>Tempered Mizutsune has been added and will appear when you are HR 41+ after completing the Mizutsune extra mission.</li>

<p>There's also a limited-time Event Quest where hunters can head to the Ruins of Wyveria and face a Guardian Doshaguma in "Anguish and Atrocity". Successfully completing the quest will see them earn extra Hunter Rank Points. The Event Quest is available until April 8 at 4:59 PM Pacific Time.</p>
<p>By the way, the developer warned players of a known issue where the game crashes when talking to Nata and selecting Sekka to trade items at the Village Intermediary. The current workaround requires waiting a certain amount of time or resting at the BBQ Menu.</p>
<p>CAPCOM has recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-10-million-units-establishing-first-month-sales-record-for-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds broke the publisher's all-time records for first-month sales, with over 10 million units sold across all platforms. It is, therefore, well on its way to surpassing its predecessor, Monster Hunter World, which currently leads with 21.30 million units sold; still, the developer's continued support with patches and DLCs will be critical to reaching that objective.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/trump-tariffs-board-games-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Board gaming, which during the 2010s was an ascendant medium and an industry finally finding its feet after decades of being seen as child's play, <a href="https://kotaku.com/board-games-are-having-a-bad-time-1842653367" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was rocked in 2020 by the pandemic, whose disruptions to manufacturing and shipping costs</a> sent a lot of companies to the wall. Five years later, those challenges seem quaint compared to what's coming in the wake of<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2025/apr/03/donald-trump-tariffs-world-trade-republicans-join-democrats-block-canada-tariffs-us-politics-latest-news-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Trump administration's tariff announcements</a>.</p><p>Like most other businesses around the world, many board game companies have been using Chinese manufacturing for years now. In most countries it's the only way to get components made for commercial purposes, since local manufacturing capabilities--or at least those capable of operating at the scale necessary to keep costs down--simply don't exist.</p><p>The imposition of a 54% tariff on goods imported from China will have a cataclysmic effect on the entire industry.<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oldhammerpodcast.bsky.social/post/3llwhylnfh22u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> A statement put out by publisher Steve Jackson Games earlier today</a> puts those numbers into context:</p><blockquote><p>On April 5th, a 54% tariff goes into effect on a wide range of goods imported from China. For those of us who create boardgames, this is not just a policy change. It's a seismic shift.</p><p>At Steve Jackson Games, we are actively assessing what this means for our products, our pricing, and our future plans. We do know that we can't absorb this kind of cost increase without raising prices. We've done our best over the past few years to shield players and retailers from the full brunt of rising freight costs and other increases, but this new tax changes the equation entirely.</p><p>Here are the numbers: A product we might have manufactured in China for $3.00 last year could now cost $4.62 before we even ship it across the ocean. Add freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution margins, and that once-$25 game quickly becomes a $40 product. That's not a luxury upcharge, it's survival math.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Extrapolate that math--$40 games going to $60, $60 games becoming $90 games--and you can see how quickly this gets away from both publishers and retailers. That’s something the industry representative group in the US, The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA), is all too aware of, saying in a statement today that "The latest imposition of a 54% tariff on products from China by the administration is dire news for the tabletop industry and the broader US economy. As an industry highly dependent on producing goods overseas and importing them into the US, this policy will have devastating consequences."</p><p>Those consequences won't just hit publishers and retailers;<a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/552558/tabletop-panic-tariffs-on-china-layoffs-bankruptcy-gama" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Polygon's Charlie Hall broke down</a> how an entire ecosystem of board game businesses could now face extinction, from distributors to studios who have Kickstarted a game recently but are yet to manufacture their game to TTRPG companies who are already cancelling production runs.</p><p>Even companies outside the US are in trouble; like so many other industries, from cars to electronics, the United States is one of (if not <em>the</em>) single biggest market for board games. Even studios and publishers based in Europe could be looking at huge drops in sales, whether because of tariffs placed on their own exports, or just because Americans are about to have a lot less expendable income to spend on things like board games.</p><p>I know board games aren't going to be grabbing the headlines in the same way cars and electronics will be amidst all this political chaos, but seeing how deeply these proposed tariffs will impact even your hobbies shows how destructive they're going to be, not just to the wider American economy, but your downtime as well.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release"><h3>Nah, Man</h3></a><p>It's not Nintendo's fault, but 2025 sure is a time</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ve done our best over the past few years to shield players and retailers from the full brunt of rising freight costs and other increases, but this new tax changes the equation entirely.”</p><p>In the post, Placko spells out an example of how the tariff could affect costs. “A product we might have manufactured in China for $3.00 last year could now cost $4.62 before we even ship it across the ocean,” she says. “Add freight, warehousing, fulfillment, and distribution margins, and that once-$25 game quickly becomes a $40 product. That’s not a luxury upcharge; it’s survival math.”</p><p>Placko adds that the company doesn’t manufacture in the US because the infrastructure “doesn’t meaningfully exist here yet.” She acknowledges that tariffs can be “an effective tool” when they are “part of a long-term strategy to bolster domestic manufacturing.” But she says that “there is no national plan in place to support manufacturing for the types of products we make.”</p><p>If you’re frustrated with the tariffs, Placko suggests writing to your elected officials. “Ask them how these new policies help American creators and small businesses,” she says. “Because right now, it feels like they don’t.”</p><p>The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) has also issued a grim warning. “The latest imposition of a 54% tariff on products from China by the administration is dire news for the tabletop industry and the broader US economy,” GAMA said, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/552558/tabletop-panic-tariffs-on-china-layoffs-bankruptcy-gama">according to <em>Polygon</em></a>. Card-grading company PSA has released a statement about the new tariffs, too, saying that the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643117/psa-pausing-submissions-outside-us-tariffs">has paused</a> direct card grading submissions from outside the US.</p><p>In March, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-ceo-on-trump-tariffs-higher-toy-prices-are-looming-184955178.html">told <em>Yahoo Finance</em> that</a> “when you’re talking about tariffs in the neighborhood of 20 percent plus, that’s a cost that we can’t fully accommodate. It will have to be passed on.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-valhalla-origins-odyssey<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em><a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16792/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has reviewed well</a>, folks are into it,<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-elon-musk-twitter-ratio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's trending on social media</a>; all of that is great, because I'm loving it as well. But looking over a lot of people's reviews and general feedback, I can't help but wonder where some of you have been for the last ten years.</p><p>For all the cool stuff <em>Shadows </em>does around the edges of the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>formula, the core experience–the way the game feels and plays and what it has you doing moment to moment–feels largely unchanged from <em>Origins</em>, a game released all the (relative) way back in 2017.</p><p>This is not a criticism. That makes sense! Of course they feel the same; a lot of the same tech is underpinning both games, which is why Bayek and Naoe move with largely the same momentum and stick to walls and doorframes the same frustrating ways. These aren’t the only familiar things, though; even <em>Shadows</em>' missions, quests and, most important, sandbox playthings are much the same.</p><p>For all of Ubisoft's efforts at making elaborate, scripted story missions for the game's two playable characters, the centrepiece of <em>Shadows</em>--and the last few <em>Assassin's Creed</em> games, but <em>Shadows </em>does it slightly better--is its open world, sandbox mayhem. It’s those personally-curated, freestyle moments when the game shows you a city block, farm or entire castle full of bad guys, a number of different ways you can approach them and says "have fun".</p><p>These are the moments that the game, and indeed much of the series, was built for. When every button press and inventory item is geared towards player expression, whether they’re opting for stealth or combat. Every sandbox encounter, from its scale to its architecture, is designed with the multiple paths towards the same goal: You can sneak your way through and steal some loot; you can sneak your way through killing everybody; you can try to sneak post everybody, fail and have to fight who's left; or you can just kick the front door open, say "surprise motherfuckers" and kill everyone.</p><p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> has always had some iteration of these playgrounds (<em>Black Flag's</em> fortress battles were great), but they started getting <em>really </em>good in <em>Origins</em>, which was the first true open-world <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, meaning it was the first to really flood the map with staged encounters and let you have at them however you wanted. And while the quality of these sandboxes has ebbed and flowed slightly over the years as settings and characters have necessitated slight changes, for me they've remained the highlight of each successive game.</p><p>The flexibility you're given, the freedom of expression, the possible strategies lying before you, the satisfaction of a self-imposed job well done, I love it all. Ubisoft know exactly what it is that's best about this series–not long horseback rides or eavesdropping, but the act of sneaking up to a guy, shanking him in the ribs then dragging his body into the bushes. Wash, rinse, repeat.</p><figure></figure><p>In <em>Shadows </em>these moments--its towering castles especially--remain the highlights. Especially since our creative impulses have been spun off into two distinct characters, each with their own strengths and approaches: Naoe for more traditional stealth and Yasuke for when I just want to kick a man to death.</p><p>I get the impression they're the highlights for a lot of other people out there, too. This is anecdotal, but three out of five co-founders here at Aftermath didn't unlock Yasuke until around 15-20 hours into the game, because we were all too busy climbing viewpoints and rinsing castles and just generally doing cool assassin stuff. (The other two co-founders...haven't played the game.)</p><p>I'm happy for everyone finding out that these skirmishes are the best part of the game but, as someone who put over 100 hours into each of the last three main games, I just wanted to say here that <em>Shadows</em>' highlights aren't substantially different to those found in <em>Origins</em>, <em>Odyssey </em>or <em>Valhalla</em>. <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has been this good for a long time, and I don't think enough people either remember that, or were aware of it in the first place.</p><p>There's a feeling on the wind, especially now that everyone is having so much fun with <em>Shadows </em>and that<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/ubisoft-had-an-absolutely-dire-2024-and-desperately-needs-a-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ubisoft has been in such trouble lately</a>, that the last few <em>Assassin's Creed</em> games have been <em>bad</em>. But that's not true. The last three (four if you count the glorified spin-off <em>Mirage</em>) have been <em>fantastic</em>, full of memorable characters and breathtaking locations and extremely cool missions. Their <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/9439/assassins-creed-valhalla" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews at launch</a> were <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/4503/assassins-creed-origins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as glowing</a> as <em>Shadows</em>’ have been.</p><p>Their problems aren't that they suck, but that they were just too big. Too long. <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>especially vastly overstayed their welcome with drawn-out (sometimes multiple) storylines and DLC, meaning a lot of people parted with those games on poor terms. Those negative views have perhaps coloured both game's legacy in ways unfair to their core experience.</p><p><em>Shadows </em>was supposed to be different. This was hoped/believed by many to be some kind of silver bullet, a fix for the series' woes, a game that could not only<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-controversies-are-for-babies-and-racists" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> weather a culture war storm</a> but also restore people's faith in a series that had supposedly grown stale. But for all that, and its delays, <em>Shadows </em>is just another <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. You climb the towers, upgrade the stuff, shank the baddies. It's not a reboot, it's not a retool, it's literally the same game we've been playing for almost a decade now, just set in Japan.</p><p>And that's fine? Long-running series ebb and flow all the time, they have highlights and lowlights, and <em>Shadows</em> was never going to be some singular act of salvation. It's just a cool video game, and if you're liking it and slept on--or have forgotten about--the last few, you should go play them too!<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Just don't feel the need to play <em>all </em>the way through them</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts"><h3>Psycho Patrol R Is A Hilarious Dream Of A Brutal Future</h3></a><p>The follow-up to Cruelty Squad is a brilliant, euro-septic vision of a the future and one of the best immersive sims I've played in ages.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-price-release"><h3>Nah, Man</h3></a><p>It's not Nintendo's fault, but 2025 sure is a time</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thomas-tank-diesel-10-scary"><h3>Fuck This Anthropomorphic Diesel Engine In Particular</h3></a><p>Thomas and the Magic Railroad's Diesel 10 gave me nightmares</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which represents all major gaming companies in the US, has responded to US president Donald Trump's sweeping trade tariffs, saying the measures will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the games industry.
</p>
<p>
Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs earlier this week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing. Vietnam, for instance - where much of Nintendo's hardware production now takes place - was hit with 46 percent tariffs, while China's reach as high as 54 percent.
</p>
<p>
Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/esa-trump-tariffs">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, ESA senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said the increased costs associated with these tariffs "are going to have a real and detrimental impact on the video game industry". Quinn also noted the way parts are sourced and devices are shipped means, "Any one product that a consumer would buy is likely to be subject to many of the tariffs announced, all compounded on top of one another."

<p>
The situation could also worsen, Quinn suggested, as countries affected by the tariffs begin to take retaliatory measures. "I think what we heard yesterday is not the end of the story," she added, "not for the United States, not for other countries."
</p>
<p>
Tariffs have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">already been a major talking point following Switch 2's reveal</a>, with analyst Daniel Ahmad noting, "Nintendo shifted its manufacturing to Vietnam to avoid tariffs and with today's reciprocal tariff announcements they're likely going to end up paying tariffs anyway." Ahmad also suggested the console's higher US cost compared to Japan "is likely a calculated move on Nintendo's part, driven by tariff impacts, the weak Japanese yen, and local market conditions."
</p>
<p>
There've also been fears <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, which is priced at $450 in the US, could see its cost eventually rise to as much as $600 if impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs. However, Ahmad argued it's "unlikely that Nintendo will raise the price of the console at this point, but it's also unlikely to see a price drop in the next five years."
</p>
<p>
Back to Quinn, though. When asked if video game manufacturers should consider producing more goods in the US to lessen the effect of tariffs, she concluded, "I think every company, every industry... needs to think about what's best for consumers, best for business, and best for employees. Supply chains are complicated and, certainly, supply chains don't change overnight. Everything that is considered or decided can't be a quick turnaround and can't be a knee-jerk reaction to any particular announcement."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions-%E2%80%93-now-you%E2%80%99re-playing-with-super-power.1154916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a> has exceeded most everybody’s wildest expectations, moving <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-sales-surpass-150-million-units-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 150 million units</a> on the way to (most likely) breaking console sales records set by Sony’s PlayStation 2. Following up on that sort of success is no simple or easy feat, and Nintendo has taken what some have deemed the “safe” route by simply delivering a more powerful, feature-enhanced <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Of course, sometimes the appeal of new hardware isn’t obvious at first glance. You need to actually go hands-on to get that exciting new console feel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recently had the opportunity to do just that, going hands-on with the Nintendo Switch 2 for several hours at a press event in Paris, tackling upcoming games, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/mario-kart-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. While I’ll have deeper thoughts to share about individual Switch 2 games in the near future, we’re going to focus on the hardware itself in this article. Has Nintendo delivered a new level of Switch splendor or should you keep your expectations docked? Scroll on for my early hands-on impressions…</span></p>

<h2><b>Form Factor</b></h2>
<p><span>Those who have had a Nintendo Switch rattling around in their backpack for the past eight years will find themselves on familiar ground with the Switch 2 in terms of basic form and function, although almost everything about the new system feels a bit more polished and cohesively designed. While slightly larger than its predecessor, the Switch 2 still feels manageable to hold, and despite packing a lot more processing power, the system remains surprisingly thin and light (perhaps even lighter than the original Switch). The matte plastic the system is made of feels nice to the touch, and, hopefully, won’t be a magnet for palm sweat.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Various small tweaks to the Switch 2 make it feel like a more modern, deluxe device, including a sturdy new flexible kickstand and dual USB-C ports, which could open the way for a broader range of accessories, like the newly-announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-camera-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a>. I didn’t spend a lot of time examining the new Switch 2 dock closely as they were almost all hidden behind glass, but Nintendo has said it has a fan to actively cool the system now, boosting performance gains when playing docked.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The Switch 2 offers up a larger (approximately 8-inch) 1080p screen, with a slimmer bezel. The screen looked quite sharp, lacking the jagginess often seen when playing the OG Switch in handheld mode, although it is noticeable that the screen is a touch less bright and vibrant than the Switch OLED’s screen. For now, greater sharpness in exchange for a bit less brightness is a trade-off you’re going to have to make (as somebody who only plays Switch in handheld mode on occasion, I don’t mind, but your mileage may vary).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, the Switch 2 is a handsome little devil that you may want to spend a few minutes just admiring in your hands before you jump into a game, although I’d be lying if I said the design upgrades are truly transformative. This is the Switch you know, just polished up a bit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch24.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>The Joy-Con Grows Up</b></h2>
<p><span>Arguably the lion’s share of the Switch 2’s design upgrades have gone towards improving the detachable Joy-Con controllers. The OG Switch’s Joy-Cons always felt like a good idea that hadn’t been fully realized – too small, too finicky, too flimsy and prone to stick drift and other failures. While the Switch 2’s new Joy-Cons have been extended less than an inch compared to the original models, they do feel more substantial in the hand. The sticks feel less flimsy, and a Nintendo rep present at the preview hinted they’ve been re-engineered to head off drift (something the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NY Times got hints about too</a>). Whether the new Switch 2 Joy-Cons will be more resilient in the long term remains to be seen, but they felt sturdier to me.</span></p>
<p><span>The Switch 2 Joy-Cons also come with some new functionality, including an IR sensor that allows the player to use a Joy-Con like a mouse. I had a chance to test the mouse functionality with several games, including Metroid Prime 4 and the updated Switch 2 version of Mario Party Jamboree and the controls were perfectly responsive and holding the Joy-Con on its edge felt surprisingly comfortable. That said, Nintendo may still have to hone their approach to mouse controls, as some games, particularly Metroid Prime 4, still require you to press the face buttons on the Joy-Con you’re using as a mouse, which doesn’t feel intuitive. The new Joy-Cons’ HD Rumble also feels as though it’s been subtly updated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Oh, and yes, as somebody who likes messing around with anything magnetic, the way the new Joy-Cons satisfyingly snap onto the side of the Switch is an immense improvement over the old janky rail system. Once connected to the main Switch 2 unit, the Joy-Cons felt fully secure, but again, we’ll have to wait and see regarding long-term durability.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch28.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>Nintendo Power</b></h2>
<p><span>Nintendo’s developers are a talented lot, but they’ve been working with more or less the same toolbox for well over a decade, given the Switch was only marginally more powerful than the Wii U. While Nintendo remains largely mum about the Switch 2’s under-the-hood improvements, it’s clear the toolbox has finally received an upgrade. That said, it’s also clear it will likely take Nintendo devs a while to adapt to the new power at their fingertips. Much like the earliest crop of Wii U titles, which marked Nintendo’s first foray into HD gaming, Switch 2’s first games look better than most of what we’ve seen from the company before, but it also feels like they’re leaving a lot of potential on the table.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most of the first-party content shown by Nintendo at the hands-on event can be roughly sorted into three piles – new big AAA-style experiences (Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4), enhanced “Nintendo Switch 2 Edition” versions of older Switch games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> + Star-Crossed World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-party-jamboree/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Party Jamboree</a> + Jamboree TV), and quirky stuff designed to show off the system’s new control features (Drag x Drive, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, and, uh, Super Party Jamboree again).</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch27.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The most successful group were the big headline games. Mario Kart World very much feels like a direct follow-up to Mario Kart 8, and that’s not a bad thing. While Mario Kart World doesn’t necessarily stand out that much visually next to MK8, Nintendo is undoubtedly putting the Switch 2’s power to some use with the game’s higher 24 racer playercount and interconnected open world. Donkey Kong Bananza offers up a bold reboot of the Kongiverse and looks to provide all the varied challenges, collectibles, and hidden extras you’d expect from a major Nintendo release. The slice of Metroid Prime 4 I got to play left me with some questions, but there was no denying its technical prowess, running an impressive 120fps in Performance mode, with none of the rough un-aliased edges we've become used to seeing from some Nintendo games.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch29.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades didn’t land with quite as much impact. While playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom with 4K visuals and a smooth framerate was certainly nice, it wasn’t the transformative experience I expected it to be. Perhaps my favorite upgraded Switch experience was Kirby and the Forgotten Land, which looks better than ever (it was already one of the prettiest Switch titles) and adds the new Star-Crossed Worlds content, which promises to be just as fun as the original game.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Quirky Stuff bag was a bit more mixed. The additions to Mario Party Jamboree were all quite entertaining, but I’m not sure how much they’ll extend the life of the game. Drag x Drive was, frankly, a bit of a drag. Perhaps the best of the quirky crew was actually Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour, which features some fun diversions and ought to come at a nice price.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch210.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Each individual game’s pros and cons aside (again, I'll have more to say about that in the future), it really does have to be stated how refreshing the technical polish of all of them were. Almost every game I played, from Mario Kart World, to Donkey Kong Bananza, to Metroid Prime 4 ran at an unblemished 60fps (or more). The OG Switch has been showing its age for some time now, so just the clarity, smoothness, and general technical prowess of most of the games I played felt revelatory in its own small way. I’m particularly excited to see what Nintendo might do with the hardware a few years down the line.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/WCCFswitch211.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><b>Current Thoughts on Nintendo Switch 2</b></h2>
<p><span>It’s been a long time since Nintendo last chose to simply iterate on a successful formula with a new console. Since the 90s with the Super Nintendo, arguably. They’ve been so dedicated to throwing the baby out with the bathwater for so many successive generations, that the Switch 2 ends up feeling rather refreshing in a way. That said, they’re also asking quite a bit for this “Super” upgrade – $450 for the console itself, with games perhaps as much as $80. That may complicate the “Should I buy this right away?” math for some people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re one of the sizable number of folks who have affection for their trusty Switches, it seems quite likely you’ll enjoy the Switch 2. The system looks better, feels better, the Joy-Cons are sturdier and more versatile, and playing Nintendo games with some decent hardware grunt behind them is a nice change of pace. Whether the Switch 2 reaches the commercial heights of the OG Switch will largely depend on its library of games, but titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza show Nintendo can still deliver fun, and sometimes unexpected, experiences with their long-running franchises. While I need more time with the Switch 2 to render a final verdict, it feels like the pieces are there for another hybrid hit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep an eye out for my hands-on impressions of Switch 2 games, including Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more over the coming days. The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 with pre-orders going live on April 9.</span></p>

I know we're all about PC games, but none of you will mind if I reminisce about how good PS2 games were, would you? Good, because they were! And <strong>Havenhold</strong>, the debut game from the Beijing based <strong>Wolfpack Games</strong>, looks like it could quite easily be one, even if it has some modern sensibilities in places. You play as a Taichu warrior monk, fighting against other players as you all vye for the top of a special mountain, with the catch being that the game's world completely resets every 14 days.
</p>

<p>
Gameplay wise, it looks to be a pretty solid action game complete with dodging, parrying, elemental abilities. Nothing that necessarily stands out on its own, but it looks pretty tight here as a complete package, and I'm a fan of how your visage transforms depending on the element that you're using. As you try to make your way to the top of the game's main mountain, Kunlun, you'll find dungeons, ruins, temples, that sorta thing, where you can learn new abilities and find blueprints to make gear and weapons.

<p>
For me, the main appeal is in the game's cycle system. I love time-based pressure games like The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unsighted">Unsighted</a>, so to see a game like Havenhold explore that across two weeks feels like a cool concept. 
</p>
<p>
The whole game is PvP generally, but you might be sometimes forced to fight tougher enemies with others, so the whole thing is kind of like one really long Fortnite match you can dip in and out of. I like it! Don't worry though, you keep items and powers over into new cycles, so you don't lose out completely.
</p>
<p>
There's a closed beta test taking place later this month on April 17th too, which you can sign-up to try out through the game's Steam page <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015760/Havenhold/">here</a>. It's also planned to launch into early access sometime this year, though no word on when that'll be just yet.

			<p>Gamers aren't the only ones who are doing everything they can to get their hands on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as soon as possible. According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/game-devs-scramble-to-join-nintendo">The Game Business</a>, game developers are "desperate" to get their hands on a Nintendo Switch 2 development kit.</p>
<p>Obviously, you can count out all the publishers and developers who were able to announce that&nbsp;<span>their&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game is coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> on launch or sometime later this year during Wednesday's Nintendo Direct presentation</span>&nbsp;from having this issue. Nintendo has, perhaps expectedly, prioritized the biggest studios and publishers when it comes to who gets a dev kit first.</p>
<p>Those left out of the loop expressed their frustrations to The Game Business, with one studio co-founder expressing why it's so important that studios get their hands on development kits for new consoles as soon as possible.</p>
<p><em>"New console audiences are often willing to try new things at the start, so we were desperate to get our hands on dev kits early. Nintendo has finally responded to us, but we still don’t think we’ll get anything for a few months</em>," the studio co-founder said.</p>
<p>That same studio also claimed they could have had a game ready to go with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 this coming June had they heard from Nintendo earlier. The Game Business also reports that most of the studios they spoke to had not received a development kit or any word from Nintendo as to when they would see one coming their way.</p>
<p>The Game Business did add, though, that those teams who have not heard yet are hopeful things will change now that the console's release date and launch lineup have been revealed.</p>
<p>Nintendo might have covered the biggest bases with its first wave of Switch 2 development kits, but alongside the first-party titles Nintendo brings to its platforms, the popularity of indie games on the Nintendo Switch is a key cultural aspect of its player base. And those smaller, independent developers are all the ones who've likely been left out of the loop on development kits.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to see if any studios speak out in the coming months about how their game could have arrived on Nintendo Switch 2 sooner if only Nintendo had been more willing to share its wealth of development kits.</p>
