In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, senior game designer Daniel Holt talked about the collaboration and this initial look, which focuses on four major character cards and their associated pre-constructed Commander decks.</p><p>The revealed cards include Terra from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, Tidus from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, Y’shtola from (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">critically acclaimed MMORPG</a>)<em> <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></em>, and of course, Cloud from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> adds various new tinctures of wyvern, toad monster and arachnid to the fantasy creature chopper's vaunted eco-stew, but that additional variety isn't quite apparent from the weapon types. They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.</p>
<p>Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"When we start development of games such as World and, recently, Wilds, we always consider whether or not this is the time to add another weapon type," Tokuda told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-wilds/new-weapon-type">PCGamesN</a> via translator in a recent interview. "It's not off the table for any particular reason, it's just that we never really decided that we wanted to for the recent titles."</p>
<p>The game's current arsenal includes 14 categories of large animal evisceration, from the relatively fool-proof Greatsword to the fussier Hunting Horn, aka Magic Murder Trumpet. It's tricky, Tokuda said, to envisage "a 15th weapon that would actually have a place in that lineup and feel equally as valid as the other weapon types while also not overlapping with them too much."
</p>
<p>
"It's a very difficult thing," he went on. "With each title we always adjust all the weapon types and maybe bring new concepts to them and their relationships with each other to make them feel fresh. We also bring new depth with new combos and moves. The resources and time that it takes to do that is something that, in every case since the last weapon was added, we've always decided were better spent bringing the whole lineup to a better place than to simply start adding another new one in."
</p>
<p>In the case of Wilds, Capcom have also had to wrangle with the problem of what to bring back from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>'s Iceborne expansion - the last home format Monster Hunter release, which was aimed at more proficient players. "People who were playing a given weapon in Iceborne were assumed to have mastered the basics and it was going beyond that with adding new combos and moves and abilities," Tokuda told the site.</p>
<p>
I haven't really felt the need for fresh weaponry in Munster Honker of late. I've been distracted by all the talk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ghastly-spider-monster-is-actually-key-to-the-games-more-approachable-design">atrocious pedagogic spiders</a>. But adding to and balancing Monster Hunter's arsenal sounds more intriguing than doing likewise for, say, Call Of Duty, because of course, every Monster Hunter weapon has to come from a monster.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered siloing off their monster design teams, feeding them a lot of fermented berries, and having them challenge the blacksmiths by putting together a menagerie that defies weaponisation. Here's a rare species of wyvern that consists entirely of balloons! Here's an insect monster made of nested triangles! Here's a dinosaur that's so thin it's only visible from the side! Let's see you make another Gunlance out of that.

                <p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> at some point later this year remains one of the biggest stories in gaming. It's not a question of whether it will be one of the biggest releases of 2025; it's about how big it can be at launch and in the years to come. Now, a new report suggests that Rockstar Games is going to expand GTA 6 even further by turning the game into a platform for user-generated content.</p><p>According to <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digiday</a>, Rockstar is in talks with experienced Roblox and Fortnite creators in addition to GTA mod creators about creating customized experiences in Grand Theft Auto 6. It's not that far of a conceptual leap, since there are already numerous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> mods, and because Rockstar purchased FiveM, which lets players take part in modified versions of the game with hundreds of other users.</p><p>The belief among some industry insiders is that Rockstar will follow the example of Fortnite and allow users to create customized locations and items that could be purchased by other players or accessed via subscriptions. Any money earned from these creations would likely include a sizable share for Rockstar itself, while also giving modders the chance to make money as well.</p><p>"It is my firm belief that is the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that--to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy," said WPP agency Wavemaker's global and esports lead Pete Basgen in the Digiday report. "It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there's a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft."</p><p>While GTA 6 user-created content could be extremely lucrative, GTA Online players have been concerned that the game will be discontinued after Grand Theft Auto 6 launches. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA Online could continue to exist</a> alongside GTA 6, but he declined to outright confirm that. Zelnick also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">a PC port for GTA 6 won't be released at launch</a>. The game itself still doesn't have a firm release window, but since Take-Two has set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4</a> for a late September release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">the drop date for GTA 6 may be coming into focus</a>.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals competitive players have been embracing the triple-strategist meta, but the devs are not letting it dominate the higher ranks thanks to some upcoming nerfs. The new <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1891880359345950886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>, which will go in effect at the start of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 second half</a>, shouldn’t kill the triple-strategist meta, but will make it less “oppressive.”</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-loki-other-strategists-to-receive-ultimate-nerfs">Cloak &amp; Dagger, Loki, Other Strategists to Receive Ultimate Nerfs</h2>



<p>The triple-strategist meta has become very popular in competitive Marvel Rivals play. With three characters providing healing and support, vanguards (tanks) can absorb far more damage, making it hard to slow down attacking teams during convoy games. However, the devs have noted concerns that characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki can charge their ultimate abilities really quickly. Because of this, teams running triple-initiator always seem to have an ultimate ready to counter one from an opposing duelist or vanguard.</p>



<p>In the Season 1 mid-season update, the energy costs for “frequent ultimates” like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki’s will be increased. Certain ultimates will also receive targeted nerfs, and the devs have explicitly stated that Cloak &amp; Dagger will be one of the recipients. Further more, some vanguards and duelists such as Venom and Magik will also get a lower energy cost to their ultimates, allowing them to be used more frequently.</p>



<p>These changes will go hand-in-hand with some more announced hero balance changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced survivability of Doctor Strange and Magneto</li>



<li>Buffs to movement-based vanguards (likely Captain America and Venom)</li>



<li>Nerfs to Storm and Moon Knight (reducing buffs from start of Season 1)</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The game’s lead combat designer said the goal is not to get rid of playstyles like the triple-strategist meta, but only to encourage other playstyles and provide an appropriate amount of counterplay opportunities. These changes will officially go into effect when the second half of Season 1 begins on February 21.</p>



<p>Is nerfing the triple-strategist meta the right call for Marvel Rivals? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>When Shuhei Yoshida stepped down as president of SIE Worldwide Studios to lead indie games in 2019, it wasn’t something he outright chose to do. In fact, Yoshida only had two options: go lead a the new initiative with indies or leave PlayStation altogether.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/shuhei-yoshida-looks-back-at-31-years-at-sony-playstation-exit-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Yoshida said that despite only having the one option, it was something he was still excited to do.</p>



<p>“Moving from first-party to indies? Well, I had no choice,” Yoshida said. “When Jim [Ryan] asked me to do the indie job, the choice was to do that or leave the company. </p>



<p>“But I felt very strongly about the state of PlayStation and indies. I really wanted to do this. I believed I could do something unique for that purpose.”</p>



<p>Yoshida said that moving from first-party games  to indies was a bigger challenge for him than ultimately leaving the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year after 31 years</a>. He said that he feels lucky that the indie community felt like he could help their growth on PlayStation.</p>



<p>“I became an adviser for some of these companies,” he said. “I’m continuing to work with some of the indie publishers and developers I respect. The transition out of Sony to becoming an independent adviser is less of a change than moving out of first-party.”</p>



<p>Following up on that statement, Yoshida said that will continue to work with indies despite no longer being with PlayStation. He says that he loves working with younger, talented developers who “come up with amazing games every year.”</p>



<p>“Every year when you come to one of these events, a couple of the nominees for game of the year are indies,” he said. “They’re bringing something exciting to the industry. It’s a lot of fun. That’s my dream job, to be able to help them.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshida saying he either took the indie leadership position or left PlayStation in 2019?

Unlike last year’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, Nightreign resembles Elden Ring in name and appearance only, trading its parent game’s open world structure for a streamlined survival format in which three-player teams have to drop into gradually shrinking maps to fight off groups of enemies and increasingly challenging bosses. It’s a design that undoubtedly suggests the developers were inspired by the hugely popular Fortnite – unsurprising, considering Epic’s battle royale has been enjoyed by no less than 200 million players this month alone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Nightreign bears an even greater resemblance to another game, one not nearly as famous and much more disliked: 2013’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ascension">God of War: Ascension</a>. And that’s a good thing. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/18/god-of-war-ascension-1739888453295.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Sony Santa Monica / Sony</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Released between 2010’s God of War 3 and 2018’s Norse-flavored God of War reboot, Ascension was a prequel set before the original Greek mythology trilogy that followed Kratos as he tried to break his oath with his soon-to-be-predecessor, Aries. Unable to live up to the initial trilogy’s epic finale, and fueling desire to shake up a tried-and-tested formula, God of War: Ascension quickly became known as the black sheep of the franchise. A half-decent appetizer to an amazing main course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an understandable reputation, but also unfair. Although Kratos’ confrontation with the Furies in Ascension obviously didn’t reach the same heights as his five-stage fight with Zeus, this divisive prequel still had some truly jaw-dropping set-pieces, including the Prison of the Damned, a labyrinthine dungeon carved into the skin and bones of an immobilized, 100-armed giant. But, more importantly, Ascension also deserves credit for trying something the franchise had not done before, and hasn’t since: multiplayer. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Trial of the Gods, is cooperative PvE. And also basically Elden Ring Nightreign. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you make your way through the Prison of the Damned in Ascension’s story, you encounter a chained up NPC who lets out a premature “You saved me!” before being crushed by the level’s boss. Open up the multiplayer mode after reaching this point in the campaign and you’ll find this same NPC is now your player character. Having been teleported to Olympus seconds before your demise, you must pledge allegiance to one of four gods – Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, or Aries – each of whom will provide you with unique weapons, armor pieces, and magic attacks. These are the tools with which you wage war across five different multiplayer modes, four of which are competitive PvP.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fifth mode, Trial of the Gods, is cooperative PvE. And also basically Elden Ring Nightreign. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay previews of Nightreign posted ahead of the network tests by prominent “Soulsborne” YouTubers like VaatiyVidya and Iron Pineapple, as well <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-first-impressions-of-the-network-test-build">IGN’s own coverage</a>, have revealed the similarities between FromSoftware’s latest and live service games like Fortnite. Much like those games, Nightreign offers a cocktail of randomized loot, resource management, and environmental hazards that damage a player’s health and limit their area of movement, making runs more challenging as they go on. Nightreign even pays homage to one of Fortnite’s most iconic images, having players drop into the level from the sky, taxied by spirit birds to a position of their choosing. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/13/eldenring-nightreign-01-4k-1734054366417.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: FromSoftware / Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You won’t find any “where are we dropping?” action in God of War: Ascension, but go beyond Nightreign’s battle royale-like surface and you’ll find much more common ground. Both Nightreign and Ascension’s Trial of the Gods mode are co-op experiences where teams of two or more face increasingly tougher foes. Both grant players the unexpected but welcome opportunity to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-elden-ring-nightreign-starting-a-fromsoft-multiverse">take on bosses from previous games</a>, be they Hercules from God of War 3 or the Nameless King from Dark Souls 3. Both have a countdown (although Ascension’s can be paused by defeating enemies) and both take place on maps that are either small or shrinking. And both are multiplayer games developed by studios known for their well-crafted single-player experiences, and were made without oversight from their series’ creators; Elden Ring director Hidetaka Miyazaki is working on an as of yet unknown project, while the directors of the original God of War trilogy – David Jaffe, Cory Barlog, and Stig Asmussen – had all left Sony Santa Monica at the time of Ascension’s creation to pursue opportunities elsewhere. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Above all, Nightreign appears to evoke the same response from players as Ascension’s Trial of the Gods did. Those who participated in FromSoftware’s network test invariably describe their runs as a frantic and exhilarating race against the clock. In contrast to the comparatively cozy vibes of the base game, where players are able to tackle every scenario in a variety of ways, using a variety of weapons and abilities and taking all the time they need, Nightreign forces players to act on instinct by picking up the pace and limiting their resources – constraints that, in <a href="https://youtu.be/7xjW5oGlcUM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VaatiVidya’s words</a>, were “made in the name of speed and efficiency.” To make up for the absence of Torrent, for instance, players now channel their inner spirit horse, being able to run faster and jump higher. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ascension’s multiplayer adjusted its single player blueprint for the sake of tighter pacing, using similar techniques to those adopted by Nightreign.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascension’s multiplayer also adjusted its single player blueprint for the sake of tighter pacing, and even used similar techniques to those adopted by Nightreign: it increased the player’s run speed, extended their jumps, automated parkour, and provided them with a grapple attack they could use to pull objects towards them (a mechanic also used by Nightreign’s Wylder character). New moves like this are a lifesaver, because while the combat isn’t too difficult on its own – what with the franchise being a power fantasy and all – Trial of the Gods throws so many enemies at you that every second counts. As a result, you and your teammate find yourselves sprinting around like hungry wolves, or terminators, or, well, Kratoses, hacking and slashing your way through armies without calculated ruthlessness. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign’s resemblance to Ascension is unexpected not only because much of the latter has been forgotten, but also because the Soulslike genre Elden Ring is part of essentially started out as God of War’s complete antithesis. Where one lets you pretend to be a warrior so powerful he can kill literal gods, the other turns you into a nameless, accursed undead for whom even regular enemies pose a considerable challenge. One rarely shows its game over screen, the other beats you over the head with it until you start crying, laughing, and crying again.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet this challenge, so utterly rage-inducing in FromSoftware’s earlier games, has gradually decreased in recent years as fans “got good” and developers provided them with better weapons and spells, culminating in the numerous game-breaking builds that have been put together since Elden Ring launched. Without access to these builds, Nightreign promises to reintroduce a degree of challenge. At the same time, those that have indeed gotten good will be able to enjoy the same thing God of War: Ascension offered: the chance to feel like a vengeful Spartan short on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tim Brinkhof is a freelance writer specializing in art and history.

                <p>It's been over 5 years since Rare's in-development project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-everything-we-know/1100-6503918/" data-ref-id="1100-6503918">Everwild</a> was announced by Xbox, and details have been thin on the ground ever since. In a recent interview, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said that Everwild is proceeding well.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/16/xboxera-podcast-episode-250/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>, Spencer mentioned a few games in passing that he's excited for. Everwild was one of those games, with Spencer confirming that Rare is making "progress" on the project. "I do think the work that Double Fine's doing and how [Double Fine founder Tim Schafer] kind of solicits feedback from the team," Spencer said in part. "And the other one, I'll say because I was recently out at Rare. It’s nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Spencer also mentioned State of Decay 3 as part of the same section, with the Xbox boss calling the series "one that I love." Later in the interview, Spencer said that studios like Rare are allowed more time to make long-in-the-oven games like Everwild because Xbox's current slate is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-has-more-games-slated-for-ps5-this-year-than-sony-so-far/1100-6529489/" data-ref-id="1100-6529489">packed with games</a>. He also indicated that the next studio he's going to visit is The Coalition, the stewards of the Gears of War franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Everwild is one of those "missing games" that it's easy to forget about, given that it was first announced in 2019, even before the start of the current console generation. A 2022 report suggests that the project was internally rebooted following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everwild-boss-resigns-from-rare-marking-another-high-profile-xbox-departure/1100-6483926/" data-ref-id="1100-6483926">the departure</a> of the game's creative director Simon Woodroffe back in 2020. Everwild's current director is Gregg Mayles, a Rare veteran who worked on games like Sea of Thieves, Viva Pinata, and Banjo-Kazooie. We still have no word on a potential release date for Everwild.</p>

			<p>Stockholm-based independent developer Chief Rebel and publisher Arc Games have announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/fellowship-is-a-co-op-multiplayer-game-focused-on-mmo-like-dungeon-runs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fellowship</a>, an upcoming 'multiplayer online adventure game' (MODA), will be playable in a Public Playtest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2352620/Fellowship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available </a>during next week's Steam Next Fest from February 24 to March 3.</p>
<p>For the Public Playtest, there will be servers available in North America, Europe, and Asia. In this preview build, players will have the chance to experience six heroes (two Tanks, two DPS – including a new DPS, Tariq, and two Healers) that will be in Fellowship's roster, go on dungeon runs (both Ranked Dungeons and Quick Play Dungeons), take on challenging enemies and acquire epic loot.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Public Playtest, Wccftech was invited for a private play session with the developers. The best analogy really is dungeons from massively multiplayer online roleplaying games (MMORPGs), played after selecting a roster of predefined heroes, each in a specific role of the so-called Holy Trinity (Tank/DPS/Healer). Fellowship strips practically everything else, such as open world and narrative content, focusing entirely on the dungeon mechanics, with the goal of providing a highly replayable cooperative experience with some competitive elements through leaderboards and the like. The replayability is also enhanced by Curses, which are gameplay modifiers on the dungeons that are mechanical extra layers that you have to deal with, and these keep rotating for each difficulty and each dungeon you do.</p>
<p>As someone who has spent an inordinate amount of time on MMORPGs, the core concept definitely has a lot of merit. However, I found the execution lacking, mainly because it sticks way too closely to what MMORPGs have been doing for over twenty years. I'm referring particularly to the tab-target combat system, which felt very static and somehow even worse than World of Warcraft's in this regard. The dungeon mechanics I've seen, while introductory, are interesting; but it won't be enough if the combat itself is too stale. In short, yes, I would have attempted action combat, or at least a hybrid system like those featured in games like Guild Wars 2 and The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>
<p>The graphics are also not at all impressive for a game that's made with Unreal Engine 5. It obviously follows the Blizzard mandate to deliver stylized graphics and ensure maximum compatibility, but one thing's for sure, you won't be playing Fellowship because of its visuals.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's my conversation with Chief Rebel during the play session. The studio was established in 2018 by developers who previously worked on games like World of Warcraft, Diablo, Helldivers, Battlefield, Tom Clancy's The Division, Just Cause, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fellowship Preview Gameplay + Developer Commentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b4Y_IlJfaow?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What's the core premise behind your game?</strong></p>
<p>In many MMOs, this high-complexity PVE content is gated behind hundreds of hours of leveling up. We want to make sure that Fellowship is approachable for newer players and something quick to jump in for veterans.</p>
<p><strong>I see there's a kill score count. Can you explain what it does?</strong></p>
<p>The kill score kind of totals the amount of enemies that we should kill in a dungeon run, so we can't just find some clever route to skip to the bosses. If you hit M on your keyboard, by mousing over enemies on the map, you can kind of see what percentage of the kill score they fill. As a tank who's kind of leading the direction we're going, I can pick out which routes I want lead the party through. But you have to fill the kill score to 100% and kill all the bosses to complete the dungeon, but there's a lot more enemies than 100% in the dungeon.</p>
<p>The intention is, especially when you get to the higher tier and the leaderboard chasing, part of the strategy is finding a good route through the dungeon, what paths should the party skip, what are more dangerous or maybe worth taking, even though they're dangerous using pull downs and all that.</p>
<p>When the timer gets turned on, then you also have to beat the dungeon within the timer to get to the next difficulty, but you're still gonna get all the loot that you would get from the dungeon, regardless of whether you beat the timer. We don't activate the timer until difficulty 4, though.</p>
<p><strong>I assume the timer is going to be a key factor in climbing the leaderboard.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. The timer affects the score as well, so when players start to get to the really high difficulties, it's gonna be a matter of practically milliseconds to determine who's number one on the leaderboard.</p>
<p>By the way, as you can see on the left, we have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing.</p>
<p>You can see each of us there above the action bar. You see our health bars (I'm the purple dude), and you can see on the damage meter how we're doing on that damage, and then, if you mouse over those, you can actually view a breakdown of what abilities are contributing to your damage.</p>
<p>This is also really important if you're going to get into optimizing your gameplay and being competitive and learning how to complete dungeons at really high difficulty, but it's not as important when starting out because, of course, we tune the game to be very forgiving in the beginning.</p>
<p>One of the barriers for a lot of players in some of these types of games is stuff like the DPS meter isn't built into these MMOs. It's something that you have to go online and search for and you gotta download add-ons and all that. As a player trying to find your role in the community, it can be a bit difficult to find your footing.</p>
<p>So, we don't really have any intentions of allowing player-made addons in Fellowship. Instead, we want to make sure that we're providing everything that veteran players want and expect in the game itself to ensure a level playing field for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Aren't you worried about online toxicity? Some MMORPGs have tried to move away from DPS meters mainly because of that issue.</strong></p>
<p>I think that toxicity is always something that there's work to do with. I think that the solution is not to remove the ability for players to understand how to get better. I mean, there's different types of games. In some, your performance doesn't really matter, but in a game where your performance matters, you need to have information to be able to know what to change to improve, or you'll just start to hit your head against the wall.</p>
<p>If there's any kind of competitiveness, just removing data, I don't think that's the solution. I think that needs to be worked with in other ways. We're trying to find lots of other ways of getting ahead of that as well.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have all kinds of metrics for players to look at just to be able to see how they are improving and how different talents or stats on their gear is affecting their damage or damage mitigation or healing. You can see our health bars and how we're doing on the damage, and then, if you mouse over those, you can actually view a breakdown of what abilities are contributing to your damage.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>How do you plan on dealing with the 'meta' situation in your game?</strong></p>
<p>In a lot of the MMOs or games where you're playing with a group, inevitably, a meta is going to be established. One of the reasons why you may choose one character or one class over another is because they have a utility ability that's really important to have at high levels of difficulty. In Fellowship, we've moved a lot of those big utility skills like mass dispel to equippable items that you unlock in higher difficulties so that anyone can bring a battle resurrection or a dispel or stuff like that to a party.</p>
<p>One thing you might notice as well is that we're trying to look into how we can handle some nonverbal communications. If you target one of these buccaneers and you hit V on the keyboard, you'll put your hero portrait next to their name. If you put your marker up and interrupt the enemy, you can see when we interrupt ours, meaning you'll know the cooldown on our interrupt skills so we can more easily manage the cooldowns of the whole group. This is another example where, at low difficulties, interrupting is not that important, but when you start to get to very high difficulties, not interrupting might get you one-shotted. So, it's really important for players to be able to coordinate and work together to ensure they have all the interrupts ready.</p>
<p><strong>How many skills is each hero going to offer?</strong></p>
<p>We're going to have 15 abilities available for each of the heroes. You unlock more and more abilities as you reach higher difficulties. What you're starting out with is just the interrupt, the movement skill, and some basic core kit, but then a lot of the abilities that come are CCs, utilities, cooldowns, and things like that.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the various dungeons and boss fights?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. As the difficulty rises, bosses and enemies in the dungeon learn new abilities. What we're seeing here is this boss's base kit and then, as you get higher, she'll get some new tricks that make the boss a little bit more interesting for when you're ready for the increased challenge.</p>
<p>In Fellowship's dungeons, we have 3 bosses to kill. They take around 20 to 30 minutes to complete, depending on gear, difficulty, skill level, et cetera. And then we also have Adventures in the game. These are single-boss dungeons that take about 10 to 12 minutes to complete. You can compete in both formats for the leaderboard score. To get higher on the leaderboards, you need to improve the average score of all your dungeons. But if you're someone for whom half an hour is a bit too much of an investment to put in, you can just jump in and do the 10-minute ones and still get the full conversion and all that.</p>
<p><strong>Does Fellowship include some sort of crafting?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have a bunch of different progression systems. Firstly, there are talents that are hero-specific, where you'll unlock ways to customize your hero.&nbsp;There's also the gear itself that has different types of stats, like Crit, Haste, Expertise, and more.</p>
<p>Once you get a little bit higher in difficulty, you'll start to obtain the transmutation resources. This is kind of a crafting system where you can use transmutation resources and some of the gold you earn to transmute items that you've gotten that you don't need. It kind of functions like a bad luck protection thing for loot. If you keep getting the same cloak all the time, you can transmute those cloaks and if you're lucky, you can reroll them into something you actually need.</p>
<p>Then we also have scrapping loot, which gives you resources, and you can upgrade loot as well. One of the bigger systems is also once you get gems and sockets unlocked. We're doing a lot more with gems and sockets than most RPGs do, so it's not just stats on those gems. The gems also unlock new defensive abilities and offensive abilities, passive ones, props and stuff, and do some cool stuff with your character as well.</p>
<p>At the end of a dungeon, you get your loot for completing it. If you right-click on the chest, but you can click on your items to collect them, and on the right side, you can see what everybody in your party got.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that. One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Is there any way to trade these items if you don't need something and your friend does?</strong></p>
<p>No trading yet. That'll be something we'll potentially look into as part of the live service.</p>
<p><strong>How many heroes will be playable at launch?</strong></p>
<p>We haven't set an exact number. It'll be somewhere around 8 or 9, maybe, at launch. Of course, we are planning to regularly release new heroes in live service as well as dungeons and adventures and other types of formats of playing as well eventually.</p>
<p><strong>They are all limited to a single role, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we're not doing multi-role heroes, at least not for the foreseeable future. Right now, we're focusing on getting a tight core of heroes that deliver on the classical RPG fantasies of big two-handed barbarians and healing priests and shield and sword tanks and stabby rogues and all of that.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of Fellowship being a hero game where you don't create your character is that, over time, we're going to be able to explore some really fun and crazy ideas when it comes to heroes. Like, we could have a character that's a slime blob that clones into other heroes and can use their abilities for a while or any kind of stuff that we want to explore eventually. But we will be starting off with a good, strong foundation of heroes.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you settle on a 4-player group format?</strong></p>
<p>We even experimented with 3, but what we noticed is that when you go down to 3, you only have 1 because we really want to lean into the Holy Trinity, which is the tank healer DPS roles. When you have a party of 3, you're really losing like an X factor, a permutation of the kind of setups you can do with your team.</p>
<p>So, 4 felt like a good number, and just from playtesting, we felt like we're not missing anything with a group of 4 instead of 5. It still feels like we're able to give the same complexity. There's a sweet spot in terms of mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Is this going to be a shared world hub with more players than just your group?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub. If someone else logged in now, they would spawn here with us until we hit the cap for the stronghold and then a new one spins up.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss what the post-launch would look like for Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>There's lots of stuff we could explore. We really want to build this game with our community. Part of us wanting to get it into the players' hands as soon as possible is for them to help us feel out, hey, what do we want? How do we make the best game for you? We're hoping to have a really close connection there.</p>
<p><strong>What about monetization?</strong></p>
<p>The plan is to be a premium game. It's not free to play; it's not subscription-based. It'll be premium. We're not in a rush to unravel a huge microtransaction plan from the very beginning. We're going to take it a little bit slow. We're not going to be selling anything that is content, so no dungeons, progression features, heroes, or anything like that.</p>
<p>We want to work with our community to understand, if you love this game, what makes sense for you all to spend money on so we can keep making this. The obvious stuff at the top of our list is skins, mounts, and little pets that follow you around.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>Will there be any cosmetic customization of the heroes?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we have a mirror behind the tree. This is just turned off right now, but of course, we will allow you to cosmetically change the way you look, which will probably be things you can get through microtransactions, but also, of course, the things that you're actually collecting, like the dungeon loot and all of that. We talked about hairstyles and stuff like that. I think there's more to explore there, but nothing final yet.</p>
<p><strong>Would you add a dueling feature to Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>We're intentionally going to double down on PVE coop. Not doing PVP allows us a lot more creative freedom and balancing. It puts us in a position where we can really do some cutting-edge stuff regarding the PVE experience. Fellowship, as the name implies, is really about the co-op experience.</p>
<p><strong>What about asymmetrical PvP, like doing simultaneous runs of the same dungeons to see who completes it first?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that kind of stuff, we're super interested in. We've talked about maybe a ghost mode where you can play even asymmetrically offline against other people's runs.</p>
<p>We talked about a live Tournament mode thing. We've talked about special game modes where you might be in the same map racing towards a boss. There's lots of cool stuff that we might do.</p>
<p><strong>What about launching on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>I'd say that's definitely very intimately connected to the gamepad support. So yeah, first, we would implement gamepad support. We don't have a date for when we would explore that, but we would do that first and then look at consoles.</p>
<p><strong>Would you add story-based content to Fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>That's a really good example that I consider not something that we would do unless the community clearly shows that that's what they would like.</p>
<p>If the community is like, hey, we really want a story adventure that focuses on letting us know more about our heroes, then cool, but initially, we're just really focused on the dungeon loop.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Right now, it's just the four of us connected, but you'll be able to see up to about 20 to 30 other players. We aren't loading every single person into this area because it would get full really quickly, but you should be able to see, connect, and interact with other players here in the hub.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What about larger group content, like raids?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. When we had our Closed Alpha in August, we forgot to remove the raids tab from our mission table. We're talking about raids. I think it is a natural step. It's the same there, though. It's not something that we're going to roll out from the very start. It's, I would say, one of the features that we're eyeing very intently.</p>
<p>But again, for the health of Fellowship in regards to balancing, I think it's really good to start with getting the 4-player format of dungeons out into the player's hands in the wild for a while so that we can make sure that we get all of the balancing and tuning knobs right and the progression systems starting to add those before we increase the complexity.</p>
<p>Increasing the amount of players you bring to a raid, maybe it's 8 players, maybe it's 12 - we want to do something a little bit smaller than the classical huge 40-man things because they're a mess to manage. But there's some added complexity even for 8 to 12 players, so I think it's healthy for us to make sure that we're delivering top-notch 4-player content before we get into that.</p>
<p><strong>Will you add a guild system, too?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a pretty natural connection. There's nothing planned at launch, but we're going to listen to our community and figure out what kind of social tools they want. The way we approach what happens after early access is that we have a lot of ideas. We also have a lot of designs pretty fleshed out for various features. We've talked about raids, we've talked about guilds, there's a whole bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>I think it's important to have some kind of discourse with the community about exactly how we want to roll that out rather than us making up the next couple of years of features and then being kind of stuck delivering on that, and maybe after two weeks the players are saying we want something else. So, we're keeping things open. We really want to do this together with the community.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/devonta-smith-cheating-claims-warzone-super-bowl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On February 9, DeVonta Smith won the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles in front of 127 million viewers. One week later, the superstar wide receiver was staring down accusations that labelled him a malicious cheater in Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>While streaming Warzone in the last few days, Smith came under fire from a slew of allegations across social media, being lambasted by folks hellbent on branding the athlete a lousy cheater. In clips that surfaced online, some suspicious sequences unravelled, but what’s the truth of it?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-does-devonta-smith-cheat-on-call-of-duty">Does DeVonta Smith Cheat on Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>The most talked-about clip of DeVonta Smith’s gameplay appeared on MLFootball on X. It was only a minute-long segment, and it was uploaded to showcase Smith’s humourous comms while streaming Warzone, but it was enough for Call of Duty sleuths to identify some strange goings-on.</p>



<p>Here’s the post with the full clip:</p>



<div><article><p><span>TRENDING: </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eagles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Eagles</a><span> star receiver  DeVonta Smith live streaming playing Call of Duty has gone viral for how funny he is.

😭😭😭

Smitty 💀
</span><span></span></p></article></div>







<p>In the video, you can see Smith – who streams under the guise <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/smityyytv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘smityyyTV’</a> – gunning down the opposition on Rebirth Island. It’s plain as day that his accuracy and locks are scarily good, and even targets flying through the air or those appearing suddenly at long range are no challenge for the Eagles star.</p>



<p>The community is torn. If you take a look at the wider picture and check out his VOD content, it becomes less suspicious, and he starts to look like more of a well-rounded player than someone using a little extracurricular software to dominate lobbies.</p>



<p>Smith took advantage of the publicity to promote his content, inviting users to check him out in future streams:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Since yall think im cheating on COD just join the stream tonight 🤷🏽‍♂️🤣</span></p></article></div>







<p>In an effort to vouch for the Super Bowl-winning athlete, Paradox Customs, a PC company, declared on social media that ‘He’s not cheating’. The vouch went hand-in-hand with a revelation that Paradox had built DeVonta’s last two PCs, but gamers were quick to jump on the post and explain how ridiculous a retort that is.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, allegations like this rarely go away. Take Nadia, for example. She became a prolific Warzone streamer off the back of ‘hackusations’ that surfaced a good few years ago <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nadia-delta-force-event-cheater-investigation/">that have followed her around</a> like a bad stink ever since.</p>

            <p>A pro skater has claimed he will appear in a yet-to-be-announced remastered Tony Hawk video game.</p>
<p>Professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones was chatting during an interview on the Breakfast Club podcast, when he casually stated: "I'm in a Tony Hawk coming out, that's cool... They got a new one they're remastering so that's about to come out, I was in the last one."</p>
<p>As a reminder, Jones was one of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-tony-hawks-remaster-does-justice-to-one-of-the-greatest-demos-of-all-time">new playable pro skaters added to the remastered Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a>, which came out in 2020.</p>

<p>But, while Jones is clearly on (skate)board with this upcoming Tony Hawk remaster (could it be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a>+4?), it is worth noting that nothing has been officially announced to be in the works by Activision. That's not to say that there hasn't been plenty of Tony Hawk-flavoured chatter, however.</p>
<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after A<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">ctivision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that apparently wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself gave us all a glimmer of hope that something was in the pipeline.</p>
<p>More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>A little later that same month, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/">Hawk then popped up on Instagram</a> with a post marking the 25th anniversary of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. And how did he round everything off? Well, like this:</p>
<p>"I'm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p>

<p>Hopefully we will hear something more concrete on what exactly this franchise future will look like soon. In the meantime, Eurgamer has contacted Activision Blizzard for comment on Jones' statement regarding a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-time-to-make-a-tofu-scramble.1112298/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/tofu-scramble-hell-yeah<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While I wouldn’t agree with Chuck Schumer that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/schumer.senate.gov/post/3li3azl3zfc2n" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the price of eggs</a> is the <em>most</em> important thing on Americans’ minds these days, there’s no denying that eggs cost a lot more than they used to, and that’s a bummer. If you’re looking for a breakfast alternative, you can’t go wrong with a tofu scramble.</p><p>But let’s be clear here: I don’t mean a fancy one, using <a href="https://nygroove.nyc/vegan-eggs-nyc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Just Egg</a> or other egg alternatives that have come about since I was last regularly cooking for vegans. I mean a late 90s/early 2000s tofu scramble, the kind you made in a batch when your trainhopping pals passed through your town, or the kind you woke up to at the punk house where your band crashed. One that kind of looked like eggs, but wasn’t trying to <em>taste</em> like eggs; one that was wholly itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I was first introduced to tofu scramble at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodroot_(restaurant)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feminist vegetarian restaurant</a> I worked at as a teen in the late 90s (a foundational but <a href="https://www.intomore.com/impact/lesbian-feminist-staple-bloodroot-vegetarian-restaurant-is-accused-of-transphobia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complicated</a> bit of Riley lore), where I would sometimes end up taking an entire trashbag of it home after a brunch shift even though I didn’t like it very much. It wasn’t until my 20s, immersed in activist and punk scenes in Boston and New York, that it became a regular feature of my diet, the kind of thing you could reliably whip up and assume that everyone could eat. You could fill it out with whatever vegetables someone had dumpster dived, and in my memory it could be scaled exponentially without needing to run out for more tofu, though obviously that can’t be right.</p><p>The only must-have ingredient I remember it having was turmeric, which is what made it yellow. Several recipes these days suggest adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kala_namak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black salt </a>to mimic the sulphurous taste of eggs, and while that sounds great and I certainly wouldn’t stop you, it feels like gilding the lily. A tofu scramble isn’t “vegan eggs;” it’s a <em>tofu scramble</em>, the staple dish of a certain time and place for me, the fuel of a particular version of myself and my communities.</p><p>This weekend I decided to recreate that tofu scramble, but my memory was hazy beyond tofu and turmeric. So I turned to the pinnacle of vegan cooking at the time (and arguably still today), Isa Chandra Moskowitz of Post Punk Kitchen. There’s a recipe on her site from <a href="https://www.theppk.com/2009/10/tof-u-and-tof-me-scrambled-tofu-revisited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2009</a>, the exact era I hoped to recapture. It features <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-reels-beans-oh-no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutritional yeast</a>, one of the best things veganism has given us, as well as cumin and thyme, which I don’t remember adding to tofu scrambles but which were great additions, savory and earthy in a way scrambled eggs are not but which tofu scramble definitely is. You rip the tofu into chunks, pan-fry it until it’s browned in some spots, then dump in the spices and mix it all together. The result was precisely what I was hoping for: a little bit dry and ugly as hell, but tasting exactly how I remembered it. I paired it with the home fries recipe I used to make in bucket-sized batches at the feminist restaurant (boiled and then fried, with paprika and peppers), and was transported back to fueling up for marches against the president (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/president-donald-trump-protest-c8796556fbf20e796f42167f61c3d942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oops</a>) or radical queer actions against the HRC (<a href="https://www.them.us/story/human-rights-campaign-layoffs-restructuring-lgbtq-rights-organization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ah damn</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve never been vegan, and I’m not vegetarian these days either, though I don't cook much meat. While I’m glad if the variety of non-dairy milks or Beyond Meat help more people eat differently, I remember those golden years when vegetarian food stopped being pasta primavera or a portobello mushroom cap with balsamic vinegar but before it tried to mimic meat, when <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2014/2/7/6283461/vegan-junk-food-restaurant-foodswings-quietly-shutters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan junk food</a> or <a href="https://gothamist.com/food/longstanding-east-village-vegetarian-diner-kates-joint-seized-by-marshal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegetarian diners</a> were splurges for when you could scrape enough money together. You do not need sausage that bleeds or something from a carton that cooks up like eggs a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-scrambled-egg-recipes-famous-chefs-2017-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity chef</a> would make. You just need a hunk of tofu and a jar of turmeric to fuel yourself for the fight.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/viktor-antonov-art-director-rip"><h3>RIP Viktor Antonov</h3></a><p>Antonov was one of the driving forces behind the art style of Half-Life 2 and Dishonored</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tony-hawks-remasters-potentially-leaked-by-pro-skater<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pro skater Tyshawn Jones may just have leaked the existence of a brand new collection of&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, if a recent radio interview is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Speaking to New York station Power 105.1FM (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/skater-tyshawn-jones-claims-to-be-in-upcoming-tony-hawk-game-remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), Jones said he's "in a&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>coming out" and that "they got a new one they're remastering, so that's about to come out".</p>

<p>As a reminder, Activision hasn't announced any new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remasters, so if Jones is right and a new collection is imminent, he's gotten ahead of Activision in revealing its existence.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-trick.jpg?itok=gZliE2DZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-trick.jpg?itok=esWJ9Yxi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater&nbsp;</em>remaster collection may be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that remasters of PS2 titles&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>were originally on the cards, but Tony Hawk himself said back in 2022 that those plans had been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-plans-for-pro-skater-3-4-remake-were-abandoned-after-blizzard-merger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shelved</a> after Blizzard's merger with Vicarious Visions.</p>

<p>Of course, a lot has happened since then, and it's entirely possible that the plans have been revived. It's also possible that Jones did the work he did for those remasters way back when and that no further development has occurred since their cancellation.</p>

<p>Presumably, the potentially-upcoming collection would include&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4</em>, but Activision could decide to skip those games and head straight for&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Underground</em>&nbsp;instead.</p>

<p>Doing so seems like a missed opportunity to me, though; these are popular games, after all, and the two PS2 installments before the series switched to&nbsp;<em>Underground&nbsp;</em>were pretty popular with the critics of their time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-grind.jpg?itok=snp5Sk_d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-and-2-grind.jpg?itok=GOUhU0OH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>could be about to get the&nbsp;<em>1 + 2&nbsp;</em>treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>If the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>4&nbsp;</em>remasters are in the works, they'll face some pretty stiff competition thanks to EA's&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>reboot, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">due to land in Early Access sometime this year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, the two games are arguably targeting different audiences;&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>tends to aim for a general audience, while&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>&nbsp;has always seemed to be focused on the hardcore skater crowd.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens with regards to new&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>remasters, but my&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk's&nbsp;</em>nostalgia and I are certainly hoping Jones is on the money. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>It was only last week that newly Sega-less Company Of Heroes developer Relic Entertainment <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/company-of-heroes-devs-relic-bounce-back-with-plans-for-big-rts-sequels-smaller-experiments-and-spiritual-revivals">announced plans</a> for various smaller <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game projects. Now, here we are with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/earth-vs-mars">Earth Vs Mars</a>, a boldly-coloured B-movie homage to Advance Wars in which you can splice units with animals to create tactical monstrosities such as "Squirrel-Cows" and "Cheetah-Flies". Advance Wars aside, the new game harkens back to Relic's 2003 RTS oddity <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/impossible-creatures">Impossible Creatures</a>. The trailer below doesn't contain any Chihuahua Whales, but it's hopefully just a matter of time.</p><!--more-->

<p>Earth vs Mars looks to handle very similarly to Nintendo's turn-based strategy opus. The maps are grids, and clashes between units play out as jazzy split-view pop-ups. Units have unique abilities, and there are commanders that have passive and active traits. The game's splicing mechanic lets you lather all this up with some funky genetic hybridisation. Rhino infantry, for example, appears to have the muscle to knock enemies back a square.</p>
<p>It'll include a single player narrative campaign with "over" 30 missions (please, developers, please just say "around" or "approximately"), together with online PvP in which you can play as either Earthlings or Martians, an AI versus mode and a map editor. All the expected strata-me-doodle fixtures.</p>
<p>Earth vs Mars is the very first Relic Labs game. According to the Steam page, these "will differ from our traditional, big bread-and-butter RTS games (which we'll continue to support and develop)" and "allow us to explore new sub-genres, experiment, get our creative juices going, and release games more frequently." I suspect that last part about frequency is the crucial load-bearing fixture, here. </p>
<p>Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3269230/Earth_vs_Mars/">Steam</a>. I'm not massively blown away by that splicing gimmick, but the presentation reminds me just a smidgeon of Kaiju Wars, an unexpected strategy game pleasure. RPS didn't review Kaiju Wars because the editors of the era (2022) were a bunch of gadabouts and chancers. So here's my, ugh, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kaiju-wars-review-a-gigantically-clever-strategy-spoof">Eurogamer review</a> instead. If you're keen to pursue peaceful Earth-Mars relations, perhaps you'd like to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mars-first-logistics-has-turned-into-a-martian-railway-builder-with-some-very-pretty-100-authentic-clouds">build some monorails</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
