<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159394/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>When the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a> was released in 2017, it won praise for its fresh take on puzzle platforming horror. Its sequel upped the scare factor even further, earning critical acclaim while deepening the series’ mythos. With a new developer at the helm of its threequel, the question on everyone’s minds is whether the franchise’s third outing sticks the landing.</p>
<p>The answer is, '<em>Yeah, sort of</em>…' but with some major caveats. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> is essentially a soft reboot for the series with an all-new storyline and lead protagonists, yet it faithfully adheres to the well-trodden gameplay formula and level design of Tarsier Studios’ earlier entries, resulting in an experience that leans perhaps too much into reiteration rather than reinvention.</p>
<p>While competently executed under the auspices of Supermassive Games, the third instalment failed to spike my cortisol or wrack my nerves the way <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_ii">Little Nightmares II</a> did. The series' trial-and-error gameplay is present, along with its oppressive atmospheres and macabre set pieces, but it all felt more brisk, gentler, and less pulse-pounding than its celebrated predecessors.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159392/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Boasting multiplayer for the first time in the series’ history, the implementation of this fandom-requested feature plainly misses the mark. While the game is built around variations on clever co-dependent puzzles that require two players to solve, co-op is locked behind online multiplayer to preserve "atmosphere and immersion", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-doesnt-have-couch-co-op-to-preserve-atmosphere-and-immersion">according to the developer</a>.</p>
<p>While I can understand the intent behind not wanting Little Nightmares to play like a party game, this feels to me like a case of the developers overthinking things. When I began my review, I had a friend over who had beaten the first two games and was eager to jump in, and the fact that I couldn’t just hand them a Joy-Con felt antithetical to the game’s multiplayer hype.</p>
<p>It’s a welcome addition that a Friend’s Pass will be available at launch, allowing you to play with a friend who doesn’t own the game, meaning only one copy needs to be purchased. However, both players will need their own consoles. While cross-generation play between Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 is supported, cross-platform play remains unavailable.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159389/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Due to these limitations (only a single Switch code was available to us during the review period), I completed my review playthrough in single-player mode, aided by an AI companion, which left things feeling a lot like Little Nightmares II, which paired its single-player mode with a bot, but even more streamlined because in this entry, your CPU partner essentially solves half the puzzles for you, given its two-player cooperative design.</p>
<p>You control one of two new leads: Low, a bow-and-arrow-wielding boy donning a plague doctor mask, and Alone, a girl with pigtails and an aviator helmet equipped with a wrench used for melee combat and puzzling. But what’s really puzzling, though, is the absence of any kind of character swap mechanic tailored specifically for single-player mode.</p>
<p>While your AI-managed companion is generally competent, there were one or two instances where it stood idle or failed to perform key actions, creating soft-lock situations that required checkpoint reloads. Those moments broke immersion and highlighted how the puzzles, clearly designed around teamwork, lose some of their intended satisfaction when played solo.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159386/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puzzles involve synchronising an action with the wrench together with timed arrow shots to manipulate the environment, obtain keys, and traverse obstacles, offering a new wrinkle on otherwise standard fare for the series. Combat situations occurred a lot less frequently than I was expecting, but similarly required a bow and wrench pairing to finish off enemies.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, you can replay chapters, or the entire game, as either of the two protagonists, experiencing how each character’s unique toolset alters puzzle-solving and exploration. As in previous Little Nightmares entries, collectible items return, cleverly hidden throughout each level to reward curiosity and thorough exploration.</p>
<p>What Little Nightmares III really gets right, though, is its atmosphere, with tension-building and evocative sound design as well as beautifully crafted biomes that bring the series to previously unseen locales, from a haunting arid desertscape with churning mills and updrafts that can be ridden with umbrellas to an abandoned institute on a sub-tropical island teeming with fatal flora.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159391/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You will navigate crumbling fairground structures at a surrealist nightmare carnival, evade grotesque adversaries in deliberately slow, nail-biting stealth sequences, and be chased down by monstrous creatures inspired by anxieties surrounding authority and adolescent vulnerability. In other words, it still <em>looks</em> and <em>feels</em> like prior Little Nightmares games.</p>
<p>That said, this entry feels distinctly more 'by the numbers' than its predecessors, playing comfortably within established boundaries punctuated by a few modest innovations to gameplay mechanics. Its storytelling unfolds in a similar vein but concludes in a way that felt like the additional chapters of paid DLC — planned for release in 2026 — are needed to fully grasp.</p>
<p>I completed my playthrough in around four to five hours, which makes it as long as past titles, despite having only four chapters, as compared to five in both prior entries. Performance on Switch 2 left much to be desired, essentially feeling like a base Switch build targeting 30fps with soft, grainy visuals and micro-stutters aplenty when the action ramped up.</p>
<figure><a title="Little Nightmares III Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159395/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The end-game boss, in particular, moved in a distracting, almost stop-motion fashion during certain sequences. Though the game’s performance falters — at least at launch — it definitely remains playable despite being a far cry from a 'next-gen' third-party experience. Players who are sensitive to performance issues should consider grabbing this one on another platform.</p>
<p>I encountered a frustrating issue in the final chapter where a key item required for progression repeatedly despawned before it finally appeared in its proper location, allowing me to continue. Although the overall gameplay experience was otherwise smooth, this incident suggests that a few lingering bugs and optimisation issues may still be lurking under the hood.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares III faithfully preserves the oppressive mood, clever environmental puzzles, and visceral unease associated with the series, but feels like an echo of what came before. While its dark allure remains potent, the baffling absence of local co-op undercuts the game’s most ambitious feature. Though its multiplayer concept shines in theory, the absence of a character-swap feature to enrich single-player mode feels like another missed opportunity.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-detailed-pc-specs-from-minimum-to-ultra/">out in just two days from the time of this writing</a>, and when it launches, it'll do so with support for NVIDIA's DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen technology, alongside Little Nightmares III, which also launches on October 10, and with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/battlefield-6-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-nvidia-reflex/">NVIDIA in a new blog post about the latest batch of DLSS 4 games</a>, when pushing max settings on Battlefield 6, at 4K, and while using an RTX 50 Series card, you get a "<em>3.8X</em>" boost in frame rates on average. "<em>GeForce RTX 5090 performance rockets to over 470 FPS, the GeForce RTX 5080 exceeds 330 FPS, the GeForce 5070Ti is in touching distance of 300 FPS, and the GeForce RTX 5070 surpasses 230 FPS.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Little Nightmares III doesn't exactly require the kind of high frame rates you'd want from a shooter like Battlefield 6, it'll still be nice to have a smooth experience while exploring the horrors that Supermassive Games has in store.</p>



<p>Beyond Little Nightmares III and Battlefield 6, NVIDIA also confirmed that when Crimson Desert launches next March, it'll do so with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Gen support, with more details to follow as to what that'll look like closer to the game's launch.</p>



<p>Lastly, the mountain biking game Mavrix by Matt Jones has also been confirmed to be adding support for DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. </p>



<p>Last month, Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Annata <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-ananta-jurassic-world-evolution-3/">were added to the list of games</a> that support DLSS 4.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-star-wars-brickheadz-phantom-menace-set-packs-6-figures-that-are-practically-free-but-only-in-prime-day%E2%80%99s-final-hours.1319839/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s a fairly safe bet that even if you’re a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan, you’ve never seen these six characters from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> like this before. That’s because Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the others have assumed LEGO BrickHeadz form in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">this eye-grabbing and fun LEGO Star Wars set that’s marked down by 31% in a new Prime Big Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>This cool set for kids 10 and up contains six collectible buildable characters — Anakin, Amidala, Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, Captain Panaka, and Jar Jar Binks, each with movie-authentic details in BrickHeadz form. In total there are 732 pieces, with each figure measuring over 2.5 inches high, 1.5 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Each has its own baseplate, and some have their own accessories like young Anakin’s hammer and Darth Maul’s double-bladed red lightsaber. Once built, these unique collectible figures are more displayable than playable, and make great decorations or conversation pieces.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Anytime Gift</h2>
<p>It’s never too early to start thinking about the holidays and knocking items off your list, but this LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace set is a terrific anytime present — birthday, great report card, or just a thoughtful gift for a young <em>Star Wars</em> fan in your life. The six BrickHeadz figures are fun for boys and girls age 10 and up to build, and then great decorations for any kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Even in the fun and unique-looking BrickHeadz form, the detail LEGO adds to these six figures from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> is exceptionally cool. Anakin Skywalker comes in his podracing outfit, while Queen Amidala’s dress comes with gem elements to snap in place. All 10 of Darth Maul’s horns are in place, and Qui-Gon Jinn’s Jedi outfit is easily recognized.</p>



<h2>Unanimous Reviews</h2>
<p>All of the Amazon reviews on the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set are raves — it’s one of the very rare Amazon items that has a unanimous 5-star rating, but then again, how can you go wrong with Star Wars figures from LEGO? This is also a collectible set, part of LEGO’s larger 25th anniversary celebration of both&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> being released in theaters and the first LEGO Star Wars building sets being released in stores.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">The Prime Big Deal at Amazon takes 31% off the price of the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set, bringing it from its usual $55 all the way down to just $38.</a> But, as with all of these Prime Day deals, you’re on borrowed time. Once Prime Day’s over, so is this Prime Big Deal.</p>

<p>Bethesda is preparing the world for another epic day. Fallout Day 2025 has been announced, and there are broadcast date details, along with information on its start time, and a sneak peek at what the company could have in store for you all on the S.P.E.C.I.A.L day.</p>



<p>Some people love Christmas Day, others look forward to Thanksgiving. But for long-time Bethesda fans, it probably doesn’t get better than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-day-broadcast-dates-and-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Day</a>. The 2025 edition is upon us, and last year’s showcase provided huge updates on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-release-notes-pts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76</a> and new content and DLC.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-day-2025-date-amp-time-announced">Fallout Day 2025 Date &amp; Time Announced</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More content for Fallout 76? We’ll have to see. Credit to Bethesda</figcaption></figure>



<p>Bethesda and Fallout fans can look forward to Fallout Day 2025 starting at 1 PM ET on October 23!</p>



<p>News of this comes directly from <a href="https://x.com/Fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Fallout</a>‘s social media: “Save the date! Our annual FalloutDay Broadcast will be streaming live on October 23 at 1 PM ET, with the FalloutforHope post-show immediately following.”</p>



<p>If you didn’t know, FalloutforHope is a charity organized by Fallout content creator Kenneth Vigue and aims to “offer hope and relief for children and their families at a time of year when loss is felt and help keenly needed.”</p>



<p>This is amazing publicity for a good cause, which should round off what is usually a solid show.</p>



<p>While Bethesda hasn’t explicitly revealed anything in particular that will be shown off or announced during Fallout Day 2025, the company has said the broadcast will feature “news about existing Fallout games” and news on upcoming Fallout fan events.</p>



<p>Could there be a surprise announcement regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-fallout-3-remastered-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 3 Remaster</a> lying in wait? I guess we’ll all have to tune in and find out.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📅 Save the date! Our annual <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FalloutDay?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FalloutDay</a> Broadcast will be streaming live on October 23 at 1pm ET, with the FalloutforHope post-show immediately following.</p><p>Tune in for the latest news about our existing Fallout games, community celebrations, and upcoming fan events! <a href="https://t.co/hOSbioXena">pic.twitter.com/hOSbioXena</a></p></div>— Fallout (@Fallout) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1975926711339409781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 update launching on all platforms will introduce new content to the RPG developed by Sandfall Interactive released in April 2025.</p>



<p>The new update was confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/506216119584948426?l=english">a new message shared by the studio on Steam</a>, celebrating the game selling 5 million copies, and the original soundtrack composed by Lorien Testard hitting 333 million track streams since its release. This new update, whose release date has yet to be confirmed, will include new content and features according to the developer. These are:</p>



<ul>
<li>A new playable location environment with new enemy encounters and surprises to find.</li>



<li>New challenging late-game boss battles</li>



<li>New costumes for each party member that will also provide new customization options</li>



<li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, which will bring the total number of supported languages to 19.</li>
</ul>



<p>New content coming to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is excellent news, as the new challenges will only improve one of the best JRPGs released in the current generation, and, in my opinion, a serious contender for this year's Game of the Year award. You can learn more about why I believe so by <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">checking out my</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Sandfall Interactive has announced a brand new sales milestone for turn-based indie RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and there's a big new update in the works as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has hit five million sales since launching earlier this year. That means it's picked up another 1.7 million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">since May</a>, which is very impressive indeed for a game that doesn't have a huge studio backing it (no shade, Kepler).</p>

<p>In order to celebrate the new sales milestone, Sandfall says it's working on a huge new update that will bring lots of new content to the RPG, so if you've been hurting for stuff to do post-game, this might be the one for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-maelle_0.jpg?itok=kMu-0r8e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-maelle_0.jpg?itok=b2Gs9-Ro 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has sold very well indeed.</figcaption></figure><p>The new update will, according to Sandfall, bring a brand new area in which you'll find "new enemy encounters and surprises to discover", as well as new challenging late-game bosses to battle.</p>

<p>You'll also find new costumes for each member of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, so you can finally take them out of those stereotypically French outfits from the base game (although if you don't, I won't blame you).</p>

<p>All of this is in addition to new localizations for the game, which will bring its total number of supported languages to 19, as well as "more to come", which is rather tantalizing.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG developed by French indie studio Sandfall Interactive, and it revolves around the titular Expedition 33's attempt to defeat the Paintress in order to prevent the culling of everyone of a certain age each year.</p>

              <p>It’s quite the pickle. You’ve got a well-loved 2016 indie hit, and you figured it’d be nice to make it free on Steam for a bit. But then, a good while later, you decide it’s time to give it a graphical overhaul, update it with a whole new online multiplayer mode, and start charging a little bit for all that work. Except, nope. It seems there’s a limit for how many times you can switch your game from free to paid. So, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-co-operative-platformer-pico-park-classic-edition-has-been-accidentally-made-free-on-steam-forever">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Tecopark’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/"><em>Pico Park: Classic Edition</em></a> and its new multiplayer mode is stuck at free, and will always be.</p> <p>Japanese developer Tecopark’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em> games have proven hugely popular multiplayer games over the last ten years. Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Classic</em> version, there’s 2021’s re-imagined&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em>, and most recently 2024’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park 2</em>. They’re all cooperative puzzle games for between two and eight players, in which you’re challenged to collect a level’s keys via collaborative platform action. As you might imagine, this can become chaotic extremely quickly as groups attempt to arrange their cute cat-like characters into stacked piles to reach platforms, or assign themselves to pressing multiple buttons at once to open doors. And in the <em>Classic</em> version, that madness could go up to as many as 10 players. Albeit, until recently, only in local multiplayer.</p>

 <p>Tecopark’s Shunsuke Miyake posted to the game’s Updates page on August 20, “I’m thinking of updating&nbsp;<em>Classic Edition</em> for the first time in nine years… Since I’m doing it anyway, I’ll update it with online support.” He added, “<wbr>I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it’s still free.”</p>

 <p>Come September 13, that update had happened, and the game now had art that matches its two sequels, ran on monitors running over 60Hz, added Steam inputs, and most significantly, now included online multiplayer. Miyake added, “We’ll keep it free for about a week.” Which was pretty generous!</p>

 <p>Then this last weekend, a new update appeared. The title is “<em>PICO PARK&nbsp;: Classic Edition</em> is permanently free!” with the text explaining this change.</p> <blockquote><p>“I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! : )”</p></blockquote> <p>He then adds, “If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (<em>PICO PARK</em>, <em>PICO PARK 2</em>) too.”</p>

 <p>The 2021 version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509960/PICO_PARK/"><em>Pico Park</em></a> was an updated port of the Switch’s 2019 game (keep notes, there’s a test at the end), with all-new levels and online multiplayer, along with a bunch of new modes and ways to play. It even lets you use your phone as a controller for party gaming around one screen, rather than forcing you into the hassle of hooking up eight Xbox controllers at once.</p>

 <p>Last September’s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644470/PICO_PARK_2/"><em>Pico Park 2</em></a> offered a brand new set of levels, along with all the previous features, including cross-platform support. Both games are extremely well received, eliciting very creative Steam reviews from people broken by their experiences. “This is the game where friendships go to DIE,” says one positive review. Another says, “this game ruined my relationships with all my friends and I am now left alone. Great game.” My personal favorite reads, “You get to see who’s stupid among your friends, then realize it was you all along.”</p> <p>And now, it seems, you can experience the original version of all this in its prettier glory, and online, for free! Poor ol’ Tecopark. For real, go buy a sequel if you enjoy it! Poor people just wanted to make a well-earned buck. Honestly, they should add it as a free game on Itch.io too, where at least people can then choose to pay for it if they want to.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-qv-35a-at-40-off-eliminates-cleaning-stress-now-cheaper-than-a-mid-range-stick-vacuum-2000633175</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-qv-35a-at-40-off-eliminates-cleaning-stress-now-cheaper-than-a-mid-range-stick-vacuum.1319806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuums but that prestige comes with a price tag. Most of their newer models sail past the $1,000 mark and puts serious automated cleaning out of reach for many households. The <strong>Qrevo QV 35A</strong> breaks that pattern as one of Roborock’s more accessible options, especially during Amazon’s<em> Prime Big Deal Days</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">where it’s dropped to $399, down from $649</a>. This <strong>Prime-exclusive deal expires tonight</strong> and gives you limited time to snag a high-end robot vacuum and mop combo.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 8,000Pa sucking power places this unit in the high-end level of cleaning power that is robust enough that it <strong>can suck out ground-in dirt from carpet fibers and snatch up debris from hardwood grout lines</strong>. Most entry-level bot vacs hover around the 3,000-4,000Pa level so this unit provides almost triple the force, which makes a major difference on carpets or homes with pets that continuously shed. The <strong>new-generation anti-tangle brushes</strong> resolve one of the pain points with owning a robot vacuum by eliminating the tendency for the brush bar to wrap around with hairs.</p>
<h2>The All-in-One Dock Does the Dirty Work</h2>
<p>The real value comes from the <strong>all-in-one docking station that handles mop washing automatically</strong>. After cleaning, the robot returns to its dock where the station washes the dual spinning mops with clean water, and removes the grime they’ve picked up. This means you’re not dragging dirty mops across your floors on subsequent cleaning sessions. The mops spin at 200 RPM and creates mechanical scrubbing action that tackles stuck-on spills and stains rather than just wiping moisture around.</p>
<p>The <strong>self-emptying dustbin is what makes the system hands-off</strong>, really. The dock self-sucks messes out of the internal dustbin on the robot into a larger bag back at the base station. You <strong>can abandon the vacuum for weeks on end</strong> as the base can accommodate as much as seven weeks’ worth of accumulated dirt and dust, depending on the size of your home and mess level. Dump the bag every month or every two months instead of dealing with a small dustbin after every cleaning pass.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>intelligent collision avoidance employs sensors and AI detection</strong> to steer around typical floor hazards such as shoes, wires, pet toys or unexpected spills. It illustrates the layout of your home during initial uses, and becomes familiar with the best cleaning paths and retaining room boundaries. No-go areas can be designated via the app which can be programmed to schedule varying cleaning modes per room or time of day.</p>
<p>The mop function provides real added value beyond ordinary vacuuming: The water tank maintains a stable moisture level on the spinning mops, appropriate for sealed hardwood, tile, laminate, or vinyl flooring. Water flow can be varied as appropriate to floor type or how grimy your floors become on average. Vacuum-then-mop, all in one automated pass, saves the time that would be taken on separate passages.</p>
<p>This Roborock at $399 comes with features that would be common on $800-1,000 units from the same company. Just the all-in-one dock would be a few hundred as a separate accessory on lower-end bots. This is the <strong>Prime-member deal that ends tonight</strong>, so grab yours before the price goes back up.</p>

<p>Jurassic World Evolution is roaring onto the scene and, if you fancy yourself as being better at managing prehistoric dinosaurs than John Hammond, it’s the perfect game for you—and we’ve got the details on the Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 21</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 makes it a trilogy for Frontier Developments, with major additions being the introduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-release-date-baby-dinosaurs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baby dinosaurs</a> and modular building—two features that have starred in sister titles Planet Coaster and Planet Zoo.</p>



<p>With the title landing in a packed release schedule for games, it’s understandable to wonder if a Game Pass subscription can save you some cash, and we’ve got all the details on whether it’s being added to the service.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-jurassic-world-evolution-3-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Jurassic World Evolution 3 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Soaring onto the scene. Image via Frontier Developments</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Jurassic World Evolution 3 will not be available to play with an Xbox Game Pass subscription when the title releases on October 21.</strong></p>



<p>Although we’re yet to see a full reveal of the titles coming to Game Pass in October, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first wave of releases not covering the entire month</a>, Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not expected to be among the other additions coming later this month.</p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 is not a first-party Xbox title, which would have resulted in automatic inclusion in the service, so any announcement of the title featuring in the catalog would have come well in advance.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-jurassic-world-evolution-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Jurassic World Evolution 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>There is no news about Jurassic World Evolution 3 coming to Xbox Game Pass in the future, although history suggests it’s likely to occur at some point.</strong></p>



<p>Jurassic World Evolution 2 is <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/games#all_all_ultimate_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently available on the service</a>, having featured several times in the past, while the original game has also had extended spells in the subscription service.</p>



<p>Other Frontier Development titles, including Planet Coaster, have also appeared on the service in the past. However, Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster 2 are yet to appear on the service, and it’s likely they would make an appearance first before Jurassic World Evolution 3—although that’s not guaranteed.</p>



<p>If we are to see Jurassic World Evolution 3 join the playlist, it will likely be a fairly decent period of time in the future.</p>



<p>What are you most excited to see in Jurassic World Evolution 3? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Specialist retro gaming studio Nightdive has announced that the original PC version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>will be delisted later this week, but it's not all bad news.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/238210/view/503964319779651936" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on Steam, Nightdive says the original 1999 release will be delisted from PC storefronts on October 10th, and that's not just Steam, either; it's also GOG and anywhere else the original version of the game is available.</p>

<p>However, if you do want to play the 1999 version rather than Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>, all is not lost. If you pick up the remaster, you'll magically see the original appear in your library as well, and if you already own the remaster, you'll get a copy of the original version free of charge.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-pc-delisting-citadel_5.jpg?itok=iJmmxeCl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-pc-delisting-citadel_5.jpg?itok=57KYOyky 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from storefronts this week.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, if you did buy the game before its delisting, you'll be able to continue downloading and playing it whenever you like, so if you do want to grab the original without picking up the remaster, you've still got a couple of days to do so.</p>

<p>If you've somehow made it this far without ever hearing about&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>, it's a hugely influential first-person shooter released in 1999 by Ken Levine's Irrational Games alongside legendary immersive sim studio Looking Glass.</p>

<p>The game takes place on the Von Braun, where an unknown infection is ripping its way through the ship. Naturally, it's up to you to figure out where this infection is coming from and why it's happening.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>&nbsp;is an immersive sim-style RPG shooter in which you can specialize in various different disciplines to help you explore the Von Braun and battle its many hostile inhabitants. You can hack your way through problems, specialize in combat, or take any number of other approaches.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/238210/System_Shock_2_1999/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shock_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and the remaster is also available across several platforms.

The video depicted a cute baby seemingly moving objects around a nursery.

Others noticed Pikmin musical cues and the tiny little creatures hiding in the background. Now we know for sure: it was Pikmin.</p><p>Unfortunately, the newly-uploaded video is currently only available in the Nintendo Today app. (I’ll update this post if and when it appears on YouTube.) In the video — which still has the same title — things play out the same, but this time around it shows that those adorable sentient plants are responsible for all of the moving objects. They’re <em>everywhere</em>; flying off rattles, carrying toy blocks, and fighting over a pacifier.</p><p>It’s a cute alternate view of the original video, even if it does raise some big existential questions for the Pikmin universe. Namely: can only children see the creatures? Nintendo has <a href="https://pikminbloom.com/#whats-pikmin-bloom">previously said</a> that Pikmin “cannot be seen with the naked eye,” but maybe the lore has changed. My house could be infested and I wouldn’t even know it.</p><p>Here’s the original video for reference:</p><p>The bigger question, of course, is whether Nintendo is teasing something with this video. A Pikmin movie? An Switch 2 update for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23799072/pikmin-4-review-nintendo-switch">Pikmin 4</a></em>? A major expansion for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22746461/pikmin-bloom-hands-on-niantic-iphone-android">Pikmin Bloom</a></em>? A new line of Pikmin-themed pacifiers? Or it could just be a cute, standalone short. Maybe more will be revealed tomorrow.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/796094/nintendo-close-to-you-video-pikmin]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developers Sandfall Interactive have wheeled out news that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'ll be getting a free update which'll include a new location for its party to explore, more boss battles, and some extra costumes. The studio are teasing that there'll be other stuff packed into this update, which they say is designed to act as a thank you to folks who've delved into the Belle Époque Frenchness.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We are working on a big 'thank you' update for the game actively, that we will release when it's ready," Clair Obscur director Guillaume Broche told our mates/mortal enemies over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">Euro Truck Gamer 2</a>. "We want to prepare an update to say a big thank you to our players, because it's thanks to our players that we are in such a comfortable situation now." He added that this update is "not a super big DLC extension with hours of content", but will contain "a bit of whee, and a bit of whoo as well", so set your expectations right in the middle.</p>
<p>The studio have <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/thank-you-from-sandfall-interactive">confirmed some of the stuff that'll be in there</a>. "A new, playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover," is the headliner, but some extra boss battles to challenge late game grinders are giving it a run for its money.</p>
<p>The expeditioneers - no idea if they're ever called that in the game, but I'm rolling with it - will get some new clothes to rock. Text and interface localisation in Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian is also incoming. Sandfall have teased that there'll be more things, but they're not revwheeling those things yet. Sorry.</p>
<p>Nic had some words about Clair Obscur when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">reviewed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Very occasionally, I'll play an RPG that makes me feel ten again. Rebirth. Cris Tales. Revisiting Suikoden. Years come, the big number ticks down, and comfortable appreciation replaces the spellbound enchantment of being told a story, of being swept off to a new world. Of playing Final Fantasy 8 in that special edition shirt that Ben Starr likes to wear that I wish I'd kept because I bet it's worth a bloody fortune now. You wait for a game to bring you back there, mostly certain you've moved passed the capacity to feel that way because you now have the sort of adult concerns that cause you ask how much a shirt might be worth on Ebay. I can't say if Clair Obscur will work its magic on everyone the same way, but it certainly did for me. I'm still not ready to leave, honestly. What a special and rare thing this is: a story that feels like someone wanted to tell it so badly it hurt.</blockquote>
<p>Come on dude, stop sitting on the fence and give us some indication of how you feel.</p>
<p>This free Clair Obscur update's got no release date or estimate attached yet, so it'll definitely arrive after Nic achieves the power to reach through my screen, grab me by the collar, and tell me he thought the game was the term above good.</p>

            <p>Paradox have slapped a release date on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a>'s All Under Heaven DLC, the 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a>'s "largest expansion" ever, which extends its dynastic soap opera to medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia. The map expansion is coming on 28th October. It's the first time the series has ventured to these latitudes, which seem a little incompatible with the European crusader premise. It also introduces Japanese language support.

<p>In a disgraceful betrayal of Rock Paper Shotgun's fine editorial traditions, I have yet to complete a single game of Crusader Kings 3. Every time I feel like trying, somebody says something like "oh great, let us know when your spymaster has an affair with himself", and I retreat frowning into the bushes. Still, I do like the sound of an expansion that encompasses the river valleys of China, Mount Fuji, and the Great Wall.
</p>
<p>"Keep a steady hand on the regional hegemon or manage the tumult of dynastic change in China," Paradox's emissary explained to us, before I had him thrown in an iron maiden. "Revere the Yamato emperor and his regent in Japan, or pursue the path of the samurai warlord. Build a monumental temple facility in the jungles of Southeast Asia and compel weaker kingdoms to pay tribute to your greatness."
</p>

<p>There's more in the press release from game director Alexander Oltner. "We've always seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a> as the story of the entire medieval world, and you can't fully tell that story without East Asia," he comments, rudely undermining my observation up the page about this being an unlikely staging ground for a kingly crusade. Watch your tone, Alexander. We always have an iron maiden going spare.
</p>
<p>Let's all celebrate these fulsome tidings in the traditional medieval style, with a banquet of freshly laid and hard-boiled bulletpoints, covered with saffron and flavoured with cloves.
</p>
<blockquote><strong>China: The Mandate of Heaven</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ascend to the highest tier of power with the new Hegemony title, reigning supreme over all empires in the Chinese region.</li>
<li>Navigate the Dynastic Cycle, a living system of stability and chaos. Exploit periods of instability to rise to power and reshape the political landscape.</li>
<li>Explore the Celestial government system, unique to China. Earn Merit through deeds or the Imperial Examinations, gaining favor and influence.</li>
<li>Manage the Imperial Treasury to fund Great Projects, defend against disasters, or expand your influence with statecraft and might.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Japan: Rise of the Shogunate</strong>
<ul>
<li>Take control of a Japanese house and forge your destiny. Rise through the intricate courtly system to become a mighty Shogun or Kampaku regent.</li>
<li>Strengthen your position through alliances, intrigue, and ritual, or unite the houses through the strength of your samurai armies; which path you take is for you to decide.</li>
<li>Lead the Imperial Yamato house to restore power to the Emperor, ushering in an age of imperial grandeur.</li>
<li>Experience the rich cultural traditions of Japan, where honor and scandal intertwine, shaping the lives of lords and vassals alike.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Southeast Asia: God-Kings and Temple Empires</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rule as a Devaraja with the Mandala Government, uniting tributaries into vast, temple-centered empires.</li>
<li>Pay tribute to the God King by performing Tributary Missions as a Tributary ruler, increasing favor with your subjects.</li>
<li>Explore the Silk Road, new Starting Bookmarks and Historical Flavor</li>
<li>Thrive along the expansive Silk Road by profiting from the wealth and innovations of China, even if you are far beyond its borders.</li>
<li>New historical starting bookmarks bring fresh perspectives and new challenges. Play as iconic characters from the past or forge your unique path.</li>
<li>Immerse yourself in Asia's cultural, artistic, and historical nuances with new throne rooms, events, and traditions.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The price tag is just as hefty as the expansion itself - $29.99, £24.99 or €29.99. Alternatively, you can get it in the Crusader Kings III: Chapter IV expansion pass. I'm not sure I'd pay £24.99 for the Great Wall - I hear it was more effective as a psychological deterrent than a literal obstacle. Still, you do you. While you're sizing up the price tag vs the feature sheet, let us know if you've had any more trouble with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-update-1171-brings-a-heap-more-fixes-for-the-coronations-dlcs-misbehaving-oaths">misbehaving oaths</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-clears-out-harry-potter-stock-hagrids-hut-selling-for-mere-pennies-2000633202</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s something that doesn’t happen often: a LEGO Harry Potter set on sale. These sets are among the most popular in the entire LEGO catalog and discounts are rare. When you find one with stellar reviews like this <strong>Hagrid’s Hut set</strong> (which boasts an impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars), it’s even more unusual.</p>
<p>Right now, during the final hours of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/">this popular set has dropped to $41 on Amazon, down from $74 (44% off) which marks an all-time low price</a>. This<strong> deal is exclusively for Prime members</strong>, and there’s no guarantee it’ll return before the holidays roll around.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4642/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Hagrid’s Hut is one of the most emotive locations in the Wizarding World, the site of Harry’s initial revelations about his magical parentage and the setting of many indelible scenes across the series. For collectors and fans, recreating these scenes is one way that the magic can be brought home in tangible form. This is a masterful capture of the barely-tamed feel of Hagrid’s mountain hut with incredible attention to every little detail.</p>
<h2>Seven Characters and a Dragon Bring the Scene to Life</h2>
<p>The real magic is the character list. You get the complete roster of <strong>seven characters: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Rubeus Hagrid as mini-figures</strong>, plus LEGO interpretations of Norbert,<strong> the baby dragon, and Fang, the loyal boarhound of Hagrid</strong>. With these, kids can reproduce the iconic scene in The Philosopher’s Stone when Harry and his pals discover Hagrid openly incubating a dragon’s egg in secret.</p>



<p>The hut itself is a happy size for play and has beautifully considered design elements that make the building experience all the more fun. It’s easy to access the inside without becoming frustrated <strong>thanks to the removable roof</strong> and the building opens wide to show the detailed interior. Hagrid’s trademark oversized furniture consists of his foldout chair that are beautifully proportioned to his half-giant frame. There is an umbrella stand on which his noted pink umbrella (which actually contains his broken wand) would sit, and the key dragon egg element waits to crack open. <strong>Fang’s doghouse sits separate</strong>&nbsp;and provides depth to the scene as well as the possibility of play scenarios outdoors.</p>



<p>One particularly nice touch is the random inclusion of <strong>two gold-plated portrait elements</strong>: They are among a group of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits that extend across multiple LEGO Harry Potter sets.</p>
<p>The <strong>collection is made up of 465 pieces</strong> and offers multiple hours of fun building time suitable for children aged 8 and above. Complexity falls just in that golden zone between challenging enough that it is rewarding without being tough enough that little builders get stuck.</p>
<p>At this all-time low price, you’re getting incredible value. Those seven characters, two buildings, and the collectible portrait pieces individually would easily merit the whole $74 price. For parents searching for a Halloween special, birthday, or early holiday gift, the deal is the best chance this year to acquire this specific set without breaking the budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Riot’s free-to-download League of Legends fighting game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/2xko">2XKO</a> is out now in early access, and the launch has brought with it various bundles, including one based on much-loved animation Arcane that costs a whopping $100.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans who want the Arcane skins for Vi, Jinx, and Ekko must buy the $100 Ultra Starter Edition. There is no way to buy the skins for each character individually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes the aforementioned Arcane skins, all Arcane skin chromas, an Arcane sticker set, 5,000 KO points (the in-game currency), plus everything in the cheaper Deluxe and Standard bundles. As you'd expect, all the contents amounts to more than $100 in terms of the individual value of what's included here, but that hasn’t stopped some fans from reacting with a mix of disbelief and frustration at the way Riot is handling microtransactions so early in the game’s life.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">2XKO is free-to-play, so fans expected somewhat aggressive monetization. But forcing players to buy the $100 bundle to get <em>any</em> of the Arcane skins rather than selling them standalone has drawn criticism. A cursory glance at the 2XKO subreddit, social media, and Discord shows the vociferous debate this bundle has sparked into life. “No separate buy? I only play vi,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1o0jaj3/100_bucks_for_the_3_arcane_skins_is_crazy_really/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complained VaninaG</a>. “Like the value of the bundle is not bad, is like buying a game+season pass, but if there's no separate buy for the skins it's kinda predatory because some might just want to spend 10-20 in one skin.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="tl" dir="ltr"><p>wait wait wait wait wait. The <a href="https://twitter.com/Play2XKO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Play2XKO</a> arcane skins cost $100?!?!?!?!</p><p>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHA<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/2XKO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#2XKO</a>, you're drunk <a href="https://t.co/T7aacDtuJI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/T7aacDtuJI</a></p></div>— Chris “bootman” Boutté (@bootmanmstz) <a href="https://twitter.com/bootmanmstz/status/1975596511552799165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">holy moly the skin prices in 2XKO are insane. $140 for 3 arcane skins + stuff 💀 i do genuinely hope this game gets as big as Riot's other games and retains enough active players that the f2p model and the game itself are sustainable. <a href="https://t.co/zfrrres0BZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zfrrres0BZ</a></p>— victoria👹 (@vicwingly) <a href="https://twitter.com/vicwingly/status/1975626557306835417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/arcane-league-of-legends">Arcane</a> is hugely popular and brought an army of newcomers into the League of Legends universe. It makes sense that Riot would want to lean on the Netflix animation, its characters and their designs for 2XKO’s launch. And the developer has raised eyebrows for its monetization for its other games, including League of Legends, in the past, so for some this approach for 2XKO comes as no surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Riot isn’t alone in employing these sorts of tactics when it comes to selling virtual video game items. Whether it’s forcing players to buy bundles instead of standalone items, selling bundles of virtual currency that always leave you with a little bit left over so you’re encouraged to spend more, or FOMO-inducing battle passes and in-game shops that make items available for a limited period only, gamers have become accustomed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-fans-blast-cardboard-isaac-clarkes-absurd-35-pricetag-in-free-to-play-skate">expensive cosmetics that are often pricier than entire games</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question for Riot is whether 2XKO’s launch monetization does the business. Complaints from the vocal hardcore online probably won’t move the internal needle if the masses open their wallets. But some are already comparing 2XKO to Warner Bros.' failed free-to-download fighting game MultiVersus, which similarly drew controversy for the way it sold virtual items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2xko-review">2XKO early access review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “2XKO has found a way to distill what's fun about tag fighters while mitigating a lot of the pain points that typically come with the territory.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <title><![CDATA[Little Nightmares 3 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/little-nightmares-3-review.1319737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of us have recurring nightmares from time to time, whether it’s the one where you go to school naked, or the one where all your teeth fall out, or indeed the one where you go to school naked and all your teeth fall out. However, Little Nightmares 3 isn’t the kind of recurring nightmare that’s likely to keep you awake at night. Instead, this puzzle-platforming sequel feels like a surprisingly uninspired retread of the two shadow-soaked stories that preceded it, and its only noteworthy new addition, a co-op mode, doesn’t shake up the formula to any substantial degree. I went into Little Nightmares 3 steeling myself for a traumatic twilight trip scary enough to make me sit bolt upright in bed, but instead it left me feeling calm enough to roll over and hit the snooze button.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3’s journey through a sequence of dimly lit domains focuses on two entirely new and aptly named child leads, Low and Alone. You select which pint-sized protagonist you want to inhabit at the story’s outset, with the second hero controlled either by the AI – like Six was in Little Nightmares 2 – or by a second player in online co-op. The two leads share the same core abilities like jumping, crouch-walking, and grabbing objects, but they’re each equipped with a unique tool for puzzle-solving and the occasional brief burst of combat. Low has a bow that can be used to shoot ropes to drop crates or switches to move platforms, while Alone lugs around a giant wrench that she can use to smash through weakened walls or manipulate the controls of certain basic bits of machinery found in Little Nightmare 3’s twisted terrain. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However there’s little room for experimentation with either character’s unique action, since they are largely context sensitive – Low will typically only raise his bow to fire if there’s a target nearby that he needs to hit, for example – and puzzle solutions always seem pretty obvious as a result. Few of them require much in the way of coordinated combinations of the two characters’ abilities, and I never found myself getting hung up on a brainteaser in Little Nightmares 3 for anywhere near as long as I did when faced with some of the more challenging puzzles of its predecessor, which made it feel like I was just mindlessly going through the motions for most of the five-hour journey.      </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Little Nightmares 3 Review Screens</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Nightmare Run</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the tales of the first two Little Nightmares’ which each featured five chapters, Low and Alone’s story is split across only four: the sandswept sprawl of Necropolis; the creepy, lollipop-lined floors of the Candy Factory; the twisted, Tim Burton-esque big tops of Carnavale; and the somewhat generic hospital hallway horrors of The Institute. (There are apparently a further two chapters to come, but they will arrive at a later date as part of a paid expansion pass.) Low and Alone travel to each standalone setting using mirrors as portals, and while I won’t spoil why it is they’re trapped in these nightmare realms or exactly where they’re trying to get to, I will say that I found the unspoken bond that gradually develops between them to be surprisingly sweet, even if the story itself is ultimately pretty slight and not nearly as spooky as the previous two.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of the four chapters on offer, Carnavale struck me as the most engaging to explore. There are all sorts of disgusting sights to sneak past in its dank depths lit by string lights and occasional flashes of lightning, from grotesquely overstuffed patrons smacking human pinatas with sticks and gorging themselves face down in straining slop buckets, to a particularly disturbing spin on the classic magician’s trick of sawing a man in half. It also features the most tense combat encounters in the entire adventure, as the diminutive duo is forced to team up against waves of wooden dolls styled like sideshow alley barkers, with Low knocking their heads off with a well-timed arrow and then frantically trying to avoid the clutches of their headless bodies, while Alone rushes in to club their discarded skulls with her wrench to terminate them for good.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Little Nightmares 3 is less of a frightening new beast and more of a familiar Frankenstein's monster assembled with parts repurposed from the previous two games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this handful of memorable moments, though, Little Nightmares 3 is less of a frightening new beast and more of a familiar Frankenstein's monster assembled with parts repurposed from the previous two games. The towering baby doll that looms large in the background of the Necropolis chapter like some sort of slack-eyed Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is certainly an intimidating sight to behold, but overcoming it is painfully straightforward – you simply need to time your movements to slink past it when its vision cone shifts like so many other stalkers in the series’ past. Remember timing your jumps in tandem on top of a trap door to crash your way down through to basement levels in Little Nightmares 2? Well, get ready to repeat that action several times over in Little Nightmares 3, along with regular stops to slowly rip the wooden beams off boarded-up doorways and push and pull crates in order to clamber up onto shelves. It all starts to feel a bit too repetitive long before you roll credits, which isn’t ideal for a story with a runtime so short it can be completed in a single late night session.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Umbrella Cooperation</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple of additional tools that Low and Alone gain access to along the way that switch things up slightly. For the first two chapters, the plucky young pair is equipped with umbrellas that can be unfurled to either take advantage of updrafts and float up to out of reach platforms, or to cushion the fall from equally great heights, which adds a welcome wrinkle to the story’s otherwise strictly linear exploration. However, any interesting movement methods these parasols present are completely quashed at the story’s midpoint, when the umbrella is ditched in favour of a flashlight that has considerably less impact on the action. Sure, it illuminates your increasingly gloomy surroundings, but there’s never a time where it’s used as a tool for heightening the tension in any interesting ways. I still get chills thinking about that sequence in Little Nightmares 2 that involved desperately shining a flashlight to halt the march of prosthetically-limbed patients in its menacing hospital setting, but sadly there’s nothing nearly as terrifying as that here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, Little Nightmares 3 quickly settles into a fairly predictable rhythm of alternating between slow and steady stealth sections and urgent chase sequences, both plagued by instant fail outcomes that are at least mitigated somewhat by mostly generous checkpointing. Zero-tolerance terminations are nothing new in the series, of course - however, these swift deaths did highlight the occasionally idiotic behaviour of the partner AI this time around, like when an CPU-controlled Low kept shooting arrows as the same giant fly in the Necropolis that would fall and crush him, sending us back to the nearest checkpoint. For several frustrating repeated deaths, it proved to be a literal game-breaking bug.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AI issues can be avoided by playing through Little Nightmares 3 in co-op, of course, but although this new two-player mode has been touted as one of its most distinguishing features, it’s been implemented in a disappointingly limited fashion. For starters, co-op is online-only so you can’t play through the story with a friend on the couch beside you, which is a shame if, like me, you enjoy partnering up in games with your spouse or children. It also isn’t drop-in, drop-out, so if you start a game in co-op but your fellow adventurer decides they’re too creeped out to continue, you have to start the story over again in order to play solo, which seems like an entirely unnecessary restriction to impose.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Awesome Couch Co-Op Games</h3><p>Sofa, so good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Little Nightmares 3 does however offer a generous friend pass system similar to that of Split Fiction, allowing a second player to join you without them having to purchase their own copy of the game, but that’s pretty much where the comparisons with Hazelight Studios’ co-op epic end. Little Nightmares 3 can’t compete with Split Fiction’s consistently innovative brilliance in co-operative game design, nor the replay value it offers by featuring such widely contrasting experiences between its two playable characters. After finishing the campaign as Low, I immediately started again as Alone and was disappointed to find there was no meaningful difference between the two beyond one character’s ability to hit things and the other's ability to shoot them.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite a pair of new protagonists and the inclusion of two-player support for the first time in the series, Little Nightmares 3 doesn’t do enough to distinguish itself from the previous two adventures, making each step through its shadowy structures less full of dread and more like a retread. There are some memorably morbid moments here and there, and the Carnavale chapter is a standout, but the constant crate-pushing and instant-fail chase sequences feel all too familiar at this point. Little Nightmares 3 features little innovation, few scares, and limited appeal if you’ve already played the previous two games, unless you’re dead keen to experience the series’ signature brand of stop-start stealth with a friend in tow. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-review]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Yooka-Replaylee Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/yooka-replaylee-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yooka-replaylee-review.1319731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all of their outdated issues, I have a soft spot for 3D platformers that makes itself known whenever something like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review"><u>Super Mario Odyssey</u></a> finds a clever way to breathe new life back into the genre. Yooka-Replaylee, which remixes a platformer that was already soggy with nostalgia, doesn’t get anywhere near that bar, but it does at least succeed in making the cute-but-forgettable adventure of 2017’s Yooka-Laylee into something more competent. My biggest gripes with the original, including camera issues, sloppy controls, and a lack of fast travel, have all been addressed, with lots of fat and ideas that didn’t work being thrown out as well. But there’s also an odd Frankenstein quality to this reworked creation, a surprising number of technical shortcomings, and the same unrelenting focus on nostalgia for the 3D platformers of yesteryear that results in almost nothing unique or novel. There are still good times to be had with this charming lizard/bird duo, but the reconfigured experiment that serves as their latest adventure only succeeds at turning a game that never quite worked into something a little less underwhelming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More than the simple remaster its cheeky title might imply, Yooka-Replaylee is a complete overhaul that fixes a pretty large number of missteps, but it’s still a 3D platforming collectathon at its heart. It wears its on-the-nose Banjo-Kazooie inspirations on its sleeve, so you’ll be hopping, gliding, and rolling around colorful worlds while chatting with dorky, googly-eyed characters as you hunt for the all-important “Pagies” required to unlock the next area. Fortunately, now you can do all that sans the absolutely atrocious camera and imprecise controls of the original, which is quite nice, and everything from the quests you’ll tackle to the story to even things as fundamental as the number of Pagies you’re collecting has been completely redesigned, to its benefit more often than not.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Yooka-Replaylee Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you’re solving basic jumping puzzles, fighting goofy looking monsters, or playing minigames like a gem-grabbing minecart ride, Yooka-Replaylee never gets any more challenging than requiring the rare second attempt. Combat in particular is as straightforward as can be, as it usually amounts to just spamming the tailspin attack until everything dies, and enemies are absolutely rubbish at being able to land hits on you. The improved controls and camera also mean the extreme simplicity of its platforming has become more glaring, and most puzzles can be solved just by knowing the basic bag of movement tricks in your belt. That could be springboarding off of Yooka’s tail for increased jumping height or learning that you can eat certain objects to augment your powers, like red orbs that give Yooka the ability to spit fire and melt things. It’s extremely basic stuff, and while it all plays much better without as much wonkiness, it’s just not that exciting to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a lot of work has clearly been put into making this version feel much better, as Yooka-Laylee’s awkward camera angles and slippery movement used to be near-constant annoyances. Probably the best compliment I can give is that I almost never thought about the camera while playing, because it was never really an issue. Of course, I’d occasionally get stuck in some weird corner or whatever and momentarily have to swing the camera around, but with controls that feel quite smooth, it never caused me much trouble as I hopped around hungrily gobbling up Pagies. I never raged during the rare instances where I failed a platforming attempt, either, since I only had myself to blame for any muck ups this time around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fresh paint doesn’t solve the underlying problem that this all feels generic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But tighter controls do nothing to address Yooka-Replaylee’s biggest issue: the original was already an unambitious throwback that played on your love of old school 3D platformers instead of trying to push that mold or do something interesting within it. Yooka-Replaylee is quite literally a remake of a game that was itself already a remix of old ideas, and a fresh coat of paint doesn’t solve the underlying problem of this all feeling generic and unsurprising. The fact that it’s coming out an additional eight years later certainly doesn’t help with that either, as we’ve had even more time to outgrow these dated designs as standouts like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> explored the genre in more exciting ways. Even when I was impressed by just how much they improved here, I still struggled to find a reason to recommend this to anyone when they could just play Astro Bot instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say it’s exactly the same, and one of the more fundamental changes is the overall pace of the adventure. Instead of unlocking abilities as you go by collecting a special currency in each area, you get all of those abilities right away and then learn to take advantage of them as they come up during platforming puzzles. Similarly, rather than unlocking different sections of each of the five main levels in phases, you have access to their full maps right from the get-go and can even fast travel to different points to minimize monotonous backtracking, which is awesome. And instead of 25 somewhat sparse Pagies to find in each level, this number has been doubled to 50, so you get to watch Yooka and Laylee delightfully freak out about finding one twice as often. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these tweaks combine to make everything about Yooka-Replaylee feel faster and less linear. Instead of seeing a Pagie out of reach and knowing you’ll have to return to get it once you’ve unlocked a certain ability you don’t yet have, you can more or less sprint through each zone grabbing everything in sight until you’ve utterly cleared it. Even cooler: you’re given a map with a checklist of all the Pagies in each world, so you can scratch your completionist itch without wandering around for hours in search of something that’s alluding you – unless that thing is a Pagie <em>piece</em>, which they don’t show you on the map for some frustratingly inconsistent reason, so you could spend three hours searching for the last one on a level like I <em>definitely didn’t do</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Removing these artificial barriers to progress is without question a good decision, and it was quite freeing to be let loose in each world to methodically solve every puzzle and combat encounter in my path, but there are some pretty weird side effects of making so many overhauls as well. The most wonky example stems from the increased number of Pagies, which completely alters the flow of the adventure in some pretty unappealing ways. If the original Yooka-Laylee was explicitly designed around the 3D platforming philosophy of classic games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, where collectibles were harder to get but more meaningful, then Yooka-Replaylee has been adapted to be more like Super Mario Odyssey, where you’re picking up items left and right. The problem is that some remain hidden behind legacy designs that ask you to win a minigame or beat a boss, while you’ll find others just lying around in easily reachable places or crammed into spots that don’t feel like a terribly natural fit. On the bright side, you get the dopamine hit of finding collectibles twice as often, but it feels pretty odd when some take significantly more effort than others, which serves as a fairly obvious reminder of just how much this thing has been altered.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Unexpected side effects of its Frankenstein construction are all over the place.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most extreme instance of this tweak going awry is the fact that, after doing a completionist run of the first two worlds, I realized I had gathered enough Pagies to just… go finish the story? That’s right – I still only needed 120 of these guys to head to the big baddie’s lair and trigger the final boss fight, and since that’s a lot easier now than it once was, I walked right into his home and rolled credits before even entering the other three stages. I’m not sure if this was an intentional decision to give players more freedom to approach the adventure how they want, but it just felt downright weird to do, especially since some of the cutscenes along the way still reference events that are supposed to take place in the worlds I skipped. For this reason, I was actually able to roll credits after just four hours, then went back and spent another seven on the other levels in the most anti-climactic way possible, completely removing any urgency to be a completionist with the remaining worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The unexpected side effects of this heavily revised collectathon’s Frankenstein construction are all over the place. For example, in the original you had lots of reasons to talk to fun side characters like Trowzer the snake, who had a chance to show off his amusing personality as he sold you all of your platforming abilities. But since you get access to those abilities right at the start now, Trowzer has been relegated to an entirely optional vendor you only have a reason to chat with maybe once per stage, leaving him devoid of most of the silly bits and one-liners he previously delivered. Another example of this is one of the villains, Dr. Quack, who used to goof around with you as he forced you to take his annoying quizzes throughout the story. These have been removed completely, which I’m certainly not crying about as these sections were never much fun, but it also means you don’t really get to build a relationship with this guy and lose a lot of the heart that was previously one of Yooka-Laylee’s strengths.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite 3D Platformers</h3><p>Do you like jumping? Then I recommend hopping on these games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t get me wrong: I still think the vast majority of these changes are a step in the right direction, even when they introduce some jankiness or come at the cost of some jokes getting dropped. It’s just abundantly clear how much this thing has been tortured to correct for errors of the past, to the point where it almost feels like it would have been a better idea to just make a new game altogether. The story in particular feels like a casualty to all the revisions, since you speak to characters far less and spend a whole lot less time understanding the bad guys and their motivations, so it almost feels like you’re required to have played Yooka-Laylee (and remember enough of it) to understand this remake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you do or not, it’s at least easy to appreciate just how good Yooka-Replaylee looks. The visual improvement over the original is absolutely massive. Everything is more colorful, lighting has been fixed so you never feel like you’re wandering through the dark, and Yooka and friends are more expressive. Plus, you can enjoy how pretty it all looks with a whole bunch of neat cosmetics to swag up your heroes as you explore. Unfortunately, this glow-up is offset by the fact that I encountered numerous technical shortcomings, from abrupt crashes to framerates absolutely tanking during boss fights or other unfortunate moments. Crashes were fairly rare, and unlike with Yooka-Laylee, I never fell through the map or got caught on the environment, but the framerate dips were worse than anything I encountered in the original, and happened often enough to leave me pretty irritated.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Yooka-Replaylee aims to overhaul a platformer that was rife with frustrating issues, and while it does feel better for it, none of its changes do enough to bring it close to the 3D platforming standards of today. Improvements to the movement of both your camera and character, the upgraded graphics, and the removal of unnecessary annoyances like having to unlock abilities over time are all fantastic changes. But all of the bending that was done to modernize this thing has resulted in an almost equal number of drawbacks, like a story that has been unsatisfyingly chopped up and a search for Pagies that feels a bit too easy given how many are now crammed into each area. So unless your nostalgia for this kind of 3D platformer is particularly strong, there aren’t a ton of compelling reasons to revisit this one.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/yooka-replaylee-review]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> dataminer has claimed that the game might have featured one of the franchise's most polarizing characters at one point in its development. Having dug through files for the game, EpicNNG uploaded their findings online.</p><h2><em>Warning: Spoilers for Borderlands 3 and 4 below</em></h2><p>After spending a chunk of time on Kairos, players eventually run into the Siren Amara in Borderlands 4 as part of their quest to find the villainous Vile Lector. Amara was the playable Siren character first introduced in 2019's Borderlands 3, <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674?" rel="nofollow ">but EpicNNG believes that the files they uncovered</a> pointed toward players originally teaming up with a different Siren at this point in the story: Ava.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Alright I guess we're gonna talk about it:<br>AVA WAS CUT FROM BORDERLANDS 4<br>There are numerous files related to her in the game, more specifically outlining that she was completely replaced by Amara late in development. This means yes, she was originally going to team up with… <a href="https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p</a> <a href="https://t.co/tBoVNJ8hpq" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tBoVNJ8hpq</a></p>  — EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The Siren-in-training made her debut in Borderlands 3, but over the years, she's become more hated than Claptrap due to her role in that game and her overall character arc. The files discovered by EpicNNG have several "Ava" titles, and Amara uses powers that are very similar to Ava's own Siren abilities that she inherited from her deceased mentor, Maya.</p><p>"It would appear everything aside from references has been completely scrubbed, including audio files, models, and more," <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975223565248299443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EpicNNG added</a>, noting that this might have been an "intentional blunder" from a Gearbox employee, given just how difficult it is to pick through Borderlands 4 data for clues on post-release content. "This game is airtight on datamining," <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975240774909407319" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they explained</a>. "Nothing pre-or post release is in the files as of now. More credibility to this being intentional[ly] left in by a dev."</p><p>Ava's role in Borderlands 3 drew a lot of criticism, with many players pointing out her grating personality, her role in getting fan-favorite character Maya killed by the Calypso Twins, and her immature outbursts. Essentially, she was the Scrappy-Doo of Borderlands, but a deleted scene from the game did suggest that a redemption arc for her was on the cards, as she realized how her actions had led to Maya's death.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui50I7jvH2M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ui50I7jvH2M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last year, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1840461497371402481" rel="nofollow ">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford asked his audience</a> how they'd feel about Ava returning, with the general consensus being heavily against seeing the young Siren in Borderlands 4.</p><p>Whether Ava returns or not remains to be seen, but we do know that another familiar face, Moxxi's daughter Ellie, will be a major character in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-borderlands-4-will-keep-you-looting-and-shooting-after-launch/1100-6534397/">first Borderlands 4 post-launch expansion</a> alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gets-new-vault-hunter-in-early-2026/1100-6535088/">new Vault Hunter C4sh</a>.</p>
