<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Studio SARU and Production I.G have just unveiled a teaser for an upcoming <em>Ghost In The Shell</em> anime, titled only <em>The Ghost In The Shell.</em></p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">The original <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> is based on the manga of the same name, and this new project seems to be a new adaptation of that. New media in the <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> franchise isn’t necessarily a rare thing, though, with the franchise spanning multiple animated adaptations, video games, and even an infamous Hollywood movie that starred Scarlett Johansson. </p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="TVアニメ『攻殻機動隊（仮）』特報｜2026年放送｜THE GHOST IN THE SHELL" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ix7QURhM7jE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">The project is being helmed by Studio SARU, which recently made <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em> for Netflix, a reimagining of the classic comic that earned critic and fan acclaim for its bold and refreshing take on the beloved story and characters. </p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true">Will we be seeing a similar approach with the new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> adaptation? Fans are already speculating we could be looking into something similar to <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood.</em></p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">i cant believe they're making ghost in the shell brotherhood. not something i neccesarily want but i guess i shall be seated. i'm curious at the very least</p>— yuuko from nichijou (@headfallsoff) <a href="https://twitter.com/headfallsoff/status/1794393622948794423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">Will Studio SARU pull off something incredible, or will it go the safe route? The teaser doesn’t reveal much, so we might be looking at a couple of years of intense speculation.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Despite various other adaptations taking a stab at the story, the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> film is still considered the best outing in the franchise and is one of the most beloved works of sci-fi in history. Even if you haven’t seen the original movie, you’ve seen one of the hundreds of properties inspired by it. Though it came out in 1995, it hasn’t aged a day, and its story is still a poignant and relevant tale backed by some of<em> </em>the best — if not the best — animated sequences in the history of Japanese animation.</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">The new <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> anime will hopefully land in 2026, but you can currently watch the original <em>Ghost In the Shell</em> on Prime Video.</p>

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re all in love with the wasteland of Fallout thanks to the new Amazon Prime TV show and the graphical update to Fallout 4, but budding Wasteland Wanderers can find plenty of ghoulish joy in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-games-that-should-get-a-ttrpg/">these five TTRPGs</a> that explore post-apocalyptic worlds.</p> <h2 id="h-gamma-world" data-injectable="false">Gamma World</h2> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">An absolutely wild game of acid-green nuclear nonsense, Gamma World has been around since the 70’s. Its most recent incarnation, a boxed set from Wizards of the Coast based on the 4th edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is sadly no longer available in print, though you can still get it in pdf. It was filled with the same joyful chaos as Fallout, with mutated animals, treacherous wastes and an enjoyably cartoonish sense of humor. The 4th edition rules, while controversial at the time, find an excellent implementation in this tactical RPG.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="0" data-injectable="false"> <figure><figcaption>A typical day in Gamma World. Image from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </figure> <h2 id="h-apocalypse-world" data-injectable="false">Apocalypse World</h2> <p data-characters="534" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">The big daddy of all Powered by the Apocalypse games since, Apocalypse World leapt onto the scene ready to blow people’s minds in 2010. The striking black and white images, the fast rules that constantly pushed the story forward, and the leading questions that empowered players to share the responsibility for building the world have been hugely influential. Apocalypse World has had an undeniable impact and inspired many other games, including the more community-focused apocalypse narratives of Legacy: Life Among the Ruins.</p>
 <h2 id="h-fallout-the-rpg" data-injectable="false">Fallout: The RPG</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Fallout RPG - How To Play" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WnklTH6aQbM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="811" data-injectable="true">Of course we had to mention Modiphius’s Fallout TTRPG. Based on their own 2d20 system and now supported by a vast array of gorgeously-produced books, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-fallout-game-ranked-best-to-worst/">Fallout RPG is stuffed with references to the classic and modern video games</a>. Solve problems with your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, target hit locations in a callback to the VATs system, and delve into a deep scavenging system. You can also get Virtual Tabletop (VTT) versions of most products produced by Modiphius, and the art evokes the setting perfectly.</p>
 <h2 id="h-rifts" data-injectable="false">Rifts</h2> <p data-characters="980" data-current-count="980" data-injectable="true">Gamma World and Fallout are weird, but Rifts? Rifts is really, really weird. While it takes itself a little more seriously than many post-apocalyptic settings, it is also a perfect example of pure unadulterated 90’s TTRPG strangeness. The original TTRPG, published by Palladium, had more than fifty supplements for different parts of the worlds, dimensions and big events in the setting. It was also a completely unique post-apocalyptic setting in which the apocalypse was rifts to other dimensions filled with sci-fi monsters that bordered on the eldritch. Earth was divided into massively detailed factions and many places had returned to idealised sci-fi tinged versions of mythological eras, such as the griffin-riding cyberknights of England, and the dinosaur swamp that took over parts of the east coast of the United States. Pinnacle Entertainment created Savage Worlds Rifts using the well-loved Savage Worlds system, and so the absolute weirdness of Rifts lives on.</p>
 <h2 id="h-mutant-year-zero" data-injectable="false">Mutant: Year Zero</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Mutant Year Zero Tabletop RPG Release Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9jk7UBlwUPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="617" data-current-count="917" data-injectable="false">Based on a TTRPG from the 1980s, Mutant: Year Zero from Free League literally empowers the player characters with bizarre mutations and places emphasis on exploration as well as building a home base. Mutant: Year Zero combines the dark humor of Fallout with the grim horrors of the STALKER series of games, creating a world where the player characters are constantly escaping by the skin of their teeth but still get to throw fireballs. Overstretch your resources and you’ll have to risk more to restock, and the question becomes: what’s worth fighting for in a world where everyone is out for themselves?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respect-to-the-director-of-netflix%E2%80%99s-atlas-for-thinking-deeply-about-mechs.881562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24164149/atlas-jennifer-lopez-director-brad-peyton-mech-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="h5sLC0">A lifetime of scarfing down sci-fi, video games, and comic books brought director Brad Peyton to the job of said lifetime: directing Jennifer Lopez in a frickin’ mech-suit movie. Signing on for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099465/netflix-atlas-jennifer-lopez-scifi-movie"><em>Atlas</em></a>, now streaming on Netflix, was an easy yes: With two big-budget Dwayne Johnson vehicles under his belt, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/11/17226498/rampage-movie-review-the-rock-dwayne-johnson"><em>Rampage</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/2/18/11052008/san-andreas-sequel-dwayne-johnson"><em>San Andreas</em></a>, Peyton was no stranger to A-list-driven spectacle. Still, the film was an intimidating prospect for someone with a deep appreciation for mech suits, mech tanks, oversized mecha, and all the made-up classifications in between. </p>
<p id="x0xVvh">“I was <em>very</em> aware of what had come out ahead of me,” Peyton tells Polygon. The director cites James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> and <em>Avatar</em> as obvious but undeniable milestones in the art of on-screen mechs. He knew that the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/10/24/13377822/titanfall-2-review-xbox-one-PC-ps4-playstation-4">Titanfall games</a> put pressure on any new live-action attempt, having created full immersion into the experience of mech fighting. But when he started imagining how to rethink mechs, he returned to the first piece of mecha media that really blew him away: Stuart Gordon’s <em>Robot Jox</em>. </p>
<p id="HUqXkg">Peyton can’t quite explain why <em>Robot Jox</em> was his holy grail, but in talking to him, it’s obvious: Like Gordon’s whiz-bang vision of the future, where Earth’s conflicts are settled by colorful mech duels, <em>Atlas</em> needed clear, well-defined logic that would ground the world-building, but also let him rip in the action department in a way that would delight his inner child. And at the end of the day, he needed to be original.</p>
<div id="sxLCIQ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P4QghULoUfE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="M5yS4I">“My biggest thing was: I knew I had to separate from everything,” Peyton says. “I had no interest in repeating. I said, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/10/7/16441340/pacific-rim-uprising-daredevil-punisher-netflix">Pac Rim</a><em>’s [mechs] are </em>this<em> big. In </em>Avatar<em>, they’re </em>this<em> big. In </em>Titanfall,<em> they’re </em>this<em> big. So mine is gonna be </em>this<em> big. This one might be square and blocky, so mine is gonna be circular.</em> I come from animation. So a lot of it started with me sketching the silhouette and figuring how to make it unique and different.” </p>
<p id="1jzDQC"><em>Atlas</em> takes place in a relatively sunny future that still exists in the shadow of an impending apocalypse. Decades earlier, a rogue artificial intelligence named Harlan (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22633102/shang-chi-review"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a>’s Simu Liu) fled Earth for an alien planet with the intent of one day returning to lay waste to humanity. When scientists discover Harlan’s whereabouts, Terran forces launch a mission to take the fight to the robot army’s doorstep. Leading the charge: Atlas Shepherd (Lopez), a data analyst recruited to go full Jack Ryan on Harlan’s ass. Of course, the attack doesn’t go as smoothly as the Earthlings would hope, and Atlas has to begrudgingly click into an AI-powered mech suit in order to survive an alien planet populated with androids who want her dead.</p>
<p id="8oXSlo">The grounded futurism of <em>Atlas</em>’ Earth led Peyton and his creative team to extrapolate from current military tech for the mech design. Rounded edges and exhaust pipes are lifted from F-18 planes. The interior control panels were built for theoretical functionality. </p>
<p id="DqkJj1">“I had to understand all the tech from the inside out,” Peyton says. “Because of my experience on <em>San Andreas</em>, where I had to understand how a helicopter worked intimately to tell Dwayne what buttons to press and not to press — at least when he would listen to me! — I took that experience and wanted to make a similar experience for [Lopez]. I laid it out with the art department of why there are screens in certain places, why there are holograms in other places. And then on the day, I’m giving her little wires to be like, ‘That’s what this screen is. That’s where the screen is.’ So after going through the blocking, I pulled those away, and she had to memorize where they were.”</p>

<p id="8tKG0K">Drawings and schematics were only half of the equation. After drafting a design, Peyton set out to make his vision come to life. Coming at it from an animation background, that meant animating various walk cycles to see if the bipedal machine could move the right way.</p>
<p id="sfoGct">“The first couple of designs we had when we animated them to see how they would work — very basic animation, walk, run, walk, jog, run cycles — looked so clunky and terrible,” Peyton says. The animation team found a groove when they clarified the dynamic between man and machine. “[The mechs] are intuitive devices. The concept that I came up with was, the soldier is the brain. He doesn’t have to be super strong. He’s not like a grunt — the machine is the grunt. He is the emotional cognitive device that syncs with this thing. So it has to be able to be as fluid as a person who’s been trained in it.”</p>
<p id="anlxlU">As Atlas traverses the biomes of Harlan’s base planet — from snowy tundras to swamps inspired by Peyton’s love for <em>Return of the Jedi</em> — the film’s hero loosens up on her “no AI” stance and forms a cognitive link with her mech’s digital interface. Like a twist on the buddy-cop movie, the two bond for survival, which presents itself as more fluid mech motions. Early on, Atlas might be bumbling around a rocky cliff. By the end, she’s running, rolling, and slapping the hell out of robot assailants with mech-fu. The early walk cycle tests came in handy for the dramatic evolution, which Peyton was able to program into an enormous soundstage gimbal rig that stood in for the mech suit. Lopez was surprisingly well suited for the demands of the mech choreography. </p>
<p id="2JGjOb">“Her background as a dancer is what allowed her to really gauge that quickly,” Peyton says. “As much as she looks like she’s walking, [the mech] is walking her, and she has to react like she’s walking. So that training as a dancer allowed her to step right into it.”</p>

<p id="FD5xmE">It also helps that Lopez routinely performs for thousands all by her lonesome on a stadium stage. Peyton says <em>Atlas</em> turned out to be one of the most demanding shoots of his career, simply because for six to seven weeks, it was just Lopez performing solo on a gimbal rig that would be completely painted over with plate shots, VFX environments, and bursts of other action sequences shot elsewhere. Occasionally, voice actor Gregory James Cohan would dial in to perform the dialogue of Smith, her AI companion. </p>
<p id="92spoJ">All the prep work required to realize a mech with the capacity for real action, and clicking in a star who was up to control it, was in service of jolting the audience, says Peyton. The first time we see the mechs in action isn’t in an act of valor; they’re caught in an ambush, mid-flight. The carrier ship goes down — and so does Atlas, in her rig. Peyton’s imagination swirled at the possibilities, as evidenced in the finished sequence. “[The mech] would be tumbling, it would be spinning, it would be hit by debris. What would it be like to be trapped in that tin can? What would it sound like? What would it feel like? And once I get through that experience, well then, how can I up the ante? Well, what if I fall through black clouds, and I’m falling into basically a World War II dogfight, but with mechs and drones? [...] That’s just the first, I don’t know, 20 seconds of a two-minute sequence.</p>

<p data-characters="533" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The High Republic era of <em>Star Wars</em> is fascinating since it depicts a golden age of peace, long before the events of <em>The Skywalker Saga</em> that would see the Jedi culled and the galaxy dragged into seemingly never-ending war. And yet it faced its own hardships and galaxy threatening perils never been before in other <em>Star Wars</em> media. There are numerous novels that tell stories set during the 500 or so years the High Repulic era lasted for, and we’re here to help break down how you can read all of them and in the correct order.</p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">For context, the High Republic era is divided across three phases, with each one set during a specific period of time: <em>Light of the Jedi</em>, <em>Quest of the Jedi</em>, and <em>Trials of the Jedi</em>. Each phase isn’t wholly comprised of books (there are comics and audio dramas too), but we will be focusing on the novels.</p> <h2 id="h-phase-1-light-of-the-jedi" data-injectable="false">Phase 1: <em>Light of the Jedi</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><em>Light of the Jedi</em> ran from January 2021 to March 2022, and consists of two separate trilogies (one for adults and another for young adults), as well as a collection of short stories and a series of novels for children. There are a couple of books for very young children, but we’ll be leaving those ones out since they’re simple adaptations of two of the novels. Here is the recommended reading order:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li><em><strong>Starlight Stories</strong></em> (released December 6, 2022)—A collection of short stories originally published in <em>Star Wars</em> Insider throughout 2020 and 2021. <a href="https://titan-comics.com/c/1824-star-wars-insider-the-high-republic-starlight-stor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Titan Comics</a> has a list of retailers you can purchase this from. Be aware that the two-part story <em>Go Together</em> serves as a prologue and epilogue to the novel <em>Light of the Jedi</em>.</li> <li><em><strong>Light of the Jedi</strong></em> (released January 5, 2021)—The first in a trilogy of adult novels, this tells of the Great Disaster, an incident that involves a ship being destroyed while in hyperspace, which threatens to destroy a whole system. <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/light-of-the-jedi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Disney sells it physically and digitally</a>.</li> <li><em><strong>The Rising Storm</strong></em> (released June 29, 2021)—The sequel to <em>Light of the Jedi</em>, this covers the aftermath of the Great Disaster, which sees a Republic Fair attacked by the anarchic, viking-like Nihil.

It’s available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/race-to-crashpoint-tower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>.</li> <li><em><strong>The Fallen Star</strong></em> (released January 4, 2022)—The sequel to <em>The Rising Storm</em> and final entry in the adult novel trilogy, it sees the Nihil launch a strategy to wipe out the Jedi for good by destroying the Starlight Beacon, which is housing survivors and refugees of the Nihil’s previous attacks. It’s being sold at <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/668900/star-wars-the-fallen-star-the-high-republic-by-claudia-gray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Penguin Random House</a> and other such retailers.</li> <li><em><strong>Into the Dark</strong></em> (released February 2, 2021)—The first entry in a trilogy of books for young adults, it follows Padawan Reath Silas as he finds himself stranded on a mysterious and abandoned space station.

Another book written for kids, it’s available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/a-test-of-courage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>. Like <em>Into the Dark</em>, this is set before <em>The Rising Storm</em>.</li> <li><strong><em>Out of the Shadows</em></strong> (released July 27, 2021)—A follow-up to <em>Into the Dark</em>, this sees the return of Reath Silas as well as Vernestra Rwoh from <em>A Test of Courage</em>.

It’s available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/out-of-the-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a> and is set in-between <em>The Rising Storm</em> and <em>The Fallen Star</em>.</li> <li><strong><em>Mission to Disaster</em></strong> (released January 4, 2022)—The last kids book on the list, this one is set after <em>Out of the Shadows</em> and once again focuses on Vernestra Rwoh as she and her Padawan rescue a friend of theirs from the Nihil. You can buy it <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/mission-to-disaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>.</li> <li><strong><em>Midnight Horizon</em></strong> (released February 2, 2022)—Continuing on from <em>Out of the Shadows</em>, this not only brings back Reath Silas but also Ram Jomaram from <em>Race to Crashpoint Tower</em>. Together, the two investigate a suspected Nihil attack on the planet of Corellia.

 <h2 data-injectable="false">Phase 2: <em>Quest of the Jedi</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true"><em>Quest of the Jedi</em> ran from October 2022 to May 2023, and includes six novels and multiple short stories. This phase is actually set 150 years before the events of Phase 1, so you could start here if you wanted to. Here is the recommended reading order:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong><em>Quest for the Hidden City</em></strong> (released November 1, 2022)—This novel for kids sees Jedi Knight Silandra Sho and her apprentice Rooper Nitani searching for a team of missing explorers on a ravaged planet said to be haunted by mythical monsters.

When Marda meets a kindly Jedi Padawan named Kevmo Zink, she hopes to convince him of her beliefs. It’s available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/path-of-deceit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>.</li> <li><strong><em>Cataclysm</em></strong> (released April 4, 2023)—The direct sequel to <em>Convergence</em>, war is about to break out between the twin planets of Eiram and E’ronoh again, but there’s evidence to suggest the Path of the Open Hand is orchestrating the conflict. Both Gella Matai and Axel Greylark return for this, and it’s available via <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/710936/star-wars-cataclysm-the-high-republic-by-lydia-kang/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Penguin Random House</a> and other such retailers.</li> <li><strong><em>Path of Vengeance</em></strong> (released May 2, 2023)—Set during the events of <em>Cataclysm</em>, this story is also a follow-up to <em>Path of Deceit</em>. Marda Ro returns as she joins an expedition to the mysterious Planet X, while her cousin Yana teams up with her dead lover’s father to wrest control of the Path of the Open Hand from its leader, the Mother. This book is available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/path-of-vengeance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>.</li> <li><strong><em>Quest for Planet X</em></strong> (released April 4, 2023)—The second kids book sees Dass Leffbruk and Rooper Nitani (from <em>Quest for the Hidden City</em>), alongside new character Sky Graf, team up to locate Planet X. However, their mission results in them crossing paths with the Path of the Open Hand. It’s available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/quest-for-planet-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>.</li> <li><em><strong>Tales of Enlightenment</strong></em> (released March 19, 2024)—An anthology of short stories centered around a bar called Enlightenment. It is available <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/739016/star-wars-insider-the-high-republic-tales-of-enlightenment-by-written-by-george-mann/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Penguin Random House</a> and other such retailers.</li> </ul> <h2 data-injectable="false">Phase 3: <em>Trials of the Jedi</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false"><em>Trials of the Jedi</em> picks up after the events of Phase 1 and is currently still ongoing, since it began in September 2023 and is expected to conclude in 2025. So, this list of novels will likely need to be updated once the phase ends, and we have a better understanding of the chronology of it. For now, here is the recommended reading order:</p> <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="false"> <li><em><strong>Tales of Light &amp; Life</strong></em> (released September 5, 2023)—Another anthology of short stories, this is to help bridge the gap between Phase 1 and Phase 3 of the High Republic era, resolving some unexplained mysteries and sowing the seeds for future stories. It’s available <a href="https://books.disney.com/book/tales-of-light-and-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Disney</a>, but there’s a <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/tales-of-light-and-life-zoraida-c-rdova/1143348431?ean=9781368101288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Barnes and Noble exclusive version</a> that has a unique cover.</li> <li><strong><em>Escape from Valo</em></strong> (released January 30, 2024)—Padawan Ram Jomaram returns for a new adventure; one where he must help his people and a trio of young Jedi escape his home planet, which is under occupation by the Nihil. This is another story aimed at kids, and is available <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/727520/star-wars-the-high-republic-escape-from-valo-by-daniel-jose-older-alyssa-wong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Penguin Random House</a> and other such retailers.</li> <li><strong><em>Eye of Darkness</em></strong> (released November 14, 2023)—The first of Phase 3’s adult novels, this story takes place one year after <em>The Fallen Star</em>. The Nihil have built a barrier around the Outer Rim called the Stormwall; one that has left Jedi and entire planets trapped behind it while those outside attempt to breach the barrier. It’s available <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/714037/star-wars-the-eye-of-darkness-the-high-republic-by-george-mann/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Penguin Random House</a> and other such retailers.</li> <li><strong><em>Defy the Storm</em></strong> (released March 5, 2024)—Jedi Knight Vernestra Rwoh takes center stage once again as she heads into Nihil territory in search of her missing Padawan.

You can pre-order it <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/730631/star-wars-temptation-of-the-force-the-high-republic-by-tessa-gratton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Penguin Random House</a> and various other retailers.</li> <li><strong><em>Beware the Nameless</em></strong> (released August 27, 2024)—A follow-up to <em>Escape from Valo</em>, this junior novel will focus on a group of Jedi-in-training, alongside Ram Jomaram, as they try to overcome their fears and fight back against the Nameless. Pre-orders are not yet available.</li> <li><strong><em>Tears of the Nameless</em></strong> (released September 24, 2024)—Another Nameless heavy novel, returning favourite Reath Silas and Padawan Amadeo Azzazzo embark on their own mission to learn more about the eponymous creatures.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-chris-chibnall-episodes-of-doctor-who-ranked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="212" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Chris Chibnall is perhaps the least prolific writer of the current generation of <em>Doctor Who</em>, with only 38 episodes to his name as writer. However, what he lacks in numbers, he makes up for in epic storytelling.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Chibnall was the showrunner for most of the episodes featuring Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor, but he also wrote some great episodes featuring Matt Smith and David Tennant. I personally love Chibnall’s storylines and feel like they’re underrated, so here’s my top 10.</p> <h2 id="h-10-42" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. 42</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="140" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false">42 is the first episode of <em>Doctor Who </em>ever to be written by Chibnall and also the first mention of Saxon, who went on to be the next Master.</p> <p data-characters="470" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">This is an interesting episode because it’s the only one in the history of <em>Doctor Who</em> that has ever played out in real-time. The Doctor, played by a baby-faced David Tennant, has just 42 minutes to save the SS Pentallion from its imminent collision with a star. Not only is it full of tension, but the title of this episode is a reference to The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and, more specifically, the answer to the ‘what is meaning of life?’ in the book.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-9-rosa" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. Rosa</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">Co-written alongside Malorie Blackman, Rosa revolves around the story of Rosa Parks and her now historic refusal to give up her seat on the bus during times of racial segregation. When the Doctor and her companions discover that a ‘rehabilitated’ mass murderer is attempting to alter the course of history, they must throw themselves into action to maintain history and keep things on track.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="137" data-injectable="false">I personally love any episode which features a significant historical moment, so this one is definitely up there in my favorite episodes.</p> <h2 id="h-8-arachnids-in-the-uk" data-injectable="false"><strong>8. Arachnids in the UK</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">There aren’t many episodes of <em>Doctor Who</em> that will see me having to shield myself with a pillow between myself and the TV, but thanks to the fact that I have arachnophobia, Arachnids in the UK is definitely one of them.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">Despite that, though, I love this episode. Maybe it’s the adrenaline it causes to surge within me, but I think there’s more to it than that. This is the episode during which Graham, Yaz and Ryan decide to go on adventures with the Doctor, launching them into a whole universe of experiences they never dreamed of.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-7-dinosaurs-on-a-spaceship" data-injectable="false"><strong>7. Dinosaurs on a Spaceship</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Imagine you, as an ordinary person with no knowledge of aliens or interdimensional travel, were suddenly dragged into the world of <em>Doctor Who</em> and thrust into the center of the action. That’s essentially what happens to Rory’s Dad, Brian, during Dinosaurs on a Spaceship and his reactions during this episode perfectly reflect his bewilderment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">For anyone who’s also a fan of Harry Potter, you can’t help but imagine Mark Williams, who plays Brian, in his role as Arthur Weasley meeting<em> </em>The Doctor<em> </em>and traveling through space alongside Egyptian Queen Nefertiti. It’s such a weird crossover that nobody asked for, but I cannot express quite how much I love this episode. Plus, it’s Matt Smith, the perfect chaotic good, and he gives the perfect “he said the thing!” moment.</p>
 <h2 id="h-6-fugitive-of-the-judoon" data-injectable="false"><strong>6. Fugitive of the Judoon</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I love seeing places in beloved TV shows and being able to say, “hey, I’ve been there!” and Fugitive of the Judoon offered me that, being set in Gloucester. Besides that, though, this episode is an introduction to the Fugitive Doctor, who pops up in cameo roles moving forward and provides a small hint to the Doctor’s past long before it’s truly revealed in Timeless Children.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">On top of that, Captain Jack Harkness makes a return in this episode, and any episode featuring him is a winner in my book. Beware the lone Cyberman.</p> <h2 id="h-5-the-woman-who-fell-to-earth" data-injectable="false"><strong>5. The Woman Who Fell to Earth</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">As a female Whovian, I have to admit that I was both excited and apprehensive when I heard that the next Doctor would be played by Jodie Whittaker. However, as soon as she appeared on screen and took up the mantle, I knew that she would be incredible as the Doctor, and I was right.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">The Woman Who Fell to Earth is also our introduction to new companions – Graham, Yaz, and Ryan. Not only is this the inaugural outing of the first female Doctor, but it’s also a lesson in love, loss and perseverance.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-4-spyfall" data-injectable="false"><strong>4. Spyfall</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Spyfall was the two-part opening episode to season 12 of <em>Doctor Who</em>. These episodes see the return of the Master, this time played by Sacha Dhawan and a small but pivotal role played by Stephen Fry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">My favorite thing in these episodes, though, is the humor injected by Ryan and Graham trying to figure out their stolen spy gadgets. Seeing Bradley Walsh, who played Graham, dancing as he tries to figure out how his laser shoes work is one of my favorite moments from the entire season and never fails to put a smile on my face.</p> <h2 id="h-3-flux-war-of-the-sontarans" data-injectable="false"><strong>3. Flux: War of the Sontarans</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">This episode is a beloved favorite of mine. It’s got everything I could ever want from an episode of Doctor Who – humor (John Bishop is an excellent comedian, and seeing him hit a Sontaran over the head with a Wok is great), threat (the potential erasing of the history of Humanity and Yaz being held hostage by Azure and Swarm), and some history thrown in for good measure (the Doctor working alongside Mary Seacole during rewritten Crimean War).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">Honestly, all six episodes of the Flux storyline are amazing. Sadly, I can’t include all of them in my top 10 because that would be cheating, but if I were to recommend any Chris Chibnall episodes, it would be the ones that are part of Flux.</p> <h2 id="h-2-the-timeless-children" data-injectable="false"><strong>2. The Timeless Children</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">This episode has proved to be something of a dividing factor in fans. Some swear by it as a perfectly logical progression in Doctor Who canon, while others consider it a retcon, going back on the established lore that the Doctor only had a limited number of regenerations. However, whichever side of the fence you’re on, you can’t deny that Timeless Children is an incredibly hard-hitting episode.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">Seeing the Doctor trapped in the Matrix, with parts of her past that she doesn’t remember shown to her, it’s difficult to imagine how that must feel. But, her monologue aimed at the Master is inspiring to say the least:</p> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">“You think you’ve broken me? You’ll have to try harder than that. You’ve given me a gift. Of myself. You think that could destroy me? You think that makes me lesser? It makes me more. I contain multitudes more than I ever thought or knew. You want me to be scared of it because you’re scared of everything. But I am so much more than you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-the-power-of-the-doctor" data-injectable="false"><strong>1. The Power of the Doctor</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="414" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">The Power of the Doctor has everything – a questionable Dalek with a suspect plan, a sad goodbye to John Bishop as Dan, the return of the Master in the guise of early 19th century Russian mystic Rasputin alongside his Cybermasters, the return of former companions Tegan and Ace, and the glorious return of David Tennant as the 14th Doctor. I mean honestly, what more could you want from a <em>Doctor Who</em> episode?</p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">I have to admit, I don’t think any of the Masters have managed to come across quite as unhinged as Sasha Dhawan’s portrayal. He plays the part, and for a brief time, the part of the Doctor, with the perfect level of chaotic, overpowered insanity.</p> <p data-characters="144" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">And on top of all this, the first ever meeting of Companions Anonymous. What I wouldn’t give to be a fly on the wall in one of those meetings.</p>

<p>With the upcoming Summer Game Fest featuring exclusive news and reveals from the likes of Xbox, Ubisoft, Nintendo, Devolver, and others, we’re left wondering about Sony. They fully intend to host their usual State of Play; it’s just a matter of when. So, here’s what we know about the PlayStation showcase this summer!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-playstation-showcase-take-place">When Does the PlayStation Showcase Take Place?</h2>



<p>While there is no official date for the PlayStation Showcase, better known as State of Play, rumors indicate it will coincide with Days of Play, a massive sale focusing on PlayStation Plus and consoles, sometime this coming week. It’s said that Days of Play takes place on May 28, perhaps May 29, and the PlayStation Showcase would either launch at the same time or shortly after.</p>



<p>It doesn’t surprise us that Sony wants to host its showcase before everyone else, especially considering that Xbox will showcase its upcoming titles during Summer Game Fest in June.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-games-will-we-see-at-the-playstation-showcase">What Games Will We See at the PlayStation Showcase?</h2>



<p>There is no official confirmation about the numerous upcoming games we’ll see at the PlayStation Showcase. However, rumors indicate the following titles will make an appearance:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Concord</strong></li>



<li><strong>LEGO Horizon Adventures</strong></li>



<li><strong>Astro Bot</strong></li>



<li><strong>God of War Ragnarok (PC)</strong></li>



<li><strong>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</strong></li>



<li><strong>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Furthermore, we’re pretty sure there’s something new coming from one or more first-party studios over at PlayStation. Sony desperately wants to maintain its lead in the gaming space, and a new reveal or two could help cement its position!</p>



<hr>



<p>There’s much to look forward to this summer, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-ubisoft-forward-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Forward</a> occurring in early June. If you don’t want to miss a single game reveal, don’t forget to subscribe to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years.881541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Novellas have had an&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;resurgence over the past few years. Perhaps we have finally grown weary of the long, multi-book epic.&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;we&nbsp;just&nbsp;want bite-sized works to read in the middle of our busy lives. Whatever the case, I’m having a great time because of it.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">As a wizened elder in his&nbsp;mid-30s&nbsp;with a young child who would put and eat many dangerous things in his mouth if I wasn’t watching, novellas provide me with works&nbsp;that I&nbsp;can read in one sitting when given the chance. Beyond that, they also&nbsp;provide&nbsp;some of the best writing&nbsp;you’re likely to&nbsp;find anywhere.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">Novellas force authors to be more efficient with their writing, fighting a ton of work into a&nbsp;little&nbsp;space. As such, many novellas include some of the hands-down best writing on a technical level I’ve ever seen. Don’t believe me? Here are some of the best novellas from the past five years. Give one a read and tell me if I’m wrong. </p>
 <h2 id="h-what-moves-the-dead-by-t-kingfisher" data-injectable="false">What Moves the Dead&nbsp;by T. Kingfisher</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">This novella can be classified as several things, as it also ends up in horror sections in many stores. A retelling of Edgar Allen Poe’s <em>Fall of the House of Usher</em>, Kingfisher uses incredibly vivid descriptions and a tense atmosphere to create an unforgettable experience. It almost feels like cozy horror, with a slight sci-fi twist that I won’t spoil.</p>
 <p data-characters="498" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">It should be no surprise that Kingfisher’s novella reads well. She won the Hugo for another of her books, <em>Nettle &amp; Bone,</em> just last year. Her characters in this novella are&nbsp;wonderful, memorable, and fleshed out, with bits and pieces of their backstory scattered throughout like little lore nuggets. For fans of Poe, lovers of solid character, or even those who&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to dip their toes into horror without it being too horrific, <em>What Moves the Dead</em> is a fantastic choice.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Elder Race by Adrian Tchaikovsky</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">Fans of sci-fi novels should be aware of Tchaikovsky’s works. His <em>Children of Time</em> series has been a critical darling, winning award after award.&nbsp;Still, for those who want to give his works a try before starting his&nbsp;larger, more dense sagas, <em>Elder Race</em> would be a great place to start.</p>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">To set the stage, we’ll first discuss another author. Arthur C. Clarke, author of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>, penned an essay that listed his three laws of science fiction. Perhaps the most memorable is the third: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. <em>Elder Race</em> is that law turned directly into a novella.</p> <p data-characters="750" data-current-count="1089" data-injectable="true">The novella is a story told from two&nbsp;perspectives,&nbsp;one of a person who&nbsp;was told stories of a great wizard who lives high up on the mountain&nbsp;and once saved her people, whom she must now call upon again, and that wizard, who is really just an off-world researcher who puts himself into cryosleep for a decade or so before waking up to collect data with satellites and drones.&nbsp;Watching&nbsp;these characters try to interact, discuss technology, or even just how they perceive situations so&nbsp;differently&nbsp;is fascinating.&nbsp;Pair that with an endlessly&nbsp;cool&nbsp;sci-fi antagonist, if it can be called that, turns the novella into a two-perspective thriller that makes one consider more about the genres of sci-fi and fantasy and what they may have in common.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">This&nbsp;is How You Lose the Time War by Amal El-Mohtar and Max Gladstone</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon and Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">This&nbsp;is the most breathtakingly beautiful book on this list. It almost isn’t fair. The prose in this book is unmatched,&nbsp;a&nbsp;masterful work that should prove to many that sci-fi is a genre to be taken seriously in the literary world. Written by two authors, the novel takes the form of messages sent between two opposing agents in a time war, fighting to make their future the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="535" data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true">Calling them messages doesn’t even do them justice. These are notes left in the dust of dying stars, taunts&nbsp;etched into cave walls to be read thousands of years&nbsp;in the future. The weft and weave of these characters and their relationship as they move through time is stunning, touching, and unforgettable. I won’t say too much more, as to do so would just be me continuing to gush, but if you’re a reader who likes prose-heavy works&nbsp;from time to time, you won’t find a better one than this.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Empress of Salt and Fortune&nbsp;by Nhgi Vo</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">I&nbsp;straight up&nbsp;don’t understand how Vo accomplishes what she does with this one. I finished reading this and felt like I had just finished reading a worldbuilding epic, with a&nbsp;huge&nbsp;and expansive setting built and fleshed out that encompassed so much. Then I looked back and realized the book was only 120 pages long with a big font.</p>
 <p data-characters="742" data-current-count="742" data-injectable="true">For&nbsp;those who are still fans of fantasy epics but would like to try a novella, this is the go-to choice.&nbsp;The story follows an exiled Empress and her handmaiden, with all the information about the world provided to us either in the form of a story or second-hand as it&nbsp;is told&nbsp;to our characters. Despite this, the world Vo builds&nbsp;is well thought out, provided to us using such&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;means. The pace of this one will be fast, as the information has to&nbsp;be provided&nbsp;constantly as the story&nbsp;is told, but if you can hold on, this book achieves something that no other novella I have read&nbsp;does;&nbsp;matching the worldbuilding of any Sanderson or Jordan book in just over 100 short pages.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Ring Shout by P. Djèlí Clark</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Macmillan</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="757" data-current-count="1057" data-injectable="true"><em>Ring Shout</em> is cool, culturally informative, and historically revealing, making it an incredibly dense novella. But, despite this density, there’s still some time for good old demon slaying. <em>Ring Shout</em> takes place in 1922 America, where the movie <em>Birth of a Nation</em>, the movie that single-handedly sparked the rebirth of the KKK, is being shown across the nation. However, the members of the KKK aren’t always flesh and blood. Something that feeds on hate has traveled through the stars and found our planet, where they found enough hate to sustain them among the members of the KKK. In response, fighters&nbsp;are trained&nbsp;to take them down, seeking to put an end to both the KKK and whatever pushes them forward from the edges of our cosmos.</p>
 <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="false">Part look at the black cultural experience in early 1900s America, part action demon shooting devil slicing action, part Lovecraftian horror, <em>Ring Shout</em> tells&nbsp;an awesome&nbsp;tale with a deep level of historical credibility that brings it a step further. For those looking for a viewpoint into African American history and culture, who want a bit of revisionist history with some otherworldly horror mixed in, or&nbsp;just&nbsp;want to read about sick-ass freedom fighters taking a shotgun to some demons, <em>Ring Shout</em> will get you there.</p>

			<p>Gaming in general and AAA gaming in particular are going through a rough patch. While 2023 was a stellar year when it came to well-received AAA releases, the constant rise of game budgets (with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-facing-cuts-playstation-may-close-another-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored to have cost $300 million to make</a>) is literally eating into the margins of publishers and developers alike. In February 2024, Sony Chief Operating Officer (COO) and SIE interim Chairman Hiroki Totoki explicitly <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-wants-to-improve-operating-profit-with-a-more-aggressive-pc-first-party-games-release-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> a more aggressive multiplatform release plan on PC would have to be enacted to improve the operating profit.</p>
<p>For its part, Microsoft, through Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, has <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-is-confident-in-xboxs-future-but-stresses-the-need-to-find-new-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stated</a> that the industry needs to find new customers and get back on a growth trajectory. Meanwhile, Microsoft has started releasing some of its exclusive games on PlayStation and Nintendo Switch consoles, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-announcement-rumor-xbox-games-showcase-medieval-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more possibly on the way.</a></p>
<p>Amidst all these shifts, the hardest part has been witnessing the record-breaking number of layoffs in 2024. AAA developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riot</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-lays-off-5-of-its-workforce-cancels-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SEGA</a>, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-announces-restructuring-program-crystal-dynamics-says-its-not-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Embracer Group</a> have laid off many thousands of employees to reduce costs. Most recently, Microsoft also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed</a> three internal Bethesda studios: Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games.</p>
<p>We recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xcoms-jake-solomon-qa-building-a-narrative-driven-life-sim-game-at-midsummer-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had the chance to interview Jake Solomon</a>, who worked for over 22 years at Firaxis Games on AAA franchises like Sid Meier's Civilization, XCOM, and Marvel's Midnight Suns. While the main topic was his new studio, which is working on a narrative-driven life simulation game, we also asked his opinion on what's happening in the industry.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry following all the layoffs? Is the doom and gloom warranted?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Honestly, it’s terrible. Too many people have lost their jobs, and it’s incredibly frustrating. It’s been nice to actually hire folks these last few months. The last few months have been terrible for a lot of folks, and hopefully, as Midsummer grows, we can provide a great studio home for some of them.</em><br>
<em>It’s a tough market right now. There are these incredible, over-the-top AAAA games that are impossible to follow. You also see amazing AA niche games that are more focused and successful. AAA sits in this awkward middle ground where it’s very expensive but hard to cover costs.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>In many cases, we've seen budgets double or triple between one installment and the next one in a series. Should developers and publishers rein in budgets to avoid these mass layoffs?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>I’m wary of telling other folks how to run their business. But I can tell you what we’re doing at</em><br>
<em>Midsummer. We want to make games in a small, collaborative atmosphere. We want to remain</em><br>
<em>independent. All of those things require that we stay relatively small, act and spend our money</em><br>
<em>in a sustainable manner, and make careful decisions on how we produce our games.</em></p>
<p>Do you believe AAA gaming to be in real trouble, or is this just a temporary phase? Let us know in the comments and through the poll below.</p>
<div id="democracy-1339" data-opts="{&quot;ajax_url&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/wccftech.com\/wp-admin\/admin-ajax.php&quot;,&quot;pid&quot;:1339,&quot;max_answs&quot;:0,&quot;answs_max_height&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,&quot;anim_speed&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;line_anim_speed&quot;:1500}"><p><strong>Is AAA Gaming in real trouble?</strong></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-dnd-warforged-5e-subraces-classes-and-stats-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-dnd-warforged-5e-subraces-classes-and-stats-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Warforged were introduced to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>as part of the Eberron setting, but players with cooperative DMs have pushed them into just about every kind of campaign – probably because being a robot is awesome.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">The Warforged are living constructs, and in Eberron, they were originally created to be soldiers. Since they have a wide range of skills, Warforged have taken on other roles over time, and they can fit into just about any class. There’s almost no downside to making your character a Warforged, and as long as you know what you’re getting into, you can become the heroic robot of your dreams.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eberron Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-what-traits-do-warforged-get" data-injectable="false">What traits do Warforged get? </h2> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">Before coming to 5E in <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, the Warforged were released as an Unearthed Arcana – essentially a beta for <em>D&amp;D</em>. There are some differences between the UA version of the race and the one that’s now part of the official ruleset, but Warforged is still an incredibly powerful canvas that players can use to create all kinds of different characters. Here are the base stats and traits for a Warforged character:&nbsp;</p>
 <ul data-found-items="10" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"> <li>Ability Score Increase: Warforged get +2 to Constitution and +1 to any other ability score.</li> <li>Age: Most Warforged are between two and thirty years old, but the creatures are immune to magical aging effects and are, in general, immortal.</li> <li>Alignment: Warforged usually default to a lawful neutral alignment, but their alignment is often dictated by their creator.– of the beings with which they served.</li> <li>Size: Medium&nbsp;</li> <li>Speed: 30&nbsp;</li> <li>Constructed Resilience: Warforged have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned and resistance against poison damage. They also are immune to disease and don’t need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.&nbsp;</li> <li>Sentry’s Rest: Instead of a typical long rest, Warforged must remain inactive for six hours. They can’t move, but they also don’t lose consciousness and retain the ability to hear and see.&nbsp;</li> <li>Integrated Protection: Warforged get a +1 to Armor Class. They can only wear armor that they are proficient with, and to put on or remove armor, they must spend 1 hour incorporating it into their construct bodies. As a nice trade-off, no one can remove a living Warforged’s armor against their will.&nbsp; Your body has built-in defensive layers, which can be enhanced with armor.</li> <li>Specialized Design: Warforged get one skill proficiency and one tool proficiency of your choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> <li>Languages: Warforged can speak common and one other language of your choice.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What are the Warforged subraces?&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">In <em>D&amp;D </em>5E there actually are no Warforged subraces in the official version of the race. Warforged are strong enough on their own that they don’t really need the support of a subrace, but there were some different subrace options when Warforged were still just an Unearthed Arcana.&nbsp;</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"> <li>Envoy – These were meant to be the multipurpose Warforged and got +1 to two different ability scores.&nbsp;</li> <li>Juggernaut – These were the clear melee Warforged and got +2 to Strength.</li> <li>Skirmisher – These were the roguish Warforged and got +2 to Dexterity.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">If you have an extremely cooperative DM, you might be able to convince them to let you play the Unearthed Arcana version of the Warforged. Don’t worry about it, though, because the official version is plenty flexible enough to fit any type of character you might want to build.</p> <figure data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eberron Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What are the strongest classes for a Warforged?&nbsp;</h2> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">Warforged is one of the least restrictive races in all of <em>D&amp;D </em>5E. The stats and features that come with being a Warforged are broadly useful, which means you can slot a robot into just about any class. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">The +2 boost to Constitution means that Warforged make excellent melee characters, and you can’t go wrong with a Fighter or a Barbarian. At the same time, every character is going to benefit from more Constitution, so you can use that +1 to an ability score as a way of shaping your Warforged into a caster.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">Do you want your Warforged to be a misguided wizard’s construct with high Intelligence? Or maybe a Warlock that found life thanks to a deal with a devil? My personal favorite build is Warforged Druid, which lets me live out my inner magical Transformer fantasies. In the game, as in the story, Warforged are meant to be shaped by their creators.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-furiosa-went-from-a-scrapped-anime-series-to-a-big-screen-blockbuster/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-furiosa-went-from-a-scrapped-anime-series-to-a-big-screen-blockbuster<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="419" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga </em>from director George Miller has finally premiered on the big screen, with emphasis on <em>finally</em>. The latest entry in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">weird and wild <em>Mad Max </em>universe</a>, starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, has been in development for some time, but the project wasn’t initially planned as a movie. Rather, Miller envisioned it as an anime series almost a decade ago, only for this idea to crumble.</p> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">The story of Furiosa dates back to the creation of<em> Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, which itself was worked on for decades. Per Miller during a chat with <a href="https://www.timeout.com/film/max-max-fury-roads-george-miller-on-his-post-apocalyptic-classics-and-mel-gibson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Time Out</a>, Mel Gibson, the star of the original <em>Mad Max</em> trilogy, was even considered to return as Max Rockatansky at one point. </p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">Come the mid-2010s, however, Miller’s first <em>Mad Max</em> title since 1985’s <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> became a reality with Tom Hardy as the lead. The film also received a tie-in comic, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a <em>Mad Max</em> video game</a>, and a tale starring one of the feature’s new characters, Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa, was being laid out.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">Miller revealed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> that Furiosa’s story was actually completed before <em>Fury Road</em> even started shooting, recalling, “So we wrote a story about Furiosa from the time she was taken as a child, as she refers to in<em> Fury Road</em>, until she became the Imperator Furiosa. That ended up as a full screenplay, with concept art and so on.” </p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">With that, he decided the anime route was the best option to bring Furiosa’s origin to life. <em>Fury Road</em> concept artist Maeda was then enlisted to create the show’s aesthetic. Unfortunately, with the delay of <em>Fury Road</em>, the Furiosa anime was put on the back burner and eventually scrapped entirely. </p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">Miller told Polygon he felt “there was no point in making an anime” due to <em>Fury Road</em>‘s halt. In time, some of <a href="https://comicbookmovie.com/action/mad-max/artwork-from-the-cancelled-mad-max-furiosa-anime-finds-its-way-online-a122059#gs.9urpik" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Maeda’s artwork</a> made it online, giving fans an idea of what could’ve been. Meanwhile, Miller maintained that a Furiosa-centric story should come to fruition, and come to fruition it did. </p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">After a dispute regarding unpaid salaries on <em>Fury Road</em> was resolved, Miller began developing the ill-fated Furiosa anime as a movie. He overhauled the plot entirely, recast Taylor-Joy for the lead instead of de-aging Theron, and assembled a supporting cast of franchise veterans and newcomers alike. It was a long, winding road to get here, but at last, Furiosa has a gritty, post-apocalyptic spotlight all her own.</p>
 <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="63" data-injectable="false"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> is now playing exclusively in theaters.</p>

<p data-characters="465" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">No one arguing in good faith could reasonably claim <em>Diablo 4’s</em> new season, Loot Reborn, hasn’t been a massive boon for the game’s longevity. The game reached a new all-time peak of over 28,000 players on Steam over six months after its initial launch thanks to this season’s major overhauls to loot systems, upgrades, class balance, and more. With all this knob-turning and sweeping modification, however, comes a new problem: game balance. </p> <h2 id="h-diablo-4-is-now-too-easy" data-injectable="false">Diablo 4 is now too easy</h2> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">When I say game balance, I don’t mean how one class performs compared to others. Gone are the days of Barbarian and Sorcerer supremacy: now every class has a nearly equally-busted collection of fantastic builds. No, I mean game balance of the player-versus-enemy variety. The game is, for the majority of an average player’s experience, easy to a degree that borders on braindead.</p> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="906" data-injectable="true">This isn’t an unexpected result of objective increases to player power and agency <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-tempering-guide/">in the form of Tempering</a> and the new, absolutely bonkers affixes it brings. Even just throwing a few build-appropriate affixes on your weapons will give you more felt power than ten or fifteen levels would. But still, in an effort to preserve “fun,” it seems the team more than slightly overshot the mark, resulting in a leveling experience that feels about as frictional as a freshly-Zamboni’d hockey rink. </p>
 <h2 id="h-even-endgame-content-is-a-breeze" data-injectable="false">Even endgame content is a breeze</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">I knew there was a slightly more serious problem than the game being a little too easy when I was face-rolling Capstone Dungeons (required to progress to the next World Tier difficulty) upwards of 20 levels earlier than I should have been just to <em>feel </em>something. Even then, when I’d progressed to a zone where enemies’ levels displayed an ominous “you’re not supposed to do this yet” red hue, I was cutting them down all the same. </p>
 <p data-characters="644" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">To be fair, blasting enemies in the dozens, hundreds, and thousands <em>is </em>fun.. for a little while. But after reaching level 80 or so my eyes are starting to glaze over every time I enter the game, run headfirst into the Helltide after popping a Profane Mindcage and utterly decimate every foe with the press of a button. Even World Bosses die in a matter of seconds. There’s no longer a measuring stick for player power <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/">besides the endgame Pit</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-access-the-pit-in-diablo-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a>because from the moment your build starts to function until the moment enemies start one-shotting you in the Pit, the amount of pushback you’ll be getting from foes will remain around zero. </p>
 <h2 id="h-the-diablo-4-grind-is-no-longer-rewarding" data-injectable="false">The Diablo 4 grind is no longer rewarding</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot from Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="683" data-current-count="983" data-injectable="false"><em>Diablo 4</em> is primed to be the perfect “brain-off” game. Action RPGs in general are my go-to “second screen” games that I use to catch up on YouTube videos which may or may not have recently included a four hour essay on the failed <em>Star Wars</em> hotel. But the “brain-off” properties should probably come after you’ve spent some time crafting a build, earning great loot, and upgrading your character until your mere presence causes rooms of enemies to explode instantly. By offering this fantasy almost immediately, players are being robbed of the draw of action RPGS entirely: to start out annoyingly underpowered and eventually becoming a God. </p>

<p data-characters="442" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Upon acquiring Lucasfilm, Disney executives immediately jumped into George Lucas’ makeshift Death Star to annihilate the cherished Expanded Universe, a collection of media spanning decades that had carried the torch for Star Wars stories between films. Ever since the acquisition, what we used to call Expanded Universe has become “Legends,” which is the Disney equivalent of that farm that all beloved animals get to go to.</p> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">The change was an attempt to streamline Star Wars by removing any question about the canonicity of these fan-favorite stories. Fans are still irate about it today, but you have to admit, it was beyond bonkers sometimes. If you think the prequels showed <em>Star Wars</em> at its weirdest, then it’s time you have a look at the absolutely wildest characters and creatures present in the now-defunct Expanded Universe.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-dovin-basals" data-injectable="false">Dovin Basals</h2> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="791" data-injectable="true">The writers of the Expanded Universe wanted to explore a conflict outside the light and dark sides of the force, so they came up with the Yuuzhan Vong, a species so barbaric that the force wants nothing to do with them. The point of the force is that it surrounds and permeates everything that is, so the inception of the Yuuzhan Vong seems to indicate that some writers don’t understand their own material, but the Yuuzhan Vong still aren’t dumb enough to feature on this list. </p>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">What we need to focus on are the Dovin Basals, a tick-shaped plant lifeform that the Yuuzhan Vong uses as a weapon because of their gravity-controlling powers. Yes, instead of using the Force, the Yuuzhan Vong employ the Dovin Basals to create protective and offensive gravity fields. That seems weird enough as is, but these wacky things have a huge impact on the Expanded Universe. </p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">You see, even though Chewbacca is alive and well throughout the sequel trilogy, he was dead for a very long time in the Expanded Universe because the Dolvin Basals used their power to have a whole ass <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&amp;q=chewbacca+death&amp;sourceid=opera&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">moon crash on top of poor Chewie.</a></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-of-the-weirdest-and-wackiest-characters-in-the-star-wars-universe/Let's%20have%20a%20look%20at%20the%20absolutely%20wildest%20characters%20and%20creatures%20present%20in%20the%20now%20defunct%20Expanded%20Universe."></a><figcaption>Image via Twitter</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Soon Bayts</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">At first, you’ll likely sense nothing wacky about Soon Bayts, a completely normal Jedi who only shows up in the <em>Star Wars</em> comics. It’s only when you realize that he’s a Jedi Master that things begin to get weird. I mean, he remains completely dependable when it comes to his ways in the light side of the force, but it’s just a bit weird that you have a character who goes by Jedi Master Bayts. </p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">Are we looking at a Freudian slip that tells us more about the infamous Jedi celibacy than we ever asked about? Not really. Bayts was created by writer Randy Stradley, who was just trying to play a prank on his editor, but it made it through to publication. In the end, Bayts is killed by General Grievous, who takes his lightsaber as a trophy but probably wouldn’t if he knew what we now know.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Nobot, the possible murderbot</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true">When you watch <em>Star Wars Episode 1</em>, your eye might catch Nobot, a droid that bears a striking resemblance to C-3PO. He’s in that movie as no more than an unwittingly confusing easter egg, but the Expanded Universe decided to give Nobot a background worthy of a horror movie.</p>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">The EU speaks of Nobot as somewhat of a cursed entity, a droid followed by the dark side or actual evil spirits. He’s constantly roaming Tatooine for reasons unknown and, despite being just a useless protocol droid, always manages to find his way back to Mos Espa.</p> <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">A vendor claims that Nobot repeatedly plays the recording of a woman pleading for her life right before she gets killed, which leads many to believe Nobot is the perpetrator.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="KOTOR Nago Sadows Tomb easiest/simplest way to kill the Terentatek" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPgKZX8z9Qs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><br>Tarentateks</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">The Tarentateks feel like a knee-jerk answer to someone who claimed that the Rancor just wasn’t scary enough. Instead of big and lethal, the Tarentateks are a type of creature mostly immune to Force powers, something Obi-Wan clearly states in the first movie that influences all things in the universe. </p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">The worst part about the Tarentateks is that you can’t just read about them and go, “phew, good thing I only have to read about them and not actually fight that dumb made-up thing.” You have to face a few of them in <em>Knights Of The Old Republic</em>. They suck so much that if you search for the words Tarentatek and <em>KOTOR</em>, most results will be about ways to cheese these things — like the clip above.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Just plain ol’ zombies</h2> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Remember when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-zombie-games-of-all-time-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zombies</a> were the biggest thing in the world? <em>Star Wars</em> needed a piece of that pie, so it shamelessly introduced actual zombies in the Expanded Universe canon. </p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">What the hell is one of the most unapologetically R-rated monsters in cinema doing in the most PG galaxy in entertainment? Undead Stormstoopers make only a few appearances in Star Wars, and are explained as being victims of the battle on Hoth who were reanimated by a virus. </p> <figure data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via the Star Wars official website</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">BoSheck</h2> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">One of the Expanded Universe’s best aspects is its ability to flesh out random characters in unnecessarily ridiculous ways. BoSheck is present in the first film of the original trilogy, but he’s just some guy who is only on screen for a few seconds, does nothing important, and then vanishes forever. </p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true">In the Expanded Universe, however, BoSheck is both Force-sensitive and so good of a pilot that he managed to beat Han Solo’s Kessel run record. One’d have thought that these skills probably should’ve been put to use in, say, destroying the Death Star instead of having a kid do it.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">R5-D4, aka skippy the Jedi droid</h2> <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">If you think Bosheck’s secret backstory is dumb, wait til you get a load of R5-D4. Much like BoSheck, R5-D4 also shows up in <em>Star Wars</em>, and he actually does something — he dies. R5-D4 is that droid whose head circuit explodes for no discernible reason — as far as you know.</p> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">If you look into the Expanded Universe lore, however, you’ll find out that his head got fried because this droid was somehow Force-sensitive. He predicted that having his brains explode <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Skippy_the_Jedi_Droid">right there and then</a> was the only way to change the fate of the galaxy for the better.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Lak Sivrak, aka Wolf Man in the cantina</h2> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">I’m kind of cheating because this guy shows up in the original cut of <em>Star Wars</em>, but he was cut by George Lucas for the 1997 Special Edition, so he probably ended up in the same waste disposal facility as the rest of the Expanded Universe. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">There’s nothing wrong about this Sivrak. He’s just chilling at the cantina. I just find it really funny that Lucas must have looked at this guy and wondered if people would notice that this actor was clearly wearing a leftover werewolf suit costume and realize that he clearly didn’t belong in <em>Star Wars.</em> </p> <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">Werewolves would be a pretty cool concept to explore in a universe featuring a bunch of planets with lots of moons. Sivrak’s erasure shows a bit of Mr. Lucas’s lack of vision.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Beldorion</h2> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true">When not making bonkers choices, the Expanded Universe tends to just repeat what people already seem to enjoy about <em>Star Wars</em>. This means a lot of Hutts tend to be crime lords even though they’re surprisingly easy to kill, which is rather problematic when you’re surrounded by murderers 24/7. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Repetition isn’t the problem with Beldorion, though. He’s not a crimelord, but a Jedi. Yes, I know that <em>Empire</em> <em>Strikes Back</em> taught us that even seemingly harmless and mad creatures can be great Jedi. Still, the prequels did show us that Yoda was also immensely skilled with the lightsaber. So, I’d really like you to imagine a Jabba-like creature attempting to perform some crazy spin moves with their saber on.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wookiepedia</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">C-3PX</h2> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">It’s the final entry, so I can finally admit that I absolutely loathe C-3PO and get as little blowback from that as possible. I like that creepy, useless thing less than I like Jar Jar. Still, if that helps, there’s one thing I like even less, which is attempts to make C-3PO look badass. That’s when C-3PX comes in. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">C-3PX is a droid that looks just like C-3PO but is also equipped with guns. He was even employed by Darth Maul as an assassin at some point. Getting a protocol droid that is ill-equipped for any sort of physical activity to be your assassin is dumber than having Anakin build C-3PO to help his mother around the house.</p> <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="false">If you’re in the market for a “badass” droid, you’re better off with BioWare’s efforts and the very vile <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-characters-in-star-wars-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HK-47, the murderbot</a> who views all organic beings as meatbags.</p>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">During today’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/indie-live-expo-when-where-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indie Live Expo 2024</a>, <em>Hotel Barcelon</em>a, a game in development with the renowned creators Swery and Suda51 studios, received a brand new trailer and a gameplay demo that details exactly what you can expect when the game launches later this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. </p> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true"><em>Hotel Barcelona</em> got its <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hotel-barcelona-swery-suda51-new-trailer-tokyo-game-show-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first trailer late last year</a>, dividing fans with its intriguing concept that’s juxtaposed by harsh visuals that would look more at home on the Nintendo Wii. The game is the result of an original idea by Suda51 but written and directed by Swery. The concept of the game is as bonkers as you might expect from the creators of <em>Lollipop Chainsaw</em>, <em>The Good Life</em>, and <em>No More Heroes 3</em>. It’s a time-looping horror action title where you face off against serial killers and aliens inspired by slasher films. </p>
 <h2 id="h-you-can-discover-exactly-what-hotel-barcelona-is-by-watching-the-gameplay-demo-now" data-injectable="false">You can discover exactly what <em>Hotel Barcelona</em> is by watching the gameplay demo now</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="INDIE Live Expo 2024.5.25 (English)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMEflpy4t0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">You can check out <em>Hotel Barcelona</em>‘s new trailer in the Indie Live Expo stream VOD above from <strong>4:19:00</strong> to get a sense of what this game is about before heading to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286600/HOTEL_BARCELONA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> and wishlisting it if it looks like your cup of tea. While we know it’s going to be released this year, there’s no official release window right now. </p>
 <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">In <em>Hotel Barcelona</em>, up to four ghost characters can help you each time you die and jump back into the world. These characters are based on your past runs, but the enemy placement in the world will change every time you jump in, meaning you’ve got to work with yourself if you want to beat the game. Protagonist Justine has an insane serial killer living inside of her, and she’s got to slash her way through every serial killer in the US who has all gathered at a luxurious hotel just outside of Pittsburgh.</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The style on show in the gameplay demo is amazing, pulling together Suda51’s comic book and video game visuals with classic slasher movie posters. Every boss is an experience packed with a character inspired by some sort of villain, be it a killer alien or a murderous baseball player. </p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">The game looks like it’ll subvert every expectation you have for it, with giant metal sharks, a huge alien monster, and superpowers that transform the player character into a raging monster that clears the field. I love the 2.5D view, and I think it’s a great fit with the incredible Metroidvanias we’ve had in 2024 so far, such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tales-of-kenzera-zau/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">The most recent game I’ve played from either creator behind <em>Hotel Barcelona</em> is <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-good-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Life</a></em>, a slice-of-life title about a journalist who can also transform into an animal to help solve problems around the village they’ve become trapped in. I’m looking forward to jumping into this demo today to get another taste of that zany style that you just can’t get anywhere else. </p>

  <p id="oV4CNC">When game director Hidetaka Miyazaki tried to explain his then-new game <em>Demon’s Souls</em> to the masses, he chose another game as its reference point: the classic, Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired role-playing game <em>Wizardry</em>.</p>
<p id="Fj75S0">FromSoftware wanted to “make the fun and charms of a classic RPG interesting all over again with the latest technology at hand,” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20121017051415/http://www.1up.com/news/sony-reveals-demon-souls">Miyazaki told Famitsu in 2008</a>. “Having long weapons bump into walls, lighting the area in real time with the torch in your hand [...] taking the things you did through menus in <em>Wizardry</em> and letting you carry them out in real life.”</p>
<p id="lay03u">Miyazaki wasn’t the only one thinking this. <em>Wizardry</em> — alongside another RPG powerhouse of the early ’80s, <em>Ultima</em> — has been cited by dozens of Japanese game developers as a major influence on their defining work. That includes Final Fantasy creator <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2017/06/29/hironobu-sakaguchi-talks-about-his-admiration-for-dragon-quest-and-upcoming-projects/?sh=26cc9d3d15b5">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a>, Dragon Quest creator <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/03/dragon-quest-creator-yuji-horii-accepts-lifetime-achievement-award-at-22nd-annual-game-developers-choice-awards">Yuji Horii</a>, and <em>Secret of Mana</em> game director <a href="https://shmuplations.com/secretofmana/">Koichi Ishii</a>. <em>Wizardry</em> and <em>Ultima</em> defined the formula of menu-driven, turn-based RPGs for decades to come, inspiring developers to adhere to its template and to break free from it.</p>
<p id="YMZtCY">Thanks to the newly released <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em>, it’s now very easy to experience what dazzled dungeon-crawling fans of the early ’80s. <em>Wizardry:</em> <em>Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> is a modernized overhaul of the original Apple II game, with gorgeous new 3D visuals and dozens of quality-of-life improvements that make <em>Wizardry</em> more easily playable — but by no means <em>easy</em> — in 2024.</p>

<p id="nu7YRJ">The new <em>Wizardry</em> serves as a streamlined entry point into a game designed for a very different kind of player, someone who would bash their head against the RPG’s unexplained rules and rudimentary graphics to savor its authentic D&amp;D-style, party-based gameplay. The new version is lavishly repainted with graphics that ooze the atmosphere of classic tabletop RPG book art and vintage <em>Wizardry</em> magazine covers. It also makes the stats and percentages more visible, explaining why you might have failed an encounter with a party of angry kobold skeletons, slimes, or bushwackers. There’s even a rich bestiary that provides new lore entries on the game’s 101 monsters and other menaces.</p>
<p id="6I8wic">Running underneath the hood of the <em>Wizardry</em> remaster is the game’s Apple II source code, restored by developer Digital Eclipse from the original Pascal programming language. All the dice rolls and random encounters defined by classic <em>Wizardry</em>’s rules are present in the new version.</p>
<p id="XZbEoI">Alongside that reverent attention to the original game rules, Digital Eclipse has inserted a long list of quality-of-life features into its new <em>Wizardry</em>. You can easily put together a party of adventurers with the click of a button — or you can craft your team of fighters, thieves, priests, and mages completely from scratch. There’s a lovely graphical interface that lets you easily jump from the inn, where your characters rest and level up, to the shop, where there’s actual useful information about the weapons and armor you can buy, to the maze, where you’ll do your perilous, first-person dungeon crawling. </p>

<p id="kUgQ1Z"><em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> does a wonderful job of letting players have it both ways; Digital Eclipse lets you choose which streamlining features you want to keep and which you don’t. The remaster even provides the option of different maze layouts, letting you choose between either the PC version or the 8-bit console versions. (You can also opt to see the original Apple II visual running in the corner of the screen, so you can regularly marvel at 40 years of graphical evolution.)</p>
<p id="SE1dqL">During my first playthrough of the remaster, I defaulted to the most streamlined version of <em>Wizardry</em> and soon found that those changes definitely do not make the game a coddling experience. <em>Wizardry</em> remains immensely difficult, even in its new form. I frequently lost members of my party after overextending them by pushing us all further and further into the maze. But the mysteries and chance encounters of <em>Wizardry</em> beckon you to do that — to explore, die, and try again. And maybe recover the corpses of the previous team of unlucky adventurers that you sent to their deaths in the maze earlier in the game.</p>
<p id="FK1Uhh">Digital Eclipse’s <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</em> is worth playing, particularly if you’re a fan of classic Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games and want to learn more about their inspiration. As part of Digital Eclipse’s growing library of beautifully restored historical games (<em>Atari 50</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/7/3612408/karateka-remake-jordan-mechner-modernize-classic-story"><em>The Making of Karateka</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24101970/llamasoft-jeff-minter-story-review"><em>Llamasoft: The Jeff Minter Story</em></a>), it’s a new way to experience a classic game in a form that was clearly developed with reverence for the source material.</p>

<p>Summertime brings sunshine and opportunities to get outdoors for most people. For players like us, however, it’s a time to sit down in a cool room, shades drawn over the windows, and watch developers and publishers reveal upcoming games and information. To that end, when is Ubisoft Forward?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-ubisoft-forward-event">When is the Ubisoft Forward Event?</h2>



<p>Following <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-xbox-showcase-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Ubisoft Forward takes place on June 10. You can watch the upcoming gaming event live via broadcast—likely on YouTube and Twitch—with news about upcoming games from the Ubisoft offices worldwide.</p>



<p>While we don’t have much longer to wait for Ubisoft Forward to kick off, we’re not entirely sure what the publisher plans to showcase this year beyond a handful of known projects. Here’s hoping they have a reveal or two to impress the crowd!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-is-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-what-will-we-see-at-ubisoft-forward-2024">What Will We See at Ubisoft Forward 2024?</h2>



<p>We know we’ll see a gameplay reveal from Assassin’s Creed Shadows at Ubisoft Forward, alongside more about Star Wars Outlaws, which launches on August 30. However, everything else remains up in the air. There’s no official confirmation about most projects—past, present, or future—but Ubisoft looks to be having a solid year with a handful of releases, and they’ll likely want to capitalize on those.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Star Wars Outlaws</strong></li>



<li><strong>XDefiant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rainbow Six: Siege</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skull &amp; Bones</strong></li>



<li><strong>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Personally, I hope we get the opportunity to explore upcoming content for Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, definitely more about Star Wars Outlaws, and, lastly, a reveal for The Division 3. Unfortunately, I highly doubt we’ll see that last one—not so soon, following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-has-canceled-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of The Division Heartland</a>!</p>

If you’re lucky, you can get several that spawn close to each other and initiate a chain reaction. Otherwise, watch your dice multiplier, changing it as you approach pickup tiles to make the most out of the event.</p>

<p data-characters="508" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The turn structure of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is one of the many key features that set it apart from other TCGs. There are five turn phases within MTG, each with its own steps and restrictions that players must follow. When it isn’t their turn, players can react to their opponents’ spells or trigger abilities that have the potential to drastically change the board. Oftentimes, it can feel like “your” turns aren’t entirely yours– especially when playing against <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/">those pesky Control decks</a>.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">This guide will detail the who, what, and when of each phase so that you know what can and can’t be done as both an <strong>Active</strong> and <strong>Non-Active Player</strong>.&nbsp;</p> <div data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false"><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#0-two-important-terms-in-mtg-" data-level="2">Two important terms in MTG</a><ul><li><a href="#1-active-player-priority-" data-level="3">Active Player priority</a></li><li><a href="#2-the-stack-" data-level="3">The Stack</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#3-beginning-phase" data-level="2">Beginning Phase</a><ul><li><a href="#4-untap-step" data-level="3">Untap step</a></li><li><a href="#5-upkeep-step" data-level="3">Upkeep step</a></li><li><a href="#6-draw-step-" data-level="3">Draw step&nbsp;</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#7-first-pre-combat-main-phase" data-level="2">First (Pre-Combat) Main Phase</a></li><li><a href="#8-combat-phase" data-level="2">Combat Phase</a><ul><li><a href="#9-beginning-of-combat" data-level="3">Beginning of Combat</a></li><li><a href="#10-declare-attackers" data-level="3">Declare attackers</a></li><li><a href="#11-declare-blockers" data-level="3">Declare blockers</a></li><li><a href="#12-combat-damage" data-level="3">Combat Damage</a></li><li><a href="#13-end-of-combat" data-level="3">End of Combat</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#14-second-post-combat-main-phase" data-level="2">Second (Post-Combat) Main Phase</a></li><li><a href="#15-ending-phase" data-level="2">Ending Phase</a><ul><li><a href="#16-end-step" data-level="3">End step</a></li><li><a href="#17-cleanup-step" data-level="3">Cleanup step</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#h-mtg-cards-that-interact-with-the-turn-structure" data-level="2">MTG Cards that interact with the turn structure</a></li></ul></div> <h2 id="0-two-important-terms-in-mtg-" data-injectable="false"><strong>Two important terms in MTG</strong></h2> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">Before we dive into the intricacies of each phase of a turn, let’s go over a couple of terms that will make the rest of this guide easier to understand.</p> <h3 id="1-active-player-priority-" data-injectable="false"><strong>Active Player priority</strong></h3> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="820" data-injectable="true">Each turn, the Active Player priority is passed to the player whose turn it is. An easy way to think about Active Player priority is that the Active Player has the “right-of-way.” In MTG, we refer to this prioritization as <strong>APNAP</strong> (Active Player, then Non-Active Player). The Active Player’s actions or triggers during their turn are the first to be included on the <strong>Stack</strong>, followed by the responses and triggers of the Non-Active Players. Priority is passed in this order through all phases of the turn.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="2-the-stack-" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Stack</strong></h3> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">The Stack is often referred to as the most complicated aspect of MTG—I won’t argue with that; it deserves an entire guide of its own. But to understand the various turn phases and steps in MTG, a baseline comprehension of the Stack is all that is necessary.</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true"> <li>The Stack is a persistent zone that isn’t physically represented on the board.&nbsp;</li> <li>The Stack’s duty is to maintain the order of the actions so that spells are resolved appropriately. You could think of the Stack as the Order of Operations in math.</li> <li>Active Player priority is an important part of determining how the Stack resolves spells and abilities.</li> <li>Imagining the Stack as a literal stack of the spell cards and abilities played each turn helps simplify the resolution process. </li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiants-end-match-achievements-are-both-satisfying-and-demeaning/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiants-end-match-achievements-are-both-satisfying-and-demeaning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Many players have experienced a rollercoaster of emotions during the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-devs-provides-update-on-practice-zone-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a></em>&nbsp;end-match achievements. It’s an unusual twist for the achievement, but they’ve made many players (myself included) feel either a genuine sense of pride or outright embarrassment.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="397" data-injectable="false">I know it sounds ironic for achievements to be demeaning, but it has to do with how <em>XDefiant</em> handles end-match achievements. Generally, shooter games showcase player stats at the end of the match to show who did the best in-game. However, rather than sticking to the standard shooter achievements like “Most Kills” or “Best K/D Ratio,” <em>XDefiant</em> covers much more than that. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">You’ll see plenty of other accomplishments, from the most “Damage Blocked” to the top scorer as an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-all-factions-and-their-abilities-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Echelon Faction</a> member. These rewarding bits bring out the “satisfying” part of the game, where no player can be deemed a loser.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">I’ve particularly enjoyed this when I haven’t been killing too many enemies, focusing solely on a support role as a Libertad. Even when my eliminations have been sub-par, the achievements will at least comfort me with a most “Damage Healed” title. It’s even better when the other players give a thumbs-up to these trophy cards, acting as a victorious virtual high five.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="728" data-injectable="true">But <em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;trophies will also make you want to run away in embarrassment after those matches where you just can’t get it right and question if you’re a true FPS player. I’ve experienced this after one of the worst matches of my life. My kills were terrible, I barely healed anyone, and I almost died every other minute. The end-game achievement of “Helped” feels like a participation trophy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">What I actually “Helped” with remains a mystery to me. Yet, I couldn’t help but laugh at my not-so-great achievement. I’ve also gotten one for the most LMG kills, which may sound impressive, except I only got&nbsp;six&nbsp;kills that match. The other players that round had more than 24 eliminations, so six kills sounds like child’s play at that point.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">Fortunately, I’m not the only one getting these hysterical trophies. Reddit user Vince_- experienced this when they were rewarded with a “Ran Around” accomplishment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="651" data-injectable="true">Although it sounds pointless, it’s better than getting a “Hey, you suck” title. There are a few funny achievements, too; some of my personal&nbsp;favorites are “Moral Support” and “Tried.” I’ve always liked the saying “A for effort,” which definitely translates well in the world of&nbsp;<em>XDefiant</em>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">Other players on Reddit have found the reward system exceptionally comical. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/comments/1cxjxp6/comment/l56foib/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One player</a> mentioned how their entire group laughed when someone on the team got a “Showed Up” title after joining the round late. I like to see this&nbsp;type of&nbsp;camaraderie as it strays away from the relatively toxic side of shooters. I’ve run into that during some bad matches, and let me tell you, it can be brutal. Fortunately, <em>XDefiant</em>&nbsp;seems much more inviting, especially with its more player-friendly <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/does-xdefiant-have-sbmm-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SBMM</a> mechanics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant’s</em>&nbsp;match conclusions are a mixed bag of emotions but in a good way. Sometimes, you’ll be on top of the world in a specific category, while other times, you may feel like a chump who only got a trophy for being there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">It’s a rollercoaster, but I’m enjoying the ride. It’s exciting to see things done this way instead of feeling like I’ll never reach the scope of the pros. It also adds humor to the game, an element that can often be left out in shooter games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">For the first time ever, I want to perform poorly in matches just to see what other humiliating achievements I can earn. It’s different, sure, but I’m glad that Ubisoft has the sense of humor to make the game much more entertaining.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">Unique content like this may have contributed to its popularity surge.&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>has even reportedly become <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-becomes-fastest-ubisoft-title-reach-one-million-unique-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of Ubisoft’s fastest-growing</a> titles yet. Hopefully, more games will learn from <em>XDdefiant</em>‘s tongue-in-cheek achievements as a way to make a match feel more fun by having a surprise waiting for players at the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can anything stop the meteoric rise of Fortnite? Even after all these years, the Fortnite Battle Royale continues to entice players and rake in cash for its developers, primarily thanks to strategic partnerships and skin pack launches. The most recent one appears to combine the social horror game Lethal Company with Fortnite!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-we-get-lethal-company-skins-in-fortnite">Will We Get Lethal Company Skins in Fortnite?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-lethal-company-collaboration-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent tease</a>, which revealed an upcoming skin and emote, we know that Lethal Company is, in fact, coming to Fortnite. More specifically, we’ll see “The Employee” skin in Fortnite, the stock player character outfit from the four-player horror game that took the world by storm in October 2023.</p>



<p>Alongside The Employee, we’ll also receive oxygen tanks and a stop sign, likely as a melee weapon and some tool, as part of the Lethal Company x Fortnite crossover event. But that’s not all because the “Company Jig” emote also joins the party in the battle royale world.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-lethal-company-coming-to-fortnite">When is Lethal Company Coming to Fortnite?</h2>



<p>While there is no official release date for the crossover event, it’s most likely to occur during Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 3. Of course, there’s no telling. We could see a delay in the crossover event until a later season or a new chapter altogether, but that seems unlikely, considering the quality of the leak in question.</p>



<p>Following the immense success of Lethal Company, which brought in nearly $100 million for its one-person developer, Zeekerss, it’s no surprise to anyone here at Insider Gaming that we’d see a crossover event like this. It was only a matter of time!</p>

<p data-characters="134" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re after a relic weapon in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and don’t mind a grind, then you might want to go after a Zodiac weapon.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Make no mistake, this Relic carries arguably the most arduous grind of any Relic in <em>FFXIV</em>, but they are glorious to look at and, as a bonus, come with the &lt;Z&gt; title. You’ll need to be prepared for a lot of hard work if you want a Zodiac weapon, but if you’re up for the challenge, let’s look at the steps in detail.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="84" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Before you can begin the Zodiac grind, you’ll need to have completed a few things:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete the level 50 MSQ quest “The Ultimate Weapon”</li> <li>Complete all Class and Job quests for your chosen job including the level 30 quest which gives you the Job Stone</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-weaponsmith-of-legend-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete The Weaponsmith of Legend in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">You’ll only need to complete this quest before you begin your first Zodiac weapon grind. When beginning additional weapons, you’ll skip over this one.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">Head to Vesper Bay and talk to Nedrick Ironheart (X:12.0, Y:14.0). He’ll send you off to Mor Dhona to speak to Rowena (X:22.0, Y:6.0), before you’ll head to Hyrstmill in North Shroud to see Gerolt (X:30.0, Y:20.0).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">This final location will be the main go-to point for the entire Zodiac grind, so you’ll get pretty good at finding it quickly.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-a-relic-reborn-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete A Relic Reborn in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="157" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Unfinished</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="88" data-current-count="88" data-injectable="false">This quest has a lot of different steps, each of which requires some effort to complete:</p> <h4 id="h-step-one-finding-your-broken-weapon" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step one: Finding your broken weapon.&nbsp;</strong></h4> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Where you need to go to find your broken weapon depends on which job you’re trying to get a Zodiac weapon for. Broken weapons are spread between the various A Realm Reborn Beastmen Strongholds:</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="823" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td><strong>Weapon co-ordinates</strong></td><td><strong>Beastmen Stronghold</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Paladin<br>Monk</td><td>(X:30.0, Y:19.0)<br>(X:32.0, Y:18.0)</td><td>Zahar’ak (Southern Thanalan)</td></tr><tr><td>Warrior<br>Black Mage<br>White Mage</td><td>(X:23.0, Y:10.0)<br>(X:23.0, Y:11.0)<br>(X:24.3, Y:6.4)</td><td>U’Ghamaro Mines (Outer La Noscea)</td></tr><tr><td>Dragoon<br>Bard</td><td>(X:34.0, Y:21.0)<br>(X:34.9, Y:20.5)</td><td>Natalan (Central Coerthas Highlands)</td></tr><tr><td>Ninja<br>Scholar</td><td>(X:16.0, Y:17.0)<br>(X:15.5, Y:16.9)</td><td>Sapsa Spawning Grounds (Western La Noscea)</td></tr><tr><td>Summoner</td><td>(X:25.0, Y:19.0)</td><td>Sylphlands (East Shroud)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-two-attach-materia-to-a-weapon" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step two: Attach materia to a weapon</strong></h4> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">To complete this step, you’ll need to either craft or purchase a specific weapon for your chosen class, then purchase two of a specific low level materia to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-meld-and-overmeld-in-ffxiv-including-pentameld/">meld</a> onto it. You can either meld the materia yourself, or pay a Materia Melder NPC to do this for you.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="59" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">Here’s the weapon and materia you’ll need for each Job:</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td><strong>Weapon needed</strong></td><td><strong>Materia needed</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Paladin<br>Warrior</td><td>Aeolian Scimitar<br>Barbarian’s Bardiche</td><td>Battledance Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>Dragoon<br>Monk</td><td>Champion’s Lance<br>Wildling’s Cesti</td><td>Savage Aim Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>Ninja<br>Bard</td><td>Vamper’s Knives<br>Longarm’s Composite Bow</td><td>Heavens’ Eye Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>Black Mage<br>Summoner</td><td>Sanguine Scepter<br>Erudite’s Picatrix of Casting</td><td>Savage Might Materia III</td></tr><tr><td>White Mage<br>Scholar</td><td>Madman’s Whispering Rod<br>Erudite’s Picatrix of Healing</td><td>Quicktongue Materia III</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-three-getting-alumina-salts" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step three: Getting Alumina Salts</strong></h4> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">This one’s easy, especially if you’re going into this on a level 90 Job. You’ll need to complete A Relic Reborn: The Chimera, which is a level 50 Trial. However, it can be easily completed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-enter-dungeon-solo-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">unsynced</a> within a few seconds solo with any level 90 Job.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true">To enter A Relic Reborn for the first time, you’ll need to head to Coerthas Central Highlands to find the entrance (X:32.0, Y6.0). For any additional weapons, you’ll be able to access this trial through the Duty Finder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed the Trial you’ll be rewarded with some Alumina Salts. With these in hand, head back to Gerolt in Hyrstmill.&nbsp;</p> <h4 id="h-step-four-getting-an-amdapor-glyph" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step four: Getting an Amdapor Glyph</strong></h4> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Again, this is a relatively easy step. All you need to do is complete the level 50 dungeon Amdapor Keep in order to get an Amdapor Glyph. Thankfully, as long as you complete the dungeon as your chosen Job, you can do it unsynced, so this is another step you can complete very quickly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="108" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got the Glyph, take it back to Rowena in Mor Dhona and then revisit Gerolt in Hyrstmill.&nbsp;</p> <h4 id="h-step-five-hunt-some-beastmen" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step five: Hunt some Beastmen</strong></h4> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">At this point, Gerolt will have given you an unfinished Zodiac weapon. You’ll now need to equip and go hunting for Beastmen. Again, which Beastmen you need to defeat depends on the Job you’re trying to get a Zodiac weapon for, but they’re in the same area as where you found your broken weapon in step one:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Job</strong></td><td><strong>Enemy 1</strong></td><td><strong>Enemy 2</strong></td><td><strong>Enemy 3</strong></td><td><strong>Location</strong></td></tr><tr><td>PaladinMonk</td><td>8 Zahar’ak Lancer</td><td>8 Zahar’ak Pugilist</td><td>8 Zahar’ak Thaumaturge</td><td>Zahar’akSouthern Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>WarriorBlack MageWhite Mage</td><td>8 U’Ghamaro Quarryman</td><td>8 U’Ghamaro Bedesman</td><td>8 U’Ghamaro Priest</td><td>U’Ghamaro MinesOuter La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>DragoonBard</td><td>8 Natalan Boldwing</td><td>8 Natalan Fogcaller</td><td>8 Natalan Windtalon</td><td>NatalanCoerthas Central Highlands</td></tr><tr><td>NinjaScholar</td><td>8 Sapsa Shelfspine</td><td>8 Sapsa Shelfclaw</td><td>8 Sapsa Shelftooth</td><td>Sapsa Spawning GroundsWestern La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Summoner</td><td>8 Violet Sigh</td><td>8 Violet Screech</td><td>8 Violet Snarl</td><td>SylphlandsEast Shroud</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-six-complete-some-trials" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step six: Complete some Trials</strong></h4> <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">You’ll need to complete four different Trials in order to complete this step. The first of these needs unlocking – A Relic Reborn: The Hydra.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Like A Relic Reborn: The Chimera, you’ll need to physically go to the entrance location for this Trial the first time you complete this step. The entrance is located in Eastern Thanalan, directly next to the entrance to Halatali (X:14.0, Y:30.0). This step needs to be completed with the unfinished Zodiac weapon equipped, but can be completed unsynced. When complete, return to Gerolt.</p>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">After that, Gerolt will send you into three Trials one by one to obtain their quest specific drops, talking to him again between each Trial. You do not need to have the unfinished Zodiac weapon equipped to complete these trials, but you do still need to complete them as you chosen Job:</p> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Trial</strong></td><td><strong>Drop</strong></td></tr><tr><td>The Bowl of Embers (Hard)</td><td>White Hot Ember</td></tr><tr><td>The Howling Eye (Hard)</td><td>Howling Gale</td></tr><tr><td>The Navel (Hard)</td><td>Hyperfused Ore</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h4 id="h-step-seven-get-some-radz-at-han-quenching-oil" data-injectable="false"><strong>Step seven: Get some Radz-at-Han Quenching Oil</strong></h4> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false">Radz-at-Han Quenching Oil can be purchased from Auriana in Mor Dhona (X:22.7, Y:6.6) for 15 <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-should-you-do-with-tomestones-of-poetics-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">Tomestones of Poetics</a> each. You only need one and then you can return to Gerolt to finish this first quest of the Zodiac grind.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-upgrade-to-a-zenith-zodiac-weapon-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to upgrade to a Zenith Zodiac weapon in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic Stage: Zenith</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">Unlike any other steps in Zodiac grind, this one involves no quests (yay!). This is a really easy step and all you need is 60 Tomestones of Poetics to purchase 3 Thavnairian Mist. These can be purchased from Auriana in Mor Dhona.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="108" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got them, take them to the Furnace in Hyrstmill and combine the Mists with your weapon. Ta da!</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-up-in-arms-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Up in Arms in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Atma</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="97" data-injectable="false">For this next step, you’re going to have to complete a lot of FATEs. And I do mean a lot.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">After speaking to Gerold, he’ll send you to Jalzahn (located very closeby) and he will tell you that you now need to collect 12 Atmas, each of which drop from FATEs completed in specific areas. However, these Atmas have an abysmally low drop rate even today so this step might take you a while to complete. You’ll need to complete these FATEs with your Zenith weapon equipped.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">As soon as you talk to Jalzahn, this quest will be marked as completed whether you have collected the Atma or not. Keep track of them by organizing your inventory. If this isn’t your first Zodiac grind, you do not need to talk to Jalzahn this first time and can immediately progress to collecting Atmas.</p> <p data-characters="55" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Here’s all the different Atmas and where to get them:</p> <figure data-found-rows="13" data-current-count="1180" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Atma</strong></td><td><strong>FATEs zone</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Lion</td><td>Outer La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Water-bearer</td><td>Upper La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Ram</td><td>Middle La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Crab</td><td>Western La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Fish</td><td>Lower La Noscea</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Bull</td><td>Eastern Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Scales</td><td>Central Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Twins</td><td>Western Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Scorpion</td><td>Southern Thanalan</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Archer</td><td>North Shroud</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Goat</td><td>East Shroud</td></tr><tr><td>Atma of the Maiden</td><td>Central Shroud</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve collected your Atmas, head back to Jalzahn and hand them back to him. He’ll upgrade your weapon to the Atma stage.</p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">As a side note, if you happen to end up with extra Atmas from any area (if you’re doing this grind with a friend, for instance) I strongly recommend keeping them somewhere. You never know when they’re going to come in handy.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-trials-of-the-braves-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Trials of the Braves in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Animus</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">Even I have to admit that this is the stage that causes people to take a break or give up the Zodiac grind altogether — the dreaded Books.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">With your Atma Zodiac weapon equipped, talk to Jalzahn and he will explain that you need to recreate ‘valorous deeds’ of the Zodiac Braves. In order to do this, you’ll need to complete objectives set out in 9 books with your Atma weapon equipped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">Head to Mor Dhona and talk to Rowena first, then to G’jusana, who is also in Mor Dhona (X:22.9, Y:7.3). From here, you can purchase books, but there is one big caveat to this – you can only ever own one book at a time and each book must be completed in full before purchasing the next book.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="57" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Each book contains the following which must be completed:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true"> <li>10 specific monsters</li> <li>3 Dungeons (can be completed unsynced)</li> <li>3 FATEs</li> <li>3 Levequests</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">Completing each book upgrades a stat on your Atma weapon, which varies depending on your chosen Job:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Book</strong></td><td><strong>Category</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Book of Skyfire I<br>Book of Skyfire II<br>Book of Netherfire I</td><td>Primary attribute (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence or Mind)</td></tr><tr><td>Book of Skyfall I<br>Book of Skyfall II<br>Book of Netherfall I</td><td>Vitality</td></tr><tr><td>Book of Skywind I<br>Book of Skywind II</td><td>Secondary attribute (Tenacity, Direct Hit, Spell Speed, Critical Hit, or Determination)</td></tr><tr><td>Book of Skyearth I</td><td>Secondary attribute (Tenacity, Direct Hit, Skill Speed, Critical Hit, or Determination)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed all nine books, head back and talk to Jalzahn again and he will reward you with an Animus stage Zodiac weapon.</p> <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Upgrading your Animus weapon to a Novus weapon will require you to complete the next two quests.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-celestial-radiance-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Celestial Radiance in Final Fantasy XIV</strong></h2> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true">Speak to Jalzahn in Hyrstmill with the Animus weapon equipped and he’ll send you to Mutamix Bubblypots in Central Thanalan (X:23.0, Y:13.0). Speak to him and he’ll ask you to get 3 Superior Enchanted Ink. This can be purchased from Rowena in Mor Dhona (X:21.0, Y:5.0) for 25 Tomestones of Poetics each.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="159" data-injectable="false">Take these to Hubairtin in Central Thanalan (X:23.0, Y:13.0) and he will provide you with a Sphere Scroll, which serves as the blueprint for the Novus upgrade.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-star-light-star-bright-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Star Light, Star Bright in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic Stage: Novus</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="41" data-current-count="41" data-injectable="false">For this stage, you will need two things:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="121" data-injectable="false"> <li>Roughly 75 Materia of varying levels, beginning at level 1 and ending at level 4. I’d recommend getting 20 of each level.&nbsp;</li> <li>75 Alexandrite</li> </ul> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true">If you’re getting a Zodiac weapon for glamour purposes, which you most likely are considering the relatively low iLvl, it doesn’t matter too much which Materia you choose to use. Use Universalis to see which Materia is cheapest and go from there. You will need to use multiple different types of Materia, but this is entirely down to personal choice.</p>
 <h4 id="h-how-to-get-alexandrite-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Alexandrite in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h4> <p data-characters="105" data-current-count="105" data-injectable="false">There are a few different ways to obtain the Alexandrite you need to meld Materia onto the Sphere Scroll:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="225" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete FATEs with an Animus Zodiac weapon equipped</li> <li>Purchase from a Hunt Billmaster in Ul’dah, Gridania or Limsa Lominsa for 50 Allied Seals each</li> <li>From treasure chests located using a Mysterious Map, which reward up to 5 Alexandrite at a time</li> </ul> <h4 id="h-how-to-get-mysterious-maps-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to get Mysterious Maps in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h4> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Mysterious Maps can be obtained in a couple of different ways, but most easily through purchase from Auriana in Mor Dhona for 75 Tomestones of Poetics each.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">The other way to get them includes a couple of steps:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete the side quest “One Man’s Trash”, picked up by talking to Ealdwine in North Shroud (X:29.5, Y:19.7) <ul> <li>After completing “One Man’s Trash”, you’ll unlock the daily repeatable quest “Morbid Motivation” which requires you to run Duty Roulette: Level 50/60/70/8- Dungeons</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p data-characters="159" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve successfully melded enough Materia to your Sphere Scroll, head back to Hyrstmill and talk to Jalzahn, who will reward you with your Novus weapon.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-farm-zodiac-light-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to farm Zodiac Light in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">Relic stage: Nexus</p> <figure data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Speak to Jalzahn with your Novus weapon equipped and complete the quest “Mmmmmm, Soulglazed Relics”. Select which weapon you wish to Soulglaze (the one that you’re working on, and remember to choose both the Sword and Shield if you’re working towards a Paladin weapon), and then you’ll be into the next grind.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">In order to upgrade your Novus weapon to its Nexus stage, you’ll need to run duties to gather 2,000 Light. These duties can be completed unsynced, and you earn light by running any duty that’s part of A Realm Reborn. Each duty provides a certain amount of light:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Feeble (8 points)</li> <li>Gentle (16 points)</li> <li>Bright (32 points)</li> <li>Brilliant (48 points)</li> <li>Blinding (96 points)</li> <li>Newborn Star (128 points)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">While it may be tempting to try for Newborn Star levels of light, this is only a possible bonus in either Syrcus Tower or The World of Darkness, which require a lot of time to complete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Countless Call of Duty fans have yet to upgrade their systems, and there’s nothing wrong with that. The last generation of consoles—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—were fantastic and often much cheaper than current-gen systems. But you also don’t want to miss out on the upcoming Call of Duty game. So, can you play Black Ops 6 on PS4?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-coming-to-ps4">Is Black Ops 6 Coming to PS4?</h2>



<p>While we heard rumors last year regarding the next Call of Duty game launching on current-gen and last-gen systems, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we can </a>confirm that Black Ops 6 is coming to PS4. It’s coming to most systems, including PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, in October 2024.</p>



<p>The Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S versions of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will offer cross-generation support, meaning you buy a single copy of the game, and it works on both systems, but PlayStation won’t offer the same compatibility. There are product listings at GameStop for both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 copies.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-cross-platform">Is Black Ops 6 Cross Platform?</h2>



<p>While we don’t yet have an official word regarding cross-platform support for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, it’s likely happening. Past titles in the long-running first-person shooter franchise have featured crossplay and cross-platform features from day one. </p>



<p>Furthermore, with Black Ops 6 releasing on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft and Activision want to ensure the widest reach possible. They want everyone in the first-person shooter scene to play this release later this year, and that means providing full lobbies of competitive players. Cross-platform between all five systems is a must-have feature to accomplish this task!</p>



<hr>



<p>Most long-time Call of Duty fans want something to help ease the wait until the next game, like XDefiant. But does it offer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-xdefiant-have-search-and-destroy-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Search and Destroy</a>? Oh, by the way, we’d love to have you join us by signing up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>About midway through <a href="https://www.animalwell.net/"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, I felt I had been lied to. I read all the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152153/animal-well-review-switch-ps5-steam-videogamedunkey">glowing</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24151337/animal-well-review-pc-ps5-switch">reviews</a> of the game and heard the breathless praise heaped upon it on social media. But my expectations did not match my reality... until I beat the game. Now, I’m well on my way to 100 percent completion for a game I was seriously considering abandoning.</p><p><strong><em>Spoilers for</em> Animal Well<em> are below.</em></strong></p><p>Though I loved <em>Animal Well</em>’s novel take on traditional movement abilities — the tools it provides possess multiple clever uses — platforming itself often felt demoralizing. Initially, <em>Animal Well</em>’s platforming felt like it had difficulty spikes that were both too great and too frequent. I could often see where I had to go and how to get there (and I often looked up video guides to confirm I was doing it right with the right tools) but actually executing was more laborious than fun and engaging. </p><div><p>Though I loved <em>Animal Well</em>’s novel take on traditional movement abilities, platforming itself often felt demoralizing</p></div><p>I’ve always felt that the difficulty of a task in a platformer should be commensurate with its importance: the hardest moments should be reserved for secrets and optional goals, while everything involved in completing the game should be more attainable. That way, I am still in control of my experience and, critically, still <em>having</em> an experience. If reaching a secret is harder than I’d like, then I can opt out to continue on to beat the game one completion percentage point lower. But if simply getting from point A to point B is too dang hard, opting out means opting out of the game entirely. <em>Animal Well</em>’s platforming convinced me I’d run into an obstacle so frustratingly difficult that I’d quit and never come back.</p><div><figcaption><em>On a lark, I decided to see what would happen if I pressed a big red skull button in a room full of crows, and yup, they pecked me to death.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Big Mode / Shared Memory</cite></p></div><p>Thankfully, that didn’t happen. Somehow, I persisted long enough to collect all four animal flames to complete the game’s first “ending,” figuring I’d stop there. But then, right before the final encounter, I found a room littered with skulls containing an upgrade to the bubble wand item. Remember this, it’ll be important in a moment.</p><p>The bubble wand creates little bubble platforms you can jump on, but you can only blow one at a time. The upgraded bubble wand allows you to blow <em>multiple</em> bubbles that, with the right technique, let you bypass a lot of the game’s obstacles. </p><p>Remember the skulls? I figured out that all the skulls in that room, piled high enough for me to reach the wand, represented the number of times I died. With that realization came the shock that even though I wasn’t initially vibing with the game, it was always vibing with me. The bubble wand upgrade is unreachable unless you’ve accumulated enough skulls to build a platform up to it. The only way I got what finally made this game click for me was because of all the frustration it put me through in the first place.</p><p>When I figured that out, I started laughing maniacally, tears in my eyes, thinking, “Oh, you cheeky bastards!” I immediately went right back to the start of the game to go egg hunting, something I already decided I wasn’t going to do. But I was locked in now. I understood. I’m stuck in the (animal) well now, and I’m never coming out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="NGoiCX">Summer’s around the corner — or maybe it’s already here, depending on the weather wherever you’re at. Either way, May is almost over, and that means movies leaving streaming services at the end of the month.</p>
<p id="edsBx5">This month, we have two very different thrillers — one about corporate malfeasance, one about an evil box — an underrated video game adaptation, and a very silly comedy with a great cast. We’re also highlighting <em>The Crow</em>, with the new version starring Bill Skarsgård and FKA Twigs just a few months away.</p>
<p id="TQm1uj">Here are the best movies you should watch before they leave streaming this May.</p>

<p id="Kog0AX"><strong>Director: </strong>Michael Mann<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer<br><strong>Leaving Criterion Channel: </strong>May 31</p>
<p id="rgji44">In 1996, <em>60 Minutes </em>ran a searing episode exposing the tobacco industry for intentionally adding dangerous chemicals to cigarettes and lying to the public. The episode relied on the testimony of whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand, the former vice president of research and development at a major tobacco company. And the story behind how that episode came to be (and how it nearly never aired) is fascinating, as documented in Michael Mann’s excellent thriller <em>The Insider</em>.</p>
<p id="2IpgEb">A powerful movie about the difficulties of working ethically inside a large corporation and what real heroism actually looks like, <em>The Insider </em>is one of Mann’s very best movies — and that’s an extremely high bar. Al Pacino and Russell Crowe star as CBS producer Lowell Bergman and the whistleblower Wigand, respectively, and the excellent supporting cast includes Christopher Plummer (as legendary <em>60 Minutes </em>correspondent Mike Wallace), Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Rip Torn. It’s a gorgeous movie to take in as well, with crisp cinematography from Dante Spinotti earning him one of the movie’s seven Oscar nominations — including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, and the first of three consecutive Best Actor nominations for Crowe. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="XH0qEW"><strong>Director: </strong>Christophe Gans<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, Laurie Holden<br><strong>Leaving Netflix: </strong>May 31</p>
<p id="9VjPbc">This movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23411610/silent-hill-movie-new-game-announcement">doesn’t get the credit it deserves</a>. Not only is it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23196727/best-video-game-movies-adaptations-tv-watch-streaming">one of the best video game movies ever made</a>, it’s also a very creepy (and gory) horror movie that does a great job of capturing the games’ mounting existential dread. You already know the premise: A girl gets lost in Silent Hill and someone else has to go rescue her, only to find all manner of untold horrors within the abandoned town. While there are bits and pieces of CGI that don’t quite hold up, the rest of this movie includes some truly terrifying creatures and sequences, and an absolutely devastating ending that few horror movies can match. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="ZQaJ91">There’s a new adaptation of <em>The Crow </em>coming around the corner this summer, so why not watch the original this month? While best known for the tragic death of star Brandon Lee, who was fatally shot in an accident during production, <em>The Crow </em>is an enduring neo-(goth-)noir classic for good reason. With a foreboding atmosphere via director Alex Proyas (<em>Dark City</em>) and the (very) dark source material, <em>The Crow </em>inspired a whole generation of goths.</p>
<p id="4eltkw">And if you love Brandon Lee in this, check out some of the other movies in his all-too-short filmography. His previous two movies — <em>Showdown in Little Tokyo </em>and <em>Rapid Fire </em>— are both stellar. Like his father, he was one hell of a movie star whose life and career was cut all too short. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="MrYfe9">I have a vivid memory of <em>The Box </em>being marketed as a horror movie, but it really isn’t. After falling head over heels for his <em>Southland Tales </em>(and with <em>Donnie Darko </em>under my belt long before that), I wanted to complete my experience with the Richard Kelly filmography with his most recent feature, which was broadly rejected by critics and audiences alike but is nonetheless a fascinating movie. And I was rewarded for that decision, albeit with some qualms.</p>
<p id="oDtuhi">You know the basic premise. It’s been memed to death — a family receives a button that will give them a million dollars if they press it, but someone they don’t know will die. But that basic premise hides a much richer movie, a tense domestic drama that unwinds into a conspiracy thriller turned [redacted for spoilers]. Like Kelly’s other movies, <em>The Box </em>is filled with interesting images and is ripe for all sorts of metaphorical readings, even if it is less successful than his two previous features. I found myself quite frustrated with the ending, especially with regard to its relationship to disability, but it’s a fascinating and endlessly discussable thriller nonetheless. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="Lv0L5o"><strong>Director: </strong>Kay Cannon<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kathryn Newton, John Cena, Leslie Mann<br><strong>Leaving Hulu: </strong><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=nOD%2frLJHOac&amp;offerid=1589248.1409&amp;type=3&amp;subid=0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">May 31</a></p>
<p id="6AXDM6">A hybrid sex comedy/generation-gap comedy from <em>30 Rock </em>alum Kay Cannon, <em>Blockers </em>follows three parents who are trying to stop their daughters from losing their virginity on prom night... and also the three daughters trying to lose their virginity on prom night. It’s not nearly as conservative about young women having sex as the premise might have you believe, as the parents’ ridiculous overprotectiveness is often the butt of the joke, but the real strength is the cast: rising stars Kathryn Newton, Geraldine Viswanathan, and Gideon Adlon excel as the three main girls, while Leslie Mann, John Cena, and Ike Barinholtz are all great as the overbearing parents.</p>
<p id="d2HAjy">Often juvenile and not always funny, <em>Blockers </em>isn’t some great breakthrough moment in American comedy, but it is a fun time with a very game cast. The split between the parents and the children and their various problems and hang-ups is almost like an American version of <em>Derry Girls</em>. While <em>Blockers </em>lacks the emotional resonance of that Netflix show, it’s still an underrated Hollywood comedy during an era where very few of those have been worth talking about. —<em>PV </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-black-ops-6-on-xbox-one-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>These days, we don’t see many brand-new launches on last-gen systems. Most developers chose to forego the system in favor of new tech, like the current-gen Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. There are also rumors about the next generation of gaming consoles coming sometime in the next year or two. That said, not everyone feels the same. So, can you play Black Ops 6 on Xbox One?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-coming-to-xbox-one">Is Black Ops 6 Coming to Xbox One?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-last-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent reports online</a>, specifically surrounding product listings at GameStop, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is indeed coming to Xbox One. It will launch on last-gen and current-gen systems, along with PC, to reach the widest audience imaginable.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming heard rumors regarding Black Ops 6 on last-gen consoles in February last year, but we can only now confirm those rumors. We have confirmation from developers and retailers, which is fantastic news for anyone playing on Xbox One or PlayStation 4!</p>



<p>Furthermore, it’s important to note that you won’t find a direct listing for Black Ops 6 on Xbox One. Instead, it falls under the Xbox Series X|S version because it’s a cross-generation copy of the game, meaning it works on both systems!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-black-ops-6-have-crossplay">Does Black Ops 6 Have Crossplay?</h2>



<p>If past titles are anything to go by, then yes, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will feature crossplay. Honestly, it’s nearly a must-have feature for a first-person, lobby-based shooter launching on all available systems.</p>



<p>We don’t have exact numbers, but we know the Xbox One sold approximately 58 million units, while the Xbox Series X|S sold 21 million units, give or take. That’s a massive gap in the player base, meaning most didn’t upgrade. It would be foolish of Activision to split the communities so significantly on last-gen and current-gen systems!</p>



<hr>



<p>While we’re all casually waiting for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, did you hear about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>?

            <p>The families of those killed in the Uvalde school shooting in 2022 have filed lawsuits against Call of Duty publisher Activision, accusing the company of "grooming" the 18-year-old who shot and killed 19 children, two teachers, and injured 17 others.</p>
<p>As reported by The New York Times (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/24/us/uvalde-gun-instagram-activision-lawsuit.html">£</a>) (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/uvalde-activision-lawsuit/">PC Gamer</a>), the dual lawsuits – one filed in California, the other in Texas – claim that the killer bought a Daniel Defense M4 V7 on his 18th birthday after seeing the gun in Call of Duty games.</p>
<p>It's the lawsuits' position that by using real-life weapons, Activision is "the most prolific and effective marketer of assault weapons in the United States". </p>
<p>They also take issue with Meta's Instagram and the arms manufacturer, Daniel Defense, too, saying that were it not for technology and video games, the socially isolated teenager living in rural Texas would not have been able to contact the gun maker.</p>
<p>Activision says that whilst it shares its "deepest sympathies" to all those impacted by the mass shooting, "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".</p>
<p>The Entertainment Software Association – the video game trade body that representations video game companies in the US and established the ESRB ratings association in the early 1990s – calls the lawsuits "baseless".</p>
<p>"We are saddened and outraged by senseless acts of violence," the ESA said in a statement to press. "At the same time, we discourage baseless accusations linking these tragedies to video gameplay, which detract from efforts to focus on the root issues in question and safeguard against future tragedies. Many other countries have similar rates of video gameplay to the United States, yet do not see similar rates of gun violence."</p>
<p>We've reached out to Activision for further comment and will update you if/when we receive a formal response.</p>

		<p>A new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> game could be announced in the next two weeks, as rumours emerge for Sony’s expected summer showcase.</p>
<p>This comes from the very, very reliable games industry leaker Billbil-kun, writing on <a href="https://www-dealabs-com.translate.goog/magazine/astro-un-nouveau-jeu-est-bien-en-cours-de-preparation-decouvrez-tout-ce-que-lon-sait-a-ce-propos-51489">French deals site Dealabs</a>. They have a remarkable track record of predicting announcements, typically revealing the monthly PlayStation Plus games just a little before Sony make the formal announcement.</p>


<p>A new Astro Bot game has been mooted by industry insider Jeff Grubb earlier this year, and it absolutely follows that Team Asobi would make a new Astro Bot game after the success and popularity of Astro Bot: Rescue Mission on the original PSVR and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/astros-playroom">Astro’s Playroom</a>, which is bundled in with every PlayStation 5 as a showcase of the console’s capabilities and love letter to all things PlayStation.</p>
<p>Team Asobi spawned out of Japan Studio, having been founded as an internal team at the studio back in 2012. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">Sony’s decision to shut down Japan Studio in early 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/03/astro-bot-developer-team-asobi-is-now-a-standalone-studio-separate-from-japan-studio/">Team Asobi was splintered off as a standalone studio</a> within PlayStation Studios.</p>
<p>So when, exactly, will Astro Bot’s next adventure be announced? Well, Sony has yet to confirm a State of Play or PlayStation Showcase, but they typically do hold an online showcase around this time of year. With Summer Game Fest now settled into the old E3 window of early June, Sony stole a march last year with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/17/playstation-showcase-announced-for-24th-may-2023/">a PlayStation Showcase on 24th May</a>. The latest rumours and speculation – coming from Jeff Grubb and Nick Baker – suggest an event could happen as soon as next week, 28th May. Except, Sony gave one week’s notice last time around and have been completely silent on the matter.</p>

<p>Astro’s Playroom was a simple bundle of joy for pretty much every PS5 owner. “Astro cements himself as the PlayStation 5’s mascot,” <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">I said in 2020</a>, “with a celebration of all things PlayStation that also showcases the full potential of the immersive new DualSense controller. Astro’s Playroom is the first thing you should play on PlayStation 5.”</p>
