			<p>Today, it was announced by Blizzard Entertainment that BlizzCon, a celebration of all of Blizzard's communities, is making a return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September of 2026. Those who want to attend will be able to do so on Saturday, September 12, and Sunday, September 13, 2026. To celebrate the news, a trailer has been released. It's just under 40 seconds long but helps build up a little bit of hype for the event.</p>
<p><iframe title="BlizzCon | Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrMT3bgU-fs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>BlizzCon has been a major event for Blizzard Entertainment since 2005, where it allows members of the team to connect with the ever-growing and constantly changing community, as well as allowing players of Blizzard games to connect with each other at the event. 2026 will, of course, be bringing back some of the staples that have always popped up at previous BlizzCons, such as the Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, Darkmoon Faire, and hands-on gameplay.</p>
<p>Along the way, there have been many changes to how BlizzCon works, as well as new events to constantly bring something new to the dedicated community, and some in-game rewards for those lucky enough to attend it in person.</p>
<p>From 2020 to 2022, there has not been an in-person BlizzCon, with a lot of it being due to the COVID-19 pandemic and people having to self-isolate. There were also plans for<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-delayed-indefinitely-game-announcements-coming/"> BlizzConline</a> during this time, but those plans also fell through, with it only happening in February 2021, despite there being plans for it in 2022.</p>
<p>Now, it's finally making a return to an in-person event, where fans and friends can gather at the Anaheim Convention Center to get some sneak peeks at upcoming content across Blizzard's mainstay franchises, such as World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, and Hearthstone.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.blizzcon.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> is posted on the official BlizzCon website, where more details will be shared in the future about what will be available at the event. The statement also goes on to say:</p>
<p><em>We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure</em>.</p>
<p>While it is far too early to even begin to speculate what could be presented at BlizzCon 2026, it's likely that there will be information about the Worldsoul Saga in World of Warcraft as it gets closer to the reveal of the second expansion, Midnight. It's not been stated as of yet when people can expect the release of the second expansion in the saga, but it's possible we'll see it at BlizzCon next year.</p>

Especially in gaming where technological progress and innovation moves at breakneck speed relative to other mediums, playing something even just five or 10 years after it released can dramatically alter its impact. But I didn’t have to struggle to unearth <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-the-kotaku-review-1826393914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chrono-trigger-the-kotaku-review-1826393914">the virtues, charms, and joy of <em>Chrono Trigger</em></a></span>’s turn-based combat, pixel art sprites, and 16-bit music decades after they became relics of the past. I was there before they became buried beneath massive open worlds, 4K textures, and cinematic storytelling. It is both my <em>Citizen Kane</em> and my Rosebud. </p><p>The shortest version of the tale <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://medium.com/insert-cartridge/timeless-the-history-of-chrono-trigger-375ce25b481e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://medium.com/insert-cartridge/timeless-the-history-of-chrono-trigger-375ce25b481e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">of the game’s legendary development</a></span> is this. Talent from the two biggest Japanese RPG franchises in the 90s—<em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em>—got together to make a cutting-edge mashup for the SNES that would break new ground on multiple fronts. <em>Dragon Ball </em>creator Akira Toriyama made the art and Yuji Horii contributed to the writing while star developers from Square like Takashi Tokita, Yoshinori Kitase, and Kazuhiko Aoki directed and produced. <em>Final Fantasy </em>creator Hironobu Sakaguchi oversaw the project, while Yasunori Mitsuda composed the game’s unforgettable soundtrack.</p><figure id="" data-id="e243a3b0e631c8bcb1c1ed3ffb09eb5b" data-recommend-id="image://e243a3b0e631c8bcb1c1ed3ffb09eb5b" data-format="png" data-width="817" data-height="460" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Crono fights a robot dragon.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those who have never played <em>Chrono Trigger</em> before<em>,</em> its an epic, time-hopping adventure that weaves in and out of medieval fantasy and futuristic sci-fi as its characters fight to save the world from an extraterrestrial evil. In addition to time travel, there’s plenty of magic, and an emphasis on the ineffable will to persist that can only be derived from deep bonds of love and friendship. Events begin at the Millennial Fair, an event celebrating the 1000th anniversary of the founding of a kingdom called Guardia. It’s here that a science experiment gone awry opens up a portal to the past, sending the titular Chrono on a collision course with the apocalypse and beginning a quest whose twists and turns deftly dodge cliché and defy expectation. One minute you’re fighting a giant dinosaur dog, the next you’re in a floating kingdom in the sky. And at the end of it all is showdown with the alien Lavos in one of the most epic turn-based, multi-phase boss fights in the genre’s history.</p><p>The moments that resonated most with me when I was younger were the dramatic story beats and climactic battles. Very early on you save a princess, only to end up on trial for your deeds. The famous court scene spares no expense. An ominously front-lit judge oversees the proceedings with a massive stained glass sculpture behind him. Fellow citizens in the wings howl and grumble at each new accusation. But most ingeniously, the verdict ultimately hinges on random, innocent actions at the beginning of the game like whether you accidentally stole someone’s lunch or helped rescue a kitten. That you still inevitably go to jail whether  proclaimed guilty or not only serves to underline the injustice of the whole thing. It’s still a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destructoid.com/chrono-triggers-trial-is-still-absolutely-brilliant/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destructoid.com/chrono-triggers-trial-is-still-absolutely-brilliant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master class in video game storytelling</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="6953e7b2dedba78b0f783830294d1d1f" data-recommend-id="image://6953e7b2dedba78b0f783830294d1d1f" data-format="png" data-width="817" data-height="499" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chrono fights a big dinosaur.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Part of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>’s enduring legacy is that it’s full of moments like this. Your party becomes much more powerful after it learns to use elemental magic attacks that open up new multi-character combos. Those exact same attacks then get wielded against you in a fight against the evil wizard Magus, who’s been leading monsters in their war against humans. He has his own special boss music that includes the 16-bit version of someone laughing/wailing in the background. Only later do you learn that Magus is a temporal interloper from hundreds of years ago that accidentally got thrown through a time portal as a child because his mom became obsessed with harvesting magic from Lavos. He’s an asshole but you feel bad for him. He can even join your party later if you beat him in a one-on-one duel. This happens after Chrono dies and before you bring him back to life, unless you choose not to and beat the game without him, unlocking one of <em>Chrono Trigger</em>’s many hidden endings.</p><p>The lesson here is that things go off the rails very quickly in this game, and then they keep going farther and farther into unexpected, uncharted territory, but without ever crashing. <em>Chrono Trigger</em> never feels like a series of fetch quests or to-do lists stitched together while your real objective keeps taunting you from just over the horizon. Each time it pulls some wild shit that makes you think you know where things are going, it then pulls some more wild shit that points you in a completely different but equally evocative and compelling direction, and each time it’s totally earned and makes complete sense. All of it is conveyed with beautiful art, razor-sharp writing, and an immaculate score. </p><figure id="" data-id="60ce34b9be21410ef5996fcac286753b" data-recommend-id="image://60ce34b9be21410ef5996fcac286753b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chrono fights Magus.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As I get older, though, I find myself appreciating other aspects of <em>Chrono Trigger </em>even more: all of its little nuances, innovations, and details that make it still feel nimble, fresh, and unique even five console generations later. For instance, combat is turn-based but there are no random encounters. Everything smoothly transitions in the environment when exploration shifts to fighting, including the enemies who each have animated attacks rather than simply being static sprites. While some scenes are scripted, other dialogue flashes by as you explore, letting you freely move around even as some of the heaviest-hitting lines in the game are delivered.</p><p>Then there’s the time travel mechanic itself. While the story proceeds linearly until the endgame, the act of shifting eras is full of small nods to the past and future that make <em>Chrono Trigger</em> feel like an intricate, living world. That sensibility carries through in details ranging from special treasure chests that only offer the most powerful items when opened up as far in the future as possible to entire side-quests that change the future or reveal the past (I’ve spoiled a lot in this tribute but I’m not going to spoil those). And of course there’s the fact that <em>Chrono Trigger</em> was willing to kill its titular hero while also letting players try to beat Lavos less than halfway through the game. It turns out that being unburdened by the traditional hero’s journey feels incredibly liberating, even if you end up following through on it anyway. </p><p><em>Chrono Trigger</em> is one of those games that has a special magic all its own, one that fans keep waiting for someone else to recreate. Why hasn’t it ever happened? Even games that look the part like <em>Sea of Stars</em> are just echoes (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165?_gl=1*ofqq7j*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTcyMDU4MS40OC4xLjE3NDE3MjA1OTQuNDcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165?_gl=1*ofqq7j*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTcyMDU4MS40OC4xLjE3NDE3MjA1OTQuNDcuMC4w">albeit great in their own right</a></span>). There are all sorts of theories one could posit, including the possibility that my rose-tinted Coke bottle glasses are obscuring my vision of the past. But my own guess is that recreating the result of a group of masters collaborating together in a small team and developing for great hardware they were intimately familiar with is next to impossible. You can’t manufacture the past, and while we’ll keep getting plenty of games that are as good as or better than <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, we’ll never get its peak fusion of tech, art, and design again. And 30 years later, I still can’t believe how good it is. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-fragpunk-lancers-what-are-the-best-lancers-in-fragpunk.1131732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-fragpunk-lancers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FragPunk</a>, the newly released tactical hero shooter from Bad Guitar Studio, features a cast of playable characters called Lancers. Each Lancers has their own set of abilities, providing multiple ways for players to utilize and maximize the Shard Cards that make each round unique.</p>



<p>At time of writing, less than a week after the game’s March 6th release, there are 13 playable Lancers in FragPunk. The variety in Lancers means there’s a character for every playstyle, but some are simply stronger than others. Here are the best Lancers in the FragPunk roster right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-fragpunk-lancers">Best FragPunk Lancers</h2>



<h3 id="h-hollowpoint">Hollowpoint</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hollowpoint excels at gathering info and holding angles. Her railgun, Meteora, is a single-shot sniper rifle that deals maximum damage after a short charge, and it also recharges ammunition over time. Paparazzi is a trap that automatically attaches to and reveals enemy players, making it super useful when defending sites or catching flankers.</p>



<p>Smoke Screen is a slow-moving source of cover that blocks off wide angles and highlights enemies hit by it. It can be stopped manually as well to close off a chokepoint, and it can go through walls to reveal unsuspecting enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-pathojen">Pathojen</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pathojen is the perfect support Lancer, providing healing to the whole team plus abilities that can hinder attacker plants and defender retakes. Her Emotional Rescue ability is a wide area-of-effect healing ability that heals everyone in range. If your team took damage getting into the site, they can all huddle together and heal before the opposing retake try occurs.</p>



<p>Pathojen can also throw down her Killer Queen trap, which deals damage over time to enemy players after it is triggered or activated manually. Finally, her Shroom Wall can block the enemies from rushing into site or pulling off a quick flank.</p>



<h3 id="h-broker">Broker</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Broker is the very first Lancer you get to play, via the tutorial, but he’s one you should consider sticking with. His most prolific ability is Goddard’s Vengeance, an easy to use but explosive rocket launcher that deals massive damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cherry Bomb is a very useful ability as well, as it creates a cluster of energy bombs that will pretty much vaporize anyone who touches them. They’re easy to spot and destroy, but even doing so will give Broker players information about where the enemy is coming from. Finally, his Smokestack Lightning ability creates a huge wall of smoke that can provide extensive cover for his whole team.</p>



<h3 id="h-corona">Corona</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re a fan of the duelist class of agents in VALORANT, then Corona is the perfect Lancer for you. Fast Lane, while ironically sharing the name of a Neon ability from Riot’s shooter, is more like Jett’s Dash. Corona can use Fast Lane to dash forwards or upwards, allowing him to get to cover and take space.</p>



<p>Ashes to Ashes is a powerful molotov-like throwable that damages enemies caught in it, but it also provides Corona with damage reduction and a speed boost. In a pinch, Corona can use it on himself to give him the edge in a firefight. Finally, Corona can use Hothead to blind all enemies looking at him after a short charge. This flash ability is so unique compared to traditional thrown blinding abilities that you’re certain to catch numerous enemy players off guard.</p>

<article role="article">

  
    

  
  <div>
      
  
  
  <div>
      <div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Head Designer Mark Rosewater has shared a new sneak peek at the latest set. The Tarkir: Dragonstorm teaser contains a glimpse at creatures, text, and mechanics found in the upcoming set, allowing fans to speculate on potential combos and synergies.</p>



<p>As usual, the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser was dropped on Mark Rosewater's official <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/777738754267955200/maros-tarkir-dragonstorm-teaser" rel="nofollow">Tumblr page</a>. Like all prior teasers like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unfinity-teaser-shared-by-mark-rosewater" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Unfinity</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mark-rosewater-shares-brothers-war-teaser" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Brothers' War</em></a>, Rosewater's teaser only provides small bits of information. No full explanations or names are given away here.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-inevitable-defeat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=QyjxsQGw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-inevitable-defeat-card-artwork.jpg?itok=wACl-Gxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first part of Rosewater's tease contains the following quotes:</p>

<ul><li>A cycle of Dragonstorm enchantments</li>
	<li>Two planeswalkers</li>
	<li>Some counters in the set: decayed, lifelink, and time</li>
	<li>A card that can tutor for one of two other cards</li>
	<li>A legendary enchantment</li>
	<li>A Hydra that uses a clan keyword</li>
	<li>A common archetype theme gets an ability word</li>
	<li>An instant the generates five effects</li>
	<li>Dragons get a new typal enchantment based on a popular Zombie one</li>
	<li>A new instant and sorcery subtype</li>
</ul><p>The first part of the Tarkir: Dragonstorm teaser has some intriguing tidbits. First, this set will be getting two new Planeswalkers. Usually, a new set only contains one. New instant and sorcery subtypes are rare additions, which is gripping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the reintroduction of decayed tokens are fascinating since they're usually seen on zombies from the Innistrad set. Time was used in a similar context in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em> Commander</a> decks.</p>

<p>The second part of the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser are bits of rule text. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>“Whenever you cast a Turtle spell, untap this creature.”</li>
	<li>“As long as there are three or more different kinds of counters among creatures you control,”</li>
	<li>“You may cast it without paying its mana cost if that spell’s mana value is 8 or less.”</li>
	<li>“If you put +1/+1 counters on five Dragons this way, you win the game.”</li>
	<li>“Whenever a creature you control enters, if you cast it, destroy that creature”</li>
	<li>“At the beginning of combat on your turn, if you’ve case both a creature spell and a noncreature spell this turn,”</li>
	<li>“Then if creatures you control have total toughness 20 or greater,”</li>
	<li>“During your end step, Warrior tokens you control have ‘This token can’t be sacrificed.’”</li>
	<li>“Whenever this creature deals combat damage to a player, you may search your library for a card named &lt;CARDNAME&gt;, reveal it, put it into your hand, then shuffle.”</li>
	<li>“Spells you cast have delve.”</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;The rules text holds a lot of gripping possibilities. First, there is the introduction of a new alternative win condition. Second is the return of the Delve mechanic, which allows you to reduce the cost of cards by exiling cards from your graveyard.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-barrensteppe-siege-artwork.jpg?itok=ar0TEQuy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tarkir-dragonstorm-barrensteppe-siege-artwork.jpg?itok=HpaUDC_B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The last part of the <em>Tarkir: Dragonstorm</em> teaser are a list of creature types and card names. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Creature – Dog Monk</li>
	<li>Creature – Elephant Druid</li>
	<li>Creature – Yeti</li>
	<li>Creature – Djinn Cleric</li>
	<li>Creature – Zombie Advisor</li>
	<li>Creature – Kirin</li>
	<li>Creature – Snake Shapeshifter</li>
	<li>Artifact Creature – Chimera</li>
	<li>Artifact Creature – Ape Snake</li>
	<li>Legendary Creature – Zombie Snake Warlock</li>
	<li>All-Out Assault</li>
	<li>Cruel Truths</li>
	<li>Desperate Measures</li>
	<li>Dragonologist</li>
	<li>Hundred-Battle Veteran</li>
	<li>Lightfoot Technique</li>
	<li>Rescue Leopard</li>
	<li>Seize Opportunity</li>
	<li>Stillness in Motion</li>
	<li>War Effort</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;This may be the lightest in terms of gameplay or lore implications, but the text is evocative and imaginative. Zombie Advisor and Zombie Snake Warlock stand out considerably. The name Dragonologist also makes sense given the new set's focus on dragons.</p>

That's thanks to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-hardware-report-project-keenan-next-gen-xbox-2027">a Windows Central report</a> that Microsoft is planning to partner with a "PC gaming OEM" for "an Xbox-branded gaming handheld" to be released later this year.

<p>For decades, Windows has been designed first and foremost for the world of large monitors driven by a mouse and keyboard world. When hardware makers try to simply stick that OS into a handheld screen size controlled by buttons and analog sticks, the results <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">can be awkward at best</a>.</p>
<p>To be worthy of the Xbox brand, Microsoft needs to design a front-end that is built from the ground up for handheld use case. That means large, easy-to-read design elements that can be easily navigated and selected without a mouse. It also means following SteamOS's example in surfacing the settings and tools most important to gamers.</p>
<p>Microsoft's years of experience building elegant controller-driven interfaces for the Xbox console line should give the company a leg up in building a similar interface on top of Windows. Thus far, though, Microsoft has shown no interest in re-creating that console-like interface through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-on-windows-10-what-it-is-what-it-isnt-and-whats-missing/">the Windows Xbox app</a>. Here's hoping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862655/microsoft-xbox-handheld-editorial-steam-deck">previous reports</a> that Microsoft is working on a "lightweight version" of the Xbox user interface for handheld gaming end up panning out.</p>

<p>While Windows has been the premier PC gaming operating system for a while now, the operating system as a whole is obviously <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/eleven-things-to-know-about-in-the-windows-11-2024-update/">designed for much more than gaming</a>. For a gaming-focused handheld, Microsoft needs to make a version of the operating system that's streamlined to focus on the tools and features game makers and players need without all the bloat associated with ones they don't.</p>
<p>The 2017 introduction of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/how-game-mode-will-make-games-run-better-on-windows/">Windows Game Mode</a> was a step in the right direction here, turning off unnecessary background processes and focusing CPU and memory resources on the game in question. And Microsoft's Xbox consoles have <a href="https://betawiki.net/wiki/Windows_Core_OS">long been built off a Windows core</a>, showing how the PC OS can be modified for gaming purposes.</p>
<p>For a dedicated gaming handheld, though, Microsoft should go even further and craft a miniature version of Windows that's laser-focused on running one game at a time on specific portable hardware. Besides streamlining performance, reducing OS overhead, and improving battery life, such a move would mean portable Xbox gamers won't have to worry about automatic printer driver updates or a bunch of mysterious background tasks clogging up their processor.</p>

<p>Any Xbox-branded portable gaming system will obviously integrate deeply with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/08/xbox-on-windows-10-what-it-is-what-it-isnt-and-whats-missing/">Microsoft's existing Windows Xbox App</a>. But it would be a mistake for Microsoft to restrict the hardware to that Microsoft-controlled platform. Players should be able to install games from competitors like Steam, the Epic Games Store, GoG, and others on their Xbox-branded handheld, even if that doesn't necessarily align with the branding.</p>
<p>This kind of functionality doesn't have to be front and center in the portable's streamlined UI; Microsoft could hide these features behind a special system option, a la <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/linux-on-steam-deck-what-you-need-to-know-what-currently-works/">the Steam Deck's Linux desktop mode</a>. But power users who don't want to limit themselves to Microsoft's online store will need to be able to treat their Xbox handheld like any other Windows device if they so choose.</p>

<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/microsoft-reveals-first-details-on-project-scarlett-game-console-for-2020/">made a lot of hay</a> over the way recent Xbox consoles can play games dating all the way back to the original Xbox. If Microsoft wants to set its first gaming handheld apart, it should make those old console games officially available on a Windows-based system for the first time.</p>
<p>The ability to download previous console games dating back to the Xbox 360 era (or beyond) would be an instant "system seller" feature for any portable Xbox. While this wouldn't be a trivial technical lift on Microsoft's part, the same <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2017-xbox-one-x-back-compat-how-does-it-actually-work">emulation layer that powers Xbox console backward compatibility</a> could surely be ported to Windows with a little bit of work. That process might be easier with a specific branded portable, too, since Microsoft would be working with full knowledge of what hardware was being used.</p>
<p>If Microsoft can give us a way to play <em>Geometry Wars 2</em> on the go without having to deal with finicky third-party emulators, we'll be eternally grateful.</p>

<p>On the console side, Microsoft's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/11/xbox-series-x-s-review-beautiful-powerful-but-whatcha-gonna-play/">split simultaneous release of the Xbox Series S and X</a> showed an understanding that not everyone wants to pay more money for the most powerful possible gaming hardware. Microsoft should extend this philosophy to gaming handhelds by releasing different tiers of portable Xbox hardware for price-conscious consumers.</p>
<p>Raw hardware power is the most obvious differentiator that could set a more expensive tier of Xbox portables apart from any cheaper options. But Microsoft could also offer portable options that reduce the overall bulk (a la the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/nintendo-switch-lite-is-the-best-portable-system-nintendo-has-ever-made/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>) or offer relative improvements in screen size and quality (a la <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the Steam Deck OLED</a> and Switch OLED).</p>

<p>One of the best things about console gaming is that you can be confident any game you buy for a console will "just work" with your hardware. In the world of PC gaming handhelds, Valve has tried to replicate this with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/valves-deck-verified-badge-will-show-which-games-run-well-on-steam-deck/">the "Deck Verified" program</a> to highlight Steam games that are guaranteed to work in a portable setting.</p>
<p>Microsoft is well-positioned to work with game publishers to launch a similar program for its own Xbox-branded portable. There's real value in offering gamers assurances that "Made for Xbox" PC games will "just work" on their Xbox-branded handheld.</p>
<p>This kind of verification system could also help simplify and clarify hardware requirements across different tiers of portable hardware power; any handheld marketed as "level 2" could play any games marketed as level 2 or below, for instance.</p>

Williams will be joined by over 200 legends, including returning players Babe Ruth, Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige, Ken Griffey Jr., and Derek Jeter. Some of the new additions include Roger Clemens and Manny Ramirez, as well as Negro Leagues legends Wilber “Bullet Joe” Rogan and James “Cool Papa” Bell.

Some truly great players emerged from that period, and the season mode will incorporate Negro Leagues legends through gameplay, historic footage, and "informative storytelling" from Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick. All of the Negro Leagues players from the first two seasons will be available at launch.</p><p>Unfortunately for PS4 and Xbox One players, MLB The Show 25 will be skipping those platforms and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">it won't be on Game Pass this year</a>. However, it will be heading to Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 on March 18.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a>'s latest collab with a musical artist appears to have leaked, and this time, Epic's popular battle-royale seems to be teaming up with none other than Kendrick Lamar.</p><p dir="ltr">Images of a cleverly named, Kdot-themed "Sit Down, Be Humble bundle" were <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1899497216546410966" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently shared on X</a> (formerly Twitter) by a prolific leaker. The bundle appears to include an emote and a song.</p><p dir="ltr">Fans hoping Kendrick might use the rumored Fortnite collab to take additional shots at rival rapper Drake may be disappointed, however, as the bundle seems to be themed around Lamar's 2017 single, "Humble." According to the leaker, the bundle includes the following items:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A Kendrick-themed dancing emote</li><li dir="ltr">A song (likely "Humble")</li></ul><p dir="ltr">However, a glance at the icon representing the emote has <a href="https://x.com/LustJinx/status/1899399679139360942" rel="nofollow ">some players convinced the emote is actually a part of a dance</a> from Lamar's iconic Drake diss track, "Not Like Us." But until Epic Games (or Lamar himself) confirms the collaboration, there's not much to do besides speculate. The bundle could include more than just the two items that have leaked, or could be a part of a bigger collaboration between the grammy-winning rapper and Fortnite. After all, Fortnite is no stranger to doing massive collaborations with extremely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ariana-grande-rift-tour-watch-it-here/1100-6494920/">popular musicians</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If the leak is legit, it certainly won't be the first time Lamar has fused gaming with his music. Lamar's Superbowl LIX halftime show performance saw him performing multiple hits (including "Not Like Us") on a massive stage that was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-kendrick-lamar-turned-his-super-bowl-halftime-show-into-a-giant-playstation-easter-egg/1100-6529357/">designed to look like a PlayStation controller</a>. According to Lamar's production company and collaborators, the performance was meant to represent Lamar's life as if it were a video game.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Gregory Shamus</em></p>

		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that BlizzCon will be back in 2026, with the weekend of September 12th and September 13th selected as the date of its return. It will be taking place in Anaheim, California. BlizzCon did not take place in 2024, and nor will it take place this year either. Obviously, it is a bit too far out to speculate on what to expect but World of Warcraft will likely be a central focus.</p>
<p><iframe title="BlizzCon | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrMT3bgU-fs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said, <em>“One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together. We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.”</em></p>
<p>BlizzCon 2026 tickets are not on sale but you can head to the official <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-gb">BlizzCon website</a> and sign up for updates on what to expect, and get notified for tickets.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-current-player-count/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-player-count-how-many-people-are-playing-fragpunk-in-2025.1131588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-current-player-count/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>FragPunk is a fresh tactical hero shooter with a unique twist, and the debut title from Bad Guitar Studio is already attracting a steadily growing player count in 2025.</p>



<p>There’s certainly no shortage of live-service online multiplayer titles, and in recent years there’s been an increase in tactical shooters and hero shooters. FragPunk falls under both categories, so how well is it doing in attracting players? The game only just released on March 6th, but the early results for FragPunk are pretty positive.</p>



<h2 id="h-fragpunk-player-count-march-2025">FragPunk Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>FragPunk’s player count peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2943650/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">113,946 players on Steam</a> during the game’s opening weekend. In the game’s first three full days, FragPunk reached a new peak each day: 63,958 players on March 7th, 85,203 on March 8th, and 113,946 on March 9th. Almost more impressively, FragPunk drew a player peak of over 100,000 players on March 10th on a Monday.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, the numbers for FragPunk are only for PC players on Steam. Just before the game’s PC launch, the devs announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-console-release-latest-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the console versions for PS5 and Xbox had been delayed</a> due to “unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation.” The console release for FragPunk has now been pushed back to an undetermined date.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fragpunk-worth-playing">Is FragPunk Worth Playing?</h2>



<p>As a free-to-play game trying something new in the hero/tactical shooter space, FragPunk is certainly worth trying and playing in 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What sets FragPunk apart from other shooters in the genre is its reliance on Shard Cards. In the game’s standard mode reminiscent of CS2, VALORANT, and Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy mode, the attacking team attempts to plant a Converter at a site while the other team defends. Players earn Shard points, and a team can use those points on Shard Cards in between rounds for unique buffs and effects. There are 169 different Shard Cards, each with its own unique effect. These effects range from basic movement or damage buffs to a “Turtleback” that blocks bullets from behind, or a snow effect that lets players slide around the map.</p>



<p>For the collector types, there are weapon skins, Lancer skins, stickers, and emotes to collect.</p>
