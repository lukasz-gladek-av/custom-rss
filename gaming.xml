		<p><em>We've been a bit sports-centric lately at Remap lately, albeit some of it against our will. We knew the Chicago Bears would garner a lot of attention this season, but we didn't anticipate it would look like...this. </em></p><p><em>This is our burden, our curse, and we're glad (??) to share it with you. It's always a treat to check Bluesky and seeing countless people doing sicko mode, hoping we'll record a podcast about yet another Chicago Bears misery event. Fortunately for you, we've obliged.</em></p><p><em>We don't always watch the Chicago Bears! Arguably, we shouldn't! But you watch enough sports for enough years that you start to develop really strong thoughts about how you're watching those sports, too.</em></p><p><em>You know Rob is on one when he randomly sends Patrick a link to a Google Docs page with several hundreds words strongly engaging with the format of a football television broadcast. </em></p><p><em>What else do you think we started Remap for?</em> </p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Now Patrick, you <em>know</em> I hate Jeff Bezos and Amazon Web Services <em>BUT: </em>I have to hand it to them: Thursday Night Football is the best broadcast in sports right now.</p><p>There are critiques you can level against it: the games are frequently bad, a problem that has dogged Thursday Night Football since the NFL started pushing it as a way to get more games into primetimes TV programming. By definition a Thursday night game is out-of-sync with the regular rhythm of an NFL season, and most of the times the teams playing it will be on short rest and reduced prep time, which makes for scrappier and less well-played games. Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit are not the most dynamic commentary duo, though I think most of the issues there is actually down to the fact that Herbstreit is about as workmanlike a color analyst as you can get.</p><p>But here’s the thing: TNF on Amazon is the only new NFL product in years that has rivaled or even surpassed Sunday Night Football on NBC. It’s sent out in HDR with a decent 1080 bitrate, which makes it visibly better-looking than any game I get through broadcast networks, a taste of what sports could and should look like if anyone had any incentive to make a better product. The audio mix is awesome, with calls at the line being audible alongside some detailed crowd noise (like the rattling bleachers at the Browns stadium in the snow game there a couple weeks ago). They are terrific at getting great asides, like Jameis Winston’s incredible pre-game speech before leading his team out against the Steelers, where he gets into a good rhythm and realizes he lost his point, so backtracks and clarifies what he meant, all without breaking his “tent revival preacher” persona.&nbsp;</p><p>So far that’s all just a normal football broadcast with a bit more attention to detail. But the thing that really differentiates it is the alternate broadcast, billed as Prime Vision with Next Gen Stats. It’s pitched as the broadcast for stats nerds (which is itself nice given how much gambling lines have overtaken statistical analysis in sports broadcast graphics) where analysis and AI work together to highlight key parts of the game. But the really nice feature of this broadcast is that uses <em>Madden</em>-style spotlighting on key personnel, which makes it <em>way </em>easier to see receiver and pass rusher groupings before the play, and it uses camera angles that give you a better look at football than any other broadcast.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the time the Prime Vision broadcast uses a wider shot akin to the beloved All-22, where you can see the whole field of play at once, which is the only way for modern football to be comprehensible given the way the passing game has become the cornerstone of the whole league. But they’ve also leaned hard on an overhead angle this year that lets you see the play almost from the perspective of the whiteboard play diagram where every football play is born. As someone who loves watching line play, that angle is the only one that really lets you see how the defense brings pressure and how the offense tries (or fails) to counter it. Crucially, it also really lets you see how critical it is to open up sightlines for the quarterback, which is an aspect of the game that totally gets lost in the side-on view most broadcasts use.</p><p>Amazon is the only player in the sports space that seems to have really thought about how you can present a match in a modern context. Maybe some of their approach was influenced by their need to do a dog-and-pony show for AWS and the various enhancements “AI” can supposedly make to everyday tasks, but it does seem like that brief led them to a novel and more thoughtful production. It really highlights how small and unambitious most of the other broadcasters are in their thinking. You start the week off with Thursday Night Football where you’re getting this rich, cutting-edge presentation and then on Sunday you’re watching Fox, where the big innovation between 2023 and 2024 was sticking a headset on Tom Brady.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@helloimnik?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Nik</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>You are the second person to bring up Amazon Prime Video’s special way of showing the game to me. They stumbled upon it while trying to mess with the configuration options, and suddenly went “hey, uh, did you realize you can watch the game in this completely different way that’s extremely cool?”</p><p>The weirdest part about watching football, compared to just about any other sport, is your inability to fully grasp what is happening on the field. In other sports, replays are important for, say, trying to understand an injury or why a flag was thrown. In football, it’s often because you cannot fucking tell what happened while you were watching, whether because of the sport’s increasingly byzantine rules that determines whether a catch happened, or because the default angle does not accurately portray the flow of plays.</p><p>But this also leads to one of my favorite moments in any football game, when the camera operator, who has most likely been filming football games for a huge chunk of their life, is tricked by what unfolds on the play. Their camera movements follow where the ball is <em>supposed</em> to go, but in reality, it’s going <em>something else entirely</em>. You watch as the camera jerks towards the action and buddy, I’m chuckling the whole time.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s actually kinda interesting how little has changed between the origins of NFL broadcasting and now?</p><p>I mean, check out one of the first broadcast NFL games. Naturally, it has the Green Bay Packers:</p>

<p>In the early 2000s, Sony faced a new competitor to its PlayStation business when Microsoft launched the original Xbox. With that new competition sparked a genuine concern from Sony that led to them getting exclusive release rights to the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) games of the era for the PlayStation 2.</p>



<p>Chris Deering, the former president of PlayStation Europe, recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz,</a> and shed some light as to why  PlayStation wanted an exclusive agreement for GTA 3, GTA: Vice City, and GTA: San Andreas.</p>



<p>“We were worried when we saw Xbox coming,” Deering said. “We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields, like Sky TV with sports. Just as Christmas was approaching when Xbox would launch, a few of us went out to our favourite third-party publishers and developers, and we asked them, ‘How would you like a special deal if you keep your next generation game on PlayStation exclusive for a two-year period?’ And one of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn’t clear that Grand Theft Auto 3 was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game.”</p>



<p>Deering added that PlayStation was “lucky” with the deal because of how it paid off for the company. </p>



<p>“It was very lucky for us,” he said. “And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid.”</p>







<p>The games ultimately saw a release on Xbox, but not before they became the best-selling games in the history of PS2. San Andreas became the best-selling PS2 game ever while the other two games, Vice City and GTA 3, became the third- and fifth-best selling games.</p>



<p>GTA 3 and Vice City released on Xbox on November 4, 2003 while San Andreas came to Xbox in June 2005.</p>

The year-long wait for more information has fueled increasingly bizarre conspiracy theories about when Rockstar will release GTA 6 Trailer 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These have included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/on-the-gta-6-trailers-1-year-anniversary-fans-are-debating-youtube-playlist-updates-and-batting-away-misleading-ai-generated-images">counting the holes in Lucia’s cell door net</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/were-now-at-the-bullet-holes-and-braille-stage-of-gta-6-fan-theory">bullet holes in the car from Trailer 1</a>, and even registration plates as they hunt for GTA 6 clues. But chief among the conspiracy theories is GTA 6’s ongoing moon watch, which was, remarkably, proven to have accurately predicted the date Rockstar announced when it would release GTA 6 Trailer 1 last December, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">debunked as a hint at the release date for Trailer 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mike York, who worked as an animator at Rockstar New England for six years helping to build Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 before leaving the company in 2017, is a big fan of all the fuss, taking to <a href="https://youtu.be/TnTIV8AFs2o?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his YouTube channel</a> to explain that the developers at Rockstar will be getting a kick out of it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"All the developers over there are geeking out about it, trust me," he said. "When I was over there I would have little conversations with people and be like, ‘Did you hear this person found this mystery?’ And they’d go, ‘Oh yeah!’ "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York also suggested that Rockstar is playing up to the conspiracy theories, deliberately avoiding saying anything about the game or when Trailer 2 will be released in order to fuel even more speculation within the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They're reaching and pulling and trying to come up with these really cool theories to decipher when the next trailer will be,” he said of fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Specifically Rockstar, they're very secretive about what they do, and this is a really cool tactic because it creates allure and it creates mystery and it creates people talking about it without them having to do anything. The more they're silent the better it is, because the more people will be antsy and want to talk about it and have this feeling of not knowing what's going to happen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">York went on to say that Rockstar is likely resisting pressure from its army of fans to announce the GTA 6 Trailer 2 release date for this exact reason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They could easily release the trailer date and be like, ‘Hey this is when the trailer's coming out,’ but they don't do it. And they don't do it on purpose because it's a really, really good marketing tactic. If you think about it, it creates these really cool theories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This brings the fans together. This is a really cool way to get fans to talk about your game when you’re not releasing anything yet, in-between the times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All these theories are great. They only create hype, they create talk, they create mystery behind the games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Rockstar actually be placing clues to things like trailer release dates in GTA Online images, as the moon theory has suggested? Probably not, York said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of these things are like trolls,” he added. “It’s a mystery to nowhere. It’s just to have you dig in there and search for stuff and find it. And even though it won’t lead to something, it’s something that can bring a chase and a journey and an adventure for all these players for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a developer, it was really cool to sit down and look at these comments that people leave and these conspiracy theories that they come up with, because a lot of them are super elaborate, and they take a lot of time to come up with. It really goes to show the passion behind all these fans behind this franchise, because these people are taking hours and hours and hours out of their day to try to go after these theories, and it’s really fun.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It <em>is</em> remarkable that Rockstar has gone a year without following up GTA 6 Trailer 1 with any new information at all. With GTA 6's fall 2025 release window on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S still on the cards, according to Take-Two, you’d expect Rockstar to pipe up sooner rather than later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you wait to find out, IGN has much more on GTA 6 to check out, including an ex-Rockstar dev who says <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-delayed-to-2026-one-ex-rockstar-dev-says-the-studio-probably-wont-be-able-to-make-that-call-until-may-2025"><u>the studio probably won’t be able to decide whether GTA 6 is delayed until May 2025</u></a>, the boss of Take-Two's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-gta-6-coming-to-pc-take-two-boss-has-a-coy-response"><u>coy response on whether GTA 6 is coming to PC</u></a>, and the expert opinion on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts"><u>whether the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 60 frames per second</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The company’s next big game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, was delayed into 2025, and Star Wars Outlaws failed to meet sales expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reuters</a>, Ubisoft shareholders are “considering” how to structure a possible buyout of the French company without reducing the founding Guillemot family’s control. The Guillemot family is the largest shareholder in Ubisoft and is reportedly in talks with Tencent and “other investors” as it seeks funding a management buyout. Tencent is the second-largest shareholder in Ubisoft with 10% and, according to Reuters, has yet to decide whether to fund the buyout.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/gettyimages-2179673307-1733497661112.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to 2025. Photo by Dimitar DILKOFF / AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Reuters said Tencent’s indecision is “partly because it has asked for a greater say on future board decisions including cash flow distribution in return for financing the deal.” Apparently the Guillemot family has yet to agree to those terms, but Tencent is willing to wait for them to come around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tencent declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, with a Guillemot family rep failing to respond. But a Ubisoft spokesperson did comment, saying: "We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft’s shares fell to their lowest level in the last decade in September after it made a series of dramatic announcements around the performance of its games. As well as delaying Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Ubisoft announced a return to Steam after a period of PC launch exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, with Star Wars Outlaws recently releasing on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This latest news comes hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">Ubisoft's announcement that it plans to shut down Call of Duty competitor XDefiant</a> and its production studios in San Francisco and Osaka while ramping down its site in Sydney, with up to 277 employees losing their jobs. Roughly half of the XDefiant team will be assigned roles elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shares in Ubisoft are up 12.52% today, December 6, following the Tencent buyout reports.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">It's beautiful, and no, Digital Foundry isn't talking about the Lost Ark. The tech-analysis outfit examined Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on console--comparing Series X and Series S versions--coming away impressed with what developer MachineGames has done on the platforms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry's tech review</a> by John Linneman states that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/" data-ref-id="1100-6520456">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> maintains 60fps on both consoles (for the most part) while utilizing ray tracing. Linneman explains that it's rare for a console title to offer open-ended levels, ray tracing, and 60fps together and still perform well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8I4SsQTqaY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b8I4SsQTqaY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">However, there are odd frame-rate dips during cutscenes for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Linneman writes that unlike the developer's Wolfenstein series, all cutscenes in this title are rendered in real time. But, other than this quirk, the action-adventure game runs "perfect[ly] on console" from a performance perspective. In fact, loading times are so fast they're barely noticeable, noted Linneman.</p><p dir="ltr">The Xbox Series X version of the game is better looking, offering 1800p most of the time from a visual perspective. Meanwhile, Series S sits around 1080p or lower. This leads to a blurrier presentation, even a bit blotchy at times. In addition, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has more of a glow and worse shadows on Xbox Series S.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this week, we learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-will-let-you-shoot-puzzles-with-your-camera-to-solve-them/1100-6528192/" data-ref-id="1100-6528192">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will let you shoot puzzles (with your camera) to solve them</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-unlock-times-and-how-to-play-early/1100-6528168/" data-ref-id="1100-6528168">The game is already unlocked</a> for people who purchased the Premium or Collector's editions of the title.

Each set will include 400 cards and a playmat with rule variants for more casual play and tournament settings. The tabletop companies say the physical edition has the “full support” of CD Projekt Red. </p><p>The beauty of Gwent was two-fold. First, it was perfectly integrated into the larger world of <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Monster slayer Geralt of Rivia could challenge opponents at the pub or in the royal court and wager money, collecting cards and expanding his reputation, including through a Gwent tournament with important ties to the narrative. Second, the game itself was thoughtful but streamlined, letting players bluff and deploy clever tactics without having to engage in some of the more convoluted TCG mechanics of a <em>Hearthstone</em> or <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="cea96d43113b6930442c55f5472b34d5" data-recommend-id="image://cea96d43113b6930442c55f5472b34d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2295" data-height="1291" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Renders of the physical Gwent cards are displayed.

            <p>A few details on Hazelight Studios' next game have leaked ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>According to the ever reliable billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733">Dealabs</a>, we will be seeing a release of the studio's upcoming game - reportedly known as Split Fiction - as soon as 6th March, 2025. The game will reportedly be available on PC and unspecified consoles.</p>
<p>Allegedly, Hazelight (best known for its couch co-op platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>) will share a trailer for Split Fiction this month, likely at The Game Awards next week. The awards are scheduled to take place on 12th December, or for those of us in the UK, at 12.30am on Friday, 13th December.</p>

<p>Hazelight founder Josef Fares shared a tease for the studio's yet-to-actually-be-announced game earlier in the year, with an enigmatic post on social media which promised "a BRAND NEW IP called S*** ******N".</p>
<p>At this time, our own <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-two-developer-teases-next-project-s-n">Matt Wales suggested the game could be called 'Sexy Bassoon'</a>, and to be honest, I am slightly disappointed it is looking less likely that this is its name. Anyway, not much longer until we find out more about what Hazelight has been cooking up since It Takes Two.</p>

This meant the game had sold a further 4m copies since March of this year, when the developer announced the game had sold 16m.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, a game that they describe as a turn-based beat ’em up coming to PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TMNT Tactical Takedown puts you in control of each of the four turtles as they take the fight to the Foot Clan in turn-based tactical battles. Each level drops your turtle into a small space with a bunch of enemies, charging you with dispatching all the foes as quickly as possible using their specific movesets to control the space and movement.</p>
<p>There’s some obvious parallels to Fights in Tight Spaces, and before that mini turn-based tactical Into the Breach as well, but those comparisons are hardly a bad thing. It just proves that this concept can work really, really well.</p>
<p>The game comes from Strange Scaffold, the developer behind I Am Your Beast, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more.</p>

<p>Studio founder Xalavier Nelson Jr. said, “Building a truly powerful licensed game requires a deep respect for the source material, love for the fans, and a willingness to challenge tentpoles of the universe to create something that both surprises and delights.</p>
<p>Bringing that kind of experience to life requires an equally powerful relationship – so I will be forever grateful to Doug Rosen and the team at Paramount for their collaboration, and putting their trust in our team to make an original take on the world that soars. I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?”</p>
<p>We’re in a rich period for TMNT fans and gamers, with the recent resurgence of the beat ’em up genre seeing the great new release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Shredder’s Revenge</a> and retro revival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">Cowabunga Collection</a>, as well as new genre spin-offs with the roguelike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>. Just avoid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-arcade-wrath-of-the-mutants-review/">Wrath of the Mutants</a> – that one’s not a very good game…</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2-focused event is being planned for May, suggesting, together with industry chatter, that the console could be released this June.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the latest episode of their podcast</a>, well-known insider NateDrake provided an update on the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing and potential release date. Commenting on the rumored June release window for the system that's been making the rounds in the past few days, the insider mentioned that as of late September, early October, there's been a lot of industry chatter that placed the Nintendo Switch 2 release window between late May to June.&nbsp;There's still some uncertainty regarding this, but partners and publishers have been considering it as the release window for the system for the time being.</p>
<p>While NateDrake could not confirm if the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed releasing in the late May-June release window, the insider did reveal that an event focused on the system is currently being planned for May. The nature of the event is not clear, but it could be similar to the January 2017 event where Nintendo invited the media for some hands-on time with the original Switch. If the Japanese company was following a similar timeframe, the timing of the event suggests that the Nintendo Switch 2 could indeed be released in June, which would be a great time to launch the system with the hands-on opportunities that could be offered during summer events like the Summer Game Fest and PAX East to generate more buzz on the system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2: Release Target &amp; Reveal Timing -- What We Know; Switch Surprise in 2025?

<p>There's little doubt that partners are getting ready for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, as images and listings for the new<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/"> Joy-Con controller</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/">accessories</a> have started appearing online. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to finally see what Nintendo has been working on for reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">quite a long time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games continues to tout the growth of its VALORANT esports scene, now having completed two seasons of its international partnership league. Like it does with League of Legends, Riot has completely run VALORANT esports all by itself since the game launched in 2020.</p>



<p>Prior to the start of the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Riot has announced the end-of-year results for its 2024 campaign, revealing yet another massive chunk of change brought in by player spending.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-comes-the-money">Here comes the money</h2>



<p>According to Riot, the company shared $44.3 million from digital goods with the partnered teams competing in VCT 2024, up from <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-US/news/vct-2023-eoy-letter-to-the-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$33 million in 2023</a>. With 44 teams competing across the four leagues last year, that averages out to just about $1 million per team. Since Riot takes 50 percent of the revenue from digital goods, that means that players spent roughly $88.6 million in total on VCT-themed digital goods.</p>



<p>The digital goods in question refer to two primary items: VCT partner team capsules and the Champions bundle. At the start of the year, Riot introduced VCT partner team capsules, which both teams and fans were highly anticipating. Each team had a bundle with a team-specific Classic pistol skin, a player card designed by the team itself, a logo gun buddy (charm), and a logo spray. New capsules are expected to be released near the start of the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The other main draw for digital goods is the yearly Champions bundle, which includes unique weapon skins and accessories celebrating the VALORANT world championship. This year, for the first time, all partnered teams received a share of Champions bundle revenue, not just the 16 teams that qualified for the event.</p>



<p>Between digital goods, stipends, and prize pool winnings, Riot claims to have given out $78.4 million across the 44 partnered teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a specific VALORANT team bundle you want to buy next year? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studio%E2%80%99s-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online.1053915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studios-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next title developed by Hazelight Studios has leaked online from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, who has said that the next game is called Split Fiction and is due out on March 6, 2025, on PC and console. Of course, this is just a leak for now, so we don't know whether it is true or not, and you'll have to take it with a pinch of salt. It's said that a reveal trailer for the game is supposed to be released this month and that the game will be announced at The Game Awards, which will be taking place next week.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios has Josef Fares at the helm, the designer of A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and It Takes Two. All of these games are published under EA's Originals banner. Split Fiction has the potential to be great, as all three of those games have won awards, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-it-takes-two-2022-bafta-games-awards-nominations/">It Takes Two</a> winning the most out of the three and being nominated for many more. With that in mind, it's a fair assumption to feel that Split Fiction will equally be full of promise.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is apparently another co-op adventure game being made by Hazelight, which, considering the games that both Hazelight and Josef Fares have worked on, it makes total sense that this is the direction they would go with, especially with the wide success of It Takes Two.</p>
<p>It is known that Hazelight Studios has been working on a new game, as both the Hazelight Studios and Josef Fares social media accounts posted about the upcoming title, confirming that a game was in development. Josef Fares even goes on to post, "Here is a tease. It is a BRAND NEW IP called S**** ******N. Can't wait to show it soon." Considering the number of letters censored and what it begins and starts with, it seems that billbil-kun is right on the money about the title of the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have more details than that, and you'll have to wait and see if the upcoming title Split Fiction is announced by Hazelight Studios at The Game Awards, which is only a week away.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-and-krafton-announce-payday-pubg-crossover.1053906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze and Krafton have announced a&nbsp;<em>PUBG Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, with the latter set to infiltrate the world of the former through what sounds like a new gameplay experience within&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-partners-with-krafton-to-expand-payday-into-pubg-battlegrounds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement on Starbreeze's website</a>, the studio says the crossover is about increasing "the visibility and reach of the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise", which Starbreeze aims to do by "bringing the heisting experience to a broader audience through&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>".</p>

<p>It's a goal that Starbreeze rather desperately needs to chase right now, since&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s in a bit of a tight spot. Recently, <em>Payday 3</em> saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">its director step down</a> in the run-up to its first anniversary, and the game's poor performance also led to Starbreeze's CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">quitting back in March</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=n-GvAGi8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=qXEtFWam 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the explosive, high-octane world of&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement, the collaboration will involve "about a quarter of Starbreeze's development organization during a year" under what Starbreeze calls a "work-for-hire agreement".</p>

<p>It sounds, then, like Starbreeze will be creating the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>content that will make its way into&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The two studios say they're "currently collaborating on the project's integration roadmap", and we'll get more updates later down the line.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky road for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, with Starbreeze admitting back in February that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">performing at "significantly lower levels"</a> than it wanted.</p>

<p>Perhaps more embarrassingly for Starbreeze,&nbsp;<em>Payday 2&nbsp;</em>is currently leagues ahead of&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the Steam player count stakes; at last count,&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was 860</a>, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s stood at a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">far more respectable 38,324</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-payday-3.jpg?itok=fTOWGsuF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-payday-3.jpg?itok=3S0I-Y21 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Starbreeze isn't having the best time of it when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton, meanwhile, is in a very strong position when it comes to&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The game's 24-hour Steam player peak is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/578080/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a princely 756,872</a>, which probably goes some way towards explaining why Starbreeze wants to integrate&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>into the battle royale hit.</p>

<p>With regards to the two studios' future plans, Krafton is currently working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of survival hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, and it's also overseeing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">a sequel</a> to&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, the IP for which (along with developer Tango Gameworks) it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">bought earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>Starbreeze, meanwhile, is engaged in a multi-stage plan to try and improve&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s fortunes, and the studio is also working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">multiplayer game using the&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>IP</a>.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, Ubisoft's family founders are trying to find funding to keep the company in good financial standing while simultaneously attempting to keep control of the firm's future.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reports that the Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--is talking to Tencent and other financial partners to try to find a way to fund a "management-led buyout."</p><p>CEO Yves Guillemot and his family members are keen to retain control of Ubisoft amid any such deal, and this has apparently been a sticking point in financing discussions. The report said Tencent is asking for a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for putting more money into Ubisoft.

                <p>The world of The Witcher is full of monsters, madmen, and mages, but when Geralt isn't on the trail of any of those, the man knows how to wind down with a game of Gwent. The two-player card game has the players as generals pitting their armies against each other. There's been a Gwent mobile app and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284410/GWENT_The_Witcher_Card_Game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free-to-play version on Steam</a>, but now a physical reproduction of the game is on its way.</p><p>Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games--which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming--are collaborating on the release. The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to give players that authentic Witcher 3 experience. There will be variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p><p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said the marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK, Rob Trounce (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-card-game-gwent-finally-getting-a-physical-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package--whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p><p>The rules are simple enough, but the path to victory has several routes, all depending on your deck, which has its own set of advantages. There are four decks to choose from: Monsters, Nilfgaardian Empire, Northern Realms, and Scoia'tael. A fifth deck--Skellige--was added with The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion. There are also neutral cards that, while not a deck in itself, can be used with any of the main decks to boost their abilities.</p><p>Matches are won by two out of three rounds, which are tallied by red gems in the game. Losing a round loses you one of the points, and if you lose both, you lose the match. A draw makes both players lose a point unless you are the Nilfgaardian Empire, whose ability is to win matches that end in draws.</p><p>The entire Gwent game set is priced at around $40 and will arrive in late 2025.</p><p>While Witcher fans won't have to wait too long for Gwent, they'll have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-devs-tease-some-of-what-cd-projekt-red-is-planning/1100-6528173/" data-ref-id="1100-6528173">bit longer for The Witcher 4</a>. Though the game has reached full-scale production, we're still looking at two years before the release.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker  private, a new report states.
</p>
<p>
The move - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">first mooted last month</a> - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders. Today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/">Reuters</a> reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control.
</p>
<p>
However, the same report states that Tencent - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.

<p>
Talks remain ongoing between the two companies on how to move forward. Ubisoft stock spiked 14 percent today as a result of the report.
</p>
<p>
"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders" a spokesperson for Ubisoft told Eurogamer today. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."
</p>
<p>The buyout talks come after a particularly rocky year for Ubisoft, which has suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, staff walkouts, and disappointing sales of key titles. </p>
<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed its biggest upcoming launch Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until 14th February 2025, after seeing "softer than expected" sales for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of several studios, with the loss of 277 employees, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulls the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that the Guillemot family and Tencent were planning a buyout of Ubisoft, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the company's shareholders are still discussing buyout terms. One of the key issues is that the Guillemot family wants to maintain control over Ubisoft following the buyout.</p>
<p>Chinese giant Tencent is already the second-largest shareholder. However, despite earlier rumors, Reuters says they haven't decided yet whether to increase their stake and, therefore, join the buyout proposal. Tencent would like to exert greater control on board decisions (such as the distribution of cash flow) if it has to finance the deal, but the Guillemots haven't agreed to that yet. At the same time, Tencent also seeks to prevent any takeover of the company from third parties. As such, their strategy is reportedly to wait and see if the Guillemot family will sign on the proposal.</p>
<p>An Ubisoft spokesperson has released the following statement to accompany Reuters' article:</p>
<p><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like the Guillemots will have to give up on their long-standing goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-confirms-avatar-mario-rabbids-and-skull-bones-for-fy-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping Ubisoft independent</a>. As you may recall, it's not the first time they had trouble with that, as Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover a few years ago. They were ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-and-vivendi-the-cutain-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsuccessful</a>, and Ubisoft enjoyed a brief reprieve.</p>
<p>However, it would not last. First came the accusations of sexual misconduct, which brought their own issues for the company to face. More recently, even game launches were not as successful as planned due to commercially underwhelming games like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones, XDefiant (which will shut down in a few months, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> yesterday), and Star Wars Outlaws. Ubisoft was even forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows, losing millions of dollars to try and prevent the same fate from befalling its premiere franchise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>sales have hit a big milestone less than a month after the JRPG remake's launch.</p>

<p>Per a press release, sales of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>have reached the two million mark across all platforms. That number includes both physical shipments and digital sales.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that number meets, exceeds, or falls short of Square Enix's sales expectations. However, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">recently stated</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>fell short of its projections, so it'll no doubt be looking for some successes to reassure shareholders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-world-map.jpg?itok=MIaAUDky 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-world-map.jpg?itok=NnSjXec3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>'s sales have hit a big milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name. It's a remake of the classic 1988 RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>&nbsp;with a new coat of paint courtesy of Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark</a> HD-2D style.</p>

<p>The new remake (for it isn't the first remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>) makes a number of changes, including the addition of difficulty options, voice acting at certain points in the game, and changes to the story.</p>

<p>Specifically, the narrative has been altered in order to make&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>fit in better with the HD-2D remakes of the first two games, which are set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>also contains a number of quality-of-life improvements, including increased movement speed, a minimap to help you explore the overworld, and more.</p>

<p>The battle system has also received a makeover; while it retains the basic essence of the original game's combat, you now view the action from a zoomed-out perspective, allowing you to see your characters as they fight.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<p>The talks surrounding a potential buyout at Ubisoft continue to pick up steam.

<p>In a new report by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>, Ubisoft’s owners have continued discussions with Tencent and other investors regarding a buyout of one of the world’s largest game studios. According to the report, the Guillemot family has made it known to potential buyers that it wants to retain control of the company.</p>

<p>Tencent is the second-largest stockholder in Ubisoft, owning 10% of the company. A reason for a delay in a decision stems from the company wanting a “greater say on future board decisions including cash flow distribution”. The report claims that the Guillemot family hasn’t agreed to that provision.</p>



<p>In response to the report, an Ubisoft spokesperson told Reuters, “We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.”</p>



<p>Tencent declined to comment on the report.</p>



<p>When the latest update first broke, stock trading for the company was temporarily suspended. However, upon resuming, share prices jumped 13% as of publishing. </p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the cancellation</a> of its free-to-play Call of Duty competitor XDefiant. Insider Gaming was the first to report on the game’s shutdown.</p>
