            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged Games has announced <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em>. The tabletop studio known for creating complex bespoke tabletop games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runescape-kingdoms-shadow-of-elvarg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Runescape Kingdoms</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-announces-sea-of-thieves-voyage-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> will bring Arrowhead Game Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter to gaming tables.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Helldivers 2: The Board Game will be produced through a crowdfunding campaign on Gamefound. Much like the Helldivers 2 videogame, the board game will be a fast-paced, tactical co-op game for one to four players. Those players will utilize deadly weapons, powerful stratagems, and coordinated tactics to overcome enemy threats in service of Super Earth.</p>

Objectives and threats will evolve as players progress. This will mean avoiding dangerous explosions, overwhelming waves of enemies, and the most dangerous threat of all: friendly fire. Every decision you make can mean the difference between glorious victory or total annihilation.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> released on PC and PlayStation 5 in February 2024. It is one of PlayStation's fastest selling video games, selling over 12 million copies within its first 12 weeks. In addition, it has several accolades such as Best Multiplayer from the 2024 Golden Joystick Awards and The Game Awards 2024.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios' CEO Shams Jorjani said the following about working with Steamforged Games on <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As passionate tabletop gamers ourselves, we're delighted to partner with Steamforged to bring Helldivers 2 into a whole new realm. The game's intense action is a perfect fit for the tabletop experience, and we can't wait for players to blast their way through its chaotic and challenging missions soon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steamforged Games' reputation in tabletop games is stellar. In addition to making impressive board games based on videogame properties, they have also produced great TTRPG products and accessories such as their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Epic Encounters</em></a> miniature boxes.</p>

<p>The Gamefound campaign for <em>Helldivers 2: The Board Game</em> will go live on April 8, 2025.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Following a hugely successful launch that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hits-1m-sales-in-just-one-day">over 1m people snapping up Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in just 24 hours</a>, developer Warhorse Studios continues to plug away at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-post-launch-roadmap-bringing-barbers-horse-riding-and-more">post-release roadmap</a>. And that brings us to today, and the release of the medieval action-RPG's 1.2 update, adding mod support, a barber shop, and "over a thousand" fixes and improvements.
</p>
<p>
According to Warhorse, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>'s 1.2 update features "a host of fixes, improvements, and rebalancing tweaks" designed to ensure "a smoother, more immersive medieval experience". These include combat refinements, enhanced NPC behaviour, more polished animations, and performance optimisations. The update also improves the physics of your parsnip, which (probably) isn't a euphemism.
</p>
<p>
The full list of changes is long enough that it's probably safer to <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2">link to Warhorse's patch notes</a> rather than risk breaking this page. But the flagship additions include Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's aforementioned barber shops and PC-only mod support. Starting with the former, those looking for a natty follicular makeover will be wanting to visit Zhelejov and Kuttenberg. Here, they can change protagonist Henry's hairstyle or pick from a variety of facial hair options, including designer stubble, a full beard, or simply clean-shaven. Regardless, a fresh trim isn't just for aesthetics - it'll temporarily buff Henry's charisma.

<p>
As for mod support, it's described as a new suite of tools offering greater accessibility and direct Steam Workshop integration. "Whether you want to tweak mechanics, expand the world, or forge entirely new adventures, the tools are in your hands," writes Warhorse. "Get ready to create, customise, and bring your own vision to life in the medieval world."
</p>
<p>
Today's 1.2 update - which is available for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC - marks the first in a series of free post-launch additions for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, previously revealed to include horse racing and a new Hardcode Mode promising a "greater challenge". That's alongside three paid story expansions - Brushes with Death, Legacy of the Forge, and Mysteria Ecclesia - due this summer, autumn, and winter respectively.
</p>
<p>
"It is a hard and maddening slog at times," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle wrote of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">her three star review</a>, "but one that still has its moments where it surprises and quietly delights. Like the original, this isn't an RPG designed to make you feel good - you continue to be little more than a passenger in this historical tapestry, following along behind the horse tails of Henry's betters, and clearing up the mess they leave behind. Some will revel in that work, but I for one won't be chomping at the bit for another sequel any time soon."

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has unveiled Rainbow Six Siege X, the next evolution of the multiplayer shooter, coming at the start of Y10 S2 on June 10. Not to be confused with the Rainbow Six Siege 2 some may have been expecting, the update makes a ton of changes to Rainbow Six Siege, big and small. Those include the first new permanent game mode since launch, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dual-front-brings-fast-paced-6v6-action-to-rainbow-six-siege/1100-6530104/" data-ref-id="1100-6530104">6v6 Dual Front</a>, which is designed to provide a new tactical experience for long-time players, as well as a friendly mode for new players to learn the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the big reveal I got to spend a few hours playing Dual Front, as well as the classic 5v5 mode on modernized versions of existing maps, which have drastically improved lighting and textures, plus a few other changes to the classic formula. While the name and framing might make it seem similar to other live-service titles getting major updates as sequels, like Overwatch 2, Siege X is more about bringing the decade-old-shooter up to modern standards, without losing anything in the process.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dual Front brings faster paced action to Siege</h2><p dir="ltr">Dual Front is a new permanent 6v6 mode coming to Rainbow Six Siege X when the update launches. This mode features one large map, with two lanes on each side and a neutral zone in the middle. Each lane has two sectors, which serve as small maps, leading into the enemy team's base. Team's will be tasked with taking control of the enemy sectors, one at a time, while also defending their own. How you decide to split up your team of six is up to you, and when players are killed, they do respawn after a roughly 30-second wait. When you respawn, you also have the option to swap operators, with a mix of offensive and defensive operators available. Matches are expected to last around 20-25 minutes, with a maximum of 30 minutes, which lined up with my experience while playing. A match could end much quicker if one team moves through sectors without much resistance.</p><p dir="ltr">While the mode sounds overwhelming on paper, in practice it's a distilled version of Siege. Each sector has a small building, like a gas station or firehouse, which serves as the map. These sectors are also mirrored structurally, so each team has the exact same objectives, although each side of the map does have a slightly different aesthetic. Each team only has one sector active at a time, so the action gets focused into the smaller area. These feature multiple potential sites for planting a bomb, with one chosen randomly at the start of the match. During my time playing Dual Front, I found the mode to offer tons of new strategies not present in the main 5v5 mode.</p><p dir="ltr">In our first match, the team split up into groups of three, one focused on offense and one on defense. The enemy team ended up doing something similar, but after we took over the first enemy sector, they shifted to having more team members on defense, allowing us to send some defenders on the attack. You can get from one end of the map to the other fairly quickly by moving through the neutral zone in the center, but you risk running into enemy players. You also have the option to move through your own sectors and base for a safer, but much longer path, but there is nothing stopping you from moving from one objective to another as needed.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the strategy comes in, is that you don't know just how many players on the enemy team are focused on each objective. At the start of the second match, we sent five people on attack and left one on defense. This worked out well for the first set of sectors, as their defense wasn't prepared for that many people, and the attackers didn't know just how many people were defending our objective, causing them to play too cautiously against a single defender.</p><p dir="ltr">The other new wrinkle here is that the operator limitations are no longer based on offense and defense. Dual Front will feature a pool of operators--35 at the launch of Siege X--which will rotate twice per season. Creative Director Alexander Karpazis told me that the number isn't set in stone, with plans to shift the pool significantly and with built-in synergies, to allow for the mode to feel different season-to-season.</p><p dir="ltr">I picked Frost, a defensive operator who can place bear traps that will down enemies who step on them. After pushing on offense and planting on their sector, we had to defend it for a few minutes as the capture meter ticked up. With a defensive operator and access to wall reinforcements, I was able to lock down the objective for us to hold it, quickly shifting our offense to defense.</p><p dir="ltr">As for future plans for Dual Front, Karpazis told me that while the current plans are to evolve the map every season with small changes and different operator pools, but depending on the community's reaction to Dual Front, there could be more maps and even potentially a ranked mode in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual Front also gave me a chance to see some of the new additions coming with Siege X that will also appear in the classic 5v5 mode. Rappelling has been upgraded, adding the ability to sprint along the side of buildings and to turn corners. New "Destructible Ingredients" are additions to the environment that provide new tactics. For example, fire extinguishers are now present, which create a smoke screen when shot and will concuss nearby players. There are gas pipes, which spew fire when shot before exploding, letting you block off a pathway temporarily, or blow up any gadgets nearby. These are found throughout the Dual Front map and the new 5v5 modernized maps.</p><h2 dir="ltr">5v5 modernized maps and ranked improvements</h2><p dir="ltr">Rainbow Six Siege X will also include five modernized maps: Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Kafe, and Border. Modernized means multiple pretty significant changes, but none of them are to the map layouts themselves. Those are the same, including the bomb sites, but the feel is quite different, thanks to some improved looks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458920-pvp04_clubhouse_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458920-pvp04_clubhouse_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458920"></a><figcaption>The new look for Clubhouse</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458920-pvp04_clubhouse_intlarge.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458921-pvp04_clubhouse_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458922-pvp09_bank_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458923-pvp09_bank_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458924-pvp10_chalet_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458925-pvp10_chalet_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458926-pvp12_russiancafe_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458927-pvp13_border_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458928-pvp13_border_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458929-r6x_ka-16_9_largelarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458921,1300-4458922,1300-4458923,1300-4458924,1300-4458925,1300-4458926,1300-4458927,1300-4458928,1300-4458929" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458921-pvp04_clubhouse_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458922-pvp09_bank_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458923-pvp09_bank_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458924-pvp10_chalet_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458925-pvp10_chalet_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458926-pvp12_russiancafe_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458927-pvp13_border_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458928-pvp13_border_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4458929-r6x_ka-16_9_largelarge.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458921-pvp04_clubhouse_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458922-pvp09_bank_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458923-pvp09_bank_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458924-pvp10_chalet_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458925-pvp10_chalet_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458926-pvp12_russiancafe_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458927-pvp13_border_extlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458928-pvp13_border_intlarge.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458929-r6x_ka-16_9_largelarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The three most important changes are to textures, lighting, and sound. For textures, the majority of surfaces had their resolutions doubled, creating more detail in the environments. There is also an optional 4K texture patch on PC, allowing players with high-end rigs to enjoy even sharper textures. This combines with a new lighting system, meant to provide more realistic shadows and illuminations. In practice, this changes the way maps look significantly. Not only are areas like the brick walls of Clubhouse far sharper in detail, but the new lighting system allows the red brick to have a more saturated look.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this comes together to create a noticeable and significant coat of paint on these maps. While much of this doesn't necessarily impact gameplay, there are some aspects that do. For example, the new lighting system creates more detailed and realistic shadows for players. It also allows you to see your own shadow, which is important because standing too close to a doorway could mean casting a shadow into the next room, potentially giving away your position.</p><p dir="ltr">The audio improvements also make a huge difference. The main improvements here are the direction, reverb, and muffling. Now, when gunshots or footsteps are heard, it's much clearer which direction it's coming from, both horizontally and vertically. In Dual Front, I was able to give much clearer callouts to my teammates when I heard enemies approaching, thanks to the improved sound. The reverb now changes based on the size of the room, and gunshots heard through walls are more muffled, making it easier to tell not only which direction a sound came from, but if it was in another room or not. In a methodical, tactical shooter like Siege, audio is incredibly important and these improvements felt immediately noticeable in match.</p><p dir="ltr">Siege X is launching with five modernized maps, but Ubisoft confirmed that, each season, three additional maps will get the modernized treatments. Starting in Year 11, brand-new maps with these features will start to be added regularly as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458930-pvp12_russiancafe_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458930" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458930-pvp12_russiancafe_intlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458930"></a><figcaption>The revamped Kafe Dostoyevsky</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4458930-pvp12_russiancafe_intlarge.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">New player onboarding and veteran rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">Part of the hope for Siege X is that it will create another opportunity for new players to jump into the multiplayer shooter. Dual Front, a mode with respawns, is a big part of this push, but Ubisoft is also moving Siege to a "free-to-access" model. This model will allow players to jump in for free, with a guided experience from level 1 to 20.</p><p dir="ltr">While the onboarding will certainly make the new-player experience easier, Karpazis did point out that the barrier to entry can't be completely removed, since Siege is a game with over 75 operators, all of whom have different special gadgets to use. There will still be an intense learning curve for new players, but the hope is that this more on-rails start will at least ease some of that pain.</p><p dir="ltr">This onboarding experience will unlock new modes, tutorials, and operators as they level up, with a total of 26 operators unlocked in this leveling experience. Free players can enjoy everything Siege has to offer, with two exceptions: Ranked and the Siege Cup, ranked tournaments that serve as the most competitive offering Siege has. Unranked, TDM, Dual Front, and any other mode can be accessed by free players, with no time limits or restrictions. Karpazis told me that he expects many players to play the game exclusively for free, although it's important to note that free players will still be able to purchase microtransactions, like new operators and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Karpazis told me that this new model makes it easier than ever for new players to try out Siege, with Dual Front as a premier mode to attract them, without compromising the Ranked experience of Siege. He said that the price of the game to get access to Ranked and Siege Cup isn't changing from what it's currently at--$20 USD, but regularly discounted. He also noted this decision should help to curb Smurfing--making a new account to play in lower-ranked lobbies--an issue that many free-to-play shooters have struggled to deal with.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranked is also getting a minor change to the way operator bans work. Instead of teams going back and forth, making multiple bans at the start of a match, each team will simultaneously ban one operator before each round, shortening the time it takes to get into a match and allowing for more strategic bans based on which operators the other team picks. These bans are reset when teams switch sides and all bans are disabled in the event of overtime.</p><p dir="ltr">For longtime players of Siege, they will be happy to know that nothing currently in the game is going anywhere. All of their cosmetics and purchased operators will be available with Siege X, and existing players will receive some in-game rewards as well. While Ubisoft didn't tell us what the rewards are, players will receive them for each year of Siege they have played and a special badge based on which year they first started playing.</p><p dir="ltr">Rainbow Six Siege X surprised me, as I was expecting a far more massive overhaul to the shooter, similar to over live-service games in the space. Instead, Ubisoft has chosen to not touch what players love about Siege and what makes it unique, which is the methodical, slow-moving tactical-shooter gameplay focused on breaching and defending spaces. Dual Front builds upon that idea, giving more flexibility without compromising the core premise, and importantly, not replacing anything. The modernized maps feel like meaningful improvements, even if the changes are more on the periphery than in the core gameplay. Siege X is attempting to thread a needle that has alluded other multiplayer games, but a focus on adding without removing features or drastically changing the core of the game makes Siege X feel like an update that could satisfy both new players and people who have been playing for a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft also teased that there are some reveals for Siege X that haven't been shared just yet, with a Reload event in May, prior to the launch of Siege X. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-closed-beta-starts-today-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530117/" data-ref-id="1100-6530117">Siege X closed beta</a> is also now underway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has unwrapped Rainbow Six Siege X, their big overhaul for the decade-old tactical shooter, aiming to prepare the game for the decade to come. As part of that there’s a whole host of technical improvements and updates to the core game, but perhaps the biggest announcement here is that the game is going free-to-play with free access to the bulk of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> experience – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-new-dual-front-mode-why-just-attack-or-defend-when-you-can-do-both/">including the new Dual Front mode</a> – while a paid tier (or a prior purchase) locks away certain modes and operators.</p>



<p>There’s a significant visual overhaul, with Ubisoft going back to rework all of the main materials within the game, upping the detail for things as fundamental as brick walls and wooden planks. Alongside that, there’s refreshed lighting and reflections that are best seen in the maps Clubhouse, Chalet, Bank, Russian Cafe, and Border. The change can feel very subtle without side-by-side comparisons, but the emphasis is basically on making lighting more realistic, so rooms will likely be a notch darker and light sources, like the sun streaming through windows in Bank, more important. Three more maps will be modernised in the same way with every season going forward, and a new map will be added each season from Year 11.</p>
<p>Maps will also feature new destructible ingredients that can be used tactically. Fire extinguishers can create a temporary smoke screen or even concuss anyone caught in their blast. Gas pipes will cut off an area with a flame that gradually concentrates before exploding to set an area on fire for a little while, and metal detectors are now interactive, and can be disabled temporarily or permanently.</p>
<p>Audio has been given the 2.0 treatment with better sound propagation and better reverb to make it easier to tell where things are coming from. Sound now passes through walls, instead of just bouncing around the environments, and sounds in a small room will have a different reverb to those in a large room or coming from the exterior.</p>
<p>Oh, and they returned to the motion capture studio to dramatically improve rappelling. You can now rappel round corners, and you can sprint along walls for faster repositioning – though obviously they’ll hear you stomping on the walls from the inside.</p>

<p>Along with all of this there’s to be an overhauled esports section in the menu UI, and Pick and Ban has been rejigged to make it quicker – both teams will choose at the same time, and then get a chance to amend picks and bans when swapping between attack and defence. For prospective newcomers there’s a redone onboarding progression and, most significantly, a shift to free access to the game – ranked, esports and access to the full character roster will require that you pay or have already paid. There’s new tutorials and a Clearance Levels onboarding system that aims to get new players up to speed, first against bots, then other players in Quick Match, before Unranked returns as the standard playlist and feeds into Ranked.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X isn’t a full sequel, but it’s still an important step for the game. There’s the excitement and intrigue that a new game mode inevitably brings, sensible improvements throughout, and making the game free to play and with a new introduction to the game can bring this to a wider audience once more.</p>

                <p>The Dragon Ball action RPG Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is getting a new expansion later this year that celebrates the most recent anime series in the franchise, Dragon Ball: Daima. The expansion will roll out in two parts, with Part 1 launching September 2025 and Part 2 planned for March 2026.

No preorder bonuses have been confirmed for Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition, but we'll update if anything is announced. While Amazon lists the game's release date as December 31, 2025, that is likely a placeholder, and we'll update once the actual launch date is confirmed.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot - Daima Edition will not include the five other Season Pass DLC expansions previously released for the game, meaning you'll have to pick those up separately if you want to experience those additional storylines. So far, only PS5 and Nintendo Switch are getting physical releases, though the digital version of the Daima expansion will be available for all other platforms, including PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p></div>                      </div><p>For the two-part Daima expansion, players explore the Demon Realm as Goku after he's shrunk down to his younger self. Goku's new companions from the Daima anime, Glorio, Shin, and Panzy, join the little Saiyan on his adventure to master new techniques and track down the Dragon Balls of the Demon Realm so he can restore himself to his normal size and full power.</p><p>In case you missed it when launched in 2020, Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot retells several storylines from the manga and anime source material, starting with the Saiyan Saga and ending with the Majin Buu Saga, while expanding the universe with new content. Several DLC expansions followed the base game that add five additional chapters to play through based on the Battle of the Gods and Resurrection 'F' arcs from Dragon Ball Super, and an all-new campaign starring Trunks. The game combines the action-packed brawling of the franchise with light RPG mechanics like leveling up Goku, taking on side quests, and exploring the game's large zones. "Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot's modern, semi-open approach to telling the saga of DBZ--despite some minor issues--is a good one," Heidi Kemps wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-review-mondo-cool/1900-6417393/">GameSpot's review</a>. Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot launched on PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC, followed by PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ports with enhanced visuals.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot before the new Daima expansion launches, the best way is to grab the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdragon-ball-z-kakarot-legendary-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-upcoming-dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-edition-is-getting-physical-ps5-and-switch-versions%2F1100-6530103%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot Legendary Edition</a>, which includes the base game, both Season Pass DLC expansions, and a few bonus in-game items.

			<p>According to the developers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege X</a> will launch in June 2025, opening up a new era for the game with the biggest and most transformative evolution in its ten-year history.</p>
<p>The new trailer shared today, which can be watched below, provides a new look at what Siege X will bring on June 10th, such as a major visual overhaul, an enhanced player experience, and some gameplay changes that will improve the game's tactical core.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Reveal Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0Hw96M5bC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Some of the new features that will come with Rainbow Six Siege X this June include a new play mode called Dual Front, a permanent 6v6 game mode that will be set on the game's biggest map to date. In this mode, players will be able to form squads by picking between 35 different operators and proceed to secure enemy sectors while defending their own. While this new play mode will only be available when Rainbow Six Siege X launches, players will be able to test it out this week with a limited-time closed beta that will run from March 13th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET to March 19th @ 12pm PT / 3pm ET/ 8pm CET. To get access to the beta, players will need to connect their Twitch and Ubisoft Connect accounts and watch either the Showcase on the<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Official Rainbow 6 Twitch channel</a> or other <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">livestreams</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="R6 Siege X: New Dual Front 6v6 Mode" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/li443iqd3Xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X will also visually enhance classic maps with new lighting, shadows, and up to 4K textures. Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank and Kafe will be upgraded at launch, with three additional upgraded maps added each season. The update also introduces gameplay features that deepen the game's tactical core, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>New destructible items (fire extinguishers, gas pipes, and metal detectors) provide additional strategic opportunities to surprise and outmaneuver opponents</li>
<li>Smoother rappel navigation with improved controls that allow players to run horizontally and jump around building corners</li>
<li>Revamped audio experience with better propagation and reverberation so that players may better pinpoint the location of enemy players</li>
<li>Refreshed onboarding experience to help new players master the basics through tutorials and field training before jumping into their matches</li>
<li>A new communication wheel to easily communicate with teammates</li>
<li>An updated Pick and Ban system injects a new layer of strategy by allowing teams to react and adapt to enemy strategies. Simultaneous bans every round will speed up the process</li>
<li>R6 ShieldGuard, a unified approach to all existing anti-cheat initiatives that also introduces new technologies to protect the game, including live security updates that will occur without the need for scheduled maintenance, making it harder to create cheats</li>
<li>An improved reputation system to ensure players behave appropriately during matches</li>
</ul>
<p>Rainbow Six Siege X will be free to access on June 10. New players will be able to play in the Dual Front, Unranked, and Quick Play modes, with the ability to earn up to 26 operators through progression. By upgrading to the Premium Edition, they can subsequently unlock Ranked Mode and the Siege Cup once they reach level 50, giving them instant access to more operators. Current players will retain all previously unlocked content, including operators, inventory, and progression, and will receive exclusive veteran rewards based on the year they joined the game.</p>

<p>Rainbow Six Siege X showcase has kicked off and revealed a brand new 6v6 game mode, Dual Front. The new game mode can be tested today, with R6 Siege X closed beta beginning right after the stream.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-r6-siege-x-s-6v6-game-mode-dual-front">What is R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Game Mode, Dual Front?</h2>



<p>Revealed during the R6 Siege X Showcase, Dual Front is the new 6v6 game mode with an exclusive new map. Players can create teams that blend attackers and defenders as they complete dynamic objectives across the map. Moreover, R6 Siege X’s 6v6 game mode will consist of respawn, where players can return as their currently selected operator or change their operator for tactical adjustment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trailer also revealed some upgrades to the core Siege experience. Players will observe new environmental destruction, advanced rappelling, visual enhancements, an audio overhaul, and new animations like weapon inspection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>R6 Siege X’s 6v6 Dual Front mode will be a permanent game mode with “a brand new ever-evolving map” called District. District features two symmetrical fronts, each with three sectors. Each team has to capture one front while simultaneously defending their own as they progress through the sectors. The final sector will consist of a prototype that players need to destroy to win the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s also a neutral sector with a timebound task that can change the tide of the battle. Each new season will bring a new assignment in Dual Front, introducing a new narrative, gameplay and neutral sector map updates.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Velan Studios has released Midnight Murder Club into early access, their dark room party game twist on a first person shooter now available for PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The game comes in at $19.99 / £15.99, but also has a generous Guest Pass, allowing an owner of the game to bring in a full lobby of buddies using a free Guest Pass version of the game. As a multiplayer game being published by PlayStation, players will require a free PSN account on PC, and an active PS Plus subscription to play on PS5.</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club - Early Access Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKc3OtSht98?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Midnight Murder Club takes the first person shooter and drops it into the pitch-black rooms of Wormwood Manor. Up to six players enter this blacked-out arena with just a revolver and a flashlight, trying to figure out where the other players are from the sound of their movement, flickers of light and sparing use of the flashlight. This could find a niche within the social deduction genre, and could be a hit with Twitch streamer groups because of this.</p>
<p>There’s five game modes in the game as of its early access launch, as described by Velan Studios:</p>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Free-for-All</strong> – Six brave souls enter the mansion, and the player with the most kills when time runs out prevails among the rest.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Thief in the Night</strong> – Three fearless teams of two scour the mansion for valuable skulls to deposit into a vault. When the last vault closes, the team with the most value accumulated wins.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Team Deathmatch</strong> – Kill-or-be-killed with your team in a murderous stand-off.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Head Hunters</strong> – Two friends become foes as they hunt the remaining four players as they try to find and burn three hidden demonic totems in the haunting halls.</li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation">New Game Mode: <strong>Wildcards</strong> – Valiant attendees will play cards from their collection that change the rules for everyone in-game in wild new ways! From hijacking the toys that appear in vendors, to giving everyone super speed, to exploding into flames when you die—use these cards to show your wild side! Then, when the dust settles and the match is over, you’ll be gifted brand new cards to add to your collection giving you even more ways to change the game.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best things about this release is how Velan is opening the door to as many players as possible. Only one person needs to buy and own the game in order to host a full lobby, thanks to the free Guest Pass version of the game. It’s a similar concept to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/split-fiction-review/">Split Fiction’s</a> Friends Pass, or games with DLC that allows DLC-havers to invite DLC-have-nots.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Beyond that, Midnight Murder Club has full cross-play and cross-progression.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Velan has also laid out what can be expected through Early Access with a dev diary roadmap:</p>
<p><iframe title="Midnight Murder Club Dev Diary - Early Access Roadmap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXZgyRQv16M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p dir="ltr">A new PvE mode is planned to release this spring, for example, while the summer will see more Toys added, as well as custom game modes. All of this is subject to change, though, depending on how the game’s community grows and feeds back on what they like and want more of in the game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">With this game Velan Studios is establishing a track record of cooking up new and inventive multiplayer games. A few years ago they launched <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/31/hands-on-the-knockout-city-cross-play-beta/">Knockout City</a>, a quirky riff on dodgeball that was rather fun and vibrant, but sadly didn’t quite find its audience under the EA Originals publishing arm, and couldn’t recover <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/knockout-city-is-going-free-to-play-and-leaving-ea-behind-velan-self-publishing/">after going independent and free-to-play</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">shutting down in 2023</a>. Here’s hoping Midnight Murder Club strikes a cord with more people!</p>

The examples included an AI voice telling a player who to pick in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and a chatbot explaining how to craft wood planks in <em>Minecraft</em>. The program also offered feedback on past in-game failures in <em>Age of Empires</em> and could be used to pull up strategy guides if the player remained stuck.</p><p>Perhaps the silliest use case presented in the podcast was telling the Copilot AI to install a game which, if communicating with Copilot via text at least, would seemingly require several more taps and clicks than just doing that manually (a process that already takes only seconds on mobile). The YouTube page is full of people asking why AI needs to be part of the experience at all.</p><figure id="" data-id="a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-recommend-id="image://a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-format="png" data-width="614" data-height="344" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-recommend-id="image://a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-format="png" data-width="614" data-height="344" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="9baed66410ae15c7de1abaf61412ec39" data-recommend-id="image://9baed66410ae15c7de1abaf61412ec39" data-format="png" data-width="642" data-height="331" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot displays a conversation with AI.

Instead of telling me how to do a thing in a game, maybe it could just do it for me, like a more experienced friend would if they were playing with me. Maybe the Copilot can show my kid how to grow food to keep his workers from starving during the winter in <em>Overthrown</em> instead of him asking me every five minutes. </p><p>The use cases quickly snowball from there, however, and probably not in a direction Microsoft wants. Why stop at helping me control my console more easily or bypass a frustrating part of a game? Why not have the Xbox Copilot do my dailies for me and grind random encounters in my favorite JRPG while I scroll TikTok? Let the AI grind the battle pass and pop achievements. One reason not to do that might be that I don’t want Copilot spying on me and my family. Or, if it eventually becomes a paid service like it will presumably have to be in order to be financially sustainable, even the cheevos it could earn for me wouldn’t be worth it.<br></p><p>We’ll see how useful, frightening, or silly the tool ends up being once it’s out. In the meantime, Microsoft also revealed that over 1,000 games like <em>Balatro </em>are now Play Anywhere between Xbox and PC, and the number is expected to keep rising.

Patch 1.2 is out now, and alongside fixes and improvements, there's both a barber shop and Steam Workshop modding support added to the massive RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The barber shop is the first of "several" planned free DLCs, per a press release from Warhorse, and will let protagonist Henry visit the barber to change up his hairstyle. There's also an option for either a clean-shaven or rugged appearance, as well as facial hair ranging from stubble to beard. A new haircut will, just like in real life, give Henry a temporary boost to charisma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 1.2 (massive patch notes below!) addresses over 1,000 fixes and improvements, including equipment and NPC behavior, as well as gameplay balance. Specifically, developer Warhorse Studios tackled country-specific localization as well. The new patch for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 refines the Chinese translations, both Traditional and Simplified, improves the Korean font for clarity, and has a newly recorded French voiceover.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for modding, dedicated Steam modding support has arrived alongside the barber DLC and Patch 1.2. The toolkit allows players to tinker with over 300 elements in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, ranging from user interface and combat mechanics to AI behavior. "Whether making subtle tweaks or complete overhauls, the possibilites for customization are vast," Warhorse said. The studio plans on discussing these updates further during a developer stream, set for March 20, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional content is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-sets-stage-for-3-expansions-in-2025">expected to roll out for the historical RPG throughout the year</a>, with its first paid content drop "Brushes with Death" set for this summer. The Legacy of the Forge expansion is expected in autumn, and then this winter, Warhorse aims to release Mysteria Ecclesia, which involves a covert mission in the Sedlec Monastery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest from Warhorse Studios doesn't show any sign of slowing down in sales, either. The sequel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shows-no-sign-of-slowing-down-sells-2-million-copies-in-less-than-2-weeks">sold 2 million copies in less than two weeks</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-does-the-business-for-embracer-as-it-nears-2-million-copies-sold">Embracer has hailed the game as a success</a>. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review">our own review of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 at IGN</a>, the RPG got high marks for its melee combat, story, and a "truly dynamic" open-world sandbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting started in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?
