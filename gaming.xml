            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-500k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Sunblink has announced that&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone just 30 days after the game's release on PC and Switch.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-top-500000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, the cozy life sim has reached 500,000 sales, which isn't bad considering it's only been available as an individually-sold game for around a month.</p>

<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>was actually released on iOS back in July 2023, but the game was part of the Apple Arcade subscription service (which will also be playing host to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-apple-arcade" rel="nofollow">first new&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>game in almost eight years</a> come next month).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-beach.jpg?itok=S3xwmdXK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-kitty-island-adventure-sales-beach.jpg?itok=x5OcjeZY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>has sold over 500,000 copies.</figcaption></figure><p>The game was subsequently released for PC and Switch in January, and presumably, it's those platforms on which the sales figures are based; after all, it's not possible to buy&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</em>as a separate purchase on iOS.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, it's a life sim based on Sanrio's hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</em>property. It bears similarities to&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>; you'll be exploring and restoring a mysterious island, all while befriending its inhabitants (although this time around they are, of course, based on other <i>Hello Kitty&nbsp;</i>properties).</p>

<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, you'll also find lots of different areas and biomes to explore in&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, including a volcano, "the ocean's depths", and "an island in the clouds".</p>

<p>Of course, since the game is a life sim, you can also expect plenty of recipes to cook and craft, as well as the ability to renovate cabins on your island in order to attract new residents. You might even unlock new storylines involving those residents.</p>




<p>You can check out <i>Hello Kitty Island Adventure&nbsp;</i>right now on PC and Switch, and it's also available via Apple Arcade, with a PlayStation port on the way in the future as well. If you want to know our thoughts on the game, you can take a look at our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-funner-animal-crossing" rel="nofollow">preview from back in June right here</a>.</p>

You need to understand both of its modes <em>and</em> the unique mechanics to use it properly. That’s asking for a lot when compared with other weapons in the game, but we promise the damage it delivers makes this worth the extra effort.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-recommend-id="image://1e4480c0ed9bfc28f1dabbf914352360" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman holds a ludicrously large axe in the middle of a swampy forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>What makes the Charge Blade such a complex weapon is that it’s made up of two weapon configurations: Sword Mode and Axe Mode.</strong> The former equips you with a sword and shield for quick movement and defensive guarding; the latter combines the two into a heavy axe that sacrifices your defense and speed for powerful attacks.</p><p>Knowing when to swap between the two is naturally an important part of learning how to use a Charge Blade. Cycling between the two modes is vital for combat. A unique mechanic for this weapon will have you gather energy with your sword to then use for your axe, or to provide buffs to your equipment.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-recommend-id="image://ee69e4500a0135fcea8fc9694a17c285" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Charge Gauge entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Aside from offering two weapon modes, the Charge Blade’s defining trait is its Phial mechanic. Underneath the Melee Weapon Sharpness gauge will be four icons to keep an eye on: a Sword, a Shield, an Axe, and a set of five phials. <strong>Landing hits in Sword Mode will gradually accumulate energy.</strong> The outline of the phials will turn yellow and then red to convey how much energy you’ve built up. Keep attacking and the icons will start flashing bright red to signal that you have too much, with your sword attacks bouncing off enemies until you’ve discharged the energy.</p><p>You have a few options for how to charge the phials:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Basic Charge</strong> – This forms the basis of your gameplay loop. Activate the Charge command by pressing R2 + Circle or RT + B to store the energy in your phials. Do this when the Phials are yellow or red to fill up three of them, or all of them, respectively. The energy will then be consumed through the various Axe: Element Discharge moves, including the important Amped Element Discharge (AED) and Super Amped Element Discharge (SAED). You can enhance these even further by charging the phials twice in a row before going into Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Element Boost</strong> – Hold down Circle or B during the Charge animation to receive Elemental Boost. This is indicated by the Shield icon lighting up, although it’s not purely a defensive buff. Having this active will enhance your guard and make it possible to follow up an AED with an SAED in Axe Mode</li><li><strong>Condensed Elemental Slash</strong> – If you have Element Boost active, you can hold Triangle or Y during the Charge animation to activate Sword Boost Mode. Your sword attacks will deal more damage and will no longer deflect</li></ul><p>The basic gameplay loop is to charge your phials, consume them in Axe Mode, and then return to Sword Mode to charge again. I highly recommend activating the buffs for your shield and sword if you want to make the most out of this weapon. A lot of extra damage will be left on the table by not making use of them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-recommend-id="image://9544862d4b1ed4181595eb8cea5f0f80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charge Blade Weapon properties menu, highlighting the Power Axe Mode entry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There is another buff tangibly related to the Phial mechanic. Power Axe Mode, commonly referred to as Savage Axe by fans, will significantly increase the heavy weapon’s effectiveness. Not only does it lessen Phial usage so that relevant attacks only use half of a Phial at a time, but it also lets you add on more damage to your attacks by holding the face buttons down, causing the Axe portion to spin like a saw blade. You can tear through everything in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-long-to-beat-story-campaign-1851769015"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> campaign</a></span> with strong attacks like these.</p><p>Power Axe Mode can be triggered through the following methods:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Perfect Guard &gt; Savage Axe Slash – After successfully timing a Perfect Guard, you can press Triangle/Y to use Savage Axe Slash and activate Power Axe Mode</li><li>Mounted Finisher – Grabbing onto a monster’s back and using a Mounted Finisher (R1/RB over a wound) will activate Power Axe Mode</li><li>Focus Slash: Double Rend – Holding L2/LT and then pressing R1/RB will use Focus Slash: Double Rend.

Landing just one of these will turn your phial icons yellow, with another turning them red. Add in another attack in between, like Sword: Shield Thrust (Triangle+Circle/Y+B), and you’ll have a full charge ready in no time. Feel free to tweak the above combo with a couple of starting attacks or use it to charge into Element Boost or Sword Boost Mode instead.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>SAED Combo</strong>: Circle/B &gt; Circle/B &gt; Circle/B &gt; Triangle+Circle/Y+B</li></ul><p>Sometimes, the best combos just take a bit of button mashing. Press Circle/B in Axe Mode to use Element Discharge I. Press it again to use Element Discharge II, and as a special combo-exclusive input, pressing it a third time will bring out an AED. If you have your Element Boost active, follow this up with the standard SAED input to dump the rest of your Phial energy into one deadly attack. Make sure to hold the buttons with Power Axe Mode to top off with even more damage.</p><hr><p>Every weapon has some deeper strategies, but none matches the Charge Blade’s technical aspects. You’ll certainly think it’s worth it for the massive damage and unparalleled versatility.

                <p>Lenovo might not be the first place you’d expect to find DualSense Controllers on sale, but it’s currently the best place to buy models in the Deep Earth lineup.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition brings <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-ray-tracing-improvements-comparison/">significant visual improvements</a> to the fifth entry in the series developed by Rockstar Games, but a new mod that was released online a few days back introduces even more stunning improvements that bring the game's realism to new heights.</p>
<p>The ChromatiX Enhanced mod v0.1 public beta, which can be downloaded <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ChromatiXGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, introduces some very welcome visual improvements to the recently released Enhanced Edition, such as increased traffic and pedestrian density, improved lighting and atmosphere for all weather conditions during day and night, increased reflection intensity, brighter nights, enhanced night sky and more. Even in this early version of the mod, the end results are stunning, as showcased in a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@INTERGTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">INTER.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 5 Enhanced with Realistic Graphics Mod!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ONpLNCvagBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While many are having issues with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition, specifically regarding GTA Online account migration, there's no denying that the improvements Rockstar Games has introduced to the game are an excellent reason to revisit the game and possibly bring new players in. The introduction of ray tracing, DLSS, and FSR support, among other things, also bode well for the inevitable PC port of Grand Theft Auto VI, which will launch sometime after the game debuts on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/">piece</a>.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/271590/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy version</a> is also still available for purchase to allow those who don't meet the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-pc-ray-traced-global-illumination-ambient-occlusion-dlss-fsr/">system requirements</a> to continue playing the game.</p>

A cute but dangerous alien crash lands on Earth, pretends to be a dog, and becomes the pet and best friend of Lilo. Of course, as you would expect, shenanigans ensue. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is set to arrive in theaters on May 23. Here’s the first official trailer: </p><p> <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>stars Maia Kealoha as Lilo Pelekai. The original voice of Stitch, Chris Sanders, is back behind the now CG incarnation of the alien. He wrote and directed the OG animated film back in 2002. Sydney Agudong also stars as Lilo’s sister and guardian Nani Pelekai. </p><p>It’s been a long time coming for <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lilo-stitch-live-action-disney-remake-works-1148811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The live-action remake was announced all the way back in 2018</a></span>. Since then, the film has gone through a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch_(2025_film)#Development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tumultuous development</a></span>, with different directors and writers hopping on and off the project. At one point, <em>Wicked </em>director Jon M. Chu was attached to this thing! Wild. There was also casting controversy, too, with at least one actor replaced before filming after people spotted them using some slurs online. </p><p>But after all that,<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>is finally coming to theaters, and after watching this first trailer my reaction is: Ehh... okay. Fine, whatever. Meh. </p><p>I understand that my love of the original will make it nearly impossible for me to be impartial about this new remake, but I just don’t think we needed this movie. Stitch seems mostly okay, but the trailer feels really flat and people seemed bored to be involved. The kid seems uninterested in what’s happening, likely because she’s a child and is being asked to act alongside nothing or blue-covered tennis balls. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popculturechat/comments/1477upr/drew_barrymore_on_how_as_a_child_she_thought_et/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remember those stories of how the kids in <em>ET </em>cried because they thought he had died on set</a></span>? That ain’t happening in an era where every film uses CG to create their alien characters. </p><p>Regardless, I get that Disney wants money and I know that kids aren’t as into 2D animation or even CG animation anymore, and prefer live-action stuff. As a result, we are getting a live action remake of basically every Disney movie ever made, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">including the horrendous-looking <em>Snow White</em></a></span><em>.</em> And yeah, to be clear: This  movie and Disney’s other live action remakes are all for kids. So while I don’t mind dunking on it or laughing at people posting jokes about the new trailer on Twitter, ultimately, what will determine if <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is a success is if kids drag enough parents to the theater in May. We’ll find out this Summer. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero during Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 across both competitive and quick play. But the duo’s massive popularity isn’t deterring the balance team at NetEase from giving them a significant buff to their direct healing ability.</p>



<p>An already incredibly pick rate for Cloak &amp; Dagger could skyrocket even more after this next Marvel Rivals balance update.</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-will-get-buffed-in-marvel-rivals-season-1-5-balance-update">Cloak &amp; Dagger Will Get Buffed in Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 Balance Update</h2>



<p>As part of a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“mid-season balance update for Season 1.5,”</a> Cloak &amp; Dagger is receiving a strong buff to the direct healing power of Dagger’s Lightforce Dagger. <strong>The direct healing effect from Lightforce Dagger on hit allies is increasing from 10 to 16</strong>. To balance this, the “spell field healing amount” that heals another nearby ally is being reduced from 18 to 16. </p>



<p>While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger’s ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger’s full “clip” of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger’s Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes to Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to Marvel Rivals pick data websites <a href="https://rivalsmeta.com/characters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsMeta</a> and <a href="http://While this does mean Cloak &amp; Dagger's ability to heal a wider group with their primary fire is slightly decreased, the amount of direct healing done to one target is getting a huge boost. Cloak &amp; Dagger's full &quot;clip&quot; of 12 Lightforce Daggers will provide 192 points of healing to one ally instead of 120. Given that Dagger's Light Explosion and Dagger Storm abilities are more geared towards healing a larger group anyway, these changes Lightforce Dagger are a huge improvement." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RivalsTracker</a>, Cloak &amp; Dagger is the most picked hero in both competitive and quick play. Both sites claim Cloak &amp; Dagger has a 50.44% pick rate in competitive play. The next highest is Invisible Woman at 44.39%, and then it’s a big drop down to number three: Rocket Raccoon at 28.99%. RivalsMeta tracks far fewer matches for quick play matches, but lists Cloak &amp; Dagger as the second most picked hero in that mode behind Invisible Woman.</p>



<p>Human Torch and Iron Man will also receive changes in the mid-season balance update for Season 1.5. Human Torch’s primary Fire Cluster projectile speed and count are increasing, and his Supernova ultimate is getting a damage increase but with an increased energy cost. The direct damage of Iron Man’s primary Repulsor Blast is getting decreased, but the damage dealt by the pulse is increasing.</p>

Whether by chance or fate, its prototype space station, the Tiqqun, finds itself cast adrift, a disintegrating ark upon which the remnants of humanity must find sanctuary – and you, Administrator, are at its helm.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>IXION</em> is a city-builder that requires you to be vigilant, to constantly assess and reassess, to learn and adapt. If you and your crew are to endure, you must confront the perils of space, while at the same time uncovering its secrets and extracting its resources. Danger, however, will come from within as well as without; you’ll need to establish, maintain and develop the Tiqqun’s infrastructure while managing the station’s population, deciding how best to answer their pleas so as to maintain their trust in you and the mission.</p><p>There are no simple solutions; your <a title="Genres > Action [2,554 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s will have repercussions, now or further down the line. How you deal with those repercussions will be the difference between <a title="Genres > Survival [385 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> and extinction.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>In DOLOS We Trust</strong> – A population to manage, survivors to find, cryopods to recover… Maintain your crew’s trust in the corporation that started this venture, or face failure and mutiny. Six sectors can be unlocked within the station, each able to house more population, support new jobs, and provide opportunity to monitor the crew with the Data Listening System. Will you bring hope to the people?</li><li><strong>Choices in the Dark</strong> – Who said DOLOS was the only faction to escape the fate of the Earth? Brush up against other pockets of survivors, navigate on from the failures and wrecks of others… <em>IXION</em> will lead the player through gripping chapters of story, where new threats and opportunities are presented, all in aid of reaching the final destination, a new home.</li><li><strong>Frontier Academia</strong> – DOLOS are famed for their innovative technology, their scientists, but the Tiqqun now finds itself cut off. Find what resources you can, research what you do not have. Find new ways to provide for your settlement, construct new buildings to create what’s needed. Modify the Tiqqun station, improve it, forge ahead in this odyssey.</li><li><strong>Occupational Hazards</strong> – Space is a dangerous place. Hull breaches, overloaded power supplies, electrical fires… It is up to you to manage these risks, deal with emergencies, create backup power solutions, and enable Extra Vehicular Activity…</li><li><strong>Stellar Exploration</strong> – There are whole new stellar maps to explore. Send out probes to reveal what’s hidden, create mining and cargo ships to find resources, commission science expeditions to discover the secrets and threats you’ll find out there in space. Encounter other survivors and bring them into the fold of your mission, objective – survive.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-crusader-kings-3-expansion-khans-of-the-steppe-revealed-for-april.1132500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>expansion in the form of&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em>, and it's the first part of the game's fourth "chapter".</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/535470580526219410" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Paradox reveals that&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will launch on April 28th, and that it'll begin "the next stage in <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s development". As with previous&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-crusader-kings-3-expansion-highlights-royal-court" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will add a number of new gameplay mechanics and features.</p>

<p>Since the expansion is based around the Mongols, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the first major feature is a nomadic government system. You'll be tasked with exploiting the resources in your current location, then moving on to a new place with more resources to reap.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-overlook.jpg?itok=CmR1jb9G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-overlook.jpg?itok=WOPY1SXn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>expansion will add nomadic governments and more.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as nomadic government,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a Herd system that will represent your "horses, cattle, and overall strength within the steppe", and it'll serve as the "cornerstone of diplomatic, martial, and economic actions" in the new expansion.</p>

<p>The new Dominance system will also measure your power and influence within the steppe, and Paradox says that if you manage to raise your Dominance high enough, you "might even claim the mantle of Genghis Khan; the Universal Ruler".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to "changing climate and weather patterns" affecting your life in the steppe; you may, for instance, have to contend with sudden snows "decimating fertility and putting pressure on you to find greener pastures".</p>




<p><em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>may be&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s first Chapter 4 expansion, but it's not the main event; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, which will, as the name suggests, expand the game's map to encompass Asia.</p>

<p>You can look forward to new cultures, faiths, and more in this expansion, as well as a new Dynastic Cycle system that will have you attempting to maintain the Mandate of Heaven to prove you can "navigate the empire through treacherous waters".</p>

<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>yet, but the first dev diary is set for May, with regular dev diaries for&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>also due to air throughout April until the expansion's release.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crusader-kings-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crusader-kings-iii/9n7gg222gtth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>'s game director Carrie Patel has been on the blower to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains">Eurogamer</a> about why Avowed doesn't have any romance in it, which is to say it does, actually, if you're paying attention, and also, affairs of the heart aren't supposed to feel like min-maxing your Wizard, Kevin. To put that another way, she has gently suggested that relationships are more relatable when they aren't some kind of mechanic or system.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship," she told Eurogamer's Robert Purchese (HELLO BERTIE). </p>
<p>As Purchese adds, Avowed does actually harbour the possibility of a soulmate, but this isn't served up to you Commander Shepard-style on a bed of amorous tooltips. It'll happen if you get to know the person in question and decide that you like them.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that says 'hey this is a thing that can happen' - there's no system that's going to track your status with them," Patel explained. "But if you're doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you'll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising."</p>
<p>I'm still playing through Avowed, and have no idea who this is referring to, so you'll have to do your own homework, you scamps. Also, I tend not to romance people in RPGs because I am afraid of emotions, and also because look Morrigan, we are trying to save the world here, there'll be time to knock boots after the credits roll. Ah, many are the sparks I have allowed to fizzle out. Sometimes the horny design gets the better of me, admittedly. I was appalled to learn at the end of the original Dragon's Dogma that I'd been seducing the local blacksmith all along. </p>

<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike involving video game performance actors is set to continue after the latest negotiations have failed to result in a new deal. In an <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/member-message-video-game-strike-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">update posted</a> on its official website Tuesday night, the union’s chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland for the video game strike says there has been progress in some areas, but it’s not enough to curb the concerns the union has about “A.I. Abuse”.</p>



<p>“Though progress has been made and agreements have been reached on certain provisions since we launched our strike last year, the last proposal the bargaining group made is still filled with alarming loopholes that will leave our members vulnerable to A.I. abuse,” the statement reads. “The union recently submitted a counter to this proposal that diligently addresses all of the loopholes and would result in a contract that offers the minimum protections our members need in order to maintain sustainable careers as video game performers.”</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that the “bargaining group” wants to paint a picture than a deal is close. Crabtree-Ireland says that it’s not the case and it’s part of a hope to have union members “turn on each other”.</p>



<p>“They want to use all past performances and any performance they can source from outside the contract&nbsp;without&nbsp;any of the protections being bargained at all,” Crabtree-Ireland wrote. “You could be told nothing about your replica being used, offered nothing in the way of payment, and you could do nothing about it. They want to be able to make your replica continue to work, as you, during a future strike, whether you like it or not. And once you’ve given your specific consent for how your replica can be used, they refuse to tell you what they&nbsp;actually&nbsp;did with it.”</p>



<p>In response to the latest statement from the union, representatives on behalf of the studios provided a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-actors-strike-set-to-continue-as-union-warns-of-alarming-loopholes-for-ai-abuse-in-latest-proposal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. </p>



<p>“”We have proposed a deal that includes wage increases of over 15 percent for SAG-AFTRA represented performers in video games, as well as enhanced health and safety protections, industry-leading terms of use for AI digital replicas in-game and additional compensation for the use of an actor’s performance in other games,” spokesperson Audrey Cooling said. “We have made meaningful progress and are eager to return to the bargaining table to reach a deal.”</p>



<p>The current video game actor strike <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began in July 2024</a>.  Despite it continuing, however, the union says that “more than 160 games” have signed interim and independent agreements to allow them to work wit SAG-AFTRA members.</p>



<p>“Those agreements contain the protections we have been asking the bargaining group for — terms that are clearly feasible and acceptable to a great number of game companies of all sizes, even as the bargaining companies resist,” the union says.</p>

<p>The Show has an interesting history with Microsoft. If you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for news about MLB The Show 25 coming to Xbox Game Pass, the answer is reaching you swifter than a fastball.</p>



<p>2021 was a landmark year for MLB The Show. It signalled the end of PlayStation’s decade-plus long exclusive relationship with the series. Microsoft finally managed to get a bit of the pitcher pie starting with MLB The Show 21. Each new release is a multi-platform extravaganza allowing PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo players to get picked.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mlb-the-show-25-cover-athletes-and-release-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MLB The Show 25</a> is 2025’s newest rewriting of the rulebook with multiple cover stars, tons of new animations, and much more. It’s all promising, but let’s see if it’s even better for Xbox Game Pass subscribers.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Guess where this one is going. Credit to San Diego Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite its history, MLB The Show 25 is not arriving as a day-one launch on Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service.</strong></p>



<p>The news might come as a shock to Game Pass users—more on this later. As it stands, MLB The Show 25 is not coming to Xbox Game Pass. Given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-mlb-the-show-25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> starts shortly, this is unlikely to change either.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/p/9NZP0WKX3WJD/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MLB The Show 25 Xbox Store page</a> makes no mention of Game Pass anywhere—nor do any trailers. It’s a cold, hard strike on this one but it’s not time to sit down yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-mlb-the-show-25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will MLB The Show 25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>MLB The Show 24 came to Xbox Game Pass on day one in 2024, meaning there is a good chance MLB The Show will follow suit and arrive on Game Pass in the future.</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, I’m not sure why MLB The Show 25 has missed out this year. The 2024 edition was a day-one benefit for Game Pass.</p>



<p>However, MLB The Show 25 hasn’t been as lucky. As there is a precedent of The Show games appearing on Game Pass, I’d wager it’s only a matter of time before Microsoft throws a curveball for those unwilling to purchase the game straight away.</p>



<p>We’ll update this article if the move comes to fruition for Xbox and PC users.</p>

<p>Were you counting on The Show 25 coming to Microsoft’s subscription service? Or is nothing stopping you from swinging for the fences in 2025? Let us know what you think about Game Pass and how it can be improved?</p>

Under the old city of Barcelona stands ANTRO, a dirty and dark hole divided into geographical strata. The inhabitants of the lowest levels fight for survival by working forced labor, while the ones in the higher levels rule over the new underground world. </p><p>ANTRO’s government has become a totalitarian system, handing power over to a corporation based on technological overproduction and the automation of sectors known as La Cupula. Freedom of speech has been censored, art and music are forbidden, and a rebellion seems to be coming to life inside the den in which they’re living.</p><p>Journey through the most remote places in the underground metropolis of ANTRO, and join the protagonist, Nittch, as you embark on a mission to deliver a package to a mysterious, unknown recipient. While you’re at it, how about overthrowing the totalitarian government of La Cupula? Play with urban music in a thrilling adventure full of action, puzzles and 2.5D platforming.</p><p>Explore ANTRO to the rhythm of hip-hop, drill, R&amp;B, and electronic music, and move around the city overcoming obstacles in your way, be it by resolving puzzles or traversing the environment using parkour. But be prepared to run at full speed, as the pursuits in ANTRO are plentiful and both you and the scenario will move in synchrony with the music. But remember: the enemy is always lurking.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>

</p>
<p>
As for those Premium-exclusive additions, March is a good 'un for fans of FromSoftware's long-running mech series, Armored Core. Armored Core, Armored Core: Project Phantasma, and Armored Core: Master of Arena all arrive in March, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arcade-paradise-vr">Arcade Paradise VR</a>.

"Many of our players are currently playing on PS5 and have shifted toward redeeming and accessing PS5 titles," it said at the time.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pxn-p5-wireless-gaming-controller-review.1132440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/12/pxn-p5-wireless-gaming-controller-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The gamepad trees are bearing their joystick-equipped fruits early this year, with many manufacturers already launching their latest and greatest for 2025, covering a wide spread of different devices and price points. While we’ve just seen some incredible value offerings from GameSir, there’s space within the budget bracket to innovate and over-deliver as much as anywhere else. That’s where PXN are aiming the P5, a multiplatform wireless gaming controller that’s available for less than £30. With the features it totes, it’s ridiculous value for money.</p>

<p>The PXN P5 offers a trio of connection options: a wireless 2.4GHz dongle, Bluetooth or wired. That means it’s all set to work with your PC and Nintendo Switch, as well as mobile or smart TVs – something that’s becoming increasingly useful with the arrival of streaming services like Luna and GeForce Now. In fact, this is an ideal extra controller just to hop into the latest games on Apple TV arcade.</p>


<p>The headline feature set for a controller at this price makes a mockery of the other manufacturers out there, especially Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo’s standard offerings. It offers Hall Effect sticks with a 1000Hz polling rate, meaning better response time and faster reactions, while also cutting down on the risk of stick drift. It has a 256-level Hall Effect trigger, with trigger lockouts, 25 hour battery life, an air-mouse mode, and is equipped with a gyroscope for motion controls and back buttons. How have they done all of this?</p>
<p>Well, the money you’re saving can be felt the moment you pick it up. The P5 is extremely light, even though the black plastic of the main body feels solid and well-made. You can tell that it’s cheaper, but it doesn’t give you the ick like third party controllers used to. The Hall Effect analogue sticks have a decent level of tautness, and they feel great in use, making the most of the accurate response in Overwatch 2. In the heat of the moment, you could easily forget that this is a value controller.</p>


<p>The face buttons feel surprisingly good as well, with traditional membrane buttons that have the right level of activation. The D-pad is a weaker element, with the up direction on our review unit feeling a little less pliant than the other directions, but it proved absolutely fine in use. I’d probably be looking elsewhere if you’re a beat ‘em up fan that uses the D-pad heavily, but for most people it does the job.</p>
<p>The cost-cutting becomes more obvious when you put your fingers on the triggers and shoulder buttons. The plastic used here feels cheaper than elsewhere, and there’s definitely an acclimatisation period to getting used to them.</p>
<p>They haven’t skimped on the tech behind the triggers though, which, like the analogue sticks, boast Hall Effect technology, so not only are they more precise through their range of movement, but they should last longer than their traditional brethren. Of course, there’s other elements to a trigger’s durability, and the spring providing tension is the traditional breaking point.&nbsp;The PXN P5 also boasts trigger lockouts, which make playing FPS games much more immediate, and improve your activation time – vital if you’re into competitive gaming.</p>

<p>On the rear of the controller you’ll find a bunch of inputs and switches, first of which are the four back buttons. These are well placed beneath your middle fingers, though that depends on whether you play with four fingers across the triggers and shoulder buttons for a claw grip.</p>
<p>I found that shifting my hands up meant I had to stretch more with my ring fingers to activate the back buttons, as they are quite small, though that, in turn, makes them harder to activate accidentally. I do like the way that the central two buttons are angled, as this made them easier to use, and you won’t catch them when using the two that sit within the controller’s grips.</p>
<p>On the rear, there’s also a switch for moving between the wireless dongle, Bluetooth, or to move across to the Nintendo Switch mode. Unlike the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/05/gamesir-super-nova-controller-review/">GameSir Super Nova</a>, it’s chunky and very easy to use.</p>

<p>There’s two options when it comes to programming the PXN P5, and first amongst them is programming the controller using the PXN button on the front of the unit. Holding this down with a combination of buttons will let you alter a multitude of settings, including switching through deadzone settings as well as button mapping, but you’ll probably have to reach for the instructions to remind yourself each time.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s the PXN Nexus app which is available for Android and iOS. This gives you a clear and comprehensive way to update your controller, and alter all of its settings to within an inch of its life, including setting up macros on the back buttons. You can add multiple steps here, loop them, or add interval times between button activations, and it’s a great addition to an already impressive package.</p>
<p>The key competitors here are fundamentally all more expensive than the PXN P5, though the Gamesir Super Nova’s extra £15 buys a far more premium experience, and a charging stand. Meanwhile, for another few pounds, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/gamesir-cyclone-2-controller-review/">GameSir Cyclone 2</a> throws in a bevy of microswitches, and you also gain a 3.5mm headphone socket, if that’s important to your setup.</p>

			<p>A new version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-unreal-engine-5-5-remaster-lumen-nanite/">Skyrim Unreal Engine 5 remaster</a> is now available for download, introducing a lot of new textures to improve the unofficial remaster's visuals.</p>
<p>The new version of the mod, which can be downloaded from the developer Greg Coulthard's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Udab2K5a5X">Discord server</a>, can be seen in action in the video below by Digital Dreams, the modder who provided the new 1000 textures the unofficial remaster now features in its latest iteration. While this unofficial remaster doesn't look as good as modded Skyrim does, it's still interesting to see how some of the original game's low polygon elements fare with the lighting improvements offered by the engine.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Port in Unreal engine 5 HUGE update with 1000 new textures | RTX5090 NextGen graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNIHJJZQPlY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an official Skyrim remaster or remake is nowhere on the horizon, there's the chance fans of The Elder Scrolls series will soon be able to revisit Oblivion with a remaster/remake that is rumored to be in development by Virtuos, the developer of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater that previously worked on plenty of other high-profile titles. Unofficially revealed via an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing with Phil Spencer back in 2023</a>, the remaster/remake is said to feature a lot of improvements over the original, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">combat, stealth, and interface improvements</a>. Unfortunately, the game has yet to be officially revealed, so everything about it is still up in the air, except for the fact that it was originally planned for a Fiscal Year 2022 release.</p>
<p>The latest version of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade/">Anniversary Edition</a> now available on PC and consoles. It introduces some additional content over the Special Edition, which is also available on PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-player-count-how-many-people-are-playing-cs2-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Despite eternally sitting at the top of the Steam charts, the player count for Counter-Strike 2 is still an important metric to many in the community. From its early CS:GO days to its current day CS2, Counter-Strike continues to grow at an impressive rate, despite periods of fluctuation.</p>



<p>The doomers that predicted that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-counter-strike-2-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Counter-Strike would die</a> after the release of CS2 have been proved (so far) to be very wrong.</p>



<p><em>Before you jump below, consider&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying your luck on Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;– you could turn your unwanted skins into something much more valuable (18+ only)</em></p>



<h2 id="h-counter-strike-2-player-count-march-2025">Counter-Strike 2 Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>On March 1st, 2025, CS2 achieved 1,789,374 concurrent players, its highest ever player peak since releasing. CS2 is also currently averaging over 1 million players since mid February, which is also a first for the newest version of the game. The only time in Counter-Strike’s illustrious history when it was more popular was in May 2023, when CS:GO hit a peak of 1,818,773 and was averaging over 1.1 million players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As mentioned earlier, CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s Most Played chart. There are only three games that have ever had higher concurrent player peaks: PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS, Black Myth: Wukong, and Palworld. To put into context how popular CS2 is, PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS is currently the second most played game on Steam, and CS2 has almost twice as many players.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-cs2-more-popular-than-cs-go">Why is CS2 More Popular Than CS:GO?</h2>



<p>Despite resounding community resentment towards CS2 after it was first released, the game did reignite many dormant fans and attract several new ones. CS2’s esports scene has also flourished since the COVID-19 online-only era, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers a day. While the game is certainly not in a perfect state, Valve has released updates addressing major issues, launched a new seasonal competitive model in Premier, and is keeping the map pool fresh.</p>



<p>Is CS2 in a good place? Is it possible that it eclipses 2 million players? Let us know down below or in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>An Ubisoft shareholder is planning a protest outside the company’s Paris offices after it claims the studio failed to disclose meetings regarding a potential acquisition.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, AJ Investments, a firm with less than a 1% stake in Ubisoft, says that studio is “horribly mismanaged by current management”. In addition, the firm’s CEO Juraj Krúpa says that the company failed to disclose reported meetings with EA and Microsoft, among other interested parties, regarding potential acquisition of Ubisoft IPs.</p>



<p>Krúpa says that the company didn’t “appropriately” communicate its plans or talks with shareholders. Because of that, he is calling those “who are frustrated with the prolonged stagnation in Ubisoft’s stock performance and the lack of decisive action from the management team” to join them in protest in May.</p>



<p>Krúpa added that AJ Investments is ready to sue Ubisoft for “misleading investors”. He did add, however, that they are aware of Ubisoft management having a financial review of various strategic options that is being advised by Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan</p>



<p>In a statement given to IGN, Ubisoft restated its past messaging that reviews of strategic and capitalistic options is ongoing at the company.</p>



<p>“The Board has established an ad-hoc independent Committee to oversee this formal and competitive process, so as to extract the best value from Ubisoft’s assets and franchises for all stakeholders,” the company said. “Ubisoft will inform the market in accordance with applicable regulations if and once a transaction materialises.”</p>
