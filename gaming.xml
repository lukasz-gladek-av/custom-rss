		<p>Focus and developer Saber Interactive have shared a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> gameplay overview trailer, showing off the chunky third person action and chitinous Tyranid enemies. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is coming out on 9th September 2024 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 sees the Ultramarines and Captain Demetrian Titus (now demoted to Lieutenant after the original game) stepping into the breach to face off against the Tyranid hordes invading the Imperial worlds of Avarax and Kadaku. While he might have been demoted, Titus has undergone the Rubicon Primaris process to transform him into a taller, stronger and faster Primaris Space Marine – a relatively new narrative twist in the 42nd millenium, after the return of the Primarchs.</p>
<p>Fighting alongside Titus are Brother-Sergeant Gadriel and Brother Chairon. This trio can all be player controlled, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/08/see-the-first-co-op-campaign-gameplay-from-space-marine-2/">Space Marine 2 features three-player campaign co-op</a>.</p>
<p>This new overview also delved into the PvE Operations and PvP Eternal War modes &nbsp;these both feature six playable classes – Tactical, Assault, Vanguard, Bulwark, Sniper and Heavy – and lean in on a customisation system for your own Space Marine. It’s not just cosmetics, but will let you level up your weapons through play with a shared progression system. After launch, Saber will roll out content updates to add more Operations missions, PvP maps, weapons and more</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-the-sequel-you-never-expected/">Space Marine 2 was revealed in 2021</a>, and is in development at Saber Interactive who are best known for World War Z and Snowrunner. The horde element from World War Z definitely plays a part in Space Marine 2, able to show off the mass of angry aliens that the Tyranid are known for – certainly, we’re going to have much grander action than was possible in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/09/12/review-warhammer-40000-space-marine/">the 2011 original</a>.</p>
<p>Dom got to go <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preview-better-the-boltgun-you-know/">hands on with Space Marine 2 back at Gamescom</a>, writing “Combat in Space Marine 2 is unapologetically gritty, focussing on the risk and reward of executions to renew your ability bank. Blood flies out of everywhere, which is little surprise when the Space Marines are packing swords with chainsaws built in and boltguns with ammo the size of your fist. There’s a cool parry move to utilise, and you have to mix up your approaches as you deal with ever-larger Tyranid enemies. They behave as you’d expect, like a flood of alien locusts that swarm towards you, intent on turning you to mulch. Better you do it to them first, then!”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/otherskin-is-a-new-third-person-shooter-with-strong-ps2-vibes.906756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/otherskin-ps2-style-shooter-q4-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher FDG Entertainment and developer Game Atelier have announced&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>, a third-person shooter-platformer hybrid that has more than a hint of the PS2 era about it.</p>
<p>Game Atelier, whose name you might recognize from&nbsp;<em>Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom</em>, describes&nbsp;<em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>as a "fast-paced third-person sci-fi platforming action-adventure", which sure is a lot of genre names.</p>
<p>By the looks of the gameplay footage released alongside the game's reveal, it's taking cues from games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/returnal-review"><em>Returnal</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/scars-above-review">Scars Above</a>&nbsp;</em>(although hopefully it turns out to be a little more successful than the latter).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/otherskin-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=MnUieJZm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/otherskin-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=y8LcCrbW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>blends third-person shooting and platforming for a throwback PS2 vibe.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>will take you to Planet Vandermire, a world falling prey to a threat known only as the Corruption. Hey, I think&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creatures-of-ava-release-date"><em>Creatures of Ava&nbsp;</em>would like a word</a>,&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike in&nbsp;<em>Creatures of Ava</em>, though, it looks like the Corruption is turning alien life hostile on Vandermire, and it's up to Alex to fight her way through the planet in order to learn what she can about the deadly threat.</p>
<p>As you play, you'll blast your way through a number of different enemies, and you'll be able to absorb "morphs" that will grant you new powers to help you explore your environment more effectively.</p>
<p>You can check out the cinematic reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>, which sets up the game's story and the world of Vandermire, right here.</p>

<p>The game will feature both ranged and melee combat, and Game Atelier says it'll be "a breeze" to swap between the two modes depending on the situation.</p>
<p>While a gameplay trailer hasn't been uploaded yet,&nbsp;<em>Otherskin</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1622630/Otherskin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">Steam page</a> does feature some gameplay footage, and if you're a fan of PS2-era shooters like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank&nbsp;</em>or even&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025"><em>Metroid Prime</em></a>, it looks like you'll find a lot to like here as well.</p>
<p><em>Otherskin&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on PC in the fourth quarter of 2024. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

  <p id="oMj2e7">September is not too far away, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22821314/batman-penguin-colin-farrell-spinoff-hbo-max"><em>The Penguin</em></a>, Max’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22951429/the-batman-movie-review-2022"><em>The Batman</em></a><em> </em>spinoff TV series, seems to know it. A new trailer for the show gets right down to it in a way that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680583/penguin-trailer-teaser-colin-farrell-dc-studios-batman">previous teases avoided</a>: This is a cutthroat mafia succession story set in the dark and oily Gotham City showcased in Matt Reeves’ Robert Pattinson-led 2022 film. </p>
<p id="KB3PBX"><em>The Batman</em> star Colin Farrell now has a whole cast to strive against in his quest to fill the power vacuum following the death of boss Carmine “The Roman” Falcone — and it’s a who’s who of Gotham City mafia figures from the most influential mafia-focused Batman books. Clancy Brown plays Salvatore Maroni, the guy who threw acid in Harvey Dent’s face; Michael Kelly plays Johnny Vitti, Falcone’s nephew and enforcer introduced in <em>Batman: Year One</em>; and Michael Zegen plays Alberto Falcone, a major player in <em>Batman: The Long Halloween</em>. Finally, Cristin Milioti plays a woman who appears to be Oswald “Oz” Cobblepot’s biggest rival for power, Sophia “Gigante” Falcone, the daughter of The Roman. </p>
<p id="xETvDI">We’ll see who comes out on top — and whether Batman has anything to say about it — when <em>The Penguin</em> premieres on the Max streaming service in September</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24181309/kinds-of-kindness-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yorgos-lanthimos%E2%80%99-kinds-of-kindness-is-three-movies-%E2%80%94-and-two-directors-%E2%80%94-in-one.906747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181309/kinds-of-kindness-review-yorgos-lanthimos-emma-stone<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="OkQqQ2">What happens to auteur theory when a film director appears to be two markedly different auteurs at the same time? If you were working on a unified theory of surrealist director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24006971/poor-things-yorgos-lanthimos-interview-emma-stone">Yorgos Lanthimos</a> that established a continuum between his early works in Greece, his English-language breakthroughs <em>The Lobster</em> and <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>, and his period Oscar contenders <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/2/24/18236661/the-favourite-story-ending"><em>The Favourite</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093718/poor-things-hulu-oscars-book-differences"><em>Poor Things</em></a>, get ready to scrap it. Lanthimos’ new movie, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>, arriving just six months after <em>Poor Things</em>, is a hard left turn — or perhaps a jump into a parallel universe that establishes two distinct tracks to the director’s career.</p>
<p id="v2LYXJ">It’s like <em>The Favourite </em>and <em>Poor Things</em> never happened. Those films’ rococo look, stylistic flamboyance, and broad, almost ribald humor is nowhere to be found. Neither is the archness and melodrama of Australian screenwriter Tony McNamara, who worked on both. Instead, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> stages unsettling, abstract moral fables in a starkly photographed modern world. The humor is underplayed, mordant, and pitch-black. It’s instantly recognizable as the work of that other Lanthimos, the one who made <em>Dogtooth</em>, <em>The Lobster</em>, and the darkly menacing <em>Sacred Deer</em>. Unsurprisingly, it reunites Lanthimos with his co-screenwriter on those films, Efthimis Filippou.</p>
<p id="RbiVfQ">Maybe Lanthimos is aware of this bifurcation in his work: It seems like split identities are on his mind. <em>Kinds of Kindness </em>is actually an anthology of three shortish films, with a total run time of 164 minutes. Each of the three uses the same troupe of core actors: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134902/civil-war-jesse-plemons-bodies-scene">Jesse Plemons</a>, Emma Stone, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/2019/2/12/18216887/willem-dafoe-at-eternitys-gate-interview-oscars">Willem Dafoe</a>, Margaret Qualley, Hong Chau, Joe Alwyn, and Mamoudou Athie. The same faces keep coming back as different people. And within each of the three stories, characters contend with identities that have been broken in two, that they don’t seem to have control over, or that are unreliable in other ways.</p>

</p>
<p id="w6vBrA">In the first film, “The Death of R.M.F.,” Plemons plays Robert, a businessman who has allowed his powerful boss, Raymond (Dafoe), to take over every aspect of his life, detailing precisely what he eats and when he has sex with his wife (Chau). After failing to hospitalize himself via a car accident per Raymond’s orders, Robert tries to break free of his boss’s control. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn.</p>
<p id="1j4SMO">The second segment, “R.M.F. Is Flying,” focuses on Plemons again, this time as Daniel, a police officer whose wife, Liz (Stone), a marine biologist, has gone missing on a research expedition. When Liz returns, Daniel becomes obsessed with the idea that she’s an impostor. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn. (This segment bears a striking resemblance to Julia Armfield’s excellent 2022 novel <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58659343-our-wives-under-the-sea"><em>Our Wives Under the Sea</em></a>.)</p>
<p id="RdTozQ">The third episode, “R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich,” casts Stone and Plemons as Emily and Andrew, cultists trying to track down a prophesied woman with the power of resurrection. The woman is central to the beliefs of Andrew and Emily’s bizarre, water-obsessed cult, led by Omi (Dafoe) and Aka (Chau). On the mission, Emily secretly and hesitantly reconnects with her husband (Alwyn) and young daughter, exposing herself to her previous, pre-cult life. That doesn’t go well, and events take a dark turn.</p>

<p id="xvE6q1">None of these people are R.M.F., by the way. R.M.F. are the initials of an incidental but significant character in all three stories who, in the movie’s funniest meta joke, bears a passing resemblance to Lanthimos himself. R.M.F. is played by Yorgos Stefanakos, who, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10606356/#didYouKnow">according to the IMDb</a>, is a notary from Athens and an old friend of Lanthimos and Filippou.</p>
<p id="bQc4Sk">If you’ve seen any of Lanthimos’ pre-<em>Favourite</em> movies, particularly <em>The Lobster</em> or <em>The Killing of a Sacred Deer</em>, you’ll have a sense for what to expect from <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>. But Lanthimos newbies coming straight from <em>Poor Things</em> and its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24046867/oscars-2024-nominations-list-predictions-movies">11 Oscar nominations</a> may be in for a shock. The flavor of surrealism Lanthimos employs here is very different. Each story takes a somewhat recognizable situation from modern, middle-class life and puts a twist on it that is absurd, symbolic, or terrifying — and frequently all three. The performances are deliberately stilted, and the characters’ behavior is inexplicably weird, but somehow painfully relatable at the same time. Where David Lynch’s movies, for example, tap into the unnerving illogic of dreams, Lanthimos — this version of him, anyway — takes slightly cruel delight in making the emotional realities of waking life as upsetting and unnerving as nightmares.</p>
<p id="GSpfn8">In this, he gets a lot of help from composer Jerskin Fendrix and cinematographer Robbie Ryan, who both rolled straight into <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> from <em>Poor Things</em>. For my money, Fendrix’s discomfiting plinky-plonk musical sketches work much better in this alienated modern world than they did in <em>Poor Things</em>’ Victorian fantasia. Ryan, meanwhile, turns in radically different work for this project. Where <em>Poor Things </em>was saturated in lush, artificial lighting and distorted fish-eye-lens frames, <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> is shot with the geometrical, roomy austerity of a Stanley Kubrick movie.</p>

<p id="XLg4Q6">The movie was filmed in and around New Orleans, and it gets fantastic mileage from its locations, conjuring a distinctive mood for each segment: sleek, luxurious modernism in “The Death of R.M.F.,” becalmed suburbia in “R.M.F Is Flying,” and seedy edgelands in “R.M.F. Eats a Sandwich.” Lanthimos, Ryan, and the costume and production design teams keep coming up with cool, arresting images: Stone peeling out of a motel car park in a purple Dodge Challenger; Dafoe and Chao bending over to cry single tears into a paddling pool; Dafoe strutting his stuff in dress shorts and high socks; Plemons tenderly stroking the face of a bum in a police station.</p>
<p id="LRaKwn">Even within the constraints of Lanthimos’ underplayed style, a movie like this is a treat for the actors, and Plemons’ transformation is particularly extraordinary: not just his bearing, but his whole body type seems to shift from piece to piece. You could call this movie <em>The Plemons Variations</em>. Stone’s agonizingly brittle performance as Emily dominates the third segment, although Dafoe and Chao are hilariously convincing as smug cult leaders. Lanthimos’ sensibility is an ideal match for the warped tranquility of a modern cult, and this third segment might be the most enjoyably weird window to peek into in <em>Kinds of Kindness</em>.</p>
<p id="JAI67W">It’s not the tidiest of the stories, though, and by the point it arrives, viewers have already been immersed in Lanthimos’ uncomfortable world for a long time. All three stories sit somewhere between short-form and long-form storytelling, and all three unfold at an unhurried pace. It’s a long sit, which may be part of the reason why the first story, “The Death of R.M.F.,” feels the most gripping and incisive. It will be interesting to try watching the three separately, like a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24146275/best-limited-series-mini-tv-shows-watch-streaming">miniseries</a>, when the movie is available at home; I can also imagine them expanded into individual 80- or 90-minute movies, as <em>Planet Terror</em> and <em>Death Proof </em>were after the release of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s 2007 pulp anthology <em>Grindhouse</em>.</p>
<p id="JCeSuZ">But watching them in isolation means missing the subtle but fascinating echoes between them, and the cumulative effect of piecing together the fragmented performances of the film’s brilliant cast. <em>Poor Things</em> is ultimately a hopeful journey for a deconstructed person, Stone’s Bella Baxter, who’s working to make herself whole. <em>Kinds of Kindness</em> returns us to the Lanthimos who — cruelly, but with tenderness and wry humor — prefers to pick people apart, open them up, and lay them out on the slab.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="v2OFcV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24147524/mars-express-movie-review-sci-fi-french-animation"><em>Mars Express</em></a>, the new sci-fi noir thriller from French director and animator Jérémie Périn, is finally available to stream on VOD this week following its American theatrical run in May. Périn’s film is fantastic: a sophisticated, hard-boiled detective story set in a futuristic society where humans and robots live side by side that’s as indebted to <em>Chinatown</em> and <em>The Long Goodbye</em> as it is to <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p id="Vu3wa5">Polygon recently had a chance to connect with Périn, so we had to ask: <strong>What was your first favorite anime, and what’s your favorite anime now?</strong></p>
<p id="OEJsgv">My Favorite Anime is Polygon’s column dedicated to collecting the stories of the biggest celebrity anime fans in the world, charting a path from their earliest introductions to Japanese animation to the series and films they love today. Here’s what Jérémie Périn had to say.</p>
<hr id="ngW9fx">
<h2 id="q7lPNH"><strong>What was your first favorite anime?</strong></h2>

<p id="urWMx6">Based on the manga by Buichi Terasawa, <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> is a 1982 sci-fi adventure anime about a bored office worker who accidentally discovers that he’s a swashbuckling mercenary who erased his own memories in order to elude a deadly group of space pirates. After regaining his memories, Cobra resumes his life as a mercenary, embarking on adventures around the universe with his partner, Lady Armaroid.</p>
<div id="3NchBy"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pw6H9doABWY?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zdwRMf">While Terasawa cited <em>Star Trek</em>, the James Bond film series, and the animation of René Laloux as his inspirations while writing the manga, the premise of <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> also bears a striking resemblance to Philip K. Dick’s 1966 short story “We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,” later adapted by Paul Verhoeven as <em>Total Recall</em>.</p>
<p id="gRrOK9">The other anime Périn cited, <em>The Rose of Versailles</em>,<em> </em>is a historical drama that takes place  before and during the French Revolution and follows the story of Oscar François de Jarjayes, the youngest daughter of a military general who raises her like a son so that she will one day succeed him as commander of the royal guard at the Palace of Versailles. Distraught over the plight of the French public under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancien_r%C3%A9gime"><em>ancien régime</em></a>, Oscar eventually leaves the guard to fight alongside the revolutionaries with her lover, André.</p>
<div id="FAjLFO"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eJIeJIqw-J0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="cr14WM">While on the surface these two anime couldn’t appear further apart, they actually share one remarkable thing in common. Both <em>Space Adventure Cobra</em> and <em>The Rose of Versailles</em> were directed by Osamu Dezaki, the anime legend who directed the 1970 anime adaptation of <em>Ashita no Joe</em> and co-founded the Japanese animation studio Madhouse. Dezaki is considered one of the most influential anime directors of the ’70s and ’80s, known for his distinctive visual style that incorporated split-screen imagery, Dutch angle shots, and other techniques that were uncommon in anime at the time. He is also best known for his use of pastel freeze frames, called “postcard memories,” which have since become a foundational visual trope throughout the entire medium of modern anime. </p>
<h2 id="Rr5DO3"><strong>What’s your favorite anime now?</strong></h2>

<p id="IhHuvc">Directed by Mamoru Oshii and produced by Production I.G, <em>Patlabor 2: The Movie</em> is a 1993 sci-fi political thriller set in an alternate 2002 where “Labors,” large-scale robots designed for heavy construction work, have revolutionized Japan’s economy. To respond to the increase in Labor-related crime, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police forms a special crime unit that deploys their own Patrol Labors (“Patlabors”) to resolve these cases.</p>
<div id="cN0StD"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/enwTApkJ0cc?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="f69A0Z">Unlike previous anime in the Patlabor franchise, <em>Patlabor 2: The Movie</em> is not a police comedy, but instead an explicitly political film that touches heavily on domestic and international issues Japan was facing at the time it was produced, such as the debate over Japan’s postwar identity and the deployment of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) in U.N. peacekeeping operations in Cambodia. The plot concerns the members of the Special Vehicles Unit of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department who work to apprehend the leader of a terrorist cell conspiring to incite havoc under the pretense of a coup.</p>
<p id="zxz3oQ">With a budget over twice that of the first Patlabor movie and <a href="https://animetudes.com/2022/04/22/mobile-police-patlabor-2-the-movie/">an improved layout production system</a> that saw talented animators and artists like Masahiro Ando, Satoshi Kon, and Hiroyuki Okiura working under animation director Kazuchika Kise, <em>Patlabor 2</em> was lauded for its more sophisticated photorealistic animation style, a style which would later be iterated upon in Oshii’s next film: the 1995 cyberpunk action anime <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p id="08E9oK"><em>Patlabor 2</em> is considered one of the best anime movies of the ’90s. Unfortunately, it’s currently unavailable to stream online. However, the film is included, along with the entire Patlabor series, in the Patlabor: The Mobile Police Ultimate Collection Blu-ray set available through the <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.crunchyroll.com%2Fproducts%2Fpatlabor-special-edition-blu-ray-816726027234.html&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fanime%2F2024%2F6%2F20%2F24180862%2Fmy-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23944903__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://store.crunchyroll.com/products/patlabor-special-edition-blu-ray-816726027234.html\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23944903__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://store.crunchyroll.com/products/patlabor-special-edition-blu-ray-816726027234.html&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/anime/2024/6/20/24180862/my-favorite-anime-jeremie-perin-the-rose-of-versailles-patlabor-2&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Crunchyroll Store</a> or <a href="https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/products/patlabor-the-mobile-police-ultimate-collection-blu-ray">Sentai Filmworks</a>.</p>

By comparison, Link has largely used more typical weaponry like the Master Sword, as well as a bow and arrow or bombs. The emphasis on furniture has spawned its own series of posts about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Yami_sha/status/1803226043806888391&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Yami_sha/status/1803226043806888391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">domesticity</a></span> and interior decoration.

It’s endlessly charming thanks to a great cast of characters and interesting missions, pulled together and kept interesting by engaging writing. It’s a tough task making a video game about journalism compelling, and perhaps even harder to be funny while doing it. Yet <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em> pulls off both with ease.

You are the first robot, or “robo” reporter aboard the <em>Times &amp; Galaxy,</em> and in a fun bit of customization, you can create your robo reporter from three body type presets and a wide-ranging color palette (I named my custom robo <em>Kotaku</em> Staff, obviously). Once aboard you’ll meet the staff of eccentric investigative reporters, sports journalists, art critics, and opinion writers. Before long, you are sent out on assignment<br></p><p>Assignments are the central gameplay loop of <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>. These are short adventures out on planets during which you must interview and investigate an area in hopes of writing the best story possible. When chatting with potential witnesses or sources you are offered dialogue options. Choose carefully, because you won’t always be able to ask every question, and whatever the interview subject says in response is all you have to work with. Assignments span all types of potential articles—the tutorial assignment is about a vehicle crash that may be hiding a corporate cover-up, but later assignments introduce you to court reporting, reviewing a restaurant, covering a cat show, and more. There are both exciting and boring assignments—as is the case in real journalism—but <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s sharp writing makes all of them fun thanks to a never-ending parade of weirdos to encounter.</p><figure id="" data-id="3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-recommend-id="image://3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-recommend-id="image://3205bf95b58a6e481e723b652282fd63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shows options for choosing elements of a news story with a headline that reads &quot;Eyes In Jar Among Cat Show Competitors&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There is a satisfying challenge to each assignment as well: turn a boring story into a hit. That’s where the build-a-story feature comes in. As a robo reporter, your special software lets you piece together sections of an article based on the information you’ve gathered. Depending on how thoroughly you explored and interviewed, you will have more options available to you. At the end of an assignment, you get to choose the hed, lede, nutgraf, key quote, and any detail that may add to the story.<br></p><p>If you don’t know what these things mean, don’t worry—as a new robo reporter, <em>Times &amp; Galaxy </em>will give you a crash course in journalism basics—no silly master’s degree that costs way too much money required! Each option also has a point rating based on how it will raise or lower readership and reputation. With that information, you can boost the paper’s standing, or ruin it.</p><h2 id="h1220"><a id=""></a><strong>Office space</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-recommend-id="image://6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="687" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-recommend-id="image://6347cfb0676b5800682e012e193b4e95" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="687" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Copybot tells Richard Gravity about his many writing errors" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When not out on assignment, you get to relax on the Scanner, the paper’s home base/spaceship. Time aboard the Scanner serves as a chance to get to know your coworkers. While they all have their own beat, each writer isn’t defined by their coverage. Learning about every hobby and interoffice spat makes talking to every person worth it. The continuous fighting between opinion writer Richard Gravity and Copybot (the robo copy editor) is one of my favorite side stories in the game. Though as much of an annoyance as Richard Gravity is, I cannot in good conscience side with the em-dash hating Copybot. Learning about and building relationships with—you can romance almost anyone on the Scanner—earns complimentary comparisons to time spent chatting with the beloved cast of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-makes-the-first-game-requ-1846899558"><em>Mass Effect</em></a></span> series while aboard the Normandy. That isn’t by accident: studio founder Ben Gelinas is an ex-Bioware writer who worked on <em>Mass Effect 3</em> and <em>Andromeda</em>.<br></p><p>As with <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s assignments, talking to everyone and exploring every corner of the Scanner is rewarded. While on assignment you are rewarded with better story options, aboard the Scanner you are rewarded with plain old character-building! </p><p>Writing dialogue and in-game text is where the developers at Copychaser Games flex their muscles the most, especially when it comes to satire. Jokes about newsrooms being short-staffed, not getting paid, em-dash arguments, endless PR emails, and more are so funny because they are so true to life. I might be biased since I am exactly this game’s audience but my fiancee—who ignores me as much as possible when I talk about my job—also loved the game’s comedic tone. That’s likely because in casting you as an intern<em> Times &amp; Galaxy </em>can teach you about journalism—even in a basic form—so that you can then laugh at the in-jokes.<br></p><h2 id="h1221"><a id=""></a><strong>This is fine (laughs nervously)</strong></h2><p>There’s so much fun to be had in<em> Times &amp; Galaxy</em>’s comedic sci-fi journalism world that it’s easy to just take it at face value. That wouldn’t be bad, it’s a fun and funny game! As you play, you’ll learn a bit about journalism along the way and enjoy the wonderfully written characters. But I can’t help but see something a little more sinister under the surface.</p><figure id="" data-id="e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-recommend-id="image://e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fellow Traveller</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-recommend-id="image://e21421b0f86bb0006f19c14d52ac5c44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A goo in a jar says &quot;Real soul-sucking stuff.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s not that the robo reporter is a thinly veiled metaphor for the influx of AI into journalism. I don’t think that is the case (<em>Kotaku</em> Staff would never take my job, right?), but rather the build-a-story structure encourages a mindset that equates good stories with readership going up. That might mean writing bad, sensational, or even outright false articles that twist the information you gained from sources can get you more eyes. Each hed, lede, and nutgraf option can be reduced to a number—as can an entire story. If it boosts numbers, it will keep a paper alive (hopefully). It’s a striking commentary on the state of modern media.<br></p><p>If this year’s satiric but more aggressive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-simulator-itch-indie-game-1851382388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-simulator-itch-indie-game-1851382388"><em>New York Times Simulator</em></a></span> is a less subtle game about the risks, responsibilities, and struggles of modern-day journalism, then <em>Times &amp; Galaxy</em> takes the spoonful of sugar approach with sharp and funny writing that makes it endlessly entertaining—even if it stings a bit. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/leveraging-emotional-design-features-to-enhance-character-perception-in-pixel-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This article explores how emotional design features - colours and shapes - influence player perception of pixel art characters. By understanding these design elements, game developers can create characters that elicit specific emotional responses, improving player engagement and retention. The article includes practical tips on applying these findings to character design in pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relationship between character design and player perception is crucial for creating engaging gaming experiences. While previous research has focused on the impact of character appearance on player perceptions, there is limited knowledge about how emotional design features specifically affect pixel art characters. The research described in this article aims to bridge that gap, providing insights that can help developers create emotionally resonant characters using cost-efficient pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Value of Emotional Design Features">The Value of Emotional Design Features</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Character appearance significantly shapes player perceptions and emotional responses. Even the slightest alterations in a character's design can substantially change how players perceive and connect with them. Players often deeply empathise with non-playable characters in narrative-driven games like the Mass Effect series. This connection enhances the gaming experience and encourages player retention.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Colour and shape psychology is widely used in narrative-driven games, such as Mass Effect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Character appearance is formed by design choices, also called emotional design features. Colours and shapes are among the most basic emotional design features and among the few actually used in pixel art. This article aims to describe how and to what extent emotional design features impact character perception in pixel art.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Colour and Shape Psychology">Colour and Shape Psychology</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Colour and shape significantly influence players' emotional responses and perceptions in games. Warm colours like red and yellow evoke danger, excitement and energy, while cool colours like blue and green promote trust and calmness. Neutral colours, such as black and white, convey power and purity, respectively. Shapes also play a role: circles and curves are seen as friendly and safe, squares as stable and reliable, and triangles as dynamic and aggressive. Game developers can use these psychological principles to enhance character development and storytelling, creating more engaging and immersive gaming experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the sake of simplicity, this experiment was limited to 4 colours—3 primary and 1 secondary—and 3 shapes. Each colour and shape has strong associations, common in design psychology research.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Experiment Design Process">The Experiment Design Process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To see if this would apply to pixel art, we conducted an experiment among 48 participants, predominantly male (61%), with a balanced age distribution predominantly under 34 years old.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The participants were split into two groups—8 were observed in a controlled environment, while 60 others completed the experiment from their homes, providing insights into natural settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Participants were shown twelve characters individually, one by one, selecting associated traits from a predefined list. This was facilitated through a digital questionnaire available at https://mgtexp.com. A detailed experiment description is provided below to help understand its design and execution:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Character creation. Twelve pixel art characters were created using combinations of four colours (red, green, blue, purple) and shapes (circle, square, triangle). Each character featured a unique combination of colour and shape, such as red triangles, blue circles, green squares, etc. </span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hypotheses. A hypothesis was created for every character based on previous research – for example, the red triangular character would be perceived as “dangerous”, and the green round-shaped one as “friendly”.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data collection. Participants were shown the characters individually. For each character, they selected associated traits from a predefined list, choosing 48 traits in total – 3 for every character. Moreover, participants responded to personal questions about age group, gender, and gaming experience.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Analysis. All responses were collected and subjected to statistical analyses to determine which colours and shapes were most strongly associated with each trait. The responses' correlation with personal data was also analysed. This analysis helped derive the conclusions discussed below.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Data Insights">Data Insights</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Based on the data analysis, four different situations were determined:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">19 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was confirmed, and the data was statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">6 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was rejected due to the wrong hypothetical value, but the data was still statistically significant at a significance level of 0.05, meaning that there was a correlation between colour and shape and the resulting answers;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">6 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was rejected due to the statistical insignificance of the data at a significance level of 0.05, but the hypothetical value was still the most common answer;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">5 hypotheses - the original hypothesis was rejected due to the inconsistency of the answers, and the data was statistically insignificant at a significance level of 0.05.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the analysis, the participants' responses could be predicted at least for 25 characters out of 36. Some of the analyses have shown inconsistent results, suggesting that colours have a stronger impact on character perception than shapes. It was found that colours and shapes influence each other, alternating character perception when working together. Moreover, there seems to be a gender and personal experience bias in character perception for secondary colours.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Key Findings">Key Findings</h2><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Primary Colours and Perception: Primary colours strongly influence character perception, consistently evoking specific emotional responses. For example, red signifies danger or excitement, while blue conveys calmness or sadness.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shapes and Their Interplay with Colours: Shapes impact character perception to a lesser extent than colours. However, the combination of colours and shapes can enhance or mitigate their individual effects. For example, a red triangle might be perceived as more aggressive than a red circle.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ambiguity of Secondary Colours: Secondary colours like purple tend to be more ambiguous and subject to personal interpretation, leading to less consistent emotional responses from players. It was also discovered that there could be a gender difference in how players perceive secondary colours.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Practical Application">Practical Application</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To apply these findings, game developers should consider the following:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Controlled Use of Primary Colours: Leveraging primary colours can create characters with predictable emotional impacts. For instance, using red for antagonistic or dangerous characters and blue for trustworthy allies can help establish clear emotional cues.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combining Colours and Shapes: Thoughtfully combining colours and shapes can enhance character design. For example, a friendly character might be designed using soft, round shapes and green colours. On the other hand, if the goal is to create a controversial character, mixing “positive” colours and “negative” shapes (and vice versa) can be considered.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Avoid Overuse of Secondary Colours: Given their ambiguous nature, secondary colours should be used sparingly and strategically to avoid inconsistent emotional responses. While purple is widely used as a “villain” colour in digital character design, the data suggests that this colour elicits mixed feelings if no other emotional design features specifically portray a character as a villain.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Testing and Feedback: Regularly test character designs with target audiences to gauge their emotional responses and adjust designs accordingly. While the study's initial hypotheses were based on popular colour psychology patterns, only half were confirmed.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this research confirms that emotional design features significantly impact character perception in pixel art, its findings also suggest that players perceive secondary colours very subjectively. By understanding and applying these insights, game developers can create more engaging and emotionally resonant characters, improving player enjoyment and retention.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nivalis-spring-2025-release-window</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambitious-cyberpunk-restaurant-sim-nivalis-gets-spring-2025-release-window.906678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nivalis-spring-2025-release-window<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Ion Lands has announced that&nbsp;<em>Nivalis</em>, the ambitious followup to cyberpunk taxi-driving sim&nbsp;<em>Cloudpunk</em>, is launching in spring 2025.</p>
<p>The game takes place in the same city as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/cloudpunk-review"><em>Cloudpunk</em></a>, but it'll offer a different type of gameplay; instead of ferrying packages around, you'll be running your very own cyberpunk restaurant, which could potentially blossom into a nightlife empire.</p>
<p>As you do so, you'll meet the locals, get to know them, and befriend them, and Ion Lands says you may even be able to find love, so it sounds like at least some of the city's inhabitants will be romanceable.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nivalis-release-window-2025-restaurant.jpg?itok=a4-atA7v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nivalis-release-window-2025-restaurant.jpg?itok=qh4yhb6w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nivalis&nbsp;</em>offers a cyberpunk slice-of-life sim that looks pretty immersive.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as a cyberpunk city with 19 distinct districts to explore, Ion Lands is promising "realistic weather simulation and night and day cycles", as well as the ability to explore not only on foot but also by boat.</p>
<p>While on your boat, you'll also be able to go fishing, and although Ion Lands doesn't specify whether you'll be able to use the fish you catch as ingredients for your meals, that seems like a no-brainer to me.</p>
<p>Ion Lands has also released a brand new trailer for <i>Nivalis</i>, and it gives a look at some "never-before-seen locations", as well as dropping some hints as to what the game's story might be. You can check it out here.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is a slice-of-life sim, you'll be able to decorate your very own home as well, and you'll be able to own multiple apartments.</p>
<p>There won't be any kind of combat element in the game either, so if you prefer your cyberpunk experiences a little more chilled-out and mellow, it looks like this one will be for you.</p>
<p>Technically, this spring 2025 release window constitutes a delay; the last we heard of&nbsp;<em>Nivalis</em>, it had a 2024 release window, so it's been pushed back a little. Let's hope that the extra time will let Ion Lands polish the game up and realize its full potential.</p>
<p><em>Nivalis&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1488490/Nivalis/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> in spring 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The project was canceled in 2003, leading to the closure of the storied studio. However, despite never seeing the light of day, the game still looms large in the minds of <em>Fallout</em> fans, and now, series creator Tim Cain has provided fresh insight into the circumstances leading to its cancellation.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196903" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="189" data-playlist="196903,196646,196411" data-current="196903"><div><p>Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22460.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Cain details the cancellation of <em>Van Buren</em> in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag&amp;t=1s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag&amp;t=1s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a></span> posted on June 19. In it, he explains how he may have had a hand in ultimately ending the original <em>Fallout 3.</em> To begin, the fact that he was involved in <em>Van Buren</em> at all is a fascinating detail given that he left <em>Fallout</em> developer and publisher Interplay in the middle of <em>Fallout 2</em>’s development. However, Cain reveals that in 2003, an Interplay vice president asked him to play a prototype of <em>Van Buren</em>. The project was already in trouble, with the VP telling Cain he planned on canceling it unless Cain could give him an estimate on development time that would reassure Interplay.</p><p>Cain played about two hours of the prototype and asked members of the development team several questions to get a better idea of the state the game was in. Eventually, Cain was able to determine a time frame. He told the VP, “I’m convinced in 18 months you could have a really good game shipped,” Cain recounts. The VP’s response was to ask if it could be done any faster. Cain did not recommend it, saying that even with a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crunch-time-why-game-developers-work-such-insane-hours-1704744577">death march crunch</a></span>” the game could not be completed in less than a year. At this point, the VP told him that any answer over six months was going to result in <em>Van Buren</em> being canceled. Cain jokes that the answer he gave got the game canceled, but notes that the game would have been canceled no matter what given the VP’s desired timeline. </p><p>Cain explains that Interplay, which had been experiencing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vg247.com/the-last-days-of-black-isle-studios&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vg247.com/the-last-days-of-black-isle-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial hardship</a></span> for years, simply couldn’t fund more than six months of development. Sure enough, <em>Van Buren</em> was canceled, Black Isle was closed, and all of its staff was laid off. Eventually, a game called <em>Fallout 3</em> made its way into the hands of gamers thanks to Bethesda, but <em>Van Buren</em> never did.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Game Freak, renowned for creating some of the most cherished Pokemon games, has announced a departure from its usual lineup with the upcoming release of Pand Land, a new RPG developed in partnership with Wonderland. Despite their extensive history with the Pokemon franchise, Game Freak is boldly venturing into uncharted territory with this exciting new game. Pand Land will be released later this month, and fans eagerly anticipate more details.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/06/game-freak-and-wonderplanet-announce-free-to-play-sailing-adventure-rpg-pand-land-for-ios-android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a>, Pand Land is a free-to-play, casual maritime adventure RPG released for iOS and Android on June 24, 2024. Pre-registration for Game Freak’s upcoming title is available now. It is important to note that Pand Land is currently only being released in Japan.</p>

<p>In Pand Land, players embark on a thrilling adventure as the captain of an expedition team in search of a legendary treasure. The game offers a vast, unexplored world to navigate, with new treasure maps and secrets to uncover. As you progress, you’ll face challenging dungeons, leading to the acquisition of new allies and valuable treasures. With over 400 types of allies and treasures to discover, the game promises endless excitement. Moreover, you can share this adventure with your friends through the game’s online play feature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we’re excited about Game Freak’s foray into non-Pokemon RPGs with Pand Land, the developer has also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced their involvement</a> in the next Pokemon mainline title. Titled Pokemon Legends Z-A, the game was unveiled with a cinematic trailer during the Pokemon Presents showcase earlier this year. Additionally, Take Two’s Private Division and Game Freak have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/project-bloom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnered up</a> to deliver a new action-adventure game codenamed Project Bloom. </p>



<p>We’re eager to hear your thoughts on Game Freak’s non-Pokemon RPG in the comments.</p>

<p>Bluepoint Games, a PlayStation-owned studio renowned for its top-tier remakes and remasters, has a rich gaming history with titles like the Demon’s Souls PS5 edition, Shadow of Colossus PS4 remake, and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake collection. Following their acquisition by Sony Interactive Entertainment in 2021, they made a significant announcement of releasing original content. </p>



<p>While they couldn’t divulge much about it, their dedication to this project is evident. Fast forward three years, and it’s clear that they are still hard at work on this highly anticipated original content.</p>



<hr>



<p>Peter Dalton, the Head of Technology at Bluepoint Games, recently took to Twitter to express his admiration for FromSoftware’s Hidetaka Miyazaki and Nintendo. In these challenging times for the gaming industry, their words of solidarity and approach towards the layoffs have been respectable and encouraging for Dalton. </p>



<p>In the same post, Dalton was asked about the status of Bluepoint Studio’s original content. His response was clear- “Nothing has changed since our statement that we are working on an original title”. He further emphasized that ‘everything takes time’ and they are committed to honing their skills, a sentiment that resonates with many in the industry.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nothing has changed since our statement that we are working on an original title. Everything takes time.

</div></figure>



<p>It’s certainly good to hear that a developer is still working on something, as promised. However, some updates will be appreciated. It has been over three years since their announcement, so the least we can expect is a title and a release window, not even a gameplay trailer. However, on the flip side and in the words of Peter Dalton, everything good does take time, and maybe a bit of patience with Bluepoint Studio is something that is needed right now. Let’s wait to see what PlayStation and Bluepoint Games are cooking behind the scenes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-repays-300m-to-lenders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Repayment comes from net proceeds received from Take-Two's purchase of Gearbox Entertainment</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Embracer Group is a step closer to clearing its debts after paying SEK 3.2 billion ($300 million) on its revolving credit facility.</p>
<p>The group told lenders today that it had made the repayment towards the credit it has borrowed. The full repayment is due by May 2025, and Embracer reported this installment is "in accordance with [the] plan."</p>
<p>The May deadline was part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-extends-credit-and-loan-agreements-amid-ongoing-restructure">extension agreements Embracer secured on its credit and loans</a> back in December.</p>
<p>The repayment was made possible by the net proceeds Embracer has already received from the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460-million">sale of Gearbox Entertainment to Take-Two Interactive</a>. The $460 million deal was announced in March, and <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-closes-the-divestment-of-gearbox-entertainment/">completed last week</a>.</p>
<p>The group has also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-sells-saber-interactive-for-247m">sold Saber Interactive</a> and associated studios for $247 million.</p>
<p>Last month, Embracer's full-year financials showed that the group <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-full-year-sales-rise-to-39bn-but-15bn-debt-remains">still held debts of $1.5 billion</a>, but the divestments of Saber and Gearbox are expected to reduce this significantly.</p>
<p>The company is also moving €900 million of its debt into tabletop publisher Asmodee as part of its plans to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/embracer-group-splits-into-three-everything-you-need-to-know">split into three separate entities</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/lars-wingefors-on-why-embracer-is-going-away-and-what-happens-next">CEO Lars Wingefors told GamesIndustry.biz</a> earlier this year: "The banks love Asmodee, they know the company has been highly leveraged on their private equity ownership for more than a decade. That amount is basically paying down the debt – not all, but most of the debt – in the remaining Embracer Group, meaning Coffee Stain &amp; Friends and Middle-Earth &amp; Friends."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gladiator-sim-we-who-are-about-to-die-gets-biggest-update-by-a-lot.906636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-who-are-about-to-die-big-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gladiator sim&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die&nbsp;</em>has received a massive new update, which developer Jordy Lakiere says is the game's biggest update yet "by a lot".</p>
<p>The Spectacles update has been "over six months in the making", according to Lakiere, and it introduces tons of new features, including new game modes, reworked animations, and more.</p>
<p>First up, five new game modes have been added. Elite Fights challenges you to take on tough bosses accompanied by minions, while Draft is described as an "army field battle" mode by Lakiere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-who-are-about-to-die-update-spectacles-new-modes.jpg?itok=ptJ3b8b6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-who-are-about-to-die-update-spectacles-new-modes.jpg?itok=lBnoZr2G 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die</em>'s combat, you're about to find more reasons to engage with it.</figcaption></figure><p>The Tournament mode sees two teams engaging in round-based combat, and the Grand Tournament variant ups the limit to three or more teams.</p>
<p>Finally, the Survival mode allows you to fight waves of enemies in order to see how long you can last. If you were disappointed by the lack of modes on offer in&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die</em>, it's fair to say that complaint has been addressed.</p>
<p>The game's animations have also been reworked; Lakiere says he's "completely rebuilt" movement animations, and that sprinting is now omnidirectional. Not only that, but you can perform "all actions" while you're sprinting now too.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough,&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die</em>'s AI has been rejigged as well; it's got a new movement system, new flanking logic, and shield aiming, plus more changes that should make it feel cleverer and more rewarding to outsmart.</p>

<p>A new map, the Grand Plaza, has also been added, and 21 new items have been introduced, alongside a host of other balance tweaks and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>As Lakiere himself says, the full list of changes was too lengthy to list on Steam or in the above video, but you can check out a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/973230/view/4172103171325838517" rel="noopener" target="_blank">truncated version of the patch notes right here</a>. Lakiere says you'll have to play the game to find out everything else that's new.</p>
<p><em>We Who Are About to Die&nbsp;</em>is a gladiator-themed action-roguelike with a unique "physics-based combat system" that relies on directional attacks and full control.</p>
<p>Each gladiator has just one life, and you'll have to make the most of it as you take part in a series of grueling fights that will test your mettle to its limit.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>We Who Are About to Die&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/973230/We_Who_Are_About_To_Die/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. It looks like a pretty solid gladiator sim, and as a bonus, its creator <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/domina-removed-from-steam-after-devs-transphobic-rant">isn't using Steam as a platform to spout hatred</a>.</p>

            <p>
With Sony having surprised precisely no-one by announcing that, once again, PlayStation won't be at this year's Gamescom, Microsoft has seized the opportunity to let everyone know that, by Jove, Xbox <em>will</em> be at this year's show.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1803774842774127085">shared the news</a> over on social media, inviting attendees to visit its "biggest booth yet" when Gamescom returns to Cologne, Germany, in August this year.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft will, of course, be the only major console maker to have at presence at Gamescom 2024; Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-report">confirmed it wouldn't be coming along</a> back in April, saying there would be opportunities for players to try Switch games at other events throughout the year, and PlayStation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year">confirmed a no-show</a> earlier this week. Sony's absence hardly warrants a raised eyebrow, however, given it hasn't showed up since 2019.

<p>
Gamescom should be a big one for Xbox, though, given its upcoming slate. First-party wise, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circles-trailer-got-me-thinking-has-there-ever-been-a-great-indy-game">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forget-levolution-and-drivatars-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-now-has-omnimovement">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Avowed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-gets-november-release-date-and-stunning-new-trailer">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, and Age of Mythology Retold all launch before the end of 2024, so hands-on time seems likely. Microsoft might even tease a little more of next year's releases - including Doom: The Dark Ages and Fable - following this month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">impressive Xbox Games Showcase</a>.
</p>
<p>
Gamescom 2024 runs from 21st-25th August, and is preceded by Geoff Keighley's glitzy Opening Night Live showcase on 20th August - which promises two hours of game announcements, trailers, and gameplay reveals. And maybe even a Kojima or two?

  <p id="EvVJYA">One of the best parts of our jobs at Polygon is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play">recommending awesome new games to play</a>. Whether it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151036/best-indie-games-2024">indie games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24151983/best-cozy-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">cozy games</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24144632/best-board-games-2024-new">board games</a>, or just the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24078256/best-video-games-2024">best of the year</a>, we’re always trying to introduce readers to new and exciting picks. Lists are a great way to share a variety of games in a short amount of time. But sometimes it’s fun to do something more personally curated.</p>
<p id="YXwJDF">That’s why we have this regular open thread dedicated to helping you, our dear readers, find the perfect game to play right now. Looking for a narrative-rich sci-fi epic that will have you fight the techno embodiment of god? We’ve got you. Want a five-minute distraction to break up the daily grind? We’ve got you there, too.</p>
<p id="DQEOOH">From 3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. EDT, I will be in the comments section down below answering your questions and fielding requests for what you should play. We previously programmed this as a weekly movie column but will be moving that version to a monthly schedule with more non-movie recommendation threads coming your way week over week.</p>
<p id="bPgMdP">I should add that this is also a great place to share what <em>you’ve been playing</em>, if you want to talk about that with your fellow Polygon readers! Participation is very welcome, even without questions.</p>
<p id="ImOZlt">Now to share a bit about your curator this time around: I’m Ana Diaz, a culture writer at Polygon. I am a contributor at MinnMax, <a href="https://minnmax.com/">a podcast and Patreon-supported network</a> started by a fantastic group of ex-Game Informer folks. Online, I can be a bit over the top. Listeners will likely know me for going “feral” during our Cream of the Steam show, where we play random games on Steam, and screaming about <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like to think about games in different contexts. I love all things local, including video games. As a result, I’m deeply invested in the games being made in Minnesota, and even spoke to one developer as part of an ongoing series for the contemporary art museum in the Twin Cities.</p>
<p id="pB9I7n">At Polygon, I play a lot of trendy viral games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24057437/palworld-review-pokemon-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-survival"><em>Palworld</em></a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24043555/lethal-company-best-entry-level-horror-game"><em>Lethal Company</em></a>. However, I was raised on the classic Nintendo catalog and figured out how to run an SNES emulator on my family’s laptop when I was 13. These days, I tend to juggle playing living games with my other interests. I play<em> Honkai: Star Rail </em>daily and <em>Fortnite </em>a few times a week. In between those games, I’ll chip away at whatever non-ongoing game I might be interested in at the moment. Right now I am working my way through the narrative sci-fi adventure <em>1000xResist</em>,<em> </em>and I’ve been doing challenge runs with my 18-year-old cousin in <em>The Sims 4</em>. </p>

                <p>EA Sports has published the official reveal trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/25-things-coming-to-madden-25/1100-6524279/" data-ref-id="1100-6524279">Madden 25</a>. The video shows off some of what to expect from this year's entry in the long-running professional football series, and there are quite a few improvements and changes on the way.</p><p>In particular, the video spotlights the so-called "Boom Tech" system that promises improvements to physics-based tackling, along with some of the new catch mechanics that could lead to some pretty impressive catches. Here's the trailer, which EA says is made up of "game engine" footage:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/bandai-namco-expectations-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bandai-namco-expectations-for-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="506" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC</a> for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em> is finally dropping later today. Some people have even started playing it already, depending on their timezone, but there’s no point being jealous when it’s so close to release. It’s not just fans who’ve been feverishly waiting for this expansion, though; publisher Bandai Namco’s own anticipation has been described as “sky-high” for what it’s calling the company’s “most ambitious” DLC launch.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">This is according to Bandai Namco Europe’s chief marketing and sales officer Anthony Macare, who told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-bandai-namcos-most-ambitious-expansion-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> “rivals the scope of a standalone game.” This is why it’s been marketed almost like a brand new title, with Bandai Namco releasing multiple physical and digital editions.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">This obviously includes a new version of <em>Elden Ring</em> that comes packaged with the DLC, which is meant to attract new players. Macare added that Bandai Namco is expecting <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> to generate a lot of new sales for <em>Elden Ring</em>, though refrained from sharing exact targets. Since <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is intended to be <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s only DLC, the promise of a complete package could entice those who skipped the game in 2022 to pick it up.</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">At the very least, in the run-up to the DLC’s release, Macare has claimed <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s active player count has already “reached new heights” thanks to both returning players and new ones, meaning some couldn’t wait for the DLC to drop before picking up the game. That does make some sense, though, considering <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-fans-mustnt-forget-to-beat-mohg-if-they-want-to-play-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you need to defeat two specific bosses</a> before you can access the DLC.</p>
 <p data-characters="636" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">As for the game’s improved player counts, while there’s no public data on the PlayStation and Xbox versions, we can see how <em>Elden Ring</em> is performing on Steam via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1245620/charts/#1y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. Although it’s not managed to reach the highs of its launch (<em>Elden Ring</em> peaked at 953,426 concurrent players in March 2022), the Steam player count has steadily gone up since the middle of May, recently breaking 200,000 concurrent players for the first time since 2022. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/globaltopsellers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s sales charts</a>, <em>Elden Ring</em> is also the top selling game on the platform at the time of writing, with the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion in second place.</p>
 <p data-characters="526" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false"><em>Elden Ring</em> was already a major success when it launched, having sold <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-12-million-sales-from-software-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a staggering 12 million copies in its first two weeks</a>, cementing it as a new IP for Bandai Namco. Just last week, the <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1800891340374642989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official FromSoftware Twitter account</a> announced <em>Elden Ring</em> had crossed the 25 million sales mark. Ironically, such overwhelming success only means Bandai Namco wants even more of it. So, while it has high expectations for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, let’s hope they’re not so unreasonable that the DLC is deemed a financial failure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/thursday-murder-club-movie-has-one-hell-of-a-cast/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=thursday-murder-club-movie-has-one-hell-of-a-cast<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="251" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Thursday Murder Club</em>, the massively successful novel by Richard Osmon, is getting a movie adaptation. The film doesn’t have a release date just yet, but it’s got its cast all set, ready to take the story from page to screen in style.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">The Thursday Murder Club is the first book in the so-far four-book <em>Thursday Murder Club</em> series and revolves around a group of crime-fighting old-age pensioners who all reside in the same luxury retirement complex. As such, it should come as no surprise that the majority of the currently known stars are on the older side, staying true to its source material. </p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">On his Podcast, <em><a href="https://www.goalhangerpodcasts.com/the-rest-is-entertainment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rest is Entertainment</a></em>, Osmon detailed that Elizabeth Banks will be played by fan favorite Helen Mirren, someone who many fans have shouted at Osmon in the streets as their casting choice, as he went on to say in the episode of the Podcast.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="109" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false">Alongside Mirren, the following incredible line-up of stars are joining the cast of <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em>:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"> <li>Pierce Brosnan as Ron Ritchie</li> <li>Sir Ben Kingsley as Ibrahim Arif</li> <li>Celia Imrie as Joyce Meadowcroft</li> <li>Naomi Ackie as Donna de Freitas</li> <li>Jonathan Pryce as Stephen Best</li> <li>David Tennant&nbsp;</li> <li>Daniel Mays</li> <li>Henry Lloyd-Hughes</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">While it hasn’t been confirmed as of yet which roles the final three names on this list will play, there’s no arguing that this is a very exciting line-up. On the latest episode of <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-rest-is-entertainment/id1718287198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rest is Entertainmant</a>, Osmon said that this might be the “greatest British cast since the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies”, and I have to admit I can’t find any reason to disagree.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amblin Entertainment</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Away from the cast themselves, the power behind <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> is also pretty impressive. The Netflix movie will be written and directed by Christopher Columbus, of previous <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Home Alone</em> fame, while the movie rights belong to Amblin Entertainment, led by Stephen Spielberg.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="false">Filming is set to begin this summer, with a hopeful release date at some point in 2025. As a fan of the books, I’m really impressed by this line-up and hopeful that the screen adaptation of <em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> will do the books justice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/forest-hills-the-last-year-revitalizes-last-years-asymmetrical-horror-this-october/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=forest-hills-the-last-year-revitalizes-last-years-asymmetrical-horror-this-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Undaunted Games has announced that it’s a follow-up to the asymmetrical horror game<em> Last Year, Forest Hills: The Last Year, which </em>will be released in time for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/whats-your-go-to-halloween-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halloween</a> 2024. The game is more of a revamp of the IP instead of a sequel, promising a refined experience for all fans.</p> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><em>Last Year</em> was initially released in December 2019 and received fairly favorable reviews, making it one of the better alternatives to <em>Dead by Daylight</em> at the time. However, the game grew faster than the developer could handle and suffered from a lack of regular new content and updates. After picking up the IP and reviving the game, Undaunted Games is now releasing a revitalized version with many new features and upgrades called <em>Forest Hills: The Last Yea</em>r on <strong>October 22, 2024</strong>. </p>
 <h2 id="h-forest-hills-the-last-year-is-the-playable-high-school-horror-movie-of-your-nightmares" data-injectable="false"><em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> is the playable high school horror movie of your nightmares</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Forest Hills: The Last Year - Official Teaser #3 | Fear Never Dies" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyGJvjYbyYI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true"><em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> was originally slated for an early access release, but that’s been changed to a full launch in 2024, with more content being added throughout 2025 via regular updates. Undaunted Games has boasted how the title will now include even more content than it had first planned, which is great news for asymmetrical horror game fans looking for something a little different from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em>. </p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">At launch, <em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> is going to have seven maps, including those from the original game, each with bug fixes and improvements. These maps are The Library, The Belltower, The Gym, The Sawmill, The Mine, The Forest, and The Cemetery.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Players will have the choice of six Fiends at launch. These are the Killers you play as in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, and they’re just as deadly. The Fiends are The Slasher, The Strangler, The Giant, The Spider, The Warlock, and The Dryad. Sam, Nick, Troy, Chad, Raj, Amber, and Abigail will be the Displaced, the Survivors of <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, you can play as. </p>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">New dialogue and audio systems have been implemented, but the most interesting development is an ability system for Fiends and an overhaul of the Arcanum system for Displaced. This is where<em> Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> will differentiate itself in the asymmetrical horror genre, offering more unique builds and ways to play. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Veteran comic book artist Andy “Bob Anger” Belanger has crafted the game’s art, acclaimed writer Frank Tieri its narrative, and Sean Schemmel, known for his work on the <em>DragonBall</em> series, is the voiceover director. A cast that should be set to make something unique and gripping to play. </p>
 <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">The gameplay of <em>Forest Hills: The Last Year</em> sees five Displaced players work together to avoid a single and incredibly powerful Fiend player. Displaced must work together to solve problems around the map and, ultimately, escape. They’ll earn powers as they work together, allowing them to fight back a little against the Fiend, who is purely out to kill every Displaced they can. </p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="false">In the game’s lore, the Displaced are high school students who played an occult card game and have been whisked away to a nightmarish version of some part of their hometown. A Fiend hunts them, and they have to escape before they’re murdered and become nothing more than a folk tale. With a giant spider as one of the Fiends, I can see this game giving anyone who plays it a good scare. </p>
