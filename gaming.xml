			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster in terms of it being a very-well done boost in graphical fidelity from the original, but it's also great because it was more than just the original game with a graphics boost.</p>
<p>It also included a new expansion called In the Beginning, with 18 new puzzles to solve, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of which</a> were actually made in collaboration with members of the Talos Principle's community.</p>
<p>So it's no wonder that they are some of the most difficult puzzles in the whole series. They're not impossible, mind you, they're just very difficult. The thing is that there's always a trick to them, and if you want a hint for Subway Escape before getting the whole solution, the hint here is that creating redundancies will take you far.</p>
<p>That's your hint, but if you just want to know the steps to solve the puzzle, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Subway Escape Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you walk into the Subway Escape puzzle area, it's immediately a bit confusing. There's a subway cart in the center of the room behind a fence and two shields on one side. You also can't head forward across the tracks, due to the walls being lined with turrets. Solving Subway Escape, thankfully, has nothing to do with these elements. Everything about the puzzle begins when you walk through the purple forcefield on the left side of the room and pick up the jammer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer and head around the corner towards the shield blocking the path to an elevator. Use the jammer on the shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Turn around and grab the connector you walked by on your way to the elevator, and take the elevator down with the connector in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you get to the bottom floor, you'll see another jammer (J2) keeping a shield in front of you deactivated. Walk into the room and grab J2 to deactivate the shield on the right-hand side of the room. Then, use the connector to connect the red laser generator to the red node, creating a redundancy with J2, and the red laser, keeping the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up J2 and walk it to the other side of the shield so you can keep the shield deactivated while grabbing the connector and bringing it to the corner of the room.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use J2 to deactivate the shield blocking your path to the fan, pressure switch, and hexahedron behind the shield on your right.&nbsp;Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, pick up the connector, and jump on the fan to fly up to the second level.&nbsp;Head down the stairs and walk towards the middle of the room so that you can place the connector in a spot where you can connect it to the blue node and blue laser generator on the bottom level. This has now created a redundancy with the shield J2 is deactivating and the blue laser.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the bottom level and grab J2. Fly back up to the second level with J2 in hand, and place it next to the connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and jump back down to the bottom floor so that you can leave the connector on the pressure switch that activates the fan, and carry the hexahedron up with you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll have noticed that so far, we've been ignoring the second hexahedron sitting on the purple forcefield, and that's because we haven't needed it yet. Grab it, and the other hexahedron and place them both beside J2.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>This next part is simple, but a little tedious. You simply have to use the hexahedrons to 'walk' across the purple forcefield. If you fall off the hexahedrons, you'll have to reset, so don't fall off. Step by step, while staying on top of the hexahedrons, make your way across the purple forcefield to the other side with J2 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedrons on the two pressure switches to deactivate the shield in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With J2 in hand, walk through the deactivated shield to jump back down to the bottom floor, and take the elevator back up to the top floor.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now, take both J2 and J1 back to the purple forcefield you walked through to get into this area, and use them to deactivate the two layers of shields blocking the way to the subway cart and the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino inside the cart to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you'll be able to take the subway cart through the hall of turrets and to the next puzzle, which is arguably the most difficult puzzle included in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Nintendo Switch just got a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658511/nintendo-switch-20-0-0-update-virtual-game-card-gameshare-switch-2">new update</a> that adds Virtual Game Cards as a way to share digital games with other people. But the update also closes a loophole that would let you play shared games online at the same time as somebody you were sharing the game with, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-users-say-virtual-game-cards-are-a-downgrade-as-online-game-sharing-changes">reported by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>Before the introduction of Virtual Game Cards, the only way Nintendo allowed you to share digital Switch games was by logging into your Nintendo Account on a second Switch and downloading the game to that console. Using that system, which is now available under “Online License Settings,” it was possible for you and a friend to play that game that you owned online simultaneously. </p><p>Following the new Switch update, that digital sharing system is still an option – you don’t have to use Virtual Game Cards. However, with the old system, two people can’t play a shared game online at the same time anymore, which could be a disappointment if you relied on it ahead of this update.</p><p>If you do opt to use Virtual Game Cards, Nintendo won’t just force you to manage those on a Switch or Switch 2; the company will also let you manage them from <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/portal/vgcs">a website</a>, which could be handy if you don’t have your Switch nearby but want to share a game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">recent round of layoffs at Respawn parent company EA</a> reportedly lead to around 300 to 400 job losses, plus cancellations of two incubation projects. It's since come out that one of those projects was likely an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> universe, codenamed 'R7'. This joins an unannounced single player<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unannounced-single-player-titanfall-game-has-been-cancelled-by-ea"> Titanfall game cancelled in 2023</a>, alongside the perpetually rumoured but yet-to-materialise Titanfall 3. It has, in brief, been a rough <em>forever </em>to be a fan of Respawn's exciting mix of parkour shooting and mech piloting combat.</p>
<p>But what's this? Nestled in the replies to this good<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/headfallsoff.com/post/3lnxved4uwc25"> Bluesky post</a> lies the promise of a mechful consolation prize. "Oopsie I dropped this legally distinct fan project," writes Diesel Knights developer Xavier B. Johnson, alongside one of those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2785740/Diesel_Knights/">Steam links I know you all enjoy</a>. "Diesel Knights is a 6-v-6, Mech/Movement Shooter set in a pulp-inspired, dieselpunk world", and you can request access to the upcoming playtest right now.</p>

<p>"Stunningly rendered for the first time in dazzling full color! Join us now for these treacherous tales of the dauntless Diesel Knights and their fearsome fighting machines," reads Steam. "Utilize verticality and momentum to outmaneuver your opponents in all new first or third person multiplayer action or compete for the fastest time in the time trial mode".</p>
<p>Everything's pre-alpha at the moment, but I do still enjoy the rusty charm of the "mid-century inspired weapons and gadgets".

I called it one of the best games in the series and the best-looking open-world game I’ve ever played. Set in feudal Japan, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266"><em>Shadows</em></a></span> quickly became the second best-selling game of the year so far. And now, after the dust has settled, Ubisoft has revealed a months-long roadmap that includes new features, quests, options, gear, and even big parkour improvements. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Wednesday</a></span>, Ubisoft published a short video detailing all the upcoming content and updates planned for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </em>Most of the updates will be completely free, including a planned series of regular “Story Drops” that will add new quests, abilities, and activities while also providing more backstory for fan-favorite side characters. The first one lands in early May. </p><p>For fans of doing sick parkour leaps across buildings and up walls, Ubisoft is improving your parkour toolbox in a later May update that will add height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a completely new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This last one will let both characters jump straight up to grab low overhangs without needing a wall. Ubisoft also promises that “more little parkour tricks and improvements” will be added throughout 2025.</p><p>Another part of <em> Shadows’ </em>roadmap is a series of community-focused updates adding content and options based directly on player feedback, including the ability to toggle different in-game filters on and off as well as certain visual effects and character headgear during cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft also says it has more surprises to reveal in the future and that this roadmap isn’t everything it has planned, but just the highlights that they wanted to let fans know about.  </p><p>Lastly, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will receive its first paid expansion—<em>Claws Of Awaji</em>—later this year, seemingly sometime after June. It will add a new region to the world as well as a new weapon for Naoi: A bow staff.</p><p>That’s a lot of content and updates! It sounds like come this time next year—assuming Ubisoft sticks to this schedule—<em>Asssassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will be a much bigger and better game, which is impressive considering how excellent the game was at launch last month.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While this is an all-around improvement over the original Joy-Cons, which could get quite noisy while rumbling, it may cause an issue with one particular minigame in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everybody-1-2-switch/" data-ref-id="5000-590008">Everybody 1-2-Switch</a>. Because of the reduced volume, "it may be more difficult to find hidden Joy-Con 2 in the minigame Joy-Con Hide &amp; Seek," Nintendo says.</p><p>The size of the Joy-Con 2 controllers will also render them unusable with a handful of other games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-fit-adventure/" data-ref-id="5000-502189">Ring Fit Adventure</a> and the various <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-labo-toycon-01-variety-kit/" data-ref-id="5000-477332">Nintendo Labo kits</a>. Beyond that, however, the vast majority of Switch games will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatible with the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5. The system itself retails for $450, while the Mario Kart World bundle (which will only be in production through Fall 2025) costs $500. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Preorders for both are currently sold out</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">Switch 2 accessories</a> and games are still in stock at retailers.</p><p>Ahead of Switch 2's launch, Nintendo recently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-system-update-now-live-adds-virtual-game-cards-switch-2-compatibility-and-more/1100-6531216/" data-ref-id="1100-6531216">big system update</a> for the original Switch.

You can preorder Mario Kart World in a couple ways. The first is as an $80 physical edition that's available at Walmart, Target, GameStop, and Best Buy.</p><p>The other option is to track down the $500 Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital download code Mario Kart World. This bundle saves you $30 compared to purchasing the physical game for $80 along with the console for $450, which would total $530. If you're planning to get both at launch, the bundle is the best option, but you'll want to act fast. The bundle has been going in and out of stock online, while it will also be available for a few months after launch, it will be discontinued in Fall 2025, so keep an eye on Walmart, Target, GameStop, and Best Buy for any restock updates.

The Switch 2 Edition includes the core game with enhancements like higher frame rates, improved resolution, and integration with the upcoming Zelda Notes app that lets you scope out the in-game map, make notes, and offers free log-in bonuses that unlock in-game items. The only thing missing from Breath of the Wild Switch 2 Edition is the DLC Expansion Pass, but this will be available separately for $20 via the eShop. Physical preorders are now available at Walmart, Target, GameStop, and Best Buy.</p><p>See our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-nintendo-switch-2-tears-of-the-kingdom-breath-of-the-wild-amiibo-preorder/1100-6530751/" data-ref-id="1100-6530751">Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom Switch 2 Editions</a> preorder guide for more.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                                                                                                                                                               <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$70 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">Created by CDProjekt Red, the studio behind the acclaimed The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 is a sprawling sci-fi RPG set in the techo-metropolis Night City.

            <p>
EA has announced the end of its partnership with the World Rally Championship, saying it's "pausing development" on all future rally games.
</p>
<p>
EA's inherited the World Rally Championship license as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters in 2021</a>, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. But that, EA has now confirmed, is as far as the partnership will go.
</p>
<p>
"Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announced that we've reached the end of the road working on WRC", the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917634912493998081">message signed by The Codemasters WRC Team</a> and shared on social media.

<p>
Despite the end of the partnership, EA Sports WRC will continue to be available; however, its previously released 2024 season will be its last expansion. Additionally, EA has announced that "for now", it's "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
"Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DIRT," it continued. "We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast... We've brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport's icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey."
</p>
<p>
EA's decision to end its WRC partnership follows its announcement last year - made as it laid off 670 employees - that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">moving away from "future licensed IP"</a> toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".
</p>
<p>
Today's WRC news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">follows yet more layoffs at EA</a>, reportedly affecting "between 300 and 400" employees. It's unclear if the Codemasters team has been impacted as a result of EA's decision to 'pause' rally development, but we've reached out for clarity on the situation.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Blue Prince is one of the greatest games of the moment, and the roguelike puzzler has encouraged a lot of discussion about the best possible way to make sense of its confounding nature. Considering the ever-changing halls of its setting, I understand how one could come to their own conclusion on how to best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-prince-guides-hub/1100-6530716/">resolve its countless mysteries</a>. I happen to have my own method, and it's been working wonders for me. You see, I've been treating Blue Prince less and less like a roguelike, where you are expected to cycle through runs ad nauseam, and more like the daily crosswords that often fill my days. Though the two might seem quite distant, I'd argue there are more than enough similarities to warrant the parallels, and so far, the approach seems to be a real winner.</p><p dir="ltr">Let me first set the stage, though. Blue Prince, which tasks players with exploring the constantly shifting rooms of a manor in search of a hidden 46th one, has quickly become the game du jour since it was released earlier this year and for good reason: It's an utterly enthralling experience with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2024s-best-games-let-me-figure-it-out/1100-6528592/">layers upon layers of mysteries</a> to unspool. And since it has ensnared just about everyone I've seen pick it up--in both positive and negative ways--I have been drowning in well-reasoned criticisms of its mechanics as well as rapturous acclaim over its novelty. I've similarly bumped up against some frustrating walls that I found particularly hard to break through, but the thing that has really changed how I play Blue Prince, and simultaneously increased my enjoyment of it, was this much-needed shift in perspective that has been incredibly illuminating.</p><p dir="ltr">I promise you, Blue Prince has not in fact rotted my brain. I do have a case here, even if it may sound like gibberish externalized outside of my head for the first time. First and foremost, I've found that some of the folks who have bristled against Blue Prince (a perfectly fine reaction, <a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/blue-prince/no-you-dont-have-to-play-blue-prince-or-any-other-game" rel="nofollow ">not everything is for everyone</a>!) have seemed to try and brute force their way through the game. Alternatively, I've been taking it at what can only be described as a near-glacial pace. I get on the game and do a handful of runs--maybe two or three at a time--that prioritize room discovery and pushing forward on a single thread until there's some turn or new discovery that further cracks the game's facade. Sometimes it's as simple as a new note to turn over in the quietest moments of my day, and sometimes it's making a perspective-shifting find that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/platanoranger.bsky.social/post/3lmxw4kqgc22m" rel="nofollow ">melts my brain</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, this methodology lets me jot down notes and be more deliberate about where I focus my dwindling brain power (I'm so tired, guys) and avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer scope of Blue Prince and ultimately being turned off by it. I know people whose playthroughs are trending towards a hundred hours if they aren't already north of that, and the community is jointly trying to solve some of its meta puzzles not unlike last year's mystery-laden platformer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-well-review-going-deeper/1900-6418225/">Animal Well</a>. Consider this approach my attempt at protecting my own peace and secondarily prolonging my satisfaction with Blue Prince so that I don't sour on it before it gets too good.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4485423-blueprince.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4485423" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4485423-blueprince.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4485423"></a><figcaption>Blue Prince's magnifying glass</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4485423-blueprince.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However there's more to this comparison than just my peace of mind, and I'd seriously note the similarities between the two if you're still doubtful. Both Blue Prince and a crossword take place on a grid. The former may present itself as a first-person puzzle game, but this feels like the first of Blue Prince's many tricks it revels in playing on the player. Open up the in-game map and you are treated not to a revelatory illustration or document, but an empty grid, not unlike a crossword. Not to give too much away, but it's also probably best thought of as that when pursuing some of Blue Prince's later and more enigmatic threads.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, despite the rigidity of the grid, the exact contents of the puzzles are constantly shifting. At the start of each run in Blue Prince, the manor effectively resets, and it's on the player to draft the next room from a randomly picked "hand" of cards. Every day, the crossword sometimes has different dimensions (especially when drawing a distinction between the weekday and weekends), features new blanks, and the shape of these blanks and white spaces could form an intriguing shape meant to clue players into a unifying theme. Both leverage visual motifs and more explicitly laid breadcrumbs to trick the player into accidentally solving a larger puzzle by picking away at smaller ones nested within the former.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, clues in an especially devious crossword will often be in concert with one another. Like inside jokes, you don't entirely get one without the others, but cracking even one seems to suddenly give you the language or cipher to piece together another. Blue Prince functions in a pretty similar way, leading the player by the hand to disparate elements, like rooms with mechanics that don't initially present as things that interact with one another or tools that might not logically function the way you think they would. Though it may initially confound, Blue Prince asks you to put these components together to unlock the next step in the grander scheme of things. "How do I ensure I get x tool to find y clue in z room reliably when the placement of each of these elements is randomly generated?"</p><p dir="ltr">I don't know, maybe by taking the exact thing I'm describing--the combination of tools and mechanics in sometimes esoteric ways--and considering the bigger picture to manipulate the game in your favor. There are coat checks everywhere for those with eyes to see. And when you hit that serendipitous "aha" moment where the puzzles, both big and small, click into place, the satisfaction of that sequence tugs the player ever deeper into the tide, whether that be into another of Blue Prince's layers or just another sophistically crafted crossword.</p><p>My appreciation of the daily crossword, a thing that I do damn near all the time thanks to brilliant games like <a href="https://www.puzzmo.com/today" rel="nofollow ">Puzzmo</a>, almost appears to have trained me for a title like Blue Prince, which seems delighted to play with and remix some of its tenets into something both new and vaguely familiar. Thewholething is a puzzle. Its construction, its contents, and the logic behind their placements. They're so uncannily similar I'd be surprised if the game didn't take some kind of inspiration from the renowned and timeless classic. And maybe along the way, Blue Prince picked up a thing or two that'll turn it into a classic in its own right in due time. For now though, I'm really relishing taking it a thread and a handful of days at a time, and am feeling all the better for it.</p>

                <p>Blizzard continues to bake features and capabilities into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> previously relegated to third-party add-ons, but it's going a step further with the newly announced Rotation Assist option coming in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/" data-ref-id="2900-5436">MMORPG's</a> next patch.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced by WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas in a new episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hqJ210XWeU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoWCast</a>, the new optional UI feature is coming as part of WoW's 11.1.7 update. It will make it so the game's UI will display which ability a player should use next to deal optimal damage, mimicking the functionality of the popular add-on Hekili Priority Helper. According to WoW add-on manager Curse Forge, Hekili has been downloaded more than 56 million times.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hqJ210XWeU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-hqJ210XWeU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">However, WoW's Rotation Assist tool will actually go even further beyond add-ons like Hekili by having an option to simplify WoW's gameplay into a single button, one that will serve as an "auto rotation" that will automatically use the next optimal ability.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be some penalty to using the single-button rotation option in the form of a small global cooldown penalty. The longer wait to cycle between abilities means those using it will perform worse than a skilled player doing the same rotation without assistance, but it's still a huge change for Blizzard's 20-year-old MMO. Hazzikostas said the option of the single-button rotation is being added for accessibility purposes, as well as for those who don't care about playing the game at a high-level or learning their class.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to make sure this is for accessibility purposes," Hazzikostas said. "That it's there for people who maybe, honestly, aren't interested in the gameplay of mastering their spec. They want to explore Azeroth and experience the story, and mechanics get in the way of that sometimes. This should be for them. Ideally, this is not a tool where someone is being told by their raid leader to stop trying to DPS manually and just turn on the one button mode to meet some DPS check. That we want to give you the tools to go through that organic progression naturally."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement of the Rotation Assist feature comes as part of larger discussion between Hazzikostas, WoW content creator Dratnos, and Team Liquid guild leader Max about Blizzard's philosophy when it comes to add-ons, expanding the base capabilities of WoW's UI, and how the game is designed around some of the information only add-ons can currently provide.</p><p dir="ltr">Hazzikostas said while he doesn't have any specific dates, the team is also looking at building a DPS meter (the most popular WoW add-on by a large margin, he said) into the base UI, as well as improvements to nameplates and more raid encounter information, like a timeline of upcoming boss abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are looking at all the places where players are saying, 'You need this WeakAura, you need this add-on to be competitive', and asking ourselves, 'How do we change our game to make that not the case?'"</p><p dir="ltr">It's a path Blizzard has already been on for several years, starting with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-players-have-a-few-notes-on-the-games-ui-overhaul/1100-6508658/" data-ref-id="1100-6508658">customizable UI overhaul in WoW's Dragonflight expansion</a> and most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-april-22-update-will-finally-offer-an-easy-alternative-to-a-critical-ui-add-on/1100-6530701/" data-ref-id="1100-6530701">recently with the introduction of the Cooldown Manager</a> to the game's base UI, a replacement for the popular add-on WeakAuras.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the video, Hazzikostas made clear none of Blizzard's decisions were set in stone going forward on the subject of add-ons and that it's listening to the community for its feedback However, he also laid out Blizzard's current philosophy on how it's approaching add-ons going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our sense is that for many players, the feeling that they have to download and use certain add-ons in order to play the game competitively, isn't really part of what's attractive about the game or healthy in the long run," Hazzikostas said. "So if we can pull things back to a place where add-ons are available for those who want to use them, but people aren't feeling pressured by their groups, by just the natural demands of competition and not wanting to lose out to someone who is using more advantages, that's going to be the healthier route in the long run."</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's 11.1.7 patch does not have a release date but will be available for testing on the game's public test realm later this week. Meanwhile, if you want to see what happens when a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-happens-when-you-install-3703-wow-classic-add-ons-at-once/1100-6528652/" data-ref-id="1100-6528652">WoW Classic player installs every available add-on at once</a>, well, you've been warned.</p>

These make complex inputs that require you to move your hand between multiple face buttons while using the right analogue stick easier. At this point these should simply be standardized across the industry, with a minimum or two and upwards of six. I have written extensively about performing <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-modded-my-ps5-controller-and-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aftermarket mods for my PS5 controllers</a>, but if we’re being honest with ourselves, nobody should have to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>The third requirement is build quality and performance. I’ve had many controllers simply turn to garbage over the years, even when the sticks are good on paper. Squeaky triggers, sticky buttons, the list goes on. I despise spending good money just to generate e-waste, and I have seen many an Xbox Elite and Scuf controller eat it, making them unsalvageable unless you know how to solder. An easy way around this is to make the entire controller modular, like the stick modules on the Dualsense Edge, although both the Edge and its modules are wildly overpriced, and the sticks inside those modules are old technology.</p><p>Lastly, I need a controller where the sticks are symmetrical. This is slightly harder to find, as the default layout for high-performance controllers skews towards the traditional Xbox layout, but there are controllers that almost fit the bill, like the 8BitDo Pro 2 (which only has two rear buttons). But I want something better than that. I want an Xbox Elite controller for half the price with better sticks, modular parts, lightning fast performance and a layout I prefer.&nbsp;</p><h2>Taobao importing</h2><figure><figcaption>That sure does look a lot like an Elite controller. I also hear the Scuff paddles fit right in there.</figcaption></figure><p>The ZD-O+ Excellence is all of the above things and more. I first heard about it via a mutual friend who had heard rave reviews of it via the Discord for <a href="http://gamepadla.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamepadla</a>, a site devoted to testing the input latency of gamepads and a fantastic resource for <a href="https://gamepadla.com/soft.pdl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open source tools for that purpose.</a></p><p>When I first saw reports about the ZD-O+ Excellence, the controller was only available in the States via Aliexpress. That was fine, but I wanted to get several of the modules that mod it to be symmetrical, similar to the PS5. The modules were slightly expensive, so I decided to purchase from Taobao via a proxy buying site, which hires a shipping agent to ship it to you. This turned out to be way more trouble than it was worth. The tariff situation meant that the controller got snagged in customs and spent several weeks lingering there. When it finally did arrive, it was sealed by big neon green tape informing me that US Customs had inspected it. Had I waited about a week, US-facing distributor GadgetHyper would have had it for sale domestically for a reasonable price (they seem like they <a href="http://gadgethyper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still have it in stock</a> for what I paid for it, as of writing this blog), but I was nervous and the escalating economic situation forced my hand. This concern was warranted, as the cost of the controller has shot up from roughly $90 to $180 on Aliexpress since then.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the controller comes in plain black and white, I decided to go with a clear transparent blue model that is aggressively more gamery, as well as several other modules, accessories and face buttons. All of this together was still less than the MSRP of Xbox Elite Series 2.</p><h2>How it feels</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Reviewing the ZD O+ Excellent!!! A Modular PC Controller with ALL the Features!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WXoCWG-eHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Old Man Rob’s initial review, which is fantastic at showing the basic functionality of the device, although it had some pushback on Reddit and the comments.&nbsp;</em></p><p>The second I held the ZD-O+ Excellence I knew I was in love. It had that premium heft and shape that I associated with the Elite series. Even as stock, the controller feels excellent: the real paddles are where they should be, magnetically held in place. The triggers and shoulder buttons feel responsive, and the controller comes with built-in toggles very similar to the Xbox Elite to switch the triggers to clicky short throws, which I enjoy far more than I expected. There’s also an additional layer of shoulder buttons to the side of the shoulders and triggers that fall organically where the index fingers are. I have not gotten too obsessed with programming these, but this gives you far more options than most people will ever need.</p><p>The modularity of the controller is a joy. I’ve had to painfully convert a Dualsense before, and the experience was not for the faint of heart. But on the ZD-O+ the front shell just pops off, revealing a few easy-to-remove hex screws. Converting the controller from Xbox (asymmetrical) stick layout to PlayStation was as simple as swapping in a new module and a face plate. On top of this, they also sell different accessories like various stick lengths as well as different modular faceplates for the d-pad. I generally prefer a symmetrical layout with a polygonal Xbox Elite style D-pad, but the accessories give you a lot of options, including a cursed “3 stick” layout.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Installing TMR Modules on the ZD O+ Excellent!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xgn9Id5quBw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Old Man Rob’s follow-up review, upon installing the TMR modules</em>, <em>which solved many of his issues.</em></p><h2>Modularity</h2><figure><figcaption>Modules are held together by a few screws. This makes the modules easy to replace, and easier to fix without tearing the controller apart.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only does the company offer multiple stick types (traditional ALPS, Hall Effect, TMR), they also offer multiple types of competing TMR sticks. This is only something that hardcore controller nerds have to contend with, but I went with “Jinful” because I had heard good things (a friend went with K-Silver and apparently got a lemon). The modules are, as of this writing, 10 dollars and not too difficult to take apart. Every test I have seen seems to indicate that the TMR modules outperform the stock Hall Effects by a country mile. It also appears to be possible to swap marginally better TMR sticks into the PCB and shell of the modules, provided you are good at soldering and desoldering. Knowing that you can do this without tearing apart and potentially ruining an $80-$100 dollar controller is deeply valuable. On top of this, user <a href="https://oshwhub.com/meki/zhi-dong-o-mu-kuai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meki has already created an open source PCB</a> specifically to be compatible with standard stick pinouts, like the kind used in Xbox, Playstation and Switch controllers. I’m so happy that this controller not only has easy solutions for stick drift, but potentially for improvements in stick technology down the line.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="噂通りの最強コントローラー？徹底的に検証した結果【ZD O Plus、ZD O+ Excellence、ゲームパッド】" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AguZG2JW67I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>If you would like to watch a Japanese YouTuber show off this controller for an hour, here you go.</em></p><p>Different button options are also on the table. The default tactile buttons in the controller I got feel quite good, far better than most controllers. Both the D-Pad as well as the default face buttons use surface mount variants of mouse switches, the kind usually used on the side clicks of the mouse (specifically HCNHK blues, having disassembled the module). There is also an optional module that has optical mouse switches, which many people contend are superior and longer lasting. Based on how they look, they appear to be these ones made by a company called <a href="https://www.globalsources.com/Micro-miniature-switch/microswitch-1197920464p.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raesha</a>, which I have heard mixed things about from true mouse perverts, but are still better than many controller buttons on the market.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ZD-O plus Excellenceの色んな右スティックを検証、一番良いスティックはこれだ【コントローラー、ゲームパッドレビュー】" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6geh12jnc8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Above: Here’s the same YouTuber just talking about just the stick modules.</em></p><p>If all of this is above your head, just know that these are generally serious parts that will last a while and be inexpensive to replace or repair if they ever fail. Given that the reason I stop using many controllers is “the buttons just feel super shitty now,” that catapults the ZD-O+ Excellence to the top of my list. In addition to this, the back paddles appear to be compatible with ones offered by brands like Scuff, which I plan on investigating because I have bigger hands and the stock paddles are just a hair too small for me personally. My controller also features RGB lighting, which I immediately turned off, and gyroscopic controls, which I don’t need but could imagine being useful if I ever got super into <em>Splatoon </em>again.</p><figure><figcaption>I wanted to go symmetrical so I went big on the accessories, although I wish they just sold a model that was symmetrical with TMR sticks stock.</figcaption></figure><p>It is absolutely crucial to properly calibrate your controller, and on the ZD-O+ that is even more important due to the modularity of its design. Different stick modules will perform differently. Calibration is done internally by pressing the triangle button in the middle, up and “A” at the same time, spinning the sticks three times, then hitting the triggers three times and pressing the middle triangle button again. <a href="https://hardwaretester.com/gamepad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardwaretester</a> is very useful for this as it will give you a sense of the circularity of your controller. By default the right stick seems to have more of a square deadzone, which I understand many players prefer particularly when it comes to FPSes. But if you want a more traditional circular deadzone you are going to need to make some deadzone adjustments in the app.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Some hiccoughs</strong></h2><p>The ZD-O+ 's companion app is not the worst I’ve ever used, but when I first bought the controller it was exclusively in Chinese. By default this is still the case, although this week they updated it with additional languages. I have an iPhone, and so had to search “<a href="https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/%E8%87%B4%E5%8A%A8%E6%B8%B8%E6%88%8F%E5%9C%B0%E5%B8%A6/id6738748371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">搜索 致动游戏地带</a>” on the iOS store, although apparently it’s not available in every country unless you use a VPN. There’s also a version on <a href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/1TfFssXB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testflight </a>as far as I know, and you can download an Android version <a href="https://www.zd2015.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on their website</a>. There is no desktop or web app for this controller, just iOS and Android, which is by far my biggest pet peeve, although once you connect it to your phone the process is pretty seamless. Though the trigger buttons can be programmed without the app, the app allows you to program extensive inputs on the fly, which is clutch for PC gaming. I pray for a world where every button in your house can be programmed to do basically anything if you’re committed and perverted enough.&nbsp;</p><p>The largest failing of the ZD-O+ appears to be its wireless connectivity. It seems to poll at a maximum of about 250-260Hz according to community testing as well as my own and has middling jitter even with the included dongle. If you are like me and basically only use your controller wired, then that’s functionally a non-issue, but I hope that either updated firmware or an improved dongle can fix whatever is causing this, because this is otherwise as close to a perfect controller that I have ever seen. I have never been less mad at an input device, which is impressive given that since the manual is in Chinese I have to look up a YouTuber’s video every time I need to change something.</p><h2><strong>On China and the future</strong></h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Death of Affordable Computing | Tariffs Impact &amp; Investigation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1W_mSOS1Qts?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>On some level, many of my hurdles with this controller stem from the fact that it feels like it wasn’t aimed at me. I only learned about it because I’m in a Discord devoted to testing controllers and someone raved about it. Many Americans like to humor ourselves and think that China tailors its products closely to US tastes, and while this has been true in the past more and more of the best deals out there in hardware are made with the Chinese domestic market in mind. In the peripheral space this is clearly true if you look at the explosion in good, affordable Hall Effect keyboards. More broadly, just look at Chinese EVs, which are so far ahead of American domestic offerings that they’re functionally impossible for most people here to own. We are not the center of the world, and rarely are we the center of innovation as much of our money and productive capacity has shifted towards the task of creating endless AI garbage.</p><p>As I write this, the United States is on a path to economic self immolation. If nothing changes and Trump doesn’t buckle or get overthrown in some treat-based version of January 6th, it’s going to be catastrophic for everyone. Everything is getting expensive for no coherent reason and container ships have more or less halted entirely. Watching this car crash in slow motion has made the prospect of writing about hardware difficult. How do you cover the tech space in the face of “<a href="https://youtu.be/1W_mSOS1Qts?si=ypnWnXm7CyABNlKH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Death of Affordable Computing</a>,” as Gamer’s Nexus called their three-hour long documentary? How can you assess the value of an object if you don’t know what it’ll cost or if it will be available tomorrow? Does the task itself become frivolous given how many industries are poised to collapse? Or does it become more relevant to talk about as it becomes clear that we have radically overestimated the degree to which China actually needs us?&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we all survive geopolitically, it does not change the fact that American hardware companies are thoroughly washed. I could never conceive of Logitech or Razer putting out a product so innovative or reasonable for anywhere close to this price and without some gargantuan caveat. No Western company would ever think to make a product so thoroughly repairable, modular, and anti-obsolescence. The ZD-O+ Excellence is a tinkerer’s dream, S-tier in repairability, close to the quality of an Elite for half the price and compatible with already existing parts on the market. It’s Taobao excellence, a potential Forever Controller, the dream of a thousand Reddit posters and Discord lurkers. Though it has real flaws that need to be addressed and other controllers may beat it in individual metrics, it is so close to being perfect that it hurts to think about. I am so happy I purchased it when it was reasonable to do so. And if you’re already in China or a country they export to that’s sane, like Canada, that almost perfect controller can still be yours for a song.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-wont-stop-ai-generated-thumbnails-on-fortnite-says-gen-ai-will-become-more-and-more-difficult-to-detect/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games project management director Dan Walsh confirms that Epic won't be making the effort to stop Fortnite creators from using AI-generated thumbnails, due in part because Walsh believes that generated AI content will "<em>become more and more difficult to detect</em>."</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZYR0gEsfg">Mustard Plays</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-wont-police-ai-generated-thumbnail-images-and-epic-games-says-detecting-them-will-likely-become-impossible">Eurogamer</a>), Walsh and executive vice president Sax Persson were both insistent that Epic itself wouldn't be using generative AI in its own creations such as Fortnite skins, but that when it comes to user's content, Epics' concerns are more geared towards whether the content is "<em>compliant with [its] rules</em>," rather than being concerned with how the users made that content.</p>
<p>"<em>From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails - like, we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails,</em>" Walsh said. "<em>All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect</em>," Walsh continued. "<em>It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point where it's probably going to become unenforceable. We're really just focused on - 'does this asset comply with our rules, yes or no?', not 'what tool did you use to make this asset'?</em>"</p>
<p>Generative AI is becoming more prevalent across the industry, with every major company and creator trying to figure out where it fits, if it does, in their process. <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-boss-doesnt-think-gen-ai-will-replace-game-creators/">Larian Studio boss Swen Vincke</a> recently commented that, in his view, generative AI might be able to make the "<em>baseline</em>" of what people can make go up, but it won't replace artists, and that if you tried to use generative AI for everything, you won't have a competitive advantage.</p>

But the more disappointing news for fans is that Codemasters is done making rally games altogether. </p><p>As announced in the Wednesday update, Codemasters is “pausing” all current development on future dirt racing rally games, effectively killing the <em>Dirt/Colin McRae </em>rally franchise after two decades and 10+ entries. The last entry in the <em>Dirt </em>franchise,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dirt-5-year-one-edition?_gl=1*170ur3a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dirt-5-year-one-edition?_gl=1*170ur3a*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Dirt 5</em>, launched in 2020</a></span>.  <em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to EA for more information. </p><p>“For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles,” explained Codemasters. “Our [World Rally Championship] partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally?_gl=1*1yt714s*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/colin-mcrae-rally?_gl=1*1yt714s*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NjAyMjg5NS41OC4xLjE3NDYwMzc2NTQuNjAuMC4w"><em>Colin McRae Rally</em></a></span>, and <em>Dirt</em>. We’ve provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.”</p><p>The studio promised fans that EA Sports <em>WRC </em>will continue to be “available” to new and existing players, so thankfully it doesn’t sound like the team’s last rally game will be delisted and shut down anytime soon. Still, it’s a shame to see the studio stepping away from rally racing after nearly 30 years of excellent games in a genre that is often ignored by other studios and publishers.</p><p>Codemasters will continue to develop other racing games, like EA’s yearly <em>F1 </em>series and possibly (hopefully) future entries in the track racer franchise <em>Grid</em>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">Individual Reliquaries vary in price but cost less than the game's old 90-tier battle pass, though they can all be bought together for the same $10 price as previous battle passes. Rewards can also be chosen in any order by spending tokens, rather than having to grind through potentially dozens of levels for a player to reach a particular reward that interests them. As in previous seasons, there are still free seasonal rewards for those who don't want to pay but still participate in the season, this time in the form of this season's Belial's Return Reliquary.</p><p dir="ltr">While being able to specifically purchase particular types of cosmetics and unlock specific rewards first is nice, the number of rewards on offer in total is far less than Diablo 4's old battle passes, something that has not gone unnoticed by players.</p><p dir="ltr">However, it's the removal of 500 Platinum (the game's premium currency used to purchase the battle pass and in-game shop cosmetics) from the battle pass that is causing the most outrage. In previous seasons, Diablo 4's premium battle pass awarded 700 Platinum. That was still 300 short of being able to purchase next season's battle pass, as in many other live-service games, and a controversy in and of itself. Diablo 4 Season 8's battle pass now only offers 200 Platinum in total.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the most popular posts on the Diablo 4 subreddit currently is one comparing the old battle pass to the new one from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1kav4ce/reliquaries_are_a_massive_downgrade_born_from/?rdt=47498" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITheDarkitect</a>, who breaks down the differences between free and premium rewards offered under previous seasons and in Season 8. They note how the new premium Reliquary doesn't offer any emotes, headstones, titles, or emblems like previous battle passes, as well as the loss of additional Platinum for those who buy the premium version.</p><p dir="ltr">"The massive downgrade, especially the 500 Platinum cut, and the supposed 'freedom of choice' that pretends to make it better, don't surprise me at all," ITheDarkitect writes. "I'll spend my money somewhere else."</p><p dir="ltr">What changes Blizzard may make in the future is unclear, but it doesn't seem Blizzard is likely to make dramatic changes to Reliquaries in Season 8. The new system will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Diablo 4's upcoming crossover with Berserk starting on May 6</a> and last until the end of the season.</p>

		<p>Frontier has now previewed what’s next for their latest theme park management game, Planet Coaster 2, with a new roadmap for May and June.</p>
<p>Arriving on 29th May is Update 5, which will include fan requested features like security guards and expanded colour customisations. The Sci-Fi theme will also return, while there’s two de-themed coasters that will allow for greater customisation alongside the returning Vector – Return Mk 2, and the maps from Act 3 of the career will be available in Sandbox mode.</p>



<p>Looking further ahead to June, Update 6 will bring Souvenir Shops and On-Ride Photos that will be sold at those shops (at no doubt extortionate prices!). There will be more stock coasters and the returning Coriolis ride, and then more ongoing stability and performance enhancements. Another returning theme is also teased, with Frontier saying that “It’s a real fairy tale come true.”</p>
<p>Planet Coaster 2 launched at the tail end of 2024, Frontier looking to find new ways to expand on their popular theme park game with a fresh release, instead of bolting on features with DLC and patches. In particular, they added new water park areas with water slides, wide plaza areas and more, though fans initially complained that it felt like a step back in terms of the number of themes and certain features, and some bugginess. Frontier has steadily worked to add more to the game since then, resolving key complaints and generally making improvements, and it seems that it’s kicking into gear with the next few updates.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/19/planet-coaster-2-review/">our Planet Coaster 2 review</a>, Dom said, “Frontier’s park-building sequel is a vibe, it is a mood, and it is sunshine wrapped in a very bright bow. Minor control frustrations aside, it’s the best theme park builder out there, with impressively deep customisation, beautifully detailed visuals and the ability to make hours of your life melt away.”</p>

			<p>Earlier today, some users <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found references to multiplayer modes in Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, reigniting a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">circulated even before the game's launch</a>.</p>
<p>However, this afternoon, Ubisoft Quebec shared the full year-one roadmap, and there's no mention at all of any multiplayer modes. They may be keeping it a secret until a later announcement, but I wouldn't count on it. On the other hand, here's what is definitely coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows in the next twelve months:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first update will land in a week from today, on May 6. It will add a new story quest titled 'The Works of Luis Frois', a Codex update, and some quality of life improvements.</li>
<li>In late May, Ubisoft Quebec plans to release another sizable update featuring a special collaboration with another franchise. Moreover, the patch will introduce new parkour interactions requested by the community, including height-gaining back flips, fully re-animated height-gaining side flips, and a brand-new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This move allows both playable characters to jump and grab onto canopies and lower overhangs—a move that's particularly handy when wall running isn't an option.</li>
<li>In June, another story drop is coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows. That includes a new story quest and a new ally for the League. Moreover, the developers will add the Alarm System to the open world, new difficulty settings, and several immersion options like toggles for weapon glints during combat, black-and-white-and-red ability filters, target assassination celebration effects, and stealth outlines. Lastly, players will be able to toggle their headgear during dialogues and cutscenes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Throughout the rest of 2025, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be updated with the New Game Plus mode, new story drops, more quality-of-life enhancements, more special collaborations, more Codex updates, Animus content and rewards, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that will introduce a new region with over 10 hours of content. As a reminder, Claws of Awaji is free for anyone who pre-ordered the game, while pricing for everyone else still needs to be communicated.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has done very well for Ubisoft</a>, largely keeping the publisher afloat during its restructuring, which culminated in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new subsidiary</a> whose sole purpose is to control the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six IPs.</p>

Carless speculates that could stop companies from trying to game the charts by running steep discounts to gin up downloads, an incentive structure that led to lots of shovelware crowding out better quality games on the best sellers list. But he adds that it will also make it harder for cheaper games, including lots of smaller indie titles, to compete for high-ranking slots against pricier blockbusters. </p><p>So what does this change look like in practice? Just about every game in the best seller list, with the exception of <em>Minecraft</em>, is different than it was a couple days ago, according to <em>GVG</em>’s comparison. The chart heavily favors games that aren’t on sale and Nintendo games in particular, with seven of the top 12 being first-party releases. The deals list has similarly been skewed away from just the games that are the most discounted, now heavily featuring those that are both heavily discounted and selling well. I had to scroll for a bit before stumbling on an obvious shovelware cash grab like <em>I Am Busy Digging A Hole</em>, an asset-flip sim aimed at capitalizing on the success of the similarly titled <em>A Game About Digging A Hole</em> which is only on Steam at the moment.</p><p>Unfortunately, on the best seller list at least, you have to toggle over to the “download only” list before you start to see lots of smaller indie games, though even those are dominated by existing winners. The <em>Gloomhaven</em>-inspired party RPG <em>Sunderfolk</em> was the only recently released game in the top 10 when I looked today. As <em>GVG </em>mentions in its video, the eShop change has gone a long way to pushing “slop” off of the discoverability pages, but it’s also done the same to many indie releases. Also the storefront is still incredibly sluggish and loads like molasses. The Switch 2 version can’t come soon enough.</p><p>What else could Nintendo do to improve store browsing in the meantime? Some developers have suggested a new browser tab purely for curated picks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pushtotalk.gg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Push to Talk</em></a></span>’s Ryan Rigney recommended a new and trending section that takes into account the eShop’s own wishlisting system and other users’ activity on the store, similar to how Valve seemingly does it on Steam. Any new options would be better than none at all, though it’s interesting to see Nintendo tinkering more with the eShop now than it has in almost the entirety of the Switch’s existence (people also have strong feelings about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/rip-orange-eshop-nintendo-fans-bid-farewell-to-iconic-switch-color&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rip-orange-eshop-nintendo-fans-bid-farewell-to-iconic-switch-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the move from orange to red</a></span>). </p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Nintendo’s developers said earlier this month. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.” They’ve promised better speed, overall performance, and a new “Game Finds” feature for more easily scrolling through images and videos on the Switch 2's eShop, though it doesn’t sound like any of those improvements will be trickling back down to the older hardware. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a brief but enlightening video with a specific schedule for May and June as the team behind the latest stealth-action entry plots out how it will keep fans coming back with free updates throughout the year.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-1746033627143.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Assassin's Creed Shadows post-launch roadmap. Image courtesy of Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The drops begin soon with The Works of Luis Frois, the first of a few free story add-ons, which is set to drop in early May. It’ll be accompanied by a Codex update and a few quality-of-life improvements, with relatively substantial parkour additions and a photo mode update also set to arrive next month. These adjustments and more are part of what Ubisoft says is a continued effort to listen to its community and take their feedback into consideration for future Assassin’s Creed Shadows updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback has been a core focus of the team throughout development, and that’s not stopping now that Shadows is released,” community developer Daniel St. Germain explained in today’s video. “Regular title updates are coming, each with impactful additions – and changes – based on your feedback and requests, with some bug fixes to continue refining the experience across all platforms.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next free Assassin’s Creed Shadows story drop will follow in June, as will more challenging difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, an open-world alarm system, and an option to keep headgear on or off during cutscenes. These are worthwhile changes that players are already looking to see included, but more features, such as new game+ support, additional story drops, special collaborations, and more, are expected to arrive before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest item on the post-launch roadmap is the first proper Assassin’s Creed Shadows DLC expansion, Claws of Awaji, which drops at an unspecified point later in the year. It’s said to include new content, such as the Bo staff weapon and a new region for Naoe and Yasuke to explore, across its 10-hour journey. Pricing details have yet to be revealed, though it will at least be free for those who pre-ordered Assassin’s Creed Shadows before its launch last month.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed Shadows arrived for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S on March 20 and finally takes Ubisoft’s long-running stealth series to Feudal Japan.

The highly anticipated follow-up to the hit 3DS game, Living the Dream is a quirky life sim in which players create Miis and watch the humorous interactions they have as they live out their daily lives as part of an island community.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo will undoubtedly have a lot more to share about the game as we get closer to its release, but in the meantime, here's everything we know about Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream so far.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Tomodachi_Life__Living_The_Dream_be_released_">When will Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has yet to pin down a firm release date for Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, but the company has confirmed the game will launch sometime in 2026.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_platforms_is_Tomodachi_Life__Living_The_Dream_on_">What platforms is Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream on?</h2><p dir="ltr">At the moment, Nintendo has only confirmed that Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream will be released for the original Switch. The company has not yet said anything about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering that several other upcoming Switch 1 titles (such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>) will be cross-gen, it's possible this could also apply to Tomodachi Life.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a> presentation.</p><p dir="ltr">The video begins with a slow pan over a peaceful shoreline, where we see one beachgoing Mii casually toot while asleep on a beach chair. The trailer then showcases a handful of different Miis going about their daily lives on the island, from an elderly man breakdancing in front of a crowd to a pair of characters angrily throwing items at each other during a heated argument.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Tomodachi_Life_gameplay_details">Tomodachi Life gameplay details</h2><p dir="ltr">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream marks the third installment in Nintendo's quirky life-sim series, and while many details about the game are still up in the air, it appears the series' hallmark gameplay and humor are intact.</p><p dir="ltr">In past installments, players would create (or import) Mii characters and have them live together on an island community, watching as the Miis went about their day-to-day lives. They could work part-time jobs, take strolls along the beach, and visit each other’s apartments, which often resulted in humorous interactions.</p><p dir="ltr">In contrast to Tomodachi Life for 3DS, where each Mii occupied a different apartment in one shared building, it appears the Miis in Living the Dream will live in their own small houses. A clothing store and supermarket can also be spotted in the background of the announcement trailer, hinting that players will still be able to purchase outfits and meals for the Miis. However, it remains to be seen if the Miis can still get married and have children.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the sequel to Obsidian's comedic sci-fi RPG, is set to release later this year. Obsidian's second major release of 2025 following Avowed, The Outer Worlds 2 has been pitched as a bigger and better version of the original, expanding the scope of the game while adding in more ways to approach situations. Obsidian RPGs are well known for giving you a variety of ways to solve a problem, and The Outer Worlds 2 seems to be continuing that tradition.</p><p dir="ltr">While The Outer Worlds 2 still hasn't been fully revealed by Microsoft, with just a release window for later this year, it has been confirmed that the second half of Xbox's June showcase will be a deep dive on The Outer Worlds 2, likely giving a release date and more information about the RPG.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Outer_Worlds_2_be_released_">When will The Outer Worlds 2 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_announcement_trailer">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_platforms">The Outer Worlds 2 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_story__setting__and_characters">The Outer Worlds 2 story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_gameplay">The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#The_Outer_Worlds_2_development_news">The Outer Worlds 2 development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_The_Outer_Worlds_2_be_released_">When will The Outer Worlds 2 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 currently has a release window of 2025. Microsoft is likely announcing a more exact date at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/">Xbox June showcase</a>, where The Outer Worlds 2 will be the main focus of a Direct following the showcase. While we don't know when the release will fall, we do at least know it won't be prior to that June showcase.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_announcement_trailer">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rvTE-3S4c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 announcement trailer was released in 2019, featuring only a CG cutscene. At The Game Awards in 2024, a second trailer was released, showing off the gameplay of The Outer Worlds 2, along with the 2025 release window. The trailer itself shows a decent amount of gameplay, from normal shooting to invisible sneaking and high-octane explosions, but it doesn't focus on the narrative of The Outer Worlds too much. Instead, it focuses on the fact that Obsidian has made a number of highly regarded sequels in the past, like Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 and Fallout: New Vegas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_platforms">The Outer Worlds 2 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 is releasing on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. As an Xbox Game Studios title, it will be available on Game Pass for both console and PC at launch, alongside the option to purchase it at full price. At the time of writing, The Outer Worlds 2 has not been confirmed to be releasing on the Nintendo Switch 2, although Xbox has expressed interest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-doesnt-make-microsoft-nervous-about-its-own-next-gen-plans-phil-spencer-says/1100-6530893/">supporting the Switch 2</a> and the first game did come to the Nintendo Switch.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_story__setting__and_characters">The Outer Worlds 2 story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">While most story details have yet to be revealed, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/" rel="nofollow ">Steam page</a> for The Outer Worlds 2 does have the basic premise. You play as the Earth Directorate agent, tasked with uncovering the source of devastating rifts in Arcadia. The Arcadia colonies are currently in a war as the Protectorate's rule is challenged by rebels. Oddly enough, the outsider with government authority trying to solve a massive problem is very similar to the pitch for Avowed, although the way the narrative shakes out over the course of the game will likely be different.</p><p dir="ltr">While more details haven't been shared just yet, the Steam page also confirms the return of companions and emphasizes player choice when it comes to how you tackle quests, both in the main story and side quests.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_gameplay">The Outer Worlds 2 gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484992" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484992"></a><figcaption>The Outer Worlds 2 will feature a variety of sci-fi weaponry.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4484992-theouterworlds22.jpg"></figure><p>The Outer Worlds 2 appears to have feature gameplay similar to the original, but refined. As shown in a gameplay video (via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhDvnM3wBaQ">IGN</a>), it's a first-person RPG, where--depending on how you like to play--you will be shooting, sneaking, and stabbing your way through enemies in combat encounters. If you have played the original, Avowed, or Fallout 4, you have a pretty good idea of how combat can flow. You will also be looting--both enemies and chests--gathering materials, valuables, and new gear.</p><p dir="ltr">That's just combat of course, as you will also spend a decent amount of time talking to NPCs. How these conversations go depends on your build, letting you play anyone from a charismatic smooth-talker to an intimidating brute. You can also use food and drugs to give stat boosts, letting you appear to be charming, even if you aren't. There will also be plenty of main missions, side quests, and companion missions, if it's similar to the first game.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Outer_Worlds_2_development_news">The Outer Worlds 2 development news</h2><p>Development news has been fairly light for The Outer Worlds 2 since its reveal in 2019. After that, there was a trailer at The Game Awards 2024, and a few gameplay videos have been released in the time since. However, The Outer Worlds 2 is getting a deep dive at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8, with a Direct focus entirely on the game after the main showcase. Xbox has done a couple of these single-game presentations after the main show in recent years, typically spending 20-30 minutes deep-diving into the game and interviewing developers. That is likely the next time news about the game will be revealed, including a release date.</p>
