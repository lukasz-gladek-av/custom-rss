            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dome-keeper-just-got-a-massive-update-that-ups-replayability-and-helps-generate-better-worlds<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Katharine (RPS in peace) thought <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dome-keeper">Dome Keeper's</a> blend of tower defence and mining was both "meditative" and "perfectly formed" in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dome-keeper-review">review</a>. So it comes as great news, then, that the devs have somehow taken that perfect dome, expanded it and polished it to an even greater sheen. We're talking about new guild assignments, new gadgets, better world generation, a new world, new monsters. The list is enormous and designed expressly around improved replayability - take that, Las Vegas Dome.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Entitled "A Keeper's Duty", the aim of the update is to provide "more run variety and bigger replayability". Take new Guild Assignments, which are essentially special challenge runs. You'll pick an assignment with special conditions and goals, like landing on a planet that has "only monsters shooting projectiles", and you've got to figure out how to deal with the twist. Complete assignments and you'll earn badges, which you can then spend on permanent rewards: being offered three instead of two gadgets, being able to reroll gadget offers, and more.</p>

<p>There's a new "Droneyard" primary gadget that helps eliminate the bore of carrying resources from the mines to your dome, as drones will do it for you instead. The yard also generates two form of drone: combat and parasitic, with the former firing missiles and the other latching onto enemies and making them more vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>As for those new monsters, there's one called the breeder that continuously spawns new ticks. If you shoot it, it'll harden for a bit and make life more difficult. Otherwise, there's a new glass cannon called the tormentor that fires a massive laser but transforms into a squishy bastard when charging up. Timing is critical then, as you need to blast it when in this vulnerable state, lest you get cooked.</p>
<p>Thanks to a big engine update (moving from godot 3 to 4), the game now has better map generation. Before there were lots of blob-shaped maps, now there will be maps of many more shapes and sizes, with new interesting structures.</p>
<p>There's an absolute tonne of extra changes I could cover here, but won't because it'll turn into a day-long endeavour. You can view them all over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1637320/Dome_Keeper/">Steam</a> if you're keen to soak it all in.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>But gaming revenue still sharply up year-on-year thanks to Activision Blizzard.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft's continued decline in Xbox console sales continued through the last financial quarter, the company has confirmed.
</p>
<p>
In what is now a familiar pattern - and one not limited to Microsoft - revenue from gaming hardware fell again, this time by 42 percent. That's down further on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-boosts-microsoft-earnings-but-xbox-console-sales-plummet">31 percent fall reported back in April this year</a>, for the quarter before.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's gaming revenue overall was up overall by 44 percent, thanks to a significant boost from the addition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft bought for $68.7bn</a> before its latest round of layoffs. Without Activision, growth would have sat around three percent.

<p>
All of the big three consoles are seeing sales drop. Xbox Series X/S will pass its fourth anniversary this November, and it's expected <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft will launch refreshed models of its console range around the same time</a>.  Sony's rival PlayStation 5 is of a similar age, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">reports suggest a souped up PS5 Pro model is also on the horizon</a>. Nintendo, meanwhile,  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">will unveil Switch 2 before next April</a>.
</p>
<p>
But Microsoft suggested it knows it must do more than simply launch new consoles to continue growing its gaming sector. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said the company's strategy so far had been to build up content pipelines for players on Xbox consoles. Next, it wanted to ensure this content was being delivered wherever people play games, such as on PC, smartphone and cloud - such as the recent addition of Xbox to Amazon Fire TV.
</p>
<p>
"The real goal here is to take a broad set of content to more users in more places, and build something that looks more like, to us, a software annuity and subscription business with enhanced transactions and the ownership of IP which is quite valuable long-term," Microsoft exec Amy Hood said. "We're encouraged by the progress and how we're making progress with Game Pass."
</p>
<p>
On a rosier note, Nadella painted the results as a picture of overall growth, and pointed to a strong pipeline of game launches over the next year including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in October. 
</p>
<p>
Nadella also noted the impact of Amazon's Fallout TV series on Bethesda's back catalogue of Fallout RPGs, available to play on Xbox Game Pass. "Hours played on Game Pass for the Fallout franchise increased nearly five times quarter-over-quarter," Nadella revealed - lining up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">the boost noted by Fallout boss Todd Howard</a> back in May.

Image credit: Nexon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>There are various changes to the way the game works, too. For example, Nexon has blocked equipping and removing modules, changing presets, and changing loadouts to prevent module swapping from becoming a strategy in Intercept Battles and Infiltration Operations.</p><p>Alongside the release of the 1.0.5 patch, The First Descendant director Minseok Joo outlined the development team’s plans for issues that are much-discussed within the game’s community. Minseok Joo confirmed plans to introduce a “guaranteed drop” system where players will be guaranteed to get the item they want after repeating an activity a certain number of times, in response to complaints about “the vagaries of drop rate.”</p><p>“The First Descendant has various missions and Amorphous Materials with chance-dependent rewards,” Minseok Joo said. “We're considering how we can effectively implement the ‘guaranteed drop’ in such diverse reward systems, and we're working to create a farming structure that players will be happy with. We hope to make improvements before long to provide a more rational and satisfying farming experience.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/image202407311736186-1722416031260.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Luna. Image credit: Nexon.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Elsewhere, Nexon is planning a system to dismantle leftover items to get byproducts, and a rotating shop system where you can exchange the byproducts for something of value. “This will allow the items you obtained to have a greater value in the game,” Minseok Joo said.</p><p>Minseok Joo also discussed balancing, admitting “we can't promise that all Descendants and weapons will be equally balanced at all times.” However, Nexon intends to keep changing the “effective” builds. “To that end, we promise to make constant adjustments and offer different ways to play with new content.”</p><p>These improvements will be made to the game during Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>Nexon’s free-to-play co-op focused looter shooter has enjoyed enormous popularity <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-is-a-massive-hit-despite-its-various-controversies"><u>with over 10 million players in just 10 days</u></a>. But it has been heavily criticized for its ultra aggressive monetization, which includes the cost of Ultimate versions of its playable characters. IGN has reported on one player <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-community-reacts-in-disbelief-as-one-player-grinds-for-200-hours-to-unlock-every-ultimate-descendant"><u>who spent an eye-watering 200 hours to unlock every Ultimate Descendant currently available in the game without paying money</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/image202407311736187-1722416132706.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Hard Difficulty Void Intercept Battle, Gluttony.

<strong>Content Improvements</strong><br>(1) UI/UX<br>- To prevent module swapping from becoming a strategy in Intercept Battles and Infiltration Operations, equipping and removing modules, changing presets, and changing loadouts are now prohibited.<br>- Added a feature to collect all Lost and Found items at once in the Mailbox.<br>- After checking the map with acquired information in the Library, closing the map now leaves the Library open.<br>- Added Camera Shake ON/OFF feature in Game Options.<br>- (PS, Xbox) Added the ability to select preset search keywords to make it easier to search modules and research.<br>- Added commas after every three digits in the game menu and HUD to make it easier to read numerical units.<br>- You can now check key stat information in the weapon, reactor, and external component inventories.<br>- You can now register equipped items as Attached Items.<br>- Saving a preset now automatically registers equipped items as Attached Items.<br>- You can now turn the red dot crosshair display on or off cities in Game Options.<br>- Added an image to some items in Graphics Options to show what they do.<br>- Increased the speed of scrolling when scrolling the map with the gamepad's R-stick.<br>- Changed the color of icons for Hard difficulty Void Intercept Battles on the World Map to make it easier to distinguish them from Normal difficulty battles.<br>- The map no longer displays the marker when a quest NPC being tracked disappears.<br>- The Modification Modules for the same Descendant are now displayed together in a row in the Library.<br>- When the first clear reward and repeat clear reward are the same, the Acquisition Info in the Library no longer shows them both.<br>- When selecting all duplicate modules in Dismantle Modules, you can now use a filter to register only the selected modules for dismantling.<br>- Simplified the module combining animation.<br>- Starting a research in the Materials tab of the Research menu now returns you to the Materials tab.<br>- Added the "Leave Party" button to the Social menu to make the function easier to find.<br>- Added a search function to the Consumables menu.<br>- Even when acquiring skins for Descendants not currently in use the red dot still appears.<br>- Added the red dot when acquiring paint.<br>- The red dot now appears in the Weapons List side tab too when acquiring a weapon skin.</p><p>(2) Descendants, Modules<br>- Increased the Poison contagion range of Freyna's Room 0 Trauma from a 4 m radius to a 7 m radius.<br>- Increased the maximum scaling range of Valby's skills from 200% to 250%.<br>- Increased the maximum scaling range of Blair's skills from 200% to 250%.<br>- Changed the blizzard generated by Viessa's "Glacial Cloud" module to be triggered instantly without delay.<br>- Changed Valby's "Albion Academy Cadet" head skin to be dyeable.<br>- Changed "Incoming Final Damage" to "Incoming Damage Modifier" in the description of the "Safe Recovery" module.</p><p>(3) Equipment<br>- Added a feature in Game Options that enables some single-shot and burst weapons to fire automatically when the fire button is pressed and held down.<br>- Increased Enduring Legacy's Critical Hit Damage from 1.7x to 2.3x.<br>- Increased Secret Garden's Critical Hit Rate from 35% to 50% and Critical Hit Damage from 1.85x to 2.25x.<br>- Increased Nazeistra's Devotion's Critical Hit Rate from 36% to 45% and Critical Hit Damage from 2x to 2.25x.<br>- Decreased the trigger rate of Bombardment of Greg's Reversed Fate, but now it also triggers when the weapon is fired at unshielded enemies.<br>- Equipment can now be dismantled at once with no quantity limit.</p><p>(4) Field<br>- Increased the amount of Void Shards that can be acquired from Special Operations by about 7 times.</p><p># Director's Comment<br>Hotfix 1.0.4 added Void Shards as rewards to Special Operations, but unfortunately, there were just too few. The original intent was to keep Void Fragments as the primary farming source for Void Shards, and get additional Void Shards from Special Operations.</p><p>But the community has told us that many of you don't like this loop, so we've increased the amount of Void Shards that can be earned in Special Operations. We're also working on some steps for future improvements.</p><p>Many players are currently farming materials without spending the Fragments at the Fusion Reactor, so we're considering removing the Fragments from the Fusion Reactor startup altogether.

The power of Bunny's "Lightning Emission" depends on the amount of Electricity she currently has.<br>- Fixed an issue where Bunny's "Maximum Power" skill's sound pitch went up infinitely and sounded like a noise.<br>- Fixed an issue where Esiemo would become uncontrollable while using the "Arche Explosion" skill.<br>- Fixed an issue where after Ultimate Viessa used "Frost Road" with the "Absolute-Zero" module or Valby used "Laundry Bomb," Ajax placing a barrier on top of it inflicted reflective damage on Ultimate Viessa or Valby.</p><p>(3) Equipment<br>- Fixed an issue where moving on a field with three or four pieces of an external component set prevented the 2-piece set effect from being applied.<br>- Fixed an issue where the damage of hitting the Ultimate Weapon King's Guard Lance after it was deployed was recorded in the statistics.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Ultimate Weapon Executor's Hip Fire Accuracy was lower than what it should be.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Ultimate Weapon Thunder Cage's unique effect would deal more than 1.33x damage when monsters were clustered. Instead, Electric Shockwave now deals 2x damage regardless of the number of enemies.</p><p># Director's Comment<br>During internal testing, we discovered a bug with Thunder Cage. Thunder Cage should always deal 1.33x damage according to its description, but it was dealing more than 1.33x damage when there were a lot of monsters. We fixed this bug, but we also boosted the 1.33x damage to 2x so that it doesn't become less efficient when hunting.</p><p>We're well aware that the value of items you own is important to you. To ensure that fixing the bug doesn't devalue your items, we've given it more power than we originally intended. If something like this happens again in the future, we won't stop at simply fixing the bug but consider how to preserve the value of your items to provide a reasonable patch.<br>- Fixed an issue where you could hear one or two extra shots when firing single shots with a repeating firearm.</p><p>(4) Modules<br>- Fixed an issue where the Firearm Critical Hit Rate increase effect was missing in the description of Valby's "Supply Moisture" module.<br>- Fixed an issue where Valby's "Tidal Wave" module would not properly stack Finishing Attack when piercing an enemy.<br>- Fixed an issue where equipping Ajax's "Body Enhancement" module would have different final result values depending on when it was saved.<br>- Fixed an issue where if the "Matrix Recomputation module" was equipped by Ajax the Shield would recover every time after a very short while and the Shield started at 50% after equipment.<br>- Fixed an issue where the "Pitmaster" passive would remain indefinitely when Blair removed the "Classic Chef" module while Flame Zone was in effect.<br>- Fixed an issue where the knockback effect would not trigger when Blair used "Deadly Cuisine" while equipped with the "Backdraft" module.<br>- Fixed an issue where the name of the "Sharp Precision Shot" module's buff was incorrectly shown as "Lethal Finish."<br>- Fixed an issue where Bunny's Evolving Skin quest requirements were not counted when Bunny equipped a Modification Module.<br>- Fixed an issue where Bunny unequipping the "Electric Condense" module left a status effect display that did not have any effect.<br>- Fixed an issue where Gley's "Predator Instinct" module skill displayed the Frenzied state icon and name twice when used.<br>- Fixed an issue where Ultimate Gley's "Demonic Modification" module sometimes did not deal damage when used.</p><p>(5) Field<br>- Fixed an issue where defeating named monsters at the same time as Void Fusion Reactor mission was being deleted allowed the player to use Reconstructing Devices without consuming Void Shards.<br>- Fixed an issue where the zone map of "Hagios: The Old Mystery" showed different paths from actual paths.<br>- Fixed an issue where the traps would remain on restart after dying in the No Resurrection Zone in Hagos: The Haven.<br>- Fixed an issue where movement markers would appear while progressing through the Void Fusion Reactor.<br>- Fixed an issue where roaming monsters would not spawn on the White-night Gulch: Hatchery battlefield.<br>- Changed the Amorphous Material Patterns and Shape Stabilizers acquired from Hard Infiltration Operations in the White-night Gulch and Hagios.</p></div><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/31/a060afc832a322a1e5f810aade460814faca153f-1722416433501.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><div><p>(6) Miscellaneous<br>- Fixed an intermittent terrain rendering bug.<br>- [XB1, XB1S] Fixed an issue where textures would intermittently display black lines when rendering terrain.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Sub Quest "Obtain Freyna's Research Materials 1" would complete after clearing "Rockfall: Vulgus Strategic Outpost" even if the "Amorphous Material Pattern: Freyna" was not obtained.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Sub Quest "Prepare to Obtain Additional Materials for Freyna Research" could not be completed with Ultimate Bunny.<br>- Fixed an issue where the camera would intermittently freeze when removing parts during Intercept Battles.<br>- Fixed an issue where the Elite Vulgus Special Effect "Chasing Orb" would not deal damage.</p><p># Director's Additional Comment<br>Greetings, this is The First Descendant Director Minseok Joo. Today, I'm going to outline the Dev Team's plans for issues that are discussed frequently by the community.</p><p>The team is currently working on Season 1 and Season 2 updates, while also responding to improvement issues discovered during the live service. Today, I'm going to talk more about how we plan to improve the current state of The First Descendant rather than about the Season 1 and 2 updates.</p><p>Drop Rate Improvement Plans<br>While all of our drop rate systems are operating fairly in The First Descendant, we do understand that some players are struggling with the vagaries of drop rate. To address this, we're planning to introduce a "guaranteed drop" system where you're guaranteed to get the item you want after repeating the activity a certain number of times.</p><p>The First Descendant has various missions and Amorphous Materials with chance-dependent rewards. We're considering how we can effectively implement the "guaranteed drop" in such diverse reward systems, and we're working to create a farming structure that players will be happy with. We hope to make improvements before long to provide a more rational and satisfying farming experience.</p><p>Disposing of Leftover Items<br>Next is an update on items that are piling up in your Consumables. There is currently no way to dispose blueprints for Descendants and weapons that you've already completed, so there are cases where players are getting multiple copies of blueprints they already own during the farming process.</p><p>We've been listening to the community, who have told us that there needs to be a way to dispose of these unwanted items. While we could consider simply converting them into some Gold or Kuiper, we want to reward you with more value for the time you have put into the game.</p><p>To resolve this, the Dev Team is planning a system to dismantle leftover items to get byproducts, and a rotating shop system where you can exchange the byproducts for something of value. This will allow the items you obtained to have a greater value in the game.</p><p>Supporting Build Diversity<br>It's a lot of fun for us to see the variety of builds being posted in the community lately. We love seeing you try so many different builds and are amazed by the unexpected ways you've evolved them.</p><p>We hope for more builds to exist in The First Descendant, and we want an environment where players are free to experiment with different builds. However, we've found that it is difficult to take advantage of loadouts after assigning socket types, which goes against our goal of experimenting with different builds freely.</p><p>As a result, the Dev Team is planning to provide an environment where completely different builds can be created by assigning each loadout with different socket types. We hope this will help you experiment with different builds without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p>Balancing<br>Finally, some news about balancing. We are seeing a dominance of the skill damage-focused builds of some Descendants. Descendants and weapons that are well-suited for these builds are quite popular now.</p><p>We want the meta builds to change from season to season. We want the Descendants and weapons that are effective in new content to be different from those in previous seasons. Also, we're looking to increase the proportion of firearm-based combat in the endgame.</p><p>We can't promise that all Descendants and weapons will be equally balanced at all times, but our goal is to keep changing the effective builds. To that end, we promise to make constant adjustments and offer different ways to play with new content.</p><p>We aim to implement the improvements I talked about today during Seasons 1 and 2.</p><p>Your feedback means a lot to the Dev Team. We'll do our best to provide a better experience as we build the game together, and we'll continue to listen to you as we strive to make The First Descendant even better.</p></div><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
EA CEO Andrew Wilson has discussed the impact of the SAG-AFTRA actors strike, stating the company doesn't anticipate "any significant short-term impact".
</p>
<p>
Wilson's comments were during a Q&amp;A after its latest earnings call, where an investor questioned the impact of the strike.
</p>
<p>
The CEO replied the company is "working diligently to negotiate at the table" but doesn't expect "near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development" or current live-service games.

<p>
His full quote is as follows (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-video-game-actor-strikes-wont-have-short-term-impact-on-the-company">IGN</a>):
</p>
<p>
"We deeply value our talented actors who are an important part of the work we do to deliver the incredible entertainment experiences that our players enjoy around the world. We're working very closely; this is not an EA-specific situation, this is an industry-specific situation, and we're working diligently to negotiate at the table. The way it works now in terms of our product specifically is that the strike is limited to games commencing production after September 2023, including live service games. So we don't expect any near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we're currently running. That being said, we're committed to continuing to bargain in good faith and are hopeful that the parties can expediently resolve our issues at the bargaining table. But we're not anticipating any significant short-term impact at EA."
</p>
<p>
Members of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union SAG-AFTRA voted last week to go on strike</a> due to concerns over the use of AI in video games as part of the Interactive Media Agreement.

</p>
<p>
The union has been in negotiations for over a year and a half with a number of major game companies, including EA, but has so far failed to reach a deal.
</p>
<p>
"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."
</p>
<p>
A collective statement from video game producers responded: "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations. We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sag-aftra-suggests-gta-6-and-other-games-not-technically-hit-by-strike-could-still-be-impacted">terms of the strike from SAG-AFTRA states</a> all "members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work". As such, "while [non-struck games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>] may not be subject to a strike in the technical sense, their production is also subject to being disrupted by members who don't want to work without the protection of AI terms and who don't want to undermine solidarity with the union," said SAG-AFTRA's chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez.

</p>
<p>
However, it seems Wilson is confident EA's games won't be disrupted in this way.
</p>
<p>
The UK equivalent to SAG-AFTRA, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">Equity, has stated it stands "in solidarity" with the US union</a>, but won't authorise its own strike.

            <p>In case you skipped the headline, I’ll repeat myself. Among the wonderful sights contained in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a>-poking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-great-fluctus">The Great Fluctus</a> are: beans, slug milk, alien volleyball, egg arguments, and massive frog. Additional screenshots suggest this frog later acquires wings. Like a captive Generation Game host, I am helpless but to shout out more incredible sights as they flutter past on the conveyor belt of pure flippin' videogame before me. It’s got dance parties with horrible gorilla aliens. It’s got building, namely the Statue Of Liberty out of goop, just as George Washington’s goop clone intended. It’s also got just sitting on a bench, enjoying some lovely serene space scenery.  Feast your famished face on the trailer.</p>

<p>“A very relaxing game to zone out for an hour, all while exploring cozy alien worlds, trading with mutants, rebuilding society and saving the world,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3085280/The_Great_Fluctus/">Steam page</a>. “You're on a mission to explore strange new worlds, trade with quirky mutants, and rebuild society.” Said society has fallen to the evils of too much phone, apparently, which I’d say was a bit trite and unimaginative if the trailer hadn’t already convinced me that imagination was in no short supply here.</p>
<p>As you explore, you’ll “form bonds with quirky characters and guide entire civilizations, influencing their future through your choices and quests.” There’s a part in the trailer where you lead a small band of gribblies towards what is maybe a battle? Less interesting to me is the entire story laid out on Steam, which is decidedly a case of “please, say less," but your mileage may vary. Still, I’m a very large sucker for very large frogs, so this one’s a wishlist for me. No release date as of yet, but it looks as if The Great Fluctus is the work of just one developer. Let them cook their space beans, say I.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Once upon a time, my favourite place to write was on trains. Specifically, laidback intercity services with nobody else in the quiet car and certainly, none of those screeching smaller bipeds, or "children" as they are scientifically known. That idyll is now lost to me thanks to Covid: I have vulnerable family members and continue to be careful about social distancing. As such I spend most train journeys these days spend lurking between carriages, trolling the door sensors and scowling furiously at anybody who visits the loo. But now, thanks to the obscene magic of video games, I can get my fill of authorial locomotivation once again.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The video game in question is On Track (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836290/On_Track/">Steam link</a>), which isn't a game at all but a productivity booster that consists of a blissful carriage view of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/proteus">Proteus</a>-esque hillsides, lakes and forests. I'm not convinced by "productivity-boosting software" - I think the whole thing is a massive con, frankly. But I'll happily choo choo choose this one.</p>
<p>The productivity element of On Track consists of a to-do list, perched below the window, and a timer. There's optional lo-fi music (no thanks) and Sir Or Madam's Choice of ambient audio - you can make the train louder and even turn up the hubbub from other, unseen passengers. The geography evolves a little as you complete tasks. Expect "surprises", though probably nothing that'll jolt you out of your seat, such as a nudist in a passing locomotive, or finding yourself unexpectedly in the world of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>.</p>
<p>You can slow down or stop the train at any time to investigate these surprises - ideal for simulating the classic LNER experience of having your journey delayed by 45 minutes, because a solitary potato crisp fell out the rear window of the next train along. Many great novels have been written during such lulls, though so far not by me.</p>
<p>On Track launches today, and will be free to play. Phoenix, Arizona-based developers GigaTank3000 are also the creators of the relatively unchill <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1975380/Kaiju_Catastrophe/">Kaiju Catastrophe</a>, in which you run around procedurally generated SimCities as Godzilla. There's a demo for that - perhaps it'll help you reach inbox zero, if you take Godzilla for a rampage in carefully controlled, endorphin-boosting five minute bursts?

		<p>Grinding Gear Games has posted a small update about the Path of Exile PS5 native client, that the studio confirmed it was developing a few weeks ago. The short version is that the native client is being treated as a new title by Sony, so it has to go through the certification process once again before being approved.</p>

<p>In its statement, Grinding Gear Games said,<em> “During our GGG Live broadcast a couple of weeks ago, we mentioned working on a native Path of Exile client for PlayStation 5. In this news post we’d like to give you a small update regarding this and when to expect the client to go live. The PlayStation 5 native client is treated as a new title submission on PlayStation 5. It gets all new PlayStation 5 services integrations like party and trophies. This means that we needed to rework some of those systems compared to the PlayStation 4 client and certify them.</em></p>
<p><em>At this moment, the game client itself is finished, but we still need to make some adjustments to satisfy the certification requirements. However, these are minor and should not take long.This also means that the PlayStation 5 client gets a new set of trophies (which are identical to PlayStation 4 trophies) and those will be unlocked automatically when you login to the game.We expect to finish certification within the next few weeks. Thanks for your patience!”</em></p>

            <p>Few acts in games feel quite as gleefully gratifying as removing a knight’s shiny dome with a halberd swing in medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> melee <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chivalry-2">Chivalry 2</a>. In a pastime that’s had several decades to perfect the art of hitting men with sharp objects, that’s quite the accomplishment. Since releasing in 2022, Torn Banner have lavished the player base with free horses, angry peasants, and most recently, the Regicide update - hosting a climatic tete-a-tete between two angry crownmen. With work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-room-in-hell-2">No More Room In Hell 2</a> well underway though, Torn Banner have decided to call it on Chiv 2, which they now consider “feature complete.”</p>

<p>A live service game gracefully bowing out, in this economy? My liege! “With Chivalry 2, we set out to make the ultimate medieval battlefield game: an unparalleled multiplayer experience that realized our dream of being a warrior on the fields of battle, inspired by classic medieval movie scenes and old tales of glory from history,” wrote Torn Banner in a <a href="https://chivalry2.com/2024/07/30/chivalry-2-the-path-ahead-for-chivalry/">blog post</a> yesterday. “With this final content update delivered to players, we’re excited to focus our efforts and resources on compelling new multiplayer projects, both in the Chivalry universe as well as within terrifying new co-op territory.”</p>
<p>That terrifying new co-op territory is No More Room In Hell 2, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/8-player-co-op-zombie-smasher-no-more-room-in-hell-2-releases-in-early-access-this-october">we last saw</a> at SGF earlier this year. It’s currently slated for release this October, but this won’t mean the end for Chivalry. “We’ve been building our team in number and skillset to take on these following challenges, with a focused effort to ensure that when the next Chivalry title is released, it will utterly blow players away.” Neither has support for Chivalry 2 completely ended, as there'll still be hotfixes and the like.</p>
<p>It’s certainly been a busy few years for Chivalry 2. There’s a <a href="https://trello.com/b/7HnXYjSb/chivalry-2-roadmap-preview">Trello board</a> where you can view the entire history of the game’s roadmap, which totals 11 major content drops, ending with the story conclusion of the Regicide update. Rick Lane <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/from-peasants-to-kings-the-making-of-chivalry-2">had a chat</a> with Torn Banner around the time of the game’s release, and it seems like the team have basically checked off every wishlist item they had for Chivalry’s 2’s future. Whether they did indeed succeed in making the “best horses ever,” though, I’ll let you decide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to chief development officer Veronique Lallier, the answer is rooted in the company's decision to ditch shareholders and go independent back in 2017.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer earlier this month, Lallier said it was "heartbreaking" to see how many studios and developers have been impacted by closures and layoffs, and explained IOI has "aways been very conscious and very careful" about how it grows to avoid similar situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Lallier, expanding requires finding the right talent for the right projects, ensuring you can unleash the passion of your employees so they can fulfill their potential. "You need to focus on the game, and the type of game you're making—while making sure you aren't spreading yourself across too many project," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After working hard to improve and develop Hitman as a franchise, for instance, it made sense for IOI to expand with Project 007. Securing the rights to develop a James Bond title might seem like a no-brainer, but Lallier explains those big decisions have to make sense. She says leaping from Hitman to Project 007 felt natural because they're both essentially "secret agent" titles—which is a genre baked into the DNA of the studio.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Independence for IOI means developing projects without compromise">Independence for IOI means developing projects without compromise</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multi-project studios like IOI require a lot of talent, and Lallier says that once you've welcomed people into the fold, it's vital you leverage them in the right way. "Making games is very hard. I'm not going to lie. So, I think the recipe of success is to be focused on your passion," she explains. On a practical level, that means allowing the teams within IOI to iterate rapidly and without fear. Playing every day. Testing every day. Sharing ideas with colleagues across disciplines and locations. Challenging each other to "find the fun." It's a highly collaborative approach that works because IOI put the foundations in place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, although IOI has studios in multiple locations, Lallier says they're all in timezones that overlap. "You can based in Copenhagen, Malmo, Barcelona, Brighton, or Istanbul and working across the same project," she says. "That's how we are divided, but if you look at the geography, we make sure we're all in the same ballpark of timezones. So we don't have people on the West Coast of America and we don't have people in Japan."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She adds that managing your finances as an independent studio is also "critical," and says "lean" spending during the earliest phases of development can help provide a runway for success. Lallier feels those decisions, which might sound mundane on paper, have ultimately given IOI the edge. Notably, she suggests the company was only able to put that plan in place because it's not beholden to the whims of shareholders or a parent company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think studios can suffer when they're on the stock market and so on—when there are big changes happening. All of a sudden you can lose millions and billions, but we don't have this problem," she says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have different challenges as an independent studio, because you might not have the power of a big publisher, but I think the advantage is that the constraints we have are the constraints we can control to some extent. Then we can forecast—we can see how much money we have. How much time we have based on that burn rate. Then we can find ways to still create the thing that makes sense without compromising so much because you have less external influences that you need to handle."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/game-pass-august-2024-lineup-just-got-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following earlier rumors, leaker extas1s has now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCN_it98zkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a partial Game Pass lineup for the month of August. Most of the games were previously leaked, but now we have dates. Deck13's Action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-reportedly-coming-to-game-pass-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Atlas Fallen</a>, for instance, will land on Microsoft's subscription service on August 13, exactly one week after the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reign of Sand update</a>, which is aiming to vastly improve the game in various areas thanks to brand new voice acting, new areas, new enemies, new Essence Stones, a New Game Plus mode, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>Activision Blizzard's Crash N.Sane Trilogy was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-activision-blizzard-games-are-reportedly-launching-on-game-pass-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to join Game Pass. According to extas1s, the remastered collection of the beloved platform franchise will be released on the subscription service on Thursday, August 8.</p>
<p>Just five days later, Game Pass subscribers will get Mafia Definitive Edition, the remake of the classic open world game that marked the beginning of the franchise. 2K has since <a href="https://x.com/2K/status/1818376797773500774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-definitive-edition-rumored-to-be-headed-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous rumor</a>, so this addition is actually official now.</p>
<p>These are the biggest new games coming in the month of the August, but there's more on the way. The wave begins on August 6 with SOPA - Tale of the Stolen Potato, an indie adventure game set in South America. The following day, Game Pass users will get to play Creatures of Ava, a so-called creature saver game where players traverse an alien planet, solving environmental challenges and rescuing the native creatures from an infection called 'withering'.</p>
<p>On August 15, the leaked schedule says the subscription service will be updated with Wargroove 2, Chucklefish's acclaimed turn-based tactics sequel released in October 2023. Last but not least, Pugstorm's Core Keeper will be added on Tuesday, August 27. Core Keeper is a 'mining sandbox adventure' game released in March 2022 via early access. It is set in a procedurally generated underground world, borrowing mechanics from the likes of Stardew Valley, Terraria, and Minecraft.</p>
<p>This appears to be the full August Game Pass slate, although extas1s previously said Spyro Reignited Trilogy and Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 are also coming soon to the subscription service. Moreover, Grand Theft Auto V might <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-reportedly-coming-soon-to-pc-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join</a> PC Game Pass in the near future. Of course, the biggest recent addition was the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III.</p>
<p>Does this lineup convince you to subscribe, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent price increase</a>?</p>

		<p>SEGA has dropped a music video for Sonic X Shadow Generations, giving us a remix of Kingdom Valley Act 1. The music has been remixed by Audissi Studios. Kingdom Valley first appeared in Sonic The Hedgehog 06, but has not been seen since, though has been referenced in Sonic Generations. You can check out the Sonic X Shadow Generations Kingdom Valley Act 1 remix below.</p>

<p>Sonic X Shadow Generations is promising two very distinct experiences, you’ll be able to play as Shadow the Hedgehog in a new story campaign that features brand new powers for the Ultimate Life Form. Then there’s a remaster of 2011’s Sonic Generations which saw modern and classic Sonic teaming up for a mixture of 2D and 3D stages.</p>
<p>The game will be released on October 25th, though those who pre-order the Digital Deluxe edition will get three days early access to play it from October 22nd. The digital deluxe edition of Sonic X Shadow Generations will include another level for Shadow, which will be released in the winter, as well as skill points and the digital soundtrack and artbook. Sonic X Shadow Generations will be available on &nbsp;PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and PC.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-gaming-ecosystem-has-500-million-monthly-active-users.940956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-gaming-ecosystem-500-mau/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent financial update, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella, went on file explaining that the company’s gaming arm has ‘over 500 million monthly active users’ (MAU) across all platforms and devices under that umbrella. He also mentioned that the gaming ‘content pipeline’ has “never been stronger”.</p>



<p>This news comes as Microsoft revealed a decline year-on-year of more than 40% in hardware sales, but an uptick in software sales.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-staggering-numbers">Staggering Numbers</h2>



<p>In the financial update <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q4/press-release-webcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by Microsoft</a>, it was detailed that the firm had seen a growth in revenue in Q4 FY24, and that ‘Xbox Content and Services’ revenue was a huge driver for this, with the sector increasing a whopping 61%.</p>



<p>While speaking about the update, Satya Nadella pointed out that Fallout was the second most-watched series on Amazon Prime <strong>ever</strong>, and that the success of the television series increased “hours played on Game Pass” for the franchise fivefold quarter-over-quarter.</p>



<p>Microsoft’s CFO, Amy Hood, explained that hardware revenue ‘will decline again’, but that loss is being offset by positive results pulled in by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which continues to pay off for Microsoft. </p>



<p>In the Q&amp;A section of the financial call, only one query was aimed at gaming, which Nadella fielded, making key comments about the diversification of Microsoft’s portfolio:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Activision portfolio, it comes with great assets for us to cover both the PC and the console, and then, of course, assets to cover mobile sockets, which we never had. We feel that now, we have both the content and the ability to access all the traditional high scale platforms where people play games, which is the console, PC and mobile. But we’re also excited about the new sockets. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are strong expectations for Microsoft’s performance in the coming months.</p>

<p>In the latest wave of claims to hit the content creator space, it was alleged that Kai Cenat’s ‘cameraman’ known as ChrisV had been knowingly messaging a minor in 2021. Per the claims, Chris was inappropriately messaging this individual despite having been told she was only 17 years old.</p>



<p>In an emotional stream segment, Kai recently confirmed that the claims are true to the best of his knowledge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-one">Another One</h2>



<p>In recent weeks, we’ve seen Dr Disrespect taken down by similar allegations, and MrBeast’s Ava Kris Tyson was cut from his company after several claims surfaced of nefarious acts and behaviour occurring over several years. </p>



<p>Now, Kai Cenat’s team has been hit, with the prolific streamer’s cameraman being targeted by allegations that the creator has confirmed are true. It was reported that ChrisV has been working with Kai Cenat for several years. During a recent stream, Kai Cenat said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This s*** is so f***ing dumb. My cameraman, Chris… In 2021, he got caught talking to a minor who was 17 years old. She lied about her age. She said she was 19, she ended up saying her age, said she was 17. Right at that moment, you’re supposed to stop texting. You can’t have an excuse for this.</p>



<p>I reached out to the person. She showed me every single thing. It’s confirmed. I’m sick and tired of having to do s*** like this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/kai-cenat-confirms-cameramans-underage-scandal-in-tearful-stream-no-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the quote</em>.</p>



<p>While confirming the revelation, Kai Cenat became noticeably emotional and frustrated, slamming his desk and becoming visibly distressed. He questioned why these topics are popping up every few days and announced his complete split from ChrisV, cutting all ties and pushing him as far away as possible. </p>

<p>Twitch is arguably the number-one streaming platform in the world, boasting millions of users and a reported annual revenue of $2 billion – but it’s <strong>still not profitable </strong>for Amazon. In 2014, Amazon acquired the streaming platform for around $1 billion, but more than ten years after that sweeping purchase, it has been revealed that the tech titan <strong>still </strong>isn’t making money from the streaming site.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always-losing">Always Losing</h2>



<p>This news came from a WSJ report that discussed Amazon’s failure to make money through Twitch after more than ten years of owning and supporting the platform. The cost of running the site through Amazon’s infrastructure means that the firm has failed to ever profit from the streaming platform, despite it pulling in a reported $2 billion a year.</p>



<p>In the report <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/twitch-amazon-video-games-investment-9020db87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published in WSJ</a>, it was claimed that fewer users are signing up to Twitch and the ‘biggest spenders’ are neglecting to pump the site with money. In recent months, Twitch has suffered from widespread layoffs as Amazon has attempted to pivot to adjust to new financial woes that have struck much of the wider industry, and per <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-insiders-fear-mass-layoffs-as-amazon-loses-billions-on-zombie-brand-2844252/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>, insiders are concerned that another wave is on the horizon.</p>



<p>It was also claimed by those close to Twitch that several projects have been cancelled or postponed internally because there isn’t any hunger or <strong>budget </strong>to float them. </p>



<p>With rising competition in the form of YouTube and Kick and constant complaints from the community about changes to Twitch, the top-tier streaming site could be about to pass a point of no return.</p>

<p>Well, I didn’t have this on my 2024 bingo card.</p>



<p>Today, Wild Assault enters a beta phase on Steam, with players worldwide being invited to soak up all the entertainment offered by this ‘Furry Tactical Shooter’. </p>



<p>That’s right – it’s a third-person shooter aimed at those with <em>special interests</em> in <span><strong>anthropomorphi</strong></span><strong>sed </strong>animals. On the surface, it looks and plays like Fortnite, but it’s a hero shooter, with several animals fulfilling roles that would apply to them if they were suddenly given the ability to wield powerful weapons.</p>



<p>Or something.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fox-has-breasts">The Fox Has Breasts</h2>



<p>In a new trailer, Wild Assault looked kind of like a run-of-the-mill third-person hero shooter. The animalistic characters that are aimed at ‘furries’ are a little too creepy for me, but it took a hard turn when the ‘fox’ character burst onto the screen with a full-fledged pair of breasts. </p>



<p>The entire host of playable hero characters are humanised creatures of varying types, but <strong>the fox </strong>looks to be the only sexualised character per the trailer.</p>



<p>Here you go:</p>

<p>Wild Assault, which is the debut title from Combat Cat Studio, enters a beta test phase today, which means you can go over to Steam and give it a try for yourself. It’s almost definitely going to fall flat from the moment it hits the market, but for now, we can marvel at how bizarre it is.</p>



<p>Which character are you going to pick? There’s a hulking bear that wields heavy weapons, or perhaps you’ll lean more towards the agile and lithe rabbit with SMG-based gear. How about a skunk with the power to control chemical weapons? The possibilities are (unfortunately) endless.</p>



<p>R34 artists are frothing at the bit.</p>

<p>Elden Ring was made to be one of the most challenging games ever – that much is glaringly obvious. It fits into that niche remarkably well and is arguably the most important game in the category, overpowering the likes of Dark Souls, Sekiro, and perhaps even Bloodborne. However, that fact doesn’t sit well with everyone, and one player in particular has taken that notion farther than anyone else, announcing that they’re seeking legal action against FromSoftware, Elden Ring’s developer.</p>



<p>Why are they suing the legendary game creator? Because Elden Ring is <strong>too hard</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-more-to-it">More To It</h2>



<p>It goes a little deeper than that, admittedly. At this point, it might also be satire, but the Elden Ring player seems resolute in their desire to sue FromSoftware. The posts online, which were recovered by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/elden-ring-player-to-sue-fromsoftware-over-high-game-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, talk of content being hidden behind a wall of difficulty that even the most skilled players won’t ever reach, thus making the game either half unplayable or inherently unfair.</p>



<p>It’s a bit wild, admittedly.</p>



<p>Per the posts, the user claims they’re taking FromSoftware (and Bandai Namco) to court on September 25, based on the following:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My ‘Elden Ring’ lawsuit (that) claims we have only played HALF of FROM SOFTWARE’s games and a whole new game is hidden inside, and that it’s too hard to access for even its most dedicated fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is where it starts to fall apart, with the player stressing that they’ve been turned ‘insane’ because of Hidetaka Miyazaki’s mission to have players ‘break the shackles of humanity’. They then start talking about a parallel universe theory and reference this as having been an issue with other games, like Sekiro. </p>



<p>Do you think there’s a case here, or is this going to be thrown out immediately by the courts?</p>

Hardware sales saw a significant dip of 31% year-over-year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-segment-gets-another-shot-in-the-arm-from-activision-blizzard-in-q3">last quarter as well</a>, though sales were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-gaming-earnings-report-activision-blizzard-acquisition">up slightly (3%) in Q2</a> thanks to a series of holiday discounts and promotions. But hardware was also down 7% prior to that in Q1, and yes, <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/SlidesFY23Q4.pptx?version=6e2b873e-6d6a-10c5-ac0b-62f8950909be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropping steadily</a> for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-and-sonys-recent-hardware-sales-reports-tell-very-different-stories">several quarters prior to that</a> too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/07/12/xbox-2-blogroll-1689179393588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox hardware sales are down once again.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For what it's worth, Xbox is far from the only console maker seeing dips in hardware sales. Everyone's impacted, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-drops-the-hardest-as-all-consoles-decline-by-double-digits-compared-to-2023">Circana's most recent report</a>. Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo all say "double-digit percentage declines" in May of 2024, and the Switch saw the most significant drop. This is likely reflective of the fact that all three consoles are on the back halves of their life cycles, and is reflective of fairly normal, cyclical industry trends. Xbox has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-next-gen-console-confirmed-business-update">already confirmed that a "next-gen" console is in the works</a>, and has expressed plans to share more information about hardware of some sort around the holiday season.</p><p>Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records. This is largely due to the boost offered by the acquisition of Activision Blizzard - it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up. Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, this indicates that Xbox's not-Activision-Blizzard-related business isn't doing quiiiiite as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year. Microsoft will hold its Q4 earnings call and field questions from investors and analysts shortly.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But since then, an account purporting to be Skibidi Toilet creator Alexey Gerasimov (DaFuq!?Boom) has said he wasn’t behind the claim, and Newman has told IGN that the manner has been “resolved,” so… all’s well that ends well?</p><p>It all began on Sunday, when Newman posted in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/833983068468936704/833983416390385685/1267223128371630282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>S&amp;Box Discord</u></a> server, “you know what's worse than the nintendo dmca?” He then shared the news about the Skibidi Toilet DMCA, including pasting a screenshot of the letter that he was sent. Interestingly, the copyright holder that the letter is attributed to is <a href="https://inviz.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invisible Narratives</u></a>, the film and TV production studio that’s partnering with Michael Bay <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skibidi-toilet-film-reportedly-in-the-works-from-michael-bay"><u>on a Skibidi Toilet film</u></a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/image-90-1722369935169.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The letter that Newman was sent on behalf of Skibidi Toilet creator DaFuq!?Boom. (Image credit: Garry Newman/Discord)</figcaption></figure></output><p>The letter that Newman posted specifically cites Skibidi Toilet characters like Titan Cameraman, Titan Speakerman, and Titan TV Man, saying they are "all registered copyrights that are unique and representative of our brand."

In it, players make their way "through the matrix dungeons, battling colorful Tetrimonsters and unearthing pixelated secrets." The DLC will also feature four other game modes, and players can play solo or with friends.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Minecraft - Tetris DLC Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Based on the trailer, one of the game modes appears to be standard Tetris, but it has a twist. Instead of placing blocks, players are trapped in the area and are forced to mine their way to the top before getting stuck. As for the dungeon crawling mode, it appears that players will eventually be forced to fight a new mob that's made entirely of Tetris blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">The Tetris DLC is out now and costs 1,510 Minecraft Coins (Minecraft's premium currency), which equates to $9.99. Those who purchase it will also get access to new clothes they can equip on their character.</p><p dir="ltr">If you need additional help in Minecraft, check out our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-beacon-in-minecraft/1100-6525031/"> guides on how to make a Beacon</a> and an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-an-anvil-in-minecraft/1100-6524993/"> Anvil</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-official-olympics-game-ditched-mario-sonic-in-favour-of-mobile-pc-but-its-also-pushing-nfts.940812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-official-olympics-game-ditched-mario-sonic-in-favour-of-mobile-pc-but-its-also-pushing-nfts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>For the past couple of decades, the official Olympics video games have starred Mario and Sonic and been exclusive to Nintendo devices. Not so, this year. Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is free-to-play and available for PC via the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>Hear the curl of the monkey's paw? Yeah, it's a mobile game port with the touchscreen prompts seemingly still intact, and its publisher is also pushing a "commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin collection".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"They wanted to look at other partners and NFTs and esports," Lee Cocker <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">told Eurogamer</a>, regarding the decision to move the series away from Mario and Sonic. "Basically the IOC wanted to bring [it] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money."
</p>
<p>Cocker was involved with several entries in the series while working at ISM Ltd, a firm responsible for managing the Olympic Games video game license.
</p>
<p>Olympics Go! Paris 2024 is consequently now <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/olympics-go-paris-2024-5d5f77">available from the Epic Games Store</a>. It includes 12 mini-games, including sports such as archery, 100m sprint, golf and rowing, and the ability to expand Olympic venues with shops, cafés and upgraded statdiums using unlockables earned via competing in events.
</p>
<p>The game is published by nWay, who also own the license for the official Olympics NFT Digital Pin. "You can claim a legendary or epic pin showcasing the Paris 2024 mascot holding a flag and waving. You can add these digital gems to your collection through Magic Eden's friendly NFT marketplace as part of Coinbase's Onchain Summer event. Be sure to have an ETH L2 Base-supported wallet to secure yours today," says the <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/">Olympics Go! website</a>.
</p>
<p>I have a real fondness for Mario &amp; Sonic At The Olympic Games 2020. Its story mode was dismal, but the many, many sports it featured were mostly fun, and I've played dozens of hours of it with family, up to as recently as a few weeks ago. I'd have probably thrown down £50 to buy a 2024 iteration. It's a shame that I now can't, but also that I can't celebrate an official Olympics game arriving on PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase.940809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-receives-atlus-exclusive-character-showcase/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date/">newest game developed</a> by Studio Zero and published by ATLUS. Studio Zero is a division of ATLUS that has developed games such as Catherine: Full Body and now the new exciting addition, Metaphor: ReFantazio, its first game since 2016. ATLUS is the mastermind behind franchises such as Shin Megami Tensei and Persona.</p>
<p>In a brand-new character showcase, players are introduced to some of the rivals and allies they can expect to meet in this new universe. The showcase uploaded to YouTube via Official ATLUS West is 18 minutes long and has a disclaimer that the footage shown is a mixture of in-game footage and footage developed for the sake of a trailer.</p>
<p>The video focuses on the protagonist, a character who is participating in the Royal Tournament but also finds himself at the bottom of the social ladder. The Royal Tournament is an event where all participants vie for kingly power. The protagonist is unlikely to be king simply based on his personality and social status.</p>
<p>In this video, the director Katsura Hashino of Metaphor: ReFantazio introduces some of the characters and explains ways in which the protagonist can increase his favor and popularity with the people. Hashino describes the way that social bonds with specific characters can affect the abilities and archetypes your protagonist will have, which can allow the protagonist to become stronger over time depending on what relationships you choose to build on.</p>
<p>The King is introduced very early into the game, before the protagonist attends his funeral. Once that happens, the King's face appears in the sky, and sets the challenge of winning the most favor in order to become king, in an event called "Tournament for the Throne." To try and gain favor, the candidates have to travel to each major city within the Kingdom to try and win favor from the citizens, and try to prove why they are worthy of being king.</p>
<p>To win favor, they have to compete in challenges. One of these challenges is called the "Exhibition of the Brave" where candidates have to try and bring in the biggest monster head they can. For those who fail, they will be eliminated from the competition, which can include the protagonist if they fail the challenges given to them.</p>
<p>While they haven't given specific dates, there will be more live streams on the ATLUS West YouTube channel where they do further deep dives into the game's development and what players can expect going forward. For now, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3MUxQ5QT5RQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">character showcase</a> on their YouTube channel to learn more about the beginnings of the story, and what you can expect from some of the characters in the game.</p>
