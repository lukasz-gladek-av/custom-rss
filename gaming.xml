		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced Surviving Mars Relaunched, an expanded version of 2018’s Surviving Mars. This relaunch version will include the base game, all of the original DLCs, including content packs and radio stations. Paradox has also confirmed that those with the original release will have an upgrade pathway, but the original version of Surviving Mars will be removed from sale on all platforms when Relaunched is launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="Surviving Mars Relaunched | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pTU0f4tlg5c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Surviving Mars: Relaunched is not just going to be a repackage of Surviving Mars, with this release including user interface improvements as well as new content. That new content is called Martian Assembly, something not available in the original release, where a dynamic political system will be added. In the Martian Assembly, you will pass laws to balance the needs and wants of the colonists including domestic matters to full Martian independence.</p>
<p>If you own Surviving Mars and want to upgrade to Surviving Mars Relaunched, you will get a discount. Paradox has said, <em>” An automatic discount of $20 on the standard price $39.99 (discounted price $19.99) will be applied to your purchase of the base game Surviving Mars: Relaunched if the original Surviving Mars is already in your library. The discount will only be applied if you are purchasing it on the same platform and using the same account as your original purchase. The offer cannot be applied across platforms.”</em></p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/15/surviving-mars-review/">Surviving Mars Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Surviving Mars review, Stefan wrote, <em>“If we ever try to colonise our red neighbour, it’s going to be one of the greatest challenges that mankind will ever undertake. Though Surviving Mars makes a game out of it, Haemimont have brilliantly kept that hard edge, as it constantly pushes and tests your ability to plan with survival in mind, especially with the unpredictability of the Mysteries of Mars. There’s plenty of ways to improve it and put more colony control in the hands of the player, but the first landing is already off to a great start.”</em></p>

              <p><span>Catch me redownloading </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>, as Lucy from the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703"><i><span>Cyberpunk Edgerunners </span></i></a><span>anime is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248"><span>joining the roster as a guest character</span></a><span>. Arc System Works’ anime fighter is releasing its </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>1.48 patch tomorrow</span></a><span>, August 21, and not only will it come with the usual balance changes and bug fixes, but it will also bring more </span><i><span>Cyberpunk</span></i><span> content to the game as well. However, there is one downer in the small print.</span></p> <p><span>Lucy is the only </span><i><span>Edgerunners </span></i><span>character joining the roster, but there will be references to others in the 1.48 patch, with avatars based on Lucy, David, and Rebecca from </span><i><span>Edgerunners</span></i><span> being made available. Meanwhile, in one of the crossover’s coolest touches, a selection of tracks from </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>‘s soundtrack will be available as background music for all your fights, regardless of whether or not you’ve paid to play as Lucy. This includes songs by Johnny Silverhand’s band Samurai, such as the lesser version of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq3d6XA75Y"><span>“Chippin’ In”</span></a><span> (should’ve been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ud65jWxMJg"><span>the superior take by my trashbag boyfriend Kerry Eurodyne</span></a><span>), as well as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN1RJF55NXI"><span>“Never Fade Away.”</span></a><span> The best song on the list, however, is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E"><span>“I Really Want to Stay at Your House” by Rosa Walton</span></a><span>, arguably the most iconic song from the game and anime. The song accompanies some of </span><i><span>Edgerunners’ </span></i><span>best moments, and is used to incredible effect. So if you want to have yearning pop perfection playing in the background as you climb up the ranks, you can do that…but only for a limited time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>According to the patch notes, “I Really Want to Stay at Your House” will be removed from </span><i><span>Strive </span></i><span>in 2027, and that’s as specific as the notes get. The specific end date will be “announced separately,” and “may be moved up without prior notice.” Bummer. Guess you can always play it through the Spotify app?</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Guilty Gear -Strive- Starter Guide - Lucy" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UT3Q6cAZgYI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>’s latest update, </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>check out the full patch notes</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p><em>Project Bloomwalker</em> is an all-new cozy crafting adventure game.</p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting a vision of a world where the protagonist’s footsteps bring life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal that transforms the world around them. Aboard their moving house, players and their adorable spirt companions called Oddling embark on a journey to explore uncharted territories, cleanse tainted landscapes, gather resources for crafting and decoration, and forge bonds with their Oddling friends as they prepare for new adventures.</p><p>Set in a once-beautiful land shared by humans and mysterious spirits, the game begins when a mysterious meteor crashes down that leaves an impact site so polluted that no life can survive. As the world suffers, Bloomwalkers appear who can wield power to restore life and heal the wounded earth. Taking on the role of a Bloomwalker, players will journey forth in their unique moving house to cleanse the polluted landscapes and rekindle the harmony of nature.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The difference between <em>Project Bloomwalker</em> and other <a title="Genres > Crafting [42 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting games</a> is its moving house system. Instead of being tied down due to a misplaced base, players experience true nomadic freedom with their own mobile house. They can effortlessly relocate, uncover breathtaking landscapes and transform any location into their personal sanctuary that embraces the joy of a life on the move.</p><p><strong>■ Game Overview</strong></p><p><strong>How would you describe <em>Bloomwalker</em> in one sentence?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> is a cozy interactive experience that lets players embark on a cozy crafting journey aboard a traveling house while befriending Oddlings, cleansing a tainted land and creating their perfect sanctuary.</p><p><strong>What is the core concept, and what kind of experience can players expect?</strong></p><p>We aim to evoke the joy of healing and restoration in <em>Bloomwalker</em>. This isn’t a game of combat, but of caring and reviving a world in need. Players will purify a wounded land and build a family amidst solitude, experiencing heartfelt connections and emotional resonance throughout this moving journey.</p><p><strong>What does the title <em>Bloomwalker</em> mean?</strong></p><p><em>Bloomwalker</em> translates to “one who walks while blooming flowers,” reflecting our vision of a world where your mobile house brings life back with every step. The title symbolizes the power of players to be a force of healing and renewal, transforming the world around them.</p><p><strong>You describe the game as “emotional crafting”-how does that differ from traditional <a title="Genres > Survival [445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> crafting games?</strong></p><p>While traditional crafting games often revolve around survival, <em>Bloomwalker</em> offers a different experience, emphasizing “us and the world” through emotional crafting. Instead of the constant struggle to survive, we provide the joy of creating beauty, healing nature, and building meaningful relationships. With its rich themes of environment and emotion, we hope to invite more players to experience the unique and rewarding essence of the crafting genre.</p><p><strong>■ Gameplay and Systems</strong></p><p><strong>What do players primarily do in the game?</strong></p><p>There are four core activities in <em>Bloomwalker</em>:</p><ul><li>Explore unknown lands aboard your moving house.</li><li>Purify polluted nature.</li><li>Craft and decorate using gathered resources.</li><li>Connect with the Oddlings as you prepare for your next journey.</li></ul><p>You’ll also face challenges, including mysterious threats like the “Pelicanny.”</p><p>The game will support <a title="Genres > Co-Op [316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> play, so players can explore and decorate their traveling home with friends.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to make the house move?</strong></p><p>We encourage players to explore freely, without the fear of making mistakes. Unlike many crafting games where the base location is a stressful choice, we’ve removed that burden. Your house is a nomadic companion, allowing you to pack up and move to any landscape, transforming it into your next camp and home.</p><p><strong>I wanted to control the house myself, but I couldn’t. Is it not controllable? Can I customize or upgrade it? What’s the “Magic Door”?</strong></p><p>Yes! Full movement control is a key feature of the full game. The demo’s automated path was simply for showcasing the core appeal in a short time. And yes, you can unleash your creativity and decorate your house as you wish. We use a ‘Magic Door’ system to expand the interior space without changing the exterior, allowing you to design your own limitless and unique worlds.</p><p><strong>The Oddlings are adorable. Who are they?</strong></p><p>Oddlings are fairy-like companions you meet in the polluted world and, in turn, are your chosen family. We hope their presence brings the warmth of a “big, bustling family,” sharing daily life together. You’ll wake up, cook, play, and tuck each other in at night which is the kind of heartwarming routine that brings a smile to your face, and it’s all part of the game.</p><p><strong>The black cat inside the house was memorable. Who is it?</strong></p><p>Drawing inspiration from beloved fairy tales like <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> and <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, the cat is a mysterious character who lives in the moving house and joins you on your quest to purify the world. It holds a secret… but we wouldn’t want to reveal too much! :)</p><p><strong>The missions seemed quite structured—does that mean the game has low freedom for a crafting game?</strong></p><p>The demo was designed to be a guided tour, highlighting the core features in a limited timeframe. In the full version, you’ll be able to explore freely, choosing your own objectives, solving environmental puzzles, and discovering hidden materials and secrets throughout the world.</p><p><strong>■ Art, Story, and Atmosphere</strong></p><p><strong>The art style is stunning. What inspired this direction?</strong></p><p>Our vision was to immerse players in a living, breathing world reminiscent of a stunning animated film. The art team’s primary focus was to ensure every visual element felt alive, employing gentle yet vibrant color contrasts to emphasize the powerful transition from decay to flourishing life.</p><p><strong>What’s the overall story and worldbuilding like?</strong></p><p>Humans and spirits once shared a flourishing world, until a meteor brought ruin. The impact zone became a source of corruption, spreading decay across the land. In response, individuals called the Bloomwalkers with the ability to heal the environment began to emerge. Their presence brings life back to blighted areas. Players will take on the role of a Bloomwalker, traveling the land in their Moving House of Restoration, seeking to undo the damage.</p><p><strong>■ Development History</strong></p><p><strong>What games inspired <em>Bloomwalker</em>?</strong></p><p>The crafting genre is filled with excellent games that have captivated players and sparked creativity. <em>Bloomwalker</em>, however, seeks to redefine the experience by introducing elements of heartfelt warmth, animation-inspired emotion, and a profound sense of harmony with the natural world. Instead of drawing inspiration from particular games, we chose to build upon the genre’s foundations while injecting our own unique emotional narrative.</p><p><strong>Why choose the environment as a central theme?</strong></p><p>Our philosophy is that games have the power to offer a warm and reflective perspective on life. <em>Bloomwalker</em> isn’t about delivering a complex message; instead, we aspire to evoke a subtle emotion in each player: the urge to protect the beauty that surrounds them. Our hope is that the game can encourage players to embrace a more positive outlook on the world.</p><p><strong>■ Other Details</strong></p><p><strong>When will the game be released, and on what platforms?</strong></p><p>We will share more details on the launch schedule through various channels.</p><p>It may take a while, but we believe it’s the time needed to fully realize the living, breathing world we envision.</p><p>The game made its debut at Gamescom, and we’re committed to making it a lasting, memorable experience.</p><p>Platforms? We’re preparing a broad launch. You’ll find <em>Bloomwalker</em> on <a title="Platforms > Xbox [26,484 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, including Game Pass, and various platforms across console and PC.</p><p><strong>Why did you debut at Gamescom? Are you targeting the European market?</strong></p><p>Gamescom brings together some of the most passionate gamers in the world, making it the perfect place to share our new journey. We also believe that European players—many of whom deeply value environmental themes—will resonate strongly with our message of restoration and renewal.</p><p><strong>What about language support?</strong></p><p>The demo is currently in English, but the full game will support a wide range of languages, which is in line with what’s standard for console releases.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/netmarble-announces-cozy-crafting-adventure-game-project-bloomwalker-for-xbox-series-pc-and-more]]></content:encoded>

Black Ops 6 is just the cherry on top here.</p><p>PlayStation also released a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Grab+This+PS5+Slim+Digital+Bundle+For+%24400+Before+It+Sells+Out&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-20+10%3A30%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-20+10%3A30%3A35&amp;fnarticle_id=6534138&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Agamespot%2Far%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%253A%252F%252Fdirect.playstation.com%252Fen-us%252Fbuy-consoles%252Fplaystation5-console-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-bundle-model-group-slim&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases%2F1100-6534138%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">regular PS5 Slim version of this bundle</a> for $450, but it's no longer in stock at any retailers.

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed Tropico 7 for 2026, with the game confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox Game Pass. This new entry into the long running series will introduce new elements including face to face talks with different faction leaders, and the ability to terraform the island to suit your own needs. If a river is not running in the direction you like, feel free to reroute it. You also be able to pick different dictatorship styles depending on political affiliations and the use of edicts.</p>

<p><em>“With Tropico 7, we open a new chapter in city-building, politics, and economics — giving players more control and complexity than ever, while preserving the mischief and satire fans love,”</em> says Daniel Dumont, Studio and Creative Director at Gaming Minds Studios. <em>“This isn’t just a sequel, it’s the ultimate sandbox for would-be dictators. El Presidente would say: ‘The best Tropico ever — because it’s mine!’”</em></p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/01/tropico-6-review/">Tropico 6 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tropico 6 review, Nick said, <em>“Tropico 6 feels like the kind of game that you can fall back on when every other game gets a little too stressful. The economy can be tricky to get started, but you can soon start to kick back and take it easy. If you are finding it too hard though, turn on unlimited money and enjoy your break. It’s almost like going on holiday to the Caribbean, which is fitting really.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/058bf1d484435/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>The hugely-popular MMORPG <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xiv_online_a_realm_reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> — which is about to celebrate its 12th anniversary (in its rebooted form) — is one of our most-requested Switch 2 ports, particularly from this writer. And it sounds like we're one step closer to seeing the game come to the hybrid console.</p>
<p>The game's director Naoki Yoshida — better known as Yoshi-P — has spoken to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">VGC</a> at Gamescom and confirmed that he and the team have been having "positive discussions" with Nintendo on the possibility of a port. Not only that, but he also wants to bring his other mainline Final Fantasy to the console, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>.</p>
<p>He told VGC "For me, it’s just my aim to provide Final Fantasy XIV and XVI to as many players as possible... We are putting in our best efforts to ensure that this happens, so it’s fine to convey to your readership that I consider the possibilities very positively."</p>
<p>The veteran producer acknowledges that the ability to play handheld, and on a console that's less powerful than a PS5 or PC, might make some aspects more difficult, such as high-level raids, “But when it comes to other types of content, they could sit back, relax on the sofa with the Switch 2 in hand, and they could do their gatherer and crafter content."</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy XIV Crafting Guide Art" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c729d654d0945/final-fantasy-xiv-crafting-guide-art.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This could be you on Switch 2... — <em>Image: <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/crafting_gathering_guide/">Square Enix</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In Final Fantasy XIV, there are a variety of jobs that are combat-focused, but there are also jobs that allow you to create gear, potions, cook food, and gather resources too. This content is more casual than your hardcore raiding or even running dungeons with randoms — though it's possible to go through many of the game's story dungeons with NPCs nowadays.</p>
<p>But, besides allowing players to go through the more chilled content on Switch 2, also excited about bringing the MMORPG to a new, potentially younger audience on the console.</p>
<p>With all of these aspects taken into consideration, Yoshi-P and the team "have been discussing with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/nintendo/" title="Platforms > Nintendo [5,512 articles]">Nintendo</a>, and the discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future.” We hope there's positive news on the horizon, too!</p>
<p>Yoshi-P has been fairly vocal about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-reiterates-interest-in-a-nintendo-release">getting FFXIV on a Nintendo console over the years</a>, but he's also a fan of the Big N's output himself. Earlier this year, he praised <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/random-final-fantasy-14-director-thinks-aspiring-game-devs-should-play-echoes-of-wisdom">a must-play game for aspiring game developers</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/titan-quest-2-preview-start-of-your-own-odyssey</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/titan-quest-2-preview-the-start-of-your-own-odyssey.1276002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greek mythology is endlessly fascinating and has incredible depth, so it was a given that I was going to play&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>'s Early Access release. A world where mythology is reality, and where gods walk among mortals, is a sure way to get me hooked.&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;has mythology in spades, but it's also shaping up to be a damn fine <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/action-rpg" rel="nofollow">ARPG</a> as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an ARPG in the same vein as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-iv" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/path-of-exile" rel="nofollow"><em>Path of Exile</em></a>, there's a heavy focus on loot and taking out packs of monsters with your increasingly powerful character. This is the type of genre I lean on when I just want to turn my brain off, watch a video on the second monitor, or listen to a podcast. When it's all said and done,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;is perfect for that purpose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-character.jpg?itok=1kmVagrF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-character.jpg?itok=KlSvGZHf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character creation is supposed to come in a later update; for now, we can settle with some pre-made characters.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Titan Quest 2:&nbsp;</em>An ARPG for Everyone</h2>

<p>Here's the thing: ARPGs are simple in concept and don't require a lot of brainpower to play (unless you're Elon Musk, who can't complete even the most basic tasks in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>), but actually creating a build is where I find a lot of friction.</p>

<p><em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;eliminates said friction by creating a streamlined, easy-to-understand experience when it comes to actually building your character, and&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;is very refreshing to see. Rather than being bombarded with a million abilities or a sprawling tree of skills, you're able to choose two masteries.</p>

<p>So in&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, you don't start out with a class. You're given a blank slate, but very soon into the prologue, you'll be able to pick your mastery. These are powers granted by the divine, and so far, there are four to choose from: Earth, Rogue, Storm, and Warfare.</p>



<h2>Be Who You Want to Be</h2>

<p>Picking a mastery grants players a new set of skills to allocate points into. Whatever you pick, this will define your class for the rest of the game. I went with Rogue and Warfare on my first playthrough, creating a capable archer with an emphasis on weapon damage and critical hits.</p>

<p>Of course, you could pick Earth and Rogue, or Storm and Warfare -- really, whatever combination works. This flexibility is nice to see, even if I do suffer from a bit of choice paralysis. The only caveat is that you're supposed to pick these very early on, and thus far, I haven't seen a way to respec masteries.</p>

<p>You can, however, reallocate points into skills and attributes, so even if you mess up a build, there's a chance to remedy that mistake. The process is just easy, and you're not losing a bunch of progress if you change your mind of what skills you want to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-spells.jpg?itok=mfGd4fLZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-spells.jpg?itok=rJCWrQfA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wanna sling spells? Go for it.</figcaption></figure><p>In many ways,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/diablo-iv-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo 4</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">Path of Exile 2</a>&nbsp;</em>feel punishing when you want to make changes, either costing a huge amount of gold to respec&nbsp;or even needing to farm new materials. Going from those games to&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;is a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>The point I want to make is,&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>&nbsp;seems to focus on accessibility. There is some depth to builds if you want to optimize your damage, but it's not quite as deep as other ARPGs; at least, not in its current state. That's just fine with me, since I'm all in it to just enjoy slaying enemies and getting better gear.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titan-quest-2-combat-screenshot.jpg?itok=ScXaapPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titan-quest-2-combat-screenshot.jpg?itok=niDNRqWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Making these Icthians into fish paste.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting All Things Fishy</h2>

<p>And yes, there's plenty of fighting and loot in&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>. So far, we're early on in its Early Access, so I'm not super impressed by the breadth of loot just yet. I haven't found anything super rare or something that alters the way I play, but I still get a little dopamine hit when I find a bow better than my last one.</p>

<p>Enemy variety could also be better, since you're mostly fighting crabs, Icthians (fish men, basically), and bandits. It's Early Access, so I'm sure we'll see more and more as time goes on. This first act mixes things up with several bosses with unique abilities, which can break up the monotony a bit.</p>

<p>For example, I fought a challenging Hippocampus -- and no, I'm not talking about that part of the brain. It's a horse with wings and a fish-like body, often depicted in Greek mythology. This hellion really gave me a run for my money, closing the gap between me and it with its kicks and water attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fates-titan-quest-2.jpg?itok=56BEQsqU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fates-titan-quest-2.jpg?itok=BGIoC6NE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what fate has in store?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Titan Quest 2</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The Hippocampus is just one of several bosses you can stumble across. Act 1's map is quite large, and there are a lot of different side areas. There are more than a few optional quests that had me captivated due to their heavy use of mythology, so I was sure to go over every corner of this beautiful landscape.</p>

<p>In one instance, I came across a group of goats by a stream. Walking further past these goats, I was transformed into one as well. Thankfully, I had a moly root, which could turn me back into my humanoid form. A naiad -- essentially a water spirit -- was the cause. I helped her with a request so the goats could be turned back into humans.</p>

<p>It's not a quest with a ton of story, but it reminds me of the time Odysseus and his crew were turned into pigs by Circe. I mean, humans turning into animals is plenty common in Greek mythology. It made me feel like I was on my own little odyssey, much like Odysseus, and if that feeling can continue throughout the rest of&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em>, I'm very excited to see what comes next.</p>

            <p>Xbox's handhelds have a confirmed release date, and yes, it's the one that leaked. As for how much the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X will cost you, Microsoft aren't sharing a price yet, because there are some macroeconomics to take into account, don't you know.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">pair of Asus devices souped up with some extra Xboxiness</a> to fit the company with all the green branding will release on October 16th. As I said, no price or pre-orders as of yet, with Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen having offered the following explanation to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-still-cant-say-how-much-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-will-cost-due-to-macro-economic-conditions-despite-announcing-release-date-and-availability-details">IGN</a> as to why that's the case:</p>
<blockquote>I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macroeconomic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October.</blockquote>
<p>Odds are that's exec speak for something along the lines of 'We'd like to see how things play out a bit more with these US tariffs, if you please'. <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">Dealabs</a>, whose reliable leaker Billbil-kun was behind the <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/rog-xbox-ally-on-connait-enfin-la-date-exacte-de-sortie-60340">early sharing of the handhelds' release date</a>, report that the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X's US prices could be $549.99 and $899.99 respectively. We'll just have to see if that's accurate, and what it equates to in sadness island pounds and pence.</p><p>Xbox also revealed a Handheld Compatibility Program, that'll let you look for the "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible" badges on games in your library to see what should work on your Xbox Ally, much like you'd check for Steam Deck verification. There'll also be a "Windows Performance Fit indicator" that'll "reflect expected performance" on your hardware. </p>
<p>Odds are our James will have plenty to say about both when they debut, which'll amount to far more than my expert analysis that them be some cheeky little thumbsticks. I can't see myself investing in one over a Steam Deck whenever I inevitably decide a handheld's a thing I need more than life itself, as Phil Spencer has over the past couple of years.</p>
<p>I'll run out the clock here by flagging that there have been protests going on this week at a Microsoft's Redmond, Washington campus. Staff continue to voice their opposition to the company's business relationship with Israel's armed forces amid the on-going assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In true Prince of Persia fashion, The Rogue Prince of Persia is coming out on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S…today! The roguelike platformer, crafted by the team behind Dead Cells’ DLC, Evil Empire, is now available for fans to play. Even more so, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can get the game at no additional cost.</p>



<p>The Prince of Persia series has had a storied history in the gaming scene. From the original 1989 PC version to 2003’s The Sands of Time, the Prince has been around for quite a while. As fans await the remake of The Sands of Time, two new titles, 2023’s The Lost Prince and the then-early-access The Rogue Prince of Persia, have delighted players. Now, more people than ever can experience the title on all platforms (outside of Switch and Switch 2).</p>



<h2 id="h-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-out-on-xbox-game-pass-right-now">The Rogue Prince of Persia Out on Xbox Game Pass Right Now</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>The launch trailer, available <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdJJbvwrAsI">above</a>, showcases some fun gameplay and its surprise shadow drop release. As mentioned before, The Rogue Prince of Persia is available now for purchase on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S. The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 version won’t be available until later this year, with no official date given as of writing. The game costs $29.99 on PlayStation 5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S and $24.99 on PC. </p>



<p>In the style of Dead Cells and Hades, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a roguelike that, when you die, you respawn at the beginning. However, each run is different, and new discoveries, like skills and perks, can be added to your Prince. Its 2D artstyle and colorful sceneries feel quite reminiscent of the originals, which longtime fans will appreciate. The game was well-received by players when it hit Early Access last year. If you haven’t played it yet, you now have a few more reasons to, thanks to the shadow drop.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-40-000-dawn-of-war-4-%E2%80%93-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran.1275987/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The thunder of bolters repelling an Ork incursion and the distinctive red and white ceramite armor of the Blood Ravens bring me right back to the moment the trailer for the original Dawn of War made me an instant Warhammer 40K fan more than 20 years ago. And it's that first game in the series that serves as the jumping off point for the upcoming Dawn of War 4. A lot has changed, but a lot remains the same, bringing bigger battles and snazzier graphics to a classic take-and-hold RTS that is equal parts spectacle and tactics. I played through the 1-2 hour demo a few times and it felt like Dark Crusade never left.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard of this franchise was in 2018 when Relic ended support for the divisive Dawn of War 3, and this next chapter is deploying under different masters. King Art Games, the developer of the alt-history dieselpunk RTS Iron Harvest, has taken up the banner, and I can definitely see a throughline between the big, stompy robots in that game and the classic dreadnoughts and titans in this one. King Art has also elevated the cinematic carnage by adding a synced animation melee system that can simulate a scrape between any two of its many dozens of units.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the recent editions of the tabletop game on which it's based, Dawn of War 4 has jumped 200 years deeper into the 41st Millennium, after the Eye of Terror opened and split the Imperium of Man apart. The Blood Ravens are a scattered and beleaguered chapter trying to put themselves back together, serving as one of the four… and a half playable factions. Their roster reflects the newest Space Marines codex, with Primaris Intercessors and Bladeguard Veterans leading the charge. Older, tracked mainstays like the Rhino and Predator have been swapped for the higher-tech repulsor vehicles. But some classic favorites like the Dreadnought and Terminators have stuck around.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dawn of War 4 has jumped 200 years deeper into the 41st Millennium, after the Eye of Terror opened and split the Imperium of Man apart.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marines focus on small, elite squads that are expensive to build and reinforce, but outshine most of their opponents pound-for-pound. Their buildings are large and expensive, with defensive structures being fully automated rather than manned. In fact, they barely pay attention to cover at all, which was an adjustment from having replayed Dawn of War 2 fairly recently. They do have a lot of tactical flexibility though, with most infantry squads being trained into a pool of strategic reserves that can be deployed by drop pod to anywhere you have vision. The drop pods are even armed, and will stay on the map as a light defensive turret until destroyed.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">ENEMIES OF THE IMPERIUM</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The other ubiquitous Dawn of War race from that very first trailer, the Orks, are the second faction, and the primary enemies in the demo I played. They have much more of a horde style of combat, though with a few units like the Meganobz in their petroleum-fueled power armor that can go toe-to-toe with a space marine. Their buildings are cheap, and all of them have some kind of little guy with a machine gun on them, so vomiting production structures across the map is also how you create defensive positions. The animations are especially thematic and entertaining, as it really looks like a giant heap of scrap that was chucked unceremoniously through the atmosphere.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Orks also, of course, get a WAAAGH! mechanic that lets them earn powerful deployable stratagems for causing all sorts of havoc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as I was coming to grips with the Orks, though, one of my control points was taken by surprise by the other hostile race, the terminator-like Necrons. Hinted at in the epilogue of Dawn of War 3 but never fully materializing, they make a dramatic return with the monolith super unit that can warp in new squads to its location. For balance reasons, Necrons can't simply get right back up when killed like they can in the tabletop game. But they do get a special building called the Resurrection Chamber that can respawn a certain number of destroyed squads for free.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They play the most differently from the other factions in that they aren't especially concerned with the requisition and power capture points dotted around the map. Rather, their economy relies on spreading their matrix – like an eerie, cybernetic form of zerg creep from Starcraft – that grants bonuses to their units when fighting on it and provides them with resources the more of the map is covered in it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">STALWART ALLIES</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Having barely fought off the Necron incursion and getting pushed back hard by the Orks due to my divided attention, who would arrive at the crucial moment to join the Blood Ravens in turning the tide of battle? Would you believe it's a faction completely new to the Dawn of War series? The final of the four fully-playable multiplayer factions is the Adeptus Mechanicus, with their swarms of cyborg servitors and impressive, well-kept war machines.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The AdMech have a unique ability to see enemy contacts as blobs of color relative to their size and power on the minimap, even in the fog of war, so it's almost impossible to surprise them. Their buildings are also networked, providing them with powerful boosts to production for being in range of a network node, which can make them vulnerable to surgical strikes severing the connection. Their super unit is the titanic Imperial Knight, which really shows off Dawn of War 4's scale next to the puny units it's stomping over.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Imperial Guard were present on the mission I played as AI-controlled allies, although with a limited roster of units. They will also be playable in the tutorial mission of the campaign, but not in multiplayer. Not yet, at least.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I did say four and a half factions, though. The Imperial Guard were present on the mission I played as AI-controlled allies, although with a limited roster of units. They will also be playable in the tutorial mission of the campaign, but not in multiplayer. Not yet, at least.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other four factions will each have their own campaigns with branching story paths, taking us back to the planet Kronus from the Dawn of War: Dark Crusade expansion. The story features more than 40 minutes of CGI cutscenes across all factions, and was written by prolific Black Library author John French, author of the recent Ahriman novels among others.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dawn of War 4 will also bring back the popular Last Stand mode from Dawn of War 2, though in a way that was described to me as less hero-centric and "less MOBA-like," focusing more on the classic RTS mechanics like Dawn of War 1. Co-op is also on the slate, and there was a conspicuously greyed-out "Painter" option on the main menu. The devs weren't ready to talk about this one yet, but told me their goal was to include everything the previous Dawn of War games had in terms of customization and then add a bit more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I certainly wasn't expecting a new Dawn of War any time soon, much less from a studio other than Relic. But from the bit of it I've played, it seems like King Art Games understands the assignment. As a Dawn of War 2 fan, I miss the emphasis on cover and move-and-fire tactics. But Dawn of War 4 has nevertheless made a big first impression. I can hardly wait to get dug in next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Have you played the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy 14? With an expanded free trial which you can play through the entirety of A Realm Reborn and the award-winning Heavensward AND Stormblood expansions now up to level 70 for free with no restrictions on playtime? What's that, you haven't? You only have Nintendo platforms and nothing else?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, never fear, because Final Fantasy 14 producer Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida is thinking of you. In an <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with VGC</a> at Gamescom this week, Yoshi-P answered some questions about the potential to bring FF14 to Nintendo Switch 2, and the news seems promising. “For me, it’s just my aim to provide Final Fantasy 14 and 16 to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games,” he said. “We are putting in our best efforts to ensure that this happens, so it’s fine to convey to your readership that I consider the possibilities very positively, and we are putting in our best efforts."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshi-P continued by saying that this would be a boon for existing players too, as some players might want to raid or do main story content on PC, but could relax on the sofa with a Switch 2 and do gathering and crafting more easily.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When it comes to players who haven’t played Final Fantasy 14 before, the younger generation of players, if they started playing Final Fantasy 14 on Switch 2, of course being an MMO, it might be a new genre for them, and I would be super excited to get these new players into this genre and enjoying the game as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So to this end, we have been discussing with Nintendo, and the discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14 has long been available on PlayStation and PC, but it recently got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-requires-game-pass-subscription-to-play-on-xbox">Xbox</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-mobile-announced-tencent">mobile</a> releases as well, making it one of the rare MMORPGs that's playable on most major platforms. Nintendo has been the main holdout, almost certainly due to past Nintendo systems not quite having the technical capability to run an MMORPG of that size. Could the Nintendo Switch 2 finally handle Eorzea and all its denizens? Hopefully yes, and hopefully soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, we did get some Final Fantasy 14 news at Gamescom Opening Night Live. We learned that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-and-final-fantasy-14-collaborations-reveal-new-content-coming-this-fall">Monster Hunter x Final Fantasy 14 collaboration is on the way this fall</a>, adding FF14 content to Monster Hunter Wilds and vice versa. Unfortunately, if you're not already active in FF14, you won't be able to just jump in and enjoy the Monster Hunter content. You'll need to have finished the latest expansion, Dawntrail, which is a hundreds-of-hours-long endeavor if you don't pay to skip most of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Haemimont Games and Paradox Interactive have announced that they are remastering their sci-fi strategy city builder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/surviving-mars/">Surviving Mars</a>. Appropriately titled Surviving Mars: Relaunched, this new version of the game will feature "enhanced graphics," new UI, and even some new content not featured in the original game.</p><p>One such addition is a new gameplay feature called Martian Assembly, which adds colony factions into the game. This means that colonists will now have their own agendas and personal demands, with the ability to set up laws and policies--you'll even be able to gain full independence from Earth. Another key aspect of this remastered version of the game is that there will be "expansive" mod support that works across all platforms. These platforms include PC, as well as PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYdb13fqECo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cYdb13fqECo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Aside from including the original base game, the remaster will also feature every single bit of DLC. That includes all of the game's major and minor expansions, cosmetics, and radio stations. The game is launching at $40, but players that own the original version of the game will be able to pick it up at a discounted price of $20, as long as you're doing so on the same platform you originally bought it on.</p><p dir="ltr">Surviving Mars launched back in 2018, and received generally positive reviews at the time. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/surviving-mars-review-building-the-final-frontier/1900-6416877/">Surviving Mars review</a> gave the game an 8/10, finding some strong design choices and captivating aesthetics, even if some of the game's concepts weren't always explained the best.</p><p dir="ltr">Surviving Mars: Relaunched doesn't have a release date just yet, only described as coming soon, but it will be available on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S whenever it does launch.</p>

<p>Those two games? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_mythologies_sub-zero">Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/mortal_kombat_special_forces">Mortal Kombat: Special Forces</a>. Not two particularly beloved games, if memory serves, but every single game deserves to be preserved, so we're really pleased to see them here.</p>
<p>After all, it wouldn't be a true history lesson or timeline if you simply covered all the cracks, and some people probably like these games.</p>

<p>Those unaware of these two Mortal Kombat spin-offs, let's take you through them. Mythologies: Sub-Zero launched on the N64 in 1997 (shortly after the PS1 release)and focuses on the elder Sub-Zero Bi-Han, who is on a quest to find Shinnok's amulet. Acting as a prequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mortal_kombat_4">Mortal Kombat 4</a>, this isn't a traditional fighting game, it's a side-scroller with a little light platforming but similar controls to earlier MK games.</p>
<p>Special Forces was a PlayStation exclusive that came out in 2000 and, similarly to Sub-Zero, focuses on an individual character in Jax and is a completely different genre, a top-down action-adventure game. The game suffered from development issues and Mortal Kombat co-creator John Tobias, along with others at Midway, left part-way through development.</p>
<p>We're sure to get an official announcement from Digital Eclipse or Atari pretty soon, but it doesn't look like these are the last additions to the game, either.</p>
<p>We already know the game is getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection-gets-proper-physical-release-on-switch-2">a full physical release on Switch 2</a>, which is excellent news, so we hope we're getting an official release date, which hasn't been announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/whoops-it-looks-like-mortal-kombat-legacy-kollections-release-date-has-leaked-early">despite numerous leaks</a> over the weeks. Physical versions of the game are due to ship on 12th December 2025 from <a href="https://atari.com/products/mortal-kombat%E2%84%A2-legacy-kollection-kollector-s-edition?srsltid=AfmBOopf1xGy-lrFklNM_Vs698nW0Tx0EnGjF2hm5dYAHijvOa-2ABZF">Atari's store</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-5-price-hike-us</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-prices-to-increase-in-the-us-from-tomorrow.1275918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a price hike for PlayStation 5 hardware in the US, with all three major models of the PS5 getting price increases starting from tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that due to a "challenging economic environment" (which the company says that "many global businesses" are also navigating), the recommended retail price for PS5 hardware will be increasing from August 21st.</p>

<p>The base PlayStation 5 model will be going up to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition (which, as a reminder, doesn't come with a disc drive) will cost you $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will jump to a fairly eye-watering $749.99. Again, as a reminder, the Pro doesn't come with a disc drive either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-5-price-hike-us-models.jpg?itok=nDxwzatd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-5-price-hike-us-models.jpg?itok=4US4gvOx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The PS5's base models will be getting a price hike, as will the PS5 Pro.</figcaption></figure><p>While the PS5 hardware itself will be getting price rises, the console's accessories will remain at their current recommended price, and there are "no other price changes to announce for additional markets", Sony says.</p>

<p>This move is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">similar decision made by Microsoft</a> back in May, with the tech giant blaming "market conditions" for putting up the prices of its Xbox Series X|S consoles, as well as certain games in the holiday season.</p>

<p>However, Microsoft subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">walked back its decision</a> to charge $80 for certain major releases (including&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>), although there's every chance prices will rise in future.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, Sony hasn't committed to charging $80 for its games either, with holiday releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ghost of Yōtei</a>&nbsp;</em>costing $70 as usual. Other publishers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">like EA</a>, also won't be raising their game prices for the foreseeable future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-price-hike.jpg?itok=-1TusAgq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-playstation-5-price-hike.jpg?itok=Q0Wbocng 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sony won't be hiking its game prices any time soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The market conditions that have necessitated this PS5 price hike are also likely what's stopping Microsoft from announcing pricing for its ROG Xbox Ally handhelds, which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to launch in October</a>.</p>

<p>It's likely said market conditions are referring to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7jjkvzmkxo" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> imposed on many countries around the world by President Donald Trump, with components and manufacturing processes becoming exponentially more expensive for many hardware manufacturers as a result.</p>

            <p>
If the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn Of War 4</a> get their way, the grim darkness of the far future is actually going to be a lot like that halycon summer I spent back in 2010, playing through the first Dawn Of War for the very first time. In a new interview following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-delivers-ork-screamy-rtsness-next-year">last night's announcement</a>, KING Art Games co-founder Jan Theysen has described Relic's original real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game as the new sequel's "guiding star" - specifically for its grander battles and greater emphasis on base-building versus the second game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-dawn-of-war-ii">more focussed, borderline action-RPG campaign</a> and the third game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-3-review">MOBA-inflected, something-for-everyone approach</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Speaking to Wrrrammer Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TY_dYhAnWg">The Great Book Of Grudges</a>, Theysen explained that the decision to track it all back to DOW1 came from discussion with players of the developer's previous alternate-history RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/iron-harvest">Iron Harvest</a>. "A lot of the feedback was '[it would be] be great if we would have bigger armies, or if we would have more base building, and more fortifications, and all of that stuff'," he said. "And so for us, relatively quickly, we said, 'OK, we feel like this is the way to go'. Instead of going more in the Dawn Of War 2 direction, let's go for Dawn Of War 1 and basically make something like a modern interpretation or an evolution of Dawn Of War 1." 
</p>
<p>
Theysen added that "we obviously also looked at Dawn Of War 2 and 3 and whatever we found might work for the game we wanted to make, we absolutely used that. But Dawn Of War 1 became our guiding star." MOBA-mislikers rejoice, I guess.
</p>
<p>
Dawn Of War 4 doesn't cut-paste ideas and mechanics wholesale from the first game, of course, for time is a river that only runs in one direction, whether it's stained with Ork blood or no.</p>
<p>"What you can't really do is just take this stuff that worked 20 years ago, put it in the modern game and expect [it to work]," Theysen went on. The new RTS strives for the same feel, however. In particular, the developers have given attention to the "relatively drawn-out" battles of the first game, and how they challenge you to weigh the value of a single objective against your base economy and the fortunes of the wider conflict.
</p><p>
"It's not like you go there and it's fast time-to-kill and then you go to the next point," Theysen commented. "But it was a little bit like if I really wanted to, you know, I can really make sure that I don't lose this point, right? Because I can invest resources, I can bring units back and heal them, you know, and then I can bring in reinforcements and so on, right? And so if I really want, I can maybe win the battle, but then I might lose the war, right?" Dawn Of War 4 also aims to cultivate this tension in terms of how and when you upgrade units.
</p>
<p>
The discussion of tactics vs strategy sits nicely alongside discussion of the game's four factions, later in the interview - that's the dauntless Space Marines, the ever-rioting Orks, the skeletal pharaonic Necrons and the crusty modem-humping spannerheads of the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
<p>I really like the sound of the last two and their base dynamics. The Adeptus Mechanicus can deploy the noosphere, a cybernetic network, to AOE-buff their units and structures, providing they arrange them more craftily than, say, the Orks. As the opposing player, you'll want to sabotage the noosphere connections to disempower the other Admech fortifications.</p>
<p>The Necrons, meanwhile, gain defensive advantages such as living metal healing while on their home turf, and benefit from slow and steady expansion. There's a link between the area they control and how fast they accumulate resources, so you might want to contain them early, before they sprawl too far.
</p><p>
All of which makes me want to fire up the other three Dawn Of War games this evening and make comparisons - my memories of the Relic trilogy are hazy, but I can certainly relate to the overarching observation about Dawn Of War's clashes being more protracted. I guess the other question here is what exactly they've carried over from the other two games. I suspect we'll need to go hands-on before we know the answer.
</p>
<p>
Some plot recap to close: Dawn Of War 4 takes place on planet Kronus, 200 years after the events of Dawn Of War expansion The Dark Crusade. It's got four singleplayer campaigns - four! Our skullcups runneth over, etc - together with skirmish, co-op, competitive multiplayer and the returning Last Stand mode. It's out in 2026.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-developer-unknown-worlds-sues-former-leadership.1275906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Unknown Worlds, the studio behind the Subnautica franchise, has filed a lawsuit against three of its former leaders, accusing them of abandoning the company, misappropriating confidential data, and scheming to rush Subnautica 2 to market in order to secure a massive payout.</p>



<p>The suit, which was <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/904055347/Unknown-Worlds-Entertainment-v-Cleveland-McGuire-and-Gill-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=tUP1182XR5apSqla4qJM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed on August 15</a>, targets studio co-founders <strong>Charlie Cleveland</strong> and <strong>Adam “Max” McGuire</strong>, along with former CEO <strong>Ted Gill</strong>, all of whom were fired on July 1, 2025. According to the complaint, the trio <strong>“largely abandoned”</strong> their duties as Subnautica 2’s creative and technical leads while simultaneously downloading tens of thousands of company files in the days before their termination.</p>



<p>The dispute traces back to Krafton’s 2021 acquisition of Unknown Worlds for <strong>$500 million</strong>, with an additional <strong>$250 million earnout</strong> tied to the successful development and release of Subnautica 2. Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, described at the time as essential to the franchise’s future, stood to collect roughly 90% of that earnout.</p>



<p>Instead of staying engaged, Unknown Worlds claims Cleveland shifted to filmmaking, McGuire focused on his passion project Moonbreaker, and Gill allowed the studio to drift without oversight. Development of Subnautica 2 slipped years behind schedule, with Krafton reviews describing the 2025 builds as “unready” and lacking core gameplay.</p>



<p>By 2025, with the earnout deadline approaching, the lawsuit says that the three executives pressed Krafton to release Subnautica 2 in an unfinished state, despite internal and external feedback that the game could damage the franchise. When Krafton refused, they allegedly threatened to <strong>self-publish the game</strong> to capture revenue for the earnout window.</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds also accuses the trio of <strong>taking company secrets on their way out the door</strong>. Between the start of June and July 1, 2025, McGuire allegedly downloaded nearly 100,000 files, Cleveland about 72,000, and Gill exported his entire company email account. The studio says the three refused to return their devices or confirm what information they retained, and even threatened to delete all of the files entirely.</p>



<p>Unknown Worlds is seeking <strong>injunctions, the return of confidential data, and monetary damages</strong> for the delays, brand harm, and breach of duty it says the defendants caused. It also wants to prevent any further use or disclosure of its files.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill—through Fortis Advisors, which represents former shareholders—have filed their own suit against Krafton, seeking to be reinstated and to force payment of the earnout. That case is headed for an expedited trial in November.</p>



<p>Fan reaction to the firings has largely sided with the company. On Reddit, one user summed up the prevailing mood: “This is defending the game, not the execs. Because those three were literally not involved in it in any way.”</p>



<p>In a lawsuit filed on August 15, Unknown Worlds is suing co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, along with former CEO Ted Gill for “abandoning” their roles at the studio after the acquisition by Krafton.</p>



<p>This lawsuit is in addition to the others <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-doubles-down-former-subnautica-2-executives-abandoned-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">involving Krafton</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-subnautica-2-leadership-suing-krafton-after-firing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the former leadership</a>. As of publishing, none of the accused parties (McGuire, Cleveland, or Gill) have publicly responded to the lawsuit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Rising video game and console prices have frustrated consumers this year, and today, Sony is adding its flagship console to the list of products getting price hikes. In the United States, the PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and PS5 Pro are each increasing in price by $50.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">a blog post</a> from Sony Interactive Entertainment vice president of global marketing, Isabelle Tomatis, the change is due to "a challenging economic environment." This brings the new prices for each device to the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</li><li>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</li></ul><p>As of today, prices remain unchanged in other countries, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-price-in-europe-australia-new-zealand-and-more">many of them faced price hikes earlier this year</a>. This news comes a few months after Sony said it was considering raising its prices in the US, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/sony-is-considering-price-hikes-to-cover-trumps-tariffs-but-it-might-not-affect-ps5">but it might not affect consoles</a>. That was, obviously, not the case. Other instances of companies increasing prices lately include <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/01/switch-accessories-alarmo-and-amiibo-prices-are-rising-but-not-switch-2">Nintendo increasing Switch 2 accessory prices</a>, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/01/xbox-console-and-accessory-price-increases-begin-today-80-first-party-games-starting">Xbox raising its console and game prices back in May</a>. Across the board, it's a rough time to be paying for new games and hardware.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox announced its new handheld's release date today, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/xbox-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-x-handheld-release-date-but-not-price-due-to-macro-economic">but won't reveal its price quite yet, citing "macro-economic conditions</a>."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/20/sony-is-raising-the-price-of-every-playstation-5-model-tomorrow-august-21]]></content:encoded>
