            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/614336/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-update-patches<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl </em>was released in November<em>, </em>it was clearly not yet the game its developers, GSC Game World, wanted it to be. Sure, this imagining of the Zone was fabulously moody, a desolate and bleak expanse of bog, scrubland, abandoned warehouses, and pallid vistas. For all the ways it was transportive and evocative, it did not yet feel truly alive. The Zone was, dare I say, a little too quiet, lacking the kind of brilliant emergent moments (like three-way skirmishes between stalkers, more stalkers, and roving packs of mutant dogs) that have previously defined the franchise. I ended my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/20/24300652/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">review</a> wondering whether the game would, and indeed could, become the very best “shining” version of itself. </p><p>Three months on, with two major and five smaller patches under its belt, I’m thrilled to report that the game is close to becoming exactly that. To cut a long story short, the enemy AI in combat situations is vastly improved, A-Life 2.0 (the more expansive AI system that gives the game its thrillingly unpredictable sense of life) is practically purring, and I’m now encountering far fewer of the immersion-breaking bugs (like floating and disembodied heads)<em>. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> was admittedly no <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> disaster at launch. That said, the work done by its Kyiv and Prague-based developers, who have labored throughout the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/12/arts/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ukraine-war.html">Russia-Ukraine war</a>, is nothing short of remarkable.</p><p>Last night, while traipsing through the overgrowth to complete a mission in the Malachite region, I was spotted by stalkers from a rival faction. I retreated back into the vehicle station that I’d just passed through, taking cover behind a steel gate. I poked my rifle around the metal panel, leaning to my left as bullets whizzed past my head, catching a glimpse of the masked stalkers attempting to flank me. They threw grenades, pinning me back. I downed one of them, and the other went to heal him. As he crouched down to administer a med kit, I headshotted him, a fearsome crack whipping through the air. Of course, I unceremoniously looted both bodies moments later.</p><p>Improved enemy AI clearly has a massive impact on gameplay. It also changes how the Zone feels. Where, previously, the architecture felt ghostly — blown-out, post-Soviet wreckage that was slowly being reclaimed by nature — now, it is the perfect site for cat-and-mouse shootouts. Fear not, the Zone is still haunting, but the adrenaline-pumping, hardcore firefights that were such a standout feature of <a href="https://youtu.be/0ZqMt74hO6U">prerelease trailers</a> are now very much a reality in the game. It adds up to a 64-kilometer-squared open-world playspace that feels even more dangerous; you’re locked into a battle with the landscape itself and the much smarter humans that stalk it. </p><p>In the latest patch released last Thursday, there are a whopping <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1643320%2Fview%2F579378232238800945" rel="sponsored">1,700 improvements</a>, ranging from small balancing tweaks like radiation levels to what seem like pretty substantial changes, including “level design, and terrain improvements for multiple locations and regions.” Your flashlight now casts shadows on objects, and stealth has been improved (although, truth be told, it’s still pretty wonky). Maybe my favorite detail is that NPCs don’t just heal their fallen allies; they now loot the corpses of downed enemies. Turns out, these NPCs have just as little shame as me. Another small detail that subtly enhances the game’s already wonderful atmosphere: thanks, I think, to the improved A-Life 2.0, NPC stalkers now more regularly gather at campfires, even those in the wilderness outside of major hub areas. </p><p>I don’t want to tacitly endorse developers releasing games in borderline unfinished states. The examples, unfortunately, have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-2042s-disastrous-launch-what-next-for-battlefield">piling</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/26/23738863/gollum-developers-apology-negative-reviews-lotr">up</a> in recent years. But you can’t deny the achievements of GSC Game World. In early December, creative director Mariia Grygorovych reflected on the game’s rocky launch. “It’s not perfect, we need to fix everything,” she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">said</a>. “But it’s a game! It’s a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there!”</p><p>Grygorovych is right, and now it’s easier than ever to appreciate all that love and soul. For sure, it’s an odd and uncompromising love, the kind that’s content to let the player cower in a shed while a blood-red radiation storm whirs above them; the kind that also takes pride in first-person animations of protagonist Skif wolfing down delicious cured sausage. These types of moments feed into a wider tapestry of action that does not go easy on the player — indeed, it goes out of its way to make life miserable for them. </p><p>This type of friction has always been the major selling point of the <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> franchise. It’s what makes the series appeal to such a specific type of video game fetishist. Now, that friction manifests in many more of the ways the developers intended. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2.</em> is no tribute act to past glories: three months on from launch, it finally feels as if it was worth the wait. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a defining trait of Nintendo’s famous barrel-tossin’ ape. But that hasn’t stopped Nike from creating a new pair of sneakers that seem to be directly inspired by Donkey Kong and his popular platformers.</p><p>On February 17, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sneakernews.com/2025/02/15/nike-air-max-1-low-poly-donkey-kong-hv5776-200/?amp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sneakernews.com/2025/02/15/nike-air-max-1-low-poly-donkey-kong-hv5776-200/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sneaker News reported on recently released promotional photos</a></span> that reveal a new version of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://footwearnews.com/shoes/sneaker-news/nike-air-max-1-dotswoosh-donkey-kong-hv5776-200-1234769846/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://footwearnews.com/shoes/sneaker-news/nike-air-max-1-dotswoosh-donkey-kong-hv5776-200-1234769846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nike Air Max 1 Low Poly that is seemingly a reference to Donkey Kong</a></span>. The images show a brown, white, red, and yellow sneaker. These are the colors of Donkey Kong. Further cementing the connection is the fact that the brown parts of the shoe are furry and similar in hue to what you might find on an ape or monkey. </p><p>However, the big giveaway that these shoes are connected to Donkey Kong and his games can be found on the inside. The insoles of the new sneakers feature pixelated mud and dirt, DK-styled gold coins, and even a smooshed low-res banana. Oh, and a big gold coin can be spotted on the back of the shoes, too. Yeah, these are Donkey Kong-themed shoes all right! And they look pretty snazzy to me, but I’m not a sneaker expert. </p><p>It makes sense that Nike’s latest Air Max 1 Low Poly would be inspired by a retro video game character as the shoe was revealed with the help of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://sneakernews.com/2024/09/26/kai-cenat-nike-air-max-1-low-poly-dotswoosh/?amp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://sneakernews.com/2024/09/26/kai-cenat-nike-air-max-1-low-poly-dotswoosh/?amp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitch streamer</a></span> and features a low-res version of the Nike swoosh logo. It seems Nike wants to combine two of the most expensive hobbies around—collecting sneakers and buying videos games—into one ultra-expensive combo. </p><p>There is no release date listed for these new <em>Donkey Kong</em> sneakers, though Sneaker News reports the upcoming Nike Air Max 1 variants might arrive in late spring or summer of this year. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fellowship-takes-the-%E2%80%98mm%E2%80%99-out-of-%E2%80%98mmorpg%E2%80%99-in-a-super-fun-way.1112511/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fellowship-takes-the-mm-out-of-mmorpg-in-a-super-fun-way<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's always cool when a game designer takes one neat thing out of a complex genre and turns it into an entire game. That's how we got the MOBA, after all — breaking just the heroes out of an RTS. Enter Fellowship, a so-called Multiplayer Online Dungeon Adventure that's going to pluck out team-based dungeon raids that are the beating heart of modern MMOs and turn them into a streamlined game – without the hundred hours of leveling up before you get to the best stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After some time with a development version of Fellowship I have to say that the concept turned out just as cool as it sounds: It's no-nonsense, endlessly scaling dungeon runs in a four player team of a tank, a healer, and two damage heroes from among a selection of unique classes. In a group you make yourself, or with a team from a handy group finder, you jump in with your chosen role in either short-and-sweet one boss Adventures or longer multi-boss dungeons—letting you tune your gameplay time depending on whether you've got ten minutes or an hour to kill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end you pick up your loot, tweak your talents, kick up the difficulty, and go again.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I was a bit skeptical that you can have a real authentic, MMO-style dungeon experience without, you know, the MMO, but Fellowship really effectively delivered. You move through the environment clearing out packs of enemy minions in order to get at the bosses, and all the classic stuff you'd expect is there: You've got to watch your tank's threat and manage aggro, try to make life easy for the healer, keep track of enemy abilities to interrupt the nasty ones, and know how to best use your class' attacks in a good rotation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Behind the wheel of an elemental mage-type character, I had plenty of abilities to manage even at the starting level. My character built up charges that could be used to call down big freezing meteors or channel icy blasts. Our healer, meanwhile, could summon plants that either damaged or healed. It was clear in my short time that each class has a nice, clear vision for what it can and can't do. The thing my squishy mage couldn't do, by the way, was survive if I took boss aggro. Sorry, tank.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was a bit skeptical that you can have a real authentic, MMO-style dungeon experience without, you know, the MMO, but Fellowship really effectively delivered. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of bosses, I saw four interesting setpiece fights that ran the gamut of stuff I expect from modern dungeon runs. In a ghost pirate dungeon we battled a skeletal shipmaster that required quick reflexes as it tossed our ghosts in and out of our bodies. There was a giant treasure construct that couldn't be tanked—instead, our tank had to roll around a ball to collect the bits of treasure we were knocking off of it. There was also a giant zombie that summoned the tides, requiring us to shackle ourselves to an anchor and dodge sharks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't all gimmicks, though, and the developers were clear they wanted to strike a balance between fights that require reflexes and understanding clever mechanics with those that really push your ability to play your class' skills to the limit. They gave me a good example of the second with a nasty warlock boss, whose up-tempo barrage of skills and summons needed constant interruption even as he created zones that either forced us to group up… or to run away at top speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What I especially liked is how Fellowship will be structured. Dungeon difficulty scales from one up to six levels, gradually adding new enemy abilities to learn, mechanics to understand, and taking off the training wheels one by one until you hit the intended difficulty. From there, though, it ramps up for dozens of levels, each with their own unique combination of two or more curses that have their own downsides and upsides. One of those, for example, could sprinkle nasty Empowered minions among the normal enemy packs—but when you beat them you'd get a short-time buff that let you clear trash even faster or take a handy boost into a boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The concept of a game focusing on infinitely scaling dungeons, familiar yet dangerous in new ways, is a really cool one. Combine that with the developers' big plans for competitive seasons, where players can start fresh to race up the leaderboards for world first kills on each boss, and I think I'm pretty excited to gear up, spec out, and take on the challenges in Fellowship when it launches this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Marvel Rivals has been a big success on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but the game hasn't come to Nintendo Switch. With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on the horizon for 2025, some are wondering if the superhero shooter could come to the new Nintendo system, and it doesn't sound too far fetched.</p><p>Producer Weicong Wu told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-developer-is-open-to-potential-future-release-on-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that NetEase is already speaking with Nintendo and "working on some development kits" for the Switch 2.</p><p>"Whenever we find that we could provide great performance for our game on Switch 2, we're open to that," Wu said. "The reason why we didn't launch it onto the Switch, it was the first generation of that device they cannot provide a great experience for our gameplay. So if it could achieve that goal, we're open to that."</p><p>It's quite surprising to hear a developer from such a big company working on a major title like Marvel Rivals speak so openly about the Switch 2. Companies are better known to be much more guarded with information about Nintendo's next console.</p><p>The Switch 2 is coming out this year, with Nintendo expected to share lots more information about the console in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">April during a special Nintendo Direct event.</a> The system, along with the launch of GTA 6, is expected to have an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">outsized impact on the overall video game industry in 2025.</a> The Switch 2 was formally confirmed in January 2025, but many remarked that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-was-surprising-due-to-lack-of-surprises-says-former-playstation-boss/1100-6529203/" data-ref-id="1100-6529203">the reveal didn't pack a punch. </a></p><p>As for Marvel Rivals, the game's developers recently announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructure its season rankings</a>, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-reworks-its-ranking-system-again-due-to-fan-complaints/1100-6529388/" data-ref-id="1100-6529388">quickly reversed that decision</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Human Torch Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Hottest Hero In Town</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Another ability the Human Torch has is to create a square of fire, with the borders of the square dealing damage to anyone standing on them or crossing over. His ultimate ability lets him throw out multiple fire tornadoes, which move around after being placed. The trailer also showed his team-up with Storm, which set her ultimate ability--also a tornado--on fire, presumably doing even more damage than usual. Johnny's flying ability and high-damage output is likely to make him a popular pick once he drops.</p><p dir="ltr">The Human Torch joins Marvel Rivals on February 21, alongside the Thing, who should get his own gameplay trailer later this week. All future Marvel Rivals heroes, including Human Torch, are available for free. The mid-season update includes other changes to Marvel Rivals, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-changes-take-aim-at-triple-support-meta/1100-6529553/">nerfs aimed at the triple-support meta</a> and rewards for players with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-now-reward-you-for-leftover-battle-pass-currency/1100-6529551/">leftover battle-pass currency</a> at the end of the season.</p>

It wears its heart on its sleeve but keeps its cards close to its chest in the first of its two episodes, and I hope its final chapter will be as compelling as the first when it launches in April because I’m hooked.</p><p><em>Lost Records </em>follows a group of four girls in a fictional small Michigan town called Velvet Cove during the mid-90s. Swann, a socially awkward high schooler whose only friend is her camcorder, is about to leave town for the Great White North. But as her family is packing their lives into boxes, she meets a new group of friends: the straight-laced ice cream shopkeep Autumn, the no-thoughts-head-empty punk Nora, and the angsty writer Kat. The girls are brought together while confronting a local bully, find an abandoned cabin they make into their secret hideout, and create a punk band together. They’ve all got big dreams beyond this small town and even if their time together is short, they’re all more than eager to hype each other up.</p><figure id="" data-id="ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-recommend-id="image://ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-recommend-id="image://ee278d60c7b333f4e126600ddbae832f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends talk on the phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swann is one of the most compelling video game leads I’ve played in a while. She’s awkward, but spirited and passionate. All of that comes through in the dialogue choices you’re given with her. She can be shy and reserved, but she can also be a little bit of a freak who’s never gotten to let loose with other girls her age. So many of the prompts I got while talking to the rest of the group felt like, in choosing them, I was encouraging Swann to take up space. That can be as simple as letting out a joyful scream as the girls run through the woods, or as weighty as asking your friends if they even want you around.</p><p><em>Lost Records </em>is a nostalgic game that leans into its ‘90s setting, but it also recognizes just how much stays the same as years pass, or even gets worse. The ‘90s story is told through interstitial flashbacks as the girls reunite and reminisce in their 40s. Despite decades between both sides of the story, Swann is still largely the same. As an adult, she’s a bookish nerd who, even after everything the girls have been through together, still doesn’t seem confident they even want her there. That’s the double-edged sword of looking back. You think of the “good ol’ days” and realize that the insecurities you felt then are still around. Maybe you fell back into old habits after so long away from each other, or maybe this is just who you always were.</p><figure id="" data-id="428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-recommend-id="image://428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-recommend-id="image://428c86e4829fb2f7c6bddd8aabeb6fff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Autumn looks down at the table in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Their time together revisiting the past isn’t all about warm recollections, though; it’s clear something happened in that fateful summer all those years ago that haunts the women to this day. That dark turn in the story begins with a scene in which Kat asks to recite lyrics she’s written for their group. The girls are sitting in a circle out in the woods away from anyone who might judge them, and I was surprised at how affected I was by the vulnerability of Kat just singing a song she wrote for her closest friends. I’m in my 30s, and I know that exposing yourself like that doesn’t get any easier with age. I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">moved to New York City</a></span> two years ago and I’m still painstakingly analyzing every word I say to new connections I make in this city, like it’s a negotiation for their time and attention and I’m trying to make my case. But when you’re a teenager everything you feel is so raw, and every request to be seen by those around you feels like the riskiest thing you’ve ever done. That’s the barrier Swann is pushing against throughout <em>Lost Records</em>’ first half.</p><p>In the present day, I see Swann is still friendly with her old group, but each dialogue option feels high-stakes, despite all the years they’ve known each other. Making a choice in <em>Lost Records </em>is accompanied by an icon of either a whole or broken heart, signifying each girl’s reaction to it. Swann’s awkward demeanor and her clear desire to be accepted by her first real, close friends made every broken heart icon sting. The paranoia of saying the wrong thing to someone you still don’t know that well but would like to can stay with you long after your awkward teenage years are behind you, and <em>Lost Records</em> makes this agonizing reality a game mechanic. It’s so well executed that I winced for Swann whenever I said the wrong thing and maybe made one of the other girls sad or uncomfortable. It ate at me until the credits rolled, not unlike remembering a dumb interaction with a new friend hours after it happened.</p><figure id="" data-id="c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-recommend-id="image://c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-recommend-id="image://c461a93e2a93d9fa9b98e76b0864e006" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Swann and her friends look down a chasm as a purple light shines from it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swann feels most herself when she doesn’t have to talk at all and is instead behind her camcorder taping all the group’s shenanigans. <em>Lost Records</em> trades <em>Life Is Strange</em>’s superpowers for a <em>Pokémon Snap</em>-like mechanic of recording your friends, nature, wildlife, and the citizens of Velvet Cove. Looking for enough shots to complete different themed videos can become a bit of a tedious collectathon, but I liked bringing out my photojournalism schooling to line up good shots and see the final montage. The system Don’t Nod uses to recognize if you’re recording the right thing is forgiving enough that you don’t feel restricted and can be expressive with your cinematography. It’s a mostly fun detour on your way to the game’s more impactful moments, but the best parts of <em>Lost Records </em>happen when Swann puts the camera down and has to relate to her friends without a buffer.</p><p>The first half of <em>Lost Records </em>only gestures at the bigger picture until it nears the end of its roughly six-hour run time. Something unspeakable happened in the ‘90s, and even as middle-aged women, Swann and her friends struggle to talk about it. But as they trace their footsteps to how they all found themselves back in Velvet Cove in their 40s, they will have to confront the truth, as much as some of them seem hesitant to do so. Don’t Nod has been gradually lowering the number of episodes in its episodic adventure games since the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>’s year-long run in 2015. So at the very least <em>Lost Records</em> won’t take too much longer. I just hope the second half lives up to the first when it launches on April 15.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals players will finally be able to exchange their leftover Chrono Tokens from the battle pass into something more useful. After having to let those extra tokens go to waste earlier, players that complete the Season 1 pass can get rewarded for their extra efforts.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-adds-new-chrono-token-exchange-system">Marvel Rivals Adds New Chrono Token Exchange System</h2>



<p>In the developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video</a> for the upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1.5 update, the team at NetEase confirmed the new Chrono Token redemption system. Players that own the Luxury battle pass and redeem all the rewards can convert leftover Chrono Tokens into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-launching-perfect-couples-costumes-on-valentines-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Units used in the store</a>. “Luxury” just refers to the paid pass itself: you did not need to buy the more expensive version that came with extra Chrono Tokens to be eligible for the new redemption system. Any player who buys the pass and redeems all its awards will be able to convert excess Chrono Tokens into Units.</p>



<p>This issue was a major community talking point during Season 0. The shortened season features a much smaller battle pass that could be completed rather quickly, but players were still completing daily and weekly challenges and earning Chrono Tokens that completely went to waste. With the new system, it should encourage players to continue playing and completing challenges even if they’ve completed the pass.</p>



<p>Potentially, this change could result in a little bit less spending of Lattice at the store. However, that all depends on what the ratio of Chrono Tokens to Units will be, which NetEase hasn’t revealed yet. Marvel Rivals fans should temper their expectations now, as it’s very unlikely that it will even be close to a 1:1 ratio. Season 1.5 officially goes live on February 21.</p>



<p>Inspired to complete the seasonal battle pass now? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This quest begins whenever you find a Fragment of Starmetal and requires you to reach the final map of the game to complete it. The Fragments of Starmetal are difficult enough to find, but having to potentially wait dozens of hours to find out what the metal does can be agonizing.</p><p>Fortunately, the quest is worth the wait, as you can score yourself an incredible weapon in Avowed with the Starmetal. The question is, how do you find Fragments of Starmetal and complete the quest?</p><p><strong>Be aware this guide naturally contains some light spoilers.</strong></p><p>First and foremost, once you find a Fragment of Starmetal, the Forged of Star-Stuff quest is automatically triggered in Avowed. You can view the quest in your journal but the game offers nothing in the way of an explanation for what to do with the metal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445586"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445586-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-23.28.41.73.png"></figure><p>You can find a Fragment of Starmetal as early as Dawnshore, but unfortunately, you have to go through every single map in the game until you can use it. If you speak to certain vendors across the three maps of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp, you can ask about the Starmetal. Specifically, asking blacksmiths about the metal will yield the most answers.</p><p>Regardless of who you speak to about the Starmetal, though, you'll get told the same thing: The Starmetal can only be worked by a smith in Solace Keep. Solace Keep is the main hub city in the final map of Avowed, called Galawain's Tusks. You can only reach this map by progressing through Avowed's main story. So, if you happen to find the Fragment of Starmetal in Dawnshore, you'll have to go through the events of Dawnshore, Emerald Stair, and Shatterscarp before you're finally able to do something with the item.</p><h2 id="How_to_get_into_Solace_Keep_and_complete_Forged_of_Star_Stuff">How to get into Solace Keep and complete Forged of Star-Stuff</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445585"></a><figcaption>Talking to Forgemaster Dela in Solace Keep</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445585-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.13.42.06.png"></figure><p>When you finally reach Galawain's Tusks, you need to travel all the way north to Solace Keep. Solace Keep is extremely well-guarded and doesn't let outsiders in, however, so you have to speak to the guards at the drawbridge before entering the city.</p><p>You are able to persuade the guard to let you in through a few methods. I was able to tell him I got the clear water running by completing an earlier side quest in Galawain's Tusks, but you can also use persuasion checks and certain background dialogue to convince the guard to let you through.</p><p>Once inside Solace Keep, head straight through the mess hall until you reach a pathway that leads downstairs. This goes into the forge, where Foregmaster Dela is standing in front of a statue. Talk to Dela and show him the Starmetal you have in your inventory. He'll start to clamor over the metal and offer to make you a unique weapon from it. You have the choice between a Starmetal Sword or an Arquebus.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445584"></a><figcaption>The unique Moonstrike arquebus weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445584-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.15.15.66.png"></figure><p>The unique sword is called Meteor Blade while the unique arquebus is called Moonstrike. Both are fantastic weapons, but the Moonstrike is a little bit better and more useful, in my opinion. However, if you find more Fragments of Starmetal, you can bring them back to Dela and he will make you more weapons with them, allowing you to possess several unique Starmetal weapons. You can also bring more Starmetal to Dela so he can upgrade your existing weapon.</p><p>Forged of Star-Stuff doesn't end until you find the location of every Fragment of Starmetal in Avowed, but once you have one weapon, the quest is essentially completed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445583"></a><figcaption>One of the Fragment of Starmetal pieces</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445583-avowedscreenshot2025.02.12-01.36.39.17.png"></figure><p>So far, we know of four different Fragment of Starmetal locations, but there are certainly more on the map that have yet to be discovered. Here are the four locations we know of:</p><ul><li><strong>Galawain's Tusks</strong>: Right beside the Ash Forest in a meteor pit where the Revenant bounty is located (northwest of Solace Keep)</li><li><strong>Dawnshore</strong>: At the Godless Altar directly south of the gate to Emerald Stair on the eastern side of the map</li><li><strong>Shatterscarp</strong>: In the Abandoned Mines directly across from Ruanga's house (seen during the One Last Drink side quest)</li><li><strong>Emerald Stair</strong>: Right underneath the Damp Burrow text in the northern part of Emerald Stair on a rock (to the east of the Abandoned Farms and Rolling Crags)</li></ul><p>We'll update this guide with more fragment locations if they are discovered. All you really need is one to complete the Forged of Star-Stuff quest in Avowed, but like we said, a few more overpowered weapons surely don't hurt, right? Well, they don't hurt <em>you</em>, anyway.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-shatterscarp-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529516/" data-ref-id="1100-6529516">Mapping the Living Lands</a> quest comes to an end in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> once you reach the final region of Galawain's Tusks. Sanza is missing one last cartographer somewhere in the fiery region and it's your job to find out where they are. Unlike the other cartographers in Mapping the Living Lands, however, the one in Galawain's Tusks is alive and well, and you have a decision to make regarding their fate.</p><p>To see where the Galawain's Tusks cartographer is located in Avowed and how to finally complete Mapping the Living Lands, keep reading the guide below.</p><h2>Galawain's Tusks Cartographer location in Avowed</h2><p>Unfortunately, the cartographer in Galawain's Tusks is just about as far as possible from the starting position in the region. You have to travel all the way north to Solace Keep and then find a jail tower where the cartographer is being held prisoner. This jail tower is called "Soreena's Mercy" and it's located to the northwest of Solace Keep.</p><p>You don't have to enter Solace Keep or complete any additional story missions in Avowed to reach the cartographer. You don't even have to actively track the new Mapping the Living Lands quest. So, if you want, you can head straight there and find the cartographer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445557-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.06.10.54.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445557-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.06.10.54.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445557"></a><figcaption>The map location for the Galawain's Tusks cartographer in Avowed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445557-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.06.10.54.png"></figure><p>At Soreena's Mercy, head inside and travel up one flight of stairs. At the very end of the prison cells, you'll see an NPC standing outside of one of the cells. There's a person inside named Renato, who you can speak to through the cell.</p><p>Renato is Sanza's missing cartographer, and he was arrested by the Wardens at Solace Keep for stealing supplies so he could stay alive to complete his mission for Sanza. As you continue speaking with him, you'll be able to make a choice regarding his fate. You can either convince the Warden to release Renato, which isn't too difficult, or you can say you're going to take his map and leave him to rot in the cell for his crimes. The alternative is to fight the Warden and free Renato yourself, but that's mostly unnecessary unless you're playing a more aggressive character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png" data-ref-id="1300-4445558"></a><figcaption>Choosing to free Renato or leave him in the cell. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4445558-avowedscreenshot2025.02.17-21.05.32.60.png"></figure><p>If you choose to free Renato, he will end up giving you his cartography map anyway. If you take his map and make him stay in the cell, the outcome is the same, as you can take the map back to Sanza in Paradis to complete the Mapping the Living Lands quest. This is the last of these quests in Avowed, so if you've completed the other three regions, you're officially done with this questline.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

The mid-season update will also add The Thing and Human Torch, along with a new map and balance update.</p><p dir="ltr">Shared in the <a href="https://youtu.be/FMPCzylKgc8?si=jxolri2w_qBGMha6&amp;t=189" rel="nofollow ">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision</a>, leftover Chrono Tokens, the battle-pass currency, will be exchanged for Units, an in-game currency used to buy cosmetics from the store, like hero skins. While the exact ratio wasn't revealed in the video, this exchange will be available to players who have purchased the premium version of the battle pass and redeemed all of the rewards in the battle pass. If you meet those two requirements by the end of the season, whatever tokens you have left will be exchanged at whatever the ratio is. It wasn't stated if the ratio will be revealed along with the patch notes for the mid-season update, or if it will be revealed towards the end of Season 1.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMPCzylKgc8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FMPCzylKgc8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Tokens are earned exclusively from challenges--daily, season, or event--so players cannot earn them endlessly. However, in Season 0 there were certainly far more tokens that could be earned than needed to unlock every item in the battle pass, and the Season 1 battle pass is tracking to be similar. Marvel Rivals battle passes don't expire, so this exchange offers a reward for players who finish a battle pass within the same season it's released.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 1 mid-season update drops on Friday, February 21, bringing a new Duelist and Vanguard to the roster, along with a new map and balance updates, like some much needed nerfs for certain Strategist ultimates.</p>

In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-deck-reveal-spoilers">an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, senior game designer Daniel Holt talked about the collaboration and this initial look, which focuses on four major character cards and their associated pre-constructed Commander decks.</p><p>The revealed cards include Terra from <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, Tidus from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, Y’shtola from (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">critically acclaimed MMORPG</a>)<em> <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></em>, and of course, Cloud from <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> adds various new tinctures of wyvern, toad monster and arachnid to the fantasy creature chopper's vaunted eco-stew, but that additional variety isn't quite apparent from the weapon types. They're fancier-looking with tweaked or expanded movesets, but it's a familiar line-up beneath the extra layers of flesh and metal. I recognise most from my ancient PSP copy of Monster Hunter Freedom 2, released in 2007.</p>
<p>Capcom have thrown in a few novelties such as Monster Hunter 4's Insect Glaive over the intervening years, but according to Wilds director Yuya Tokuda, the developers currently feel it's more important to trick out and rebalance the existing wargear than give you entire new ways to play.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"When we start development of games such as World and, recently, Wilds, we always consider whether or not this is the time to add another weapon type," Tokuda told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-wilds/new-weapon-type">PCGamesN</a> via translator in a recent interview. "It's not off the table for any particular reason, it's just that we never really decided that we wanted to for the recent titles."</p>
<p>The game's current arsenal includes 14 categories of large animal evisceration, from the relatively fool-proof Greatsword to the fussier Hunting Horn, aka Magic Murder Trumpet. It's tricky, Tokuda said, to envisage "a 15th weapon that would actually have a place in that lineup and feel equally as valid as the other weapon types while also not overlapping with them too much."
</p>
<p>
"It's a very difficult thing," he went on. "With each title we always adjust all the weapon types and maybe bring new concepts to them and their relationships with each other to make them feel fresh. We also bring new depth with new combos and moves. The resources and time that it takes to do that is something that, in every case since the last weapon was added, we've always decided were better spent bringing the whole lineup to a better place than to simply start adding another new one in."
</p>
<p>In the case of Wilds, Capcom have also had to wrangle with the problem of what to bring back from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>'s Iceborne expansion - the last home format Monster Hunter release, which was aimed at more proficient players. "People who were playing a given weapon in Iceborne were assumed to have mastered the basics and it was going beyond that with adding new combos and moves and abilities," Tokuda told the site.</p>
<p>
I haven't really felt the need for fresh weaponry in Munster Honker of late. I've been distracted by all the talk of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ghastly-spider-monster-is-actually-key-to-the-games-more-approachable-design">atrocious pedagogic spiders</a>. But adding to and balancing Monster Hunter's arsenal sounds more intriguing than doing likewise for, say, Call Of Duty, because of course, every Monster Hunter weapon has to come from a monster.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered siloing off their monster design teams, feeding them a lot of fermented berries, and having them challenge the blacksmiths by putting together a menagerie that defies weaponisation. Here's a rare species of wyvern that consists entirely of balloons! Here's an insect monster made of nested triangles! Here's a dinosaur that's so thin it's only visible from the side! Let's see you make another Gunlance out of that.

                <p>The arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> at some point later this year remains one of the biggest stories in gaming. It's not a question of whether it will be one of the biggest releases of 2025; it's about how big it can be at launch and in the years to come. Now, a new report suggests that Rockstar Games is going to expand GTA 6 even further by turning the game into a platform for user-generated content.</p><p>According to <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digiday</a>, Rockstar is in talks with experienced Roblox and Fortnite creators in addition to GTA mod creators about creating customized experiences in Grand Theft Auto 6. It's not that far of a conceptual leap, since there are already numerous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> mods, and because Rockstar purchased FiveM, which lets players take part in modified versions of the game with hundreds of other users.</p><p>The belief among some industry insiders is that Rockstar will follow the example of Fortnite and allow users to create customized locations and items that could be purchased by other players or accessed via subscriptions. Any money earned from these creations would likely include a sizable share for Rockstar itself, while also giving modders the chance to make money as well.</p><p>"It is my firm belief that is the reason that they purchased FiveM is exactly that--to spin up a metaversal universe of custom-built experiences, and potentially UGC items, with an attached UGC creator economy," said WPP agency Wavemaker's global and esports lead Pete Basgen in the Digiday report. "It will essentially occupy that adult-enumerated space at the top of the ecosystem; there's a very natural place there for people that graduate from Roblox and Minecraft."</p><p>While GTA 6 user-created content could be extremely lucrative, GTA Online players have been concerned that the game will be discontinued after Grand Theft Auto 6 launches. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-suggests-that-current-gta-online-could-continue-after-gta-6-releases/1100-6529517/" data-ref-id="1100-6529517">GTA Online could continue to exist</a> alongside GTA 6, but he declined to outright confirm that. Zelnick also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">a PC port for GTA 6 won't be released at launch</a>. The game itself still doesn't have a firm release window, but since Take-Two has set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4</a> for a late September release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">the drop date for GTA 6 may be coming into focus</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals is Nerfing the New Triple Strategist Meta]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-is-nerfing-the-new-triple-strategist-meta/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals competitive players have been embracing the triple-strategist meta, but the devs are not letting it dominate the higher ranks thanks to some upcoming nerfs. The new <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1891880359345950886" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes</a>, which will go in effect at the start of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 second half</a>, shouldn’t kill the triple-strategist meta, but will make it less “oppressive.”</p>



<h2 id="h-cloak-amp-dagger-loki-other-strategists-to-receive-ultimate-nerfs">Cloak &amp; Dagger, Loki, Other Strategists to Receive Ultimate Nerfs</h2>



<p>The triple-strategist meta has become very popular in competitive Marvel Rivals play. With three characters providing healing and support, vanguards (tanks) can absorb far more damage, making it hard to slow down attacking teams during convoy games. However, the devs have noted concerns that characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki can charge their ultimate abilities really quickly. Because of this, teams running triple-initiator always seem to have an ultimate ready to counter one from an opposing duelist or vanguard.</p>



<p>In the Season 1 mid-season update, the energy costs for “frequent ultimates” like Cloak &amp; Dagger or Loki’s will be increased. Certain ultimates will also receive targeted nerfs, and the devs have explicitly stated that Cloak &amp; Dagger will be one of the recipients. Further more, some vanguards and duelists such as Venom and Magik will also get a lower energy cost to their ultimates, allowing them to be used more frequently.</p>



<p>These changes will go hand-in-hand with some more announced hero balance changes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Reduced survivability of Doctor Strange and Magneto</li>



<li>Buffs to movement-based vanguards (likely Captain America and Venom)</li>



<li>Nerfs to Storm and Moon Knight (reducing buffs from start of Season 1)</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The game’s lead combat designer said the goal is not to get rid of playstyles like the triple-strategist meta, but only to encourage other playstyles and provide an appropriate amount of counterplay opportunities. These changes will officially go into effect when the second half of Season 1 begins on February 21.</p>



<p>Is nerfing the triple-strategist meta the right call for Marvel Rivals? Let us know down below in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
