BioWare has updated the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/">Steam page</a> to confirm it’s been verified for Steam Deck.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Hrungry/status/1816450818658500668">Hrungr on X</a>, this means that The Veilguard will be fully functional on Valve’s handheld, which has not been confirmed until now. Consider this a quick PSA for PC players who enjoy playing their role-playing games on the small(ish) screen.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-official-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hunt: Showdown is finally getting a brand-new chapter, as revealed by the game's developers, Crytek. This update is called Hunt: Showdown 1896, and players will be heading to the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Luckily, players won't have long to wait, as the official release date for this chapter is August 15. This update will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>This update is a huge overhaul to Hunt: Showdown, and it will mean that anyone who owns the original Hunt: Showdown will have to upgrade to Hunt: Showdown 1896 in order to play the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-gets-rated-by-esrb-for-pc-ps5-xbox/">Hunt: Showdown 1896</a> takes players to an area called Mammon's Gulch, where players will explore a new biome type. Within the mountain peaks, players will have to learn how to traverse the new heights of the Colorado mountains, which will give them access to new vantage points. While the world above is full of lush greenery, below the mountains is full of corruption and mines filled with oil.</p>
<p>This update is relatively significant for Hunt: Showdown as a whole, as the graphics are gaining a revamp, maps from the base game are overhauled, audio is updated, and much more, using their new engine, CRYENGINE 5.11.</p>
<p>Mammon's Gulch involves exploring 16 unique compounds spread over the mountains of Colorado. Players must search high and low to seek out new information and encounter new threats. Whether you're engaging in PvP up in the mountains or going deep down into the mines to uncover secrets, Hunt: Showdown 1896 has a lot in store.</p>
<p>For those curious about the capabilities of the new CRYENGINE 5.11, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpIimnVGUbw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developers have uploaded</a> a developer update that breaks down what players can expect to see when using the new engine. Using their new engine means players on consoles will now get to experience native 4K and 60fps support across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. For those who are using Xbox Series S, you'll be able to play the game in 2K, 60fps in HDR.</p>
<p>With the launch of Hunt: Showdown 1986, the original Hunt: Showdown will no longer be playable on last-generation platforms such as PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. However, those who owned Hunt: Showdown will receive an automatic upgrade to Hunt: Showdown 1896 for free, including all previous progress and purchases that may have been made for Hunt: Showdown.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mammon's Gulch Map Reveal | Cinematic Trailer | Hunt: Showdown 1896" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nrpz5OFPNg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even if you haven't chosen to upgrade yet, the upgrade will remain free for anyone who owns the previous game version and will be ready to install on PlayStation and Xbox Series X|S as and when players are prepared to return.</p>

Honestly, this feature should be standard in almost every game. But despite the photo mode’s overall straightforward nature, every title does it slightly differently, which sometimes makes learning the mechanic your favorite titles a pain as you’ll need to learn new button layouts and the individual quirks of each game’s photo mode. </p><p>Here is how to access and use camera mode in <em>Once Human</em> to its full effect!</p><h2 id="h2660"><a id=""></a>How to access camera mode in <em>Once Human</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="8d8ba62248fa9fe296a5ea219803a7b6" data-recommend-id="image://8d8ba62248fa9fe296a5ea219803a7b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player accesses photo mode in Once Human." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player accesses photo mode in Once Human." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d8ba62248fa9fe296a5ea219803a7b6" data-recommend-id="image://8d8ba62248fa9fe296a5ea219803a7b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player accesses photo mode in Once Human." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s easy enough to access the game’s photo mode. <strong>Hold down “Tab” on your keyboard to open the radial menu, where your options include “Camera,”</strong> “Summon V,” and “Cradle.” Of course, you want the camera mode, so hover over that one and release your hold on the tab button.</p><p>The game will automatically pull up the camera settings and a handful of controls in the bottom left-hand corner of the HUD. You can alter nearly everything in real time. You can hide the HUD, swap angles, open your screenshot album, reset settings, and tweak camera functions for the perfect shot!</p><div><h4> Where are <em>Once Human</em>’s photo mode images saved?  </h4><p> There are two ways to save your images in <em>Once Human</em>.  On PC via Steam, hitting F12 will save the image according to where  your image folder is set in Steam’s settings. If you take the image with  the in-game option, you’ll find them in the “photo_local” folder in  either <em>Once Human</em>’s Program Files folder or in the SteamLibrary  directory if you’re playing the game on Steam. You can view what images  you’ve taken by hitting the N key while in photo mode.  </p></div><p>A quick note about the various enemies in <em>Once Human</em>: If you intend to snap a few screenshots near monsters, they’ll react in one of two ways. Either they’ll back away, giving you ample space to snap a photo, or they’ll attack as a last resort if backed into a corner. If they attack, it will pull you from photo mode. The latter is a neat feature, allowing you to land a picture without frantically spamming F12 mid-combat!</p><h2 id="h2661"><a id=""></a><em>Once Human </em>camera mode settings worth tweaking</h2><figure id="" data-id="e4c2bd81c407196627bb95536d49572b" data-recommend-id="image://e4c2bd81c407196627bb95536d49572b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character stands on a street while photo mode is activated." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player character stands on a street while photo mode is activated." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4c2bd81c407196627bb95536d49572b" data-recommend-id="image://e4c2bd81c407196627bb95536d49572b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player character stands on a street while photo mode is activated." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Once Human</em> offers countless ways to take the perfect screenshot. The settings you tweak depend on the photo you want to share with the world. If your goal is t<strong>o show off your character’s aesthetic and weaponry, turn the “Type” to “Encircle Character;”</strong> otherwise, your character won’t appear in the shot. You’ll also want to visit the “Character” menu and turn “Weapons On” to “On.”</p><p>Other settings worth tweaking are:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Depth of Field</li><li>Auto Focus (determines whether the camera will automatically focus on your subject)Aperture (determines the distance at which the image blurs)</li><li>Character</li><li>ActionsWeaponsRotation</li><li>Effects</li><li>Exposure (how bright or dark your image is)ContractTexture</li><li>Environment</li><li>WeatherTime</li><li>Stickers</li><li>Frames</li><li>Text</li></ul><p>We recommend messing with the game’s environmental settings and character actions to nail the perfect background to match your action shot. For example, even if it’s currently sunny in the game server, you can make it rain for aesthetics.</p><p><em>Once Human</em> offers a fantastic amount of depth in nearly all of its systems and mechanics, especially for a free-to-play game. You’ll want to test out many of the camera settings, find what filters work best for you, and then share your shots with the world!</p><p>.<br>  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earth-defense-force-6-review-bombed-for-using-epic-accounts.936669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is being review bombed on Steam due to its requirement that players sign up for an Epic Games account in order to play online.</p>
<p>The game has attracted a "Mostly Negative" review rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on Steam</a> across 909 reviews at time of writing, and since it's only just been released, that's a lot of angry players queueing up to give it a kicking.</p>
<p>Most of the negative reviews point to the fact that it's necessary to sign up for an Epic Games account in order to play any of&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6</em>'s online modes, and also the fact that players must install Epic Online Services in order to play the game at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic-shooting.jpg?itok=oWergjZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earth-defense-force-6-review-bomb-epic-shooting.jpg?itok=ysSNuVO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is attracting hostility from players over its Epic account requirements.</figcaption></figure><p>Pretty much all of the negative reviews I could see on the Steam page pointed to the Epic requirement, although there were one or two criticizing&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>for its lackluster technical performance as well. That's pretty much par for the course when it comes to&nbsp;<em>EDF&nbsp;</em>games, though.</p>
<p>Developer Sandlot and publisher D3Publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took to Steam earlier today</a> to address the criticism. The two studios apologize for "the lack of advance notice"; players apparently weren't told that signing up for an Epic account would be needed if they wanted to play online.</p>
<p>Additionally, the two studios point out that signing into the Epic account is "usually" only required once, and that players can play online freely once they've done so without needing to sign in again.</p>
<p>There's no sign that the studios will climb down from the requirement to sign up for an Epic account; since Epic's online services are seemingly baked into&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>on a basic level, it's unlikely that such a walkback is coming.</p>

<p>Although the Epic controversy might have dulled D3Publisher and Sandlot's spirits, the two studios can take solace in the fact that&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>is easily the best-performing game in the series when it comes to player numbers.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the 24-hour Steam player peak for&nbsp;<em>EDF 6&nbsp;</em>was 17,690, over twice that achieved by&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 5&nbsp;</em>(which stands at 8,416). Other&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>games can't hold a candle to those numbers.</p>
<p>Weirdly, this controversy makes&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force 6&nbsp;</em>the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">second bug-blasting third-person multiplayer-focused shooter</a> to incur the wrath of Steam players over the need to sign up for a third-party account in order to play.</p>
<p>Of course, the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>situation is different in a number of key ways.</p>
<p>For one thing, the need to sign up for a Sony account made it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-delisted-for-over-100-countries-on-steam">impossible</a> for players who couldn't access the PlayStation Network in their home countries to play the game. For another, Sony eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked back the requirement</a> to sign up for PSN to play&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, although it has yet to relist the game in many countries.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens in the case of&nbsp;<em>EDF 6</em>. For now, though, if you want to check out Sandlot's latest bug-based splatterfest, it's out now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002862/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>.

<p>In a series of posts on X, multiple Fortnite leaks teased possible Item Shop release dates and details for new content, including the anticipated Deadpool &amp; Wolverine tie-in.</p>



<p>Reliable Fortnite leakers HYPEX and SpushFNBR teased <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816476086127276083">via X</a> that the Deadpool &amp; Wolverine content will release tomorrow. Their posts elaborate on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-introduce-a-deadpool-wolverine-bundle-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iFireMonkey’s claims</a> from earlier this week.</p>



<p>They claim the cosmetics for each character will go for 2,000 V-Bucks, “including backbling, pickaxe, emote &amp; wrap.” They also claim that Gliders will be 800 V-Bucks apiece, with a full bundle costing 3,600.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>HYPEX <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1816184395289825519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also claimed</a> to have release dates for a wide range of Fortnite Item Shop additions coming in the next few weeks.</p>



<p>HYPEX mentioned launch dates for Stranger Things, Avatar, Futurama, and Summer Road Trip to round out the month. </p>



<p>They also finally offered a concrete date for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-lethal-company-collaboration-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lethal Company collaboration</a>, which HYPEX teased last May. They claim that other IP will include My Hero Academia and Jujutsu Kaisen, apparently coming in the first week of August.</p>



<p>A host of leaks surfaced following Fortnite’s major v30.30 update, including rumors that the desert biome from chapter 1 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-leaks-tease-desert-biome-possibly-coming-to-reload/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could release in Reload</a>. SpushFNBR claimed that the devs modified a material with the same codename as the biome after the latest update.</p>



<p>At this time, Epic Games did not confirm the release dates or pricing for any the leaked content possibly coming to the Item Shop.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-fallout-london</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/psa-installing-fallout-london-is-a-bit-tricky-here%E2%80%99s-how-to-do-it.936660/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-fallout-london<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Fly the Union Flag, plate up some beans on toast, and get the kettle on for a good brew – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-fallout-4-mod-fallout-london-finally-has-a-release-date-and-its-today">Fallout: London is finally here</a>. The ambitious, long-awaited mod for Fallout 4 is now available for PC players to download for free. But diving into the British wasteland isn’t quite as easy as booting up a new videogame. Depending on what platform you’re using, Fallout 4 might require a little tinkering before it’s ready for Fallout London. Have no fear, though, for this guide will help you to keep calm, carry on, and get Fallout: London installed on your PC. </p><h2>What you need to play Fallout: London</h2><p>To play Fallout: London, you need to own <strong>Fallout 4 and all of its DLC packs</strong>. That’s easily acquired by purchasing the Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition, which is the complete package. If you already own Fallout 4 and the odd one or two DLC packs, you will need to purchase what you are missing. Here’s a list of everything you need to own:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fallout 4</li><li>Automatron</li><li>Far Harbor</li><li>Nuka World</li><li>Wasteland Workshop</li><li>Contraptions Workshop</li><li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li></ul><p>You can use the High Resolution Texture Pack (available for free) if you wish, but it is not a requirement. </p><p>You will also need to <strong>downgrade Fallout 4</strong> to make it compatible with Fallout: London (more on that later in the guide). On top of all that, you will also need the Fallout: London mod itself. This is available to download from GOG, using the GOG Galaxy launcher. Create a GOG account if you don’t already have one and add the free mod to your account using the green button on the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout: London store page</a>. Then download GOG Galaxy, find Fallout: London in your library, and download it. </p><h2>Steam vs GOG</h2><p>Fallout 4 for PC is available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/199943/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG</a>. Fallout: London can be played using either version (sorry, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-wont-work-with-epic-games-store-copies-of-fallout-4">Epic Games Store version is incompatible</a>), but if you are buying Fallout 4 on PC for the first time specifically to play Fallout: London, then we recommend buying from GOG. </p><p>Why? Because the installation process is much, much simpler. Team FOLON, the developer behind Fallout: London, has a partnership with GOG. Using the <a href="https://www.gog.com/galaxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOG Galaxy</a> platform, you’ll be able to simply download Fallout 4: GOTY Edition and then install Fallout: London after. Then it's just a case of launching the game and playing. </p><p>If you own Fallout 4 on Steam, things are a bit trickier. You may have previously read about how the recent Fallout 4 ‘next-gen’ update created compatibility issues with many mods. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-creators-forced-to-delay-hotly-anticipated-mod-out-of-fear-fallout-4s-next-gen-update-will-break-it">Fallout: London was impacted by this</a> (hence the delayed release date) and so it requires a previous, ‘last-gen’ version of the game to work. Where GOG Galaxy only allows this older version to be downloaded to ensure compatibility with mods, Steam automatically downloads the ‘next-gen’ version of Fallout 4. As such, you’ll need to force Steam to download an older version of Fallout 4 to play Fallout: London.</p><h2>How to install Fallout: London on Steam</h2><p>To install Fallout: London using a Steam version of Fallout 4, you will need to access the old 1.10.163.0 version of Fallout 4: Game of the Year Edition. The easiest way to do this is by using Team FOLON’s downgrader tool, which is available from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a>. If this is your first time modding a PC game then this is probably your best option. </p><p>After downloading, run the Fallout London Downgrader .exe app. This will open a window that will ask for you to select the install path. Click the folder icon to the right of the window and search for where Fallout 4 is installed (by default, that’s "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4"). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-4-downgrader-tool-01-1721914465311.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The next window will ask you to log into your Steam account. This is so the downgrader tool can access the older versions of the Fallout 4 files and install them to your system. Enter your username and password, and then follow the prompts to authorise the log-in via Steam Guard. If you’re uncomfortable with logging into your Steam account via the tool, then you can manually downgrade Fallout 4. See below this section for instructions on how to do that. </p><p>With your Steam account logged in, the downgrader tool will begin the process of installing the correct version of Fallout 4. This will take a long time so you’ll need to be patient. When the process is complete, hit ‘finish’ to exit the tool.  </p><p>With a freshly downgraded version of Fallout 4 ready, you now need to install Fallout: London. Boot up GOG Galaxy, find Fallout: London in your library, and download the mod. (Yes, even if you have Fallout 4 on Steam, you need to use GOG to play Fallout: London). When downloaded, you can hit ‘play’ to launch the installer. The system should automatically detect your Steam version install folder, but just double check before hitting the install button (again, by default this is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4"). </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/25/fallout-london-installer-1721914536172.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>After the install process is complete, you will be able to launch Fallout: London from GOG Galaxy. It will launch straight to Fallout: London’s bespoke main menu and play like a standalone game. </p><p>Two final things to note: you cannot change your graphical settings from the Fallout: London main menu and the game will likely launch in a low resolution. To adjust settings, launch Fallout 4 in Steam and use the ‘Options’ menu in the pre-game launcher. </p><p>You should also disable cloud saves for Fallout 4 in Steam just to prevent any issues. From the Fallout 4 library page, click the cog button and go to the properties menu. In the general tab, turn off the Steam Cloud option. </p><h2>How to manually downgrade Fallout 4 on Steam</h2><p>If for some reason you don’t want to use the downgrader tool, you can manually download an older version of Fallout 4 using Steam’s command console. To begin, we recommend deleting everything from your Fallout 4 install folder (which is, by default, located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout 4") and then following these steps:</p><p>Type steam://open/console into the address bar of your internet browser.

                <p>Sony has released several DualSense controllers over the last couple of years, but its new limited-edition Concord controller is easily one of its most attractive so far. Inspired by the game and its sci-fi aesthetic, the controller has a matte black base complemented by bold orange and teal lines converging into a single point on the touchpad. There's even a little bit of simulated wear and tear on the paint, to give the device a slightly tarnished finish.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340388-concord-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340388" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340388-concord-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340388"></a><figcaption>Concord limited-edition DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340388-concord-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340390-concord_0000_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340391-concord_0001_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340392-concord_0002_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340393-concord_0003_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340394-concord_0004_background.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340390,1300-4340391,1300-4340392,1300-4340393,1300-4340394" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340390-concord_0000_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340391-concord_0001_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340392-concord_0002_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340393-concord_0003_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4340394-concord_0004_background.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340390-concord_0000_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340391-concord_0001_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340392-concord_0002_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340393-concord_0003_dualsense-controller-concord-hero-6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4340394-concord_0004_background.jpg"></figure><p>The Concord controller will be more expensive than your typical DualSense peripheral, as it's priced at $85. This is $10 more than the Deep Earth collection and $15 more than a standard white or black controller.</p><p>Sony has only released a handful of controllers directly inspired by its first-party games, as 2023's Marvel's Spider-Man 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorder-marvels-spider-man-2-ps5-limited-edition-console/1100-6516370/" data-ref-id="1100-6516370">featured a subdued DualSense design</a> incorporating symbiote tentacles taking over the bright red portions of that hardware. The controller sold out surprisingly quickly whenever it was in stock, although it remains to be seen if PlayStation fans will flock to the Concord design.</p><p>Concord will launch for PS5 and PC on August 20, and the 5v5 shooter recently wrapped up its closed and open beta sessions. In a departure from other live-service games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-has-no-battle-pass-you-own-concord-concord-doesnt-own-you/1100-6525272/" data-ref-id="1100-6525272">Concord will not have a battle pass system</a> to grind through as developer Firewalk confirmed that new characters, maps, and modes will be released at no additional cost. Players will only need to purchase Concord itself for $40 and can expect regular content drops, according to Firewalk.</p><p>"Concord’s mechanics may tread a lot of familiar ground within the hero shooter genre, but the way Firewalk Studios’ heroes, maps, and game modes complement each other feels fresh," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-didnt-care-about-concord-until-i-played-it/1100-6524530/" data-ref-id="1100-6524530">Concord hands-on impressions</a>. "Each Freegunner has just enough flexibility to break out of their role if they need to, the simplistic arena-style maps prioritize smart ability usage over intimate map knowledge, and the game modes are just complicated enough to encourage teamwork. I’m curious to see if and how Concord holds up with more maps, characters, and game modes in the mix."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Although Microsoft has yet to make any official statement regarding the unionization, it hasn't made moves to block employees from unionizing. In 2022--while in the midst of negotiating the acquisition of Activision-Blizzard--Microsoft finalized an agreement with the Communications Workers of America (CWA) with the goal of making it easier for employees in certain positions to unionize, and later announced it would support the organizing efforts of other American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (ALF-CIO) unions in a similar way. ALF-CIO is the largest federation of unions in the United States.</p><p dir="ltr">The news of the World of Warcraft developers' victory comes just a week after 240 employees at Bethesda Game Studios (also owned by Microsoft) joined the union.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's gaming division has seen massive layoffs in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">1,900 employees losing their jobs</a> in January alone. More layoffs (and studio closures) followed, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shuttering of Tango Gameworks</a>, which left the developers behind 2023's highly praised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/">Hi-Fi Rush</a> jobless. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has defended the recent layoffs, citing the need to "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">run a sustainable business</a>." The expansion of unions at Microsoft is good news for developers, as it offers them an array of potential benefits, from increased job security to more beneficial salary negotiations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hell-yes-ice-cream-maker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years, I’ve wanted to buy an ice cream maker, but friends who had one always told me the same story. They said their ice cream maker was too big, that it required too much prep. They said they never used it. They said they regretted buying it. But I’ve owned one for a couple weeks now, and I have decided that, unlike everyone else in the world, I will simply never get tired of it.</p><p>One of the great things about being a grown-up is that you can just have ice cream whenever you want. I’ve been an adult for a long time, but I still get a thrill from going out for ice cream without having to ask my parents. Given my love of ice cream, I’ve gotten pretty OK over the years at making <a href="https://www.foodiecrush.com/how-to-make-easy-no-churn-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no-churn</a> ice cream out of heavy cream and sweetened condensed milk, which creates a very good dessert that’s very close to ice cream. And I’ll even cop to making <a href="https://www.theendlessmeal.com/chocolate-banana-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">banana ice cream</a> when I have bananas in the freezer, which makes a very reasonable soft serve-alike. But I always knew that none of this was <em>real</em> ice cream, the kind the forbidden machine could make.&nbsp;</p><p>But a few weeks ago I went to admire all the baking pans I shouldn’t buy at the home goods store in my neighborhood, and there was a <a href="https://www.cuisinart.com/cuisinart-frozen-yogurt---ice-cream-sorbet-maker/ICE-21P1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cuisinart ice cream maker</a> I’d just read good things about, a single one just randomly sitting on a shelf. It felt like a sign, and when the person behind the counter told me they owned one and used it–<em>sometimes</em>, they warned me–I was sold. I hauled it home, happy to find that while its bowl takes up <em>a lot </em>of space in my very tiny freezer, it still fits while leaving room for other stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My Aftermath colleague Chris will surely write some blog about the best ice cream maker to buy and how to <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hack it</a> into being even better, but I am more interested in the outcome–ice cream!!--than in the tools. The machine is fine; you freeze the bowl for a day, then put it on its motorized stand, press a single button, and pour in your chilled ice cream base. The bowl spins around a little plastic paddle and in 20 minutes you have something that’s very close to ice cream, though you should put it in the freezer for a few more hours to harden up. And then it’s <em>really</em> ice cream–any kind of ice cream you want, unbound by the limited imagination of Big Ice Cream or whatever change you can rustle up from the couch cushions.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing I’ve learned about ice cream so far is that it’s a combination of a bunch of things that don’t want to bind together, that you have to convince water and fat and air to cohere through the careful application of heat and proteins and sugars. There are a million ideas about what the right way to do this is, and what the best ratios are, and what the best ingredients are. I didn’t know that ice cream, so peaceful and happy, had so much tension at its core. At the same time, a lot of this is personal preference. It’s at once a science and an art, with a surprising amount of flexibility.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve made what I’ll call three and a half ice creams so far. The first was a <a href="https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/The-Darkest-Chocolate-Ice-Cream-in-the-World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark chocolate</a> using a <a href="https://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Jenis-Ice-Cream-Base/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">base</a> devised from the founder of Jeni’s Ice Cream, a shop I enjoyed in DC, which contains the unusual ingredients of cream cheese and cornstarch. I tried it mostly because I had leftover cream cheese in the fridge the day I bought my machine, and while I was skeptical, the final product was shockingly excellent.</p><p>The next was a <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/plum-sorbet-recipe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plum sorbet</a> that I was worried would turn into a container full of ice shards after freezing (a particular challenge, I’ve learned, of homemade ice cream versus store bought), but which came out tart and smooth, even after several days. Its only downside was that I had too much of it, and grew eager to try new ice creams that I felt like I couldn’t justify until I’d finished the ice cream I already had. (Oh no, a crisis!)</p><p>The third was a <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/vanilla-ice-cream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanilla ice cream</a> from guru David Lebovitz, and my first foray into using egg yolks. There are a lot of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-many-eggs-should-i-use-to-make-ice-cream" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opinions about egg yolks</a>, but I was leery of them mostly because it would mean ending up with a ton of extra egg whites I’d have to find a use for. But lucky for me, Lebovitz also had a recipe for <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/brown-pastry-browned-butter-financiers-recipe-french/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers</a>, so I put my extra whites to that and mixed his vanilla with swirls of rhubarb jam I’d made in the spring. I have to say that this one was probably the best, and that egg yolks are totally worth it. (Less worth it, but still worth it, is real vanilla beans, which cost a <em>fortune</em>, oh my god.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The financiers came out weird because I didn’t have the right pan, but then I realized I could add them to a <em>new</em> ice cream. Enter the “half” from above: I made an earl grey base by squinting at an Amazon sample of the <a href="https://jenis.com/products/jenis-splendid-ice-creams-at-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeni’s book</a>, but I think I mixed something up in the ratios. There was oddly <em>little</em> ice cream, and it thickened way too fast in the bowl and wouldn’t churn any more, even though it was clearly not fully churned. That happened at about eight yesterday morning, because this is the kind of person I am now in my ice cream journey, and it was a disappointing way to start a day. But I froze it anyway, throwing in a handful of frozen financier chunks just to see how they’d hold up. It’s… <em>okay</em>: I wouldn’t serve it to anyone else, but it’s still ice cream, and it tastes great even if the texture isn’t what I’d hope for.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m going to try this flavor combo again using an egg-based recipe, and then use <em>those</em> egg whites to make <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/angel-food-cupcakes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">angel food cupcakes</a>, which I could add to <em>another</em> ice cream alongside either the rest of my rhubarb jam or with some lemon curd I made, in a food waste-free loop of ice cream, <em>forever</em>. My biggest problem now is that I have <em>too much</em> ice cream, and also a lot of friends who don’t eat dairy so can’t help me eat it, though I’ve been researching non-dairy ice cream recipes obsessively to figure out what I can make for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Will the novelty wear off? Probably. Is an ice cream maker a replacement for just buying ice cream? Definitely not; between freezing the bowl, prepping and chilling the ice cream base, and letting the churned ice cream chill, you definitely can’t just whip up a batch of ice cream whenever the mood strikes you. But does it totally rule to think of any kind of ice cream flavor I want and just create it, no matter how decadent or outlandish or experimental? Hell yes. I now live in a new, wide open ice cream frontier; I can see the ice cream Matrix and bend it to my will. I might grow tired of the ice cream-making process, but I will never grow tired of the ice cream-making power. I will defy the odds. I will make ice cream forever.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a precipitous 90% quarter-on-quarter drop in its operating profits following the cancellation of&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life simulation&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>earlier this year.</p>
<p>In a summary of the studio's latest interim financial report, Paradox says its operating profit has fallen from 292.9 million Swedish kronor last quarter to 28.9 million this quarter, with&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>-related "write-downs" of 208 million kronor being "included in the operating profit".</p>
<p>Overall revenue has fallen by 22% since the first quarter of the year, which isn't quite such a disastrous percentage, but is still probably not what Paradox was hoping for.</p>

On the one hand, Wester says Paradox's "core business" has performed well, but he says the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">cancellation of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>was "difficult".</p>
<p>In a more detailed report accompanying the quarterly summary, Wester says&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>'s cancellation gives his studio a "strong motivation to further improve our operations".</p>
<p>He's unexpectedly candid about Paradox's decision-making, admitting that his studio has "made the wrong calls in several projects" and that improvements are needed across production, quality, and risk assessment.</p>
<p>He also says that Paradox won't be starting projects with the "same combination of high risk and high costs" as&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>incurred, so it looks like you won't be seeing any projects similar to the former potential&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>rival anytime soon.</p>

            <p>Over 13 minutes of leaked gameplay from Star Wars Outlaws is currently making the rounds online.</p>
<p>Some of the footage shows the game's opening scenes, although there are no major spoilers. The footage was previously available to view on YouTube, but has since been pulled by Ubisoft. (There was little doubt as to the footage's authenticity, though the company's own copyright claim confirms the video as real.)</p>
<p>Other clips show off the game's aerial combat, along with footage of Star Wars' blackjack-like card game Sabacc.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-lets-you-play-blackjack-like-sabacc">Sabacc was confirmed to be part of Outlaws earlier this year</a>, when a description from the ESRB ratings board revealed players would be able to "wager in-game currency" on the card game (this is also more than likely the gambling referred to in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-rated-19-in-south-korea">South Korea's own ratings board listing</a>, which resulted in Star Wars Outlaws getting slapped with an adults-only badge).</p>
<p>While the recently-uploaded footage has been removed from YouTube, the gameplay is still available to view elsewhere. To borrow from many characters in the Star Wars universe, Ubisoft probably has a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to release next month, on 30th August, across PC (<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/star-wars-outlaws">Epic</a>), <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9p87s3np6sr2">Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>

<p>Our Chris has already been hands on with Star Wars Outlaws, but came away feeling a little apprehensive about the whole thing.</p>
<p>"The sense, above all, is that Star Wars Outlaws is a game that is intentionally aiming for a mechanical light touch - which is absolutely fine. There is room for games that are more approachable and set themselves up for broad appeal, and its fitting for Star Wars' family audience," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-worryingly-dated-hands-on-with-star-wars-outlaws-ubisofts-galactic-open-world-feels-less-exciting-than-expected">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws preview</a>.</p>
<p>"But in Outlaws' case it feels like a clear step beyond approachable and into something potentially bland."</p>

            <p>
Infamous internet animation series Skibidi Toilet, made using Valve's Source Filmmaker software and featuring assets from Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike, is in discussions to be turned into a Michael Bay movie.
</p>
<p>
Bay, who directed disaster film blockbusters such as Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, is reportedly in talks to launch a Skibidi Toilet film and TV franchise with former Paramount Pictures boss Adam Goodman. 
</p>
<p>
"We are absolutely in talks right now, both on the television side and the earliest conversations right now on the film side," Goodman told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/">Variety</a>. "But it's not a be-all, end-all for us."
</p>
<p>
Skibidi Toilet, for those mercifully still unaware, is an enormously-popular online animation series that has been likened to a Slender Man for Generation Alpha. (Fellow Millenials, think a post-apocalyptic Salad Fingers for tweens.) 
</p>
<p>
The series has accumulated over 65bn views on YouTube, another 15bn on Tiktok, and is ubiquitous on Roblox, where countless spin-off games lie.
</p>
<p>
What is a Skibidi Toilet? I'm so glad you asked. In short, it's a race of evil toilets with human heads. They're led by G-Toilet, an evil toilet with the head of G-Man from Half-Life.
</p>
<p>
The Skibidi Toilet animation series, now 70-something episodes long, follows an ever-escalating war between the Skibidi Toilets and a variety of humans with CCTV cameras, speakers and TVs on their heads. 
</p>
<p>
As of the animation's latest season, G-Toilet has returned as G-Toilet 4.0, now with an array of laser cannons.
</p>
<p>
Skibidi Toilet is the work of Alexy Gerasimov, who has cited machinima videos made in Garry's Mod as a key influence.
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the news of a potential Michael Bay Skibidi Toilet movie franchise, Garry's Mod creator Garry Newman <a href="https://x.com/garrynewman/status/1816168530519195729">wrote</a> on X: "If the Skibidi Toilet movie gets made I'll cut my cock off."

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stalcraft-x-celebrates-10th-anniversary/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalcraft-x-celebrates-10th-anniversary/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EXBO is celebrating the 10th anniversary of Stalcraft: X, the free-to-play MMOFPS, by majorly overhauling its features. This title is the giant online game set in the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone, where players can participate in both PvP and PvE gameplay.</p>
<p>With just under 50,000 positive reviews on Steam, Stalcraft: X has been titled Minecraft meets <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-hands-on-impressions-good-hunting/">S.T.A.L.K.E.R</a>, as it includes RPG elements, dynamic shooter components, and an open world requiring survival.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, EXBO has diligently listened to the player base to gain feedback and constantly added new challenges and obstacles for players to try and overcome throughout the game's play through, whether they are playing alone or grouping up with friends to take on the various mutants lurking in the shadows.</p>
<p>In time for the 10th anniversary, EXBO has released the "Day X update," the most extensive update throughout the game's history. While the update isn't out yet, EXBO has released a trailer showing what players can expect.</p>
<p>In the trailer, players can see the massive graphics overhaul that Stalcraft: X is receiving. The game also features a new world with locations, characters, and enemies to uncover. It also features a new soundtrack created by Hollywood musician Jean-Pierre Taieb, who has composed music for shows and movies such as The Grand Tour, Addict, and Perfect Crimes.</p>
<p>In this update, players will be introduced to the Northern factions, which will give them a brand-new perspective on what it's like to live within the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and allow them to pick a faction after exploring all of their stories. In addition, to give players the ability to rest, Personal Shelters have now been added to the game, where they can relax and craft valuable items. For those who want to add a personal touch, the shelters are fully customizable and can even transform into an underground base should you want it to.</p>
<p>One of the most important features of the Stalcraft: X 10th anniversary is a brand-new animation engine. The engine has been in development for two years, and the characters will now be animated using it to give them revamped movement, better perception of enemies on the battlefield, and a more lifelike overall appearance when exploring the game.</p>
<p><span>EXBO has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://telegra.ph/All-STALCRAFT-X-innovations-Patchnote-100724-07-09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive patch notes blog</a> on their website, which explains every new detail coming in the Day X update, how the new functions will work throughout the game, and what players can expect to see in the new areas.</span></p>
