            <p>You're shuffling through the desert scrub, wondering if the clawed beasts just a few yards away have spotted you yet. You've made sure to pop a Stealth Boy just to be extra safe, and told Raul that if his knees creak at an inopportune moment, he's on his own. Then, you realise you brought Rex along, and he's gotten stuck on a rock several meters behind you. Finally freeing himself, the good boy bounds towards you at full speed. This should be the point in some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> stealthing that you realise it's brown trousers time.</p>
<p>It isn't, because Obsidian weren't total sadists when they designed the thing. It does take you out of your Mojave roleplay a bit, though. Thankfully, I can report that a modder has taken it upon themselves to ensure that New Vegas now benefits from the finest in sneaking dog technology.</p>

<p>The modder who's cracked the code to covert canines goes by Wombat, and has been doing <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/95967?tab=description">plenty of cool stuff</a> with New Vegas' animations as of late. Their '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96002?tab=description">Dog Sneak Animations</a>' does exactly what it says on the tin, adding in some extra movements which allow companions like Rex and Dogmeat to drop into a prone crawl whenever your character decides the time is right for stealthy crouch-walking.</p><p>Seriously, just look at Rex go in the video about, tail wagging just enough to betray how happy he is at the idea of pouncing on some unsuspecting raider. Are dogs actually this good at sneaking in real life? As a cat owner, I've got no idea, but if nothing else the animation's cute enough to distract you momentarily if you sneak yourself into a tight spot you're not going to be able to get out of.</p>
<p>The mod should also support modded dog companions, and judging by the comments could potentially be tweaked to include New Vegas' coyote-snake hybrid Nightstalkers, who'd certainly fit as sneaky slithering sidekicks. Wombat also notes that they've already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94901?tab=description">added to some sneak animations</a> to another non-human companion in the form of loveable robot ball ED-E. Though, there's no video preview for that one, so I can't tell you whether it causes the bot to grow limbs and start scrabbling around on his belly like the dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy creeping around with one of the Mojave's mutts, you'll need to grab a few other mods to get sneaking dogs working. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883">New Vegas Script Extender</a>'s up first, with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277?tab=description">JIP LN NVSE Plugin</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71336">kNVSE Animation Plugin</a> to follow, all of which are common New Vegas frameworks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-hard-on-valentines-day-deals-love-sculpture-art-set-hits-its-lowest-price-and-is-selling-out-fast-2000663268</link>
            <guid>1417255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO has endured for a reason. It’s rare to find a brand that speaks just as clearly to kids exploring creativity and adults rediscovering it later in life. There’s something calming about opening a LEGO box, dropping out all the individual pieces across the carpet, sorting them out, and then getting started with the build. I personally like to pop on music or a podcast as I connect brick to brick, zoning out for a bit and enjoying the break from every day life for a moment.</p>
<p>Though putting together LEGO doesn’t have to be a lonely activity. It’s something you and your partner can do together, perhaps even as a Valentine’s Day date at home. And LEGO has the perfect set for the occasion. This art collectible set spells out in four letters, L-O-V-E to remind each other why you’re doing it. Show you love someone by gifting them this home decor LEGO set, then putting it together with them. It even happens to be one sale ahead of the special holiday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">Normally sold for $80, it’s now marked down 20%. That ends up shaving off $16, bringing the price to just $64 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Celebration of an Icon</h2>
<p>Now this isn’t just some design LEGO cooked up themselves. This is based on artist Robert Indiana’s iconic pop art. He first created it as a card back in 1964. Later in 1970, he adapted it into a 144-inch tall sculpture, now located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Since then, many different incarnations have been created, finding homes in cities including Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, but now potentially your living room too.</p>
<p>This 791-piece LEGO set is thankfully not as tall as the original. No, this one only measures in at a humble 10 inches tall by 10 inches wide, by 2.5 inches deep. It has the same vibrant red, blue and green colors. Just looking at pictures of this has me wondering when LEGO is going to make a set of the Nintendo 64 start-up screen logo. One day, hopefully.</p>



<h2>Build With a Loved One</h2>
<p>Really leaning into the Valentine’s Day theming of this set, it is even packed with two copies of the instructions, encouraging couples or duos of any kinds to work together on the build.</p>
<p>The set is even popular enough that a number of third party vendors on Amazon are selling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6895/">LED kits custom made to line up with the outer edge of each letter, turning your lovely LEGO set into a cute lamp.</a></p>

            <p>
French unions representing workers at Ubisoft have reportedly voted unanimously in favour of strike action following the company's recent dramatic "reset" and in response to a voluntary redundancy proposal that could see as many as 200 Paris HQ employees lose their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Last week, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">announced</a> a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", resulting in the cancellation of six games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">troubled Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as well as delays for seven other titles, the closure of its Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, and a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Ubisoft is proposing a voluntary round of redundancies as it seeks to further reduce operating costs. The move - which is being organised under the voluntary Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, wherein employees can collectively negotiate the mutually agreed termination of a permanent contract - could result in as many as 200 jobs cut at Ubisoft's Paris headquarters. That's reportedly around 18 percent of the company's Paris HQ workforce, said to number approximately 1100 employees in total.
</p>
<p>
"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives," a Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">confirmed in a statement provided to IGN</a>, "Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France."
</p><p>
"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."
</p>
<p>
In response to the companys's voluntary redundancy proposal, as per French financial publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a>, unions representing Ubisoft workers - specifically, Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses du jeu vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps écologique - have unanimously agreed to strike. The strike is due to run from 10th-12th February, and will reportedly see unions coordinating with their international counterparts in a bid to expand the scope of the action.
</p>
<p>
Following word of Ubisoft's latest "reset", the company's share price <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">plummeted 34 percent</a>, resulting in its lowest share price in 15 years.

<p>A new trademark has been filed for the upcoming open-world game mode set to launch with EA FC 27. </p>



<p>The discussions, leaks, and rumours about EA Sports introducing an open world with their upcoming title have been circulating for months now. Back in November 2025, we even saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> for this mode, with the open world looking pretty similar to NBA 2K’s.

"It has insane difficulty spikes with bosses like Spider Guardian and Boost Guardian which were only rectified with the Wii port as part of Metroid Prime Trilogy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Switch was never known as a place for serious racing games. There’s any number of reasons for that – younger audience demographics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario’s karting stranglehold</a>, it’s lower processing power – but that didn’t stop at least one company dipping their toe in. Admittedly, the GRID series isn’t the most serious out there, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/01/grid-autosport-switch-review/">GRID Autosport</a> was a showcase for what could be achieved on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid, handily shrinking down a racing game from yesteryear to run on the go. It’s fitting, then, that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grid-legends">GRID Legends</a> is arriving on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, once again becoming a beacon for Nintendo-owning racing fans who want to race wherever they are. Oh, and gamers who know that there are racing options that don’t feature moustachioed plumbers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pre-order Now — GRID™ Legends: Deluxe Edition Arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 January 29th!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1xP3-wlwyQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/grid-legends-review/">GRID Legends originally released in 2022</a>, appearing across the last generation PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the shinier PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. That immediately puts it in a good spot for the Switch 2, with Nintendo’s newest system sitting somewhere between the two, performing comparably to the PS4 in many scenarios, while tapping into some of the latest techniques like DLSS and ray tracing.</p>


<p>As with GRID Autosport, Feral Interactive has taken the high octane reins from original developer Codemasters. Their approach here is certainly successful, especially because they put the game’s performance and visuals directly within your control.</p>


<p>There’s multiple graphics options, split between docked and handheld, and I immediately love that there’s defined options for both, meaning that you can have different choices set up for either situation. Docked is more straightforward. Here there’s a Graphics option, with the game set to 30fps, but with all of the effects and visual eye-candy turned up. You’re getting some lovely reflections here, enhanced weather effects and a higher resolution, sharper image, and it really does look very good indeed, albeit with the odd spot of pop-in here and there.</p>
<p>All that said, the moment you switch to the Performance mode, all of those visual niceties are forgotten. At 60fps the game just feels so much tighter, more accurate and responsive. If you’re truly a fan of racing games, you’d be hard pressed to go back to the solid, but ultimately slower-feeling Graphics option.</p>

<p>Handheld play brings even more choice and granularity. There’s four different options here, and alongside the previous Graphics and Performance, there’s Balanced as a mid-point between the two, and Battery Saver, which tunes down both graphics and performance in order to keep you playing for longer.</p>
<p>You can also toggle enhanced effects on and off too, for a further performance to power option. Crucially, every one of these visual options feels valid in some way. Saber Interactive have given players an amazing suite of options to choose from, and in aping a more PC-like suite of options, they’ve set a new benchmark for Nintendo Switch 2 ports. It could be argued that’s too many options for a fixed platform, but it doesn’t hurt to have.</p>
<p>Even at the lowest Battery Saving mode, the visuals are clean and crisp, and the game is thoroughly playable, though it looks more like the original GRID Autosport than you’re probably expecting, losing all of the visual bells and whistles that you’ll see further up the graphical options.</p>
<p>GRID Legends story mode has aged surprisingly well. The huge, ongoing popularity of racing series like Drive to Survive and Nascar Full Speed, means that GRID Legends documentary-style live action footage and in-engine racing still feels of the moment, and becoming Driver 22 puts you in the midst of it all. You are an unknown rookie, joining the upstart team Seneca Racing, aiming to take them from paddock nobodies to the talk of the track.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a little too earnest at times, and it sometimes doesn’t entirely match up with your race performances, but it’s fun, mostly well acted, and lends the game a real sense of drama. You can also become the Leonardo di Caprio pointing meme looking out for the current Doctor Who, with Ncuti Gatwa appearing as one of the race drivers.</p>

<p>Despite being four years old, there’s a lot that feels pulled from Brad Pitt’s big-budget F1 movie, especially the intense, Hans Zimmer-esque music that rises and falls through each race. I can see it being a point of contention for some – you can always turn it off – but if you want to feel like you’re in the middle of an underdog racing story, GRID Legends has it nailed.</p>
<p>One of the other reasons that the Nintendo Switch wasn’t the preferred home for serious racers was the lack of analogue triggers on either Joy-Con or Pro Controller, which are a practical necessity for modern racing games. You can adjust, though. I grew up when all racing game controls were digital, and I still find myself reverting to taps on the stick and triggers rather than small, smooth adjustments. After a moment’s adjustment, I barely noticed when playing GRID Legends. It helps that the handling and ultra-grippy cars make this rather forgiving and intended to be welcoming, and &nbsp;it all comes together really well on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Feral Interactive have built in analogue control options though. The first is to utilise the right analogue stick, giving you precise control over the cars braking and acceleration, though in a way that feels deeply unusual to me and hard to get used to. The easier option? GRID Legends supports the official Switch 2 GameCube controller, which has two, great-feeling analogue triggers. Suddenly, racing games seem a lot more appealing on the Switch 2…</p>

<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161545/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>For serious petrolheads, the Switch 1 wasn't exactly a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/burnout_paradise_remastered">(Burnout)</a> paradise platform. In fact, given the size of the console's library, there's surprisingly little in the way of even semi-serious racing sims for those looking for more than kart racing, smaller-scale experiences that hone in on one aspect and expand (such as the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/art_of_rally">art of rally</a>), or more general arcade fare (like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hot_wheels_unleashed_2_turbocharged">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/horizon_chase_turbo">Horizon Chase Turbo</a>).</p>
<p>These are all great games, for sure, but even now, with the Switch successor nearly eight months into its life, what are we looking at in terms of sim-styled stuff? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rush_rally_3">Rush Rally 3</a> and its follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rush_rally_origins">Rush Rally Origins</a>, perhaps, but precious little. 2019's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> still stands out, though.</p>
<p>I know, Codemasters' 2014 racer (brought to Switch by Feral Interactive) isn't really a sim either, not purely, but it's a different level of racing experience to the others I've mentioned. You can have a big, serious career across multiple disciplines, and so it's a game that comes as close to the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_motorsport">Forza</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo</a> as you'll currently get on a Switch. Indeed, it's the most impressive racing game port I've played on the console, giving you the full-fat package of single-player content to race through local and online multiplayer was added in post-launch updates), and with no major performance issues to speak of. It also looks great, even now.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161546/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now 2022's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends</a>, the most recent series entry, has landed on Switch 2 and it's brought all the same graphics options and tweakable bells and whistles as its impressive predecessor — more about those in a bit — whilst also upping the ante in terms of the depth and scope of its solo content. Nice! However, does it have the bleedin' multiplayer at launch this time?</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. And whilst, yes, it's a shame, I have to say, as someone who owns this game on other platforms, you're not missing much. At all. In fact, given that online leaderboards <em>have</em> made the cut here, I'd go so far as to say you've still got the best and cleanest multiplayer element intact. It's unclear if multiplayer might be patched in later, like its predecessor.</p>
<p>However, Legends <em>is</em> aiming to please primarily by bringing narrative aspects and solo content to the fore. It feels like that rare sort of racer that's been made with single-player racing fans in mind, in fact. Its story and campaign modes are where it sings, mixing a little light drama with racing that can, and does, get fairly explosive on the regular. Also, this Deluxe Edition lands with all previously-released DLC, meaning there's loads more to dig into in these modes.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161547/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's talk about the handling of the cars. The Grid games hit my own personal sweet spot (most of the time) for controls in an arcade-sim/simcade style. It immediately feels very satisfying to put your boot down and tear up a straight; to drift ferociously through corners or handbrake at the last second into a hairpin and swing your back around, ready to rinse and repeat step one. If you've played any modern arcade racer, you're immediately comfortable, and this game feels as good as any of its peers when you're on the track. In fact, I've been on a bit of a racer kick lately, and I can say that this one easily beats out <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed_heat">Need For Speed Heat</a></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/need_for_speed_unbound">Need for Speed Unbound</a></strong>. Both lovely games, but this one wins on controls, it wins on content, and it wins on giving solo players loads that they'll feel the need to speed into. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>Now, let's reverse a bit, because I mentioned controls and whilst for some, the lack of a multiplayer suite will be the primary annoyance, it's Nintendo's choice of digital triggers on the Switch 2's controllers that bothers me most for this type of experience. It's not a complete killer, not at all, and I'm sure you've had plenty of experience with it in the past, but it's going to be an issue for some finesse fans who don't want to start considering new control setups or tweaking in order to attain the level of throttle control they enjoy.</p>
<p>Of course, and you'll know this if you've checked out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">recent guide to Switch 1 and 2 games with analogue trigger support for GameCube controllers</a>, you <em>can</em> also use your snazzy NSO GameCube pad to override this issue and enjoy the wonder of technology that's been around since the late '90s. With the GC controller plugged in, the game shines all the brighter.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161538/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I do also think, on balance, that the lack of analogue triggers on the default controllers isn't quite as important as it could have been. There's no way you're getting me around Monaco in an exacting F1 game with digital triggers, for example — I'm crashing 1000 times on the first bend — but it works fine for what's presented here.</p>
<p>Onto the modes on offer, and Grid Legends brings lots to the table. Besides the main story mode, which I'll get to in a bit, we've got a career that's split up over four unlockable levels, starting with a rookie program and ending in a gauntlet of pro challenges. With a total of nine disciplines to try to master, from touring and electric cars to open-wheeled vehicles, trucks, and high-performance GT stuff (my favourite), there are 128 motors and 137 track routes set in 22 different locations here. Yes, I did say it's a meaty one.</p>
<p>Free play mode then gives you single player quick races, single race events and custom cups for you to set up at your leisure, whilst Dynamic Events mode, as I briefly mentioned earlier, allow you to pit your online times against others via leaderboards.</p>

<p>As for the main course, that is the game's 'Drive to Glory' story mode, this roughly seven-hour affair sees you rise up the ranks through events and trials in a tale that's as rote as they come, but it does have an ace up its sleeve! And that ace, my friends, is live-action acting for the cutscenes and all the main parts of rival racers and team members, making for some utterly hammy, totally unnecessary, and really, actually, quite fun cutscenes.</p>
<p>I also vastly prefer the overall style of how this stuff gets delivered here; dropped in casually and quickly as we set up for races and arrive at paddocks, and so on, rather than cutting away for big chunks. It gives you a story, and it keeps you near to the action at all times. So, if you feel like the narrative aspects <em>might</em> get in the way of racing, fear not, as it's a well-balanced thing, and having voices and faces for opponents sure does bring a new level of competitiveness on the track, too. <em>"I really hate that guy!"</em> you'll scream as you ram into their car and make an enemy, or a 'rival', as the game labels it.</p>

<p>Yes, the racing here once again incorporates the Grid series' slick nemesis system, and it's been improved in Legends, making for some seriously dirty races as you start to make <del>enemies</del> rivals who'll then make sure to get payback by spinning you out on a corner or shunting you at the worst possible moment. I love it, and you can toggle off the rough stuff if you're not a fan, as there are difficulty levels for everyone to enjoy here and options galore.</p>
<p>Speaking of options, this one has got all the graphics modes found in GRID Autosport. So, you've a choice between "Graphics" and "Performance" in TV mode (30/60fps, respectively). In handheld, we get both performance and quality as above, with the addition of a "Balanced" mode and a "Battery Saver" mode.</p>
<p>I've been messing with all of these and the visual quality mode, whilst fine, isn't worth the sacrifice for how smooth performance feels at a solid 60fps. I'll also say I've been pretty blown away by how great the performance mode looks on a big TV screen. There's no need to worry about awful textures and image quality at all with this, it looks fab.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161541/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In handheld, I've landed on the balanced mode after lots of experimenting. It feels that bit smoother than quality and looks sublime on the console's little screen. There are also options to turn on or off enhanced visual effects and to reduce rain intensity, so plenty to muck with, and the game delivers top-notch, highly enjoyable and responsive racing on the go as a result.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you can make peace with a lack of multiplayer outside of online leaderboards, alongside the fact that digital triggers aren't ideal if you're after precision throttle control (grab a GameCube NSO pad to swerve this issue), Grid Legends on Switch 2 serves up an excellent package of slick and satisfying 'simcade' action that looks and plays wonderfully well in both docked and handheld.</p>
<p>With lots of options in terms of graphics and accessibility, and all previously-released DLC included, this is easily the best racing package of this type that's currently available on either of Nintendo's Switches and a real blast for solo racing fans.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Zombies Are More Unpredictable Than Ever Because They Retain Some of Their Human Memories]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-more-unpredictable-than-ever/</link>
            <guid>1417204</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Throughout the marketing phase of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> kept quiet about a few things. One was famously <strong>the presence of Leon Kennedy as a playable character</strong>, which leaker Dusk Golem swore about for a long time but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained unconfirmed until last month</a>. </p>



<p>Another was <strong>the zombies</strong>, the key enemy in the whole series. How would they look? What would they behave like? It was only recently that the developers finally opened up about this. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-are-unpredictable-in-ways-the-series-hasnt-tried-before/1100-6537627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a fresh interview with Gamespot</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi unveiled the twist: to make them more unpredictable, CAPCOM <strong>has ensured they retain some of their human behavior</strong>.</p>



<p><em>When making a Resident Evil title, the question of how to present zombies is always something that comes up in discussions. You want to have some variety, but at the same time, if you make too many changes, it doesn't feel like a zombie anymore, so there's always that element or that challenge of designing enemies for a Resident Evil title. In this setting, you're dealing with a lot of zombies who literally just became zombies momentarily or a while ago. It's pretty fresh.</em></p>



<p><em>Part of that fear experience is not knowing what the enemy is going to do when they approach you or when you see them, and so if you just had a standard zombie, you probably by now have an idea of what a zombie's going to do. But if you had these zombies here that retained some of their memories or behavior from their previous life, then there's more of a mystery element. You're not exactly sure what they're going to do.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly an interesting concept. Over the course of the series, zombies did become a bit trite and less scary than they were at first. Will this change in Resident Evil Requiem be enough to make players fear them once again? We'll know in a month when the game will be released across all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

              <p>As spotted by the fine folks over at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-switch-online-gamecube-releases-might-have-been-leaked"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>, it appears Walmart may have rather given away a couple of big Nintendo secrets. On the retail giant’s <a href="https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719">Nintendo section of its website</a> there’s a section called “Unlock more” which sells you a $35 gift card unlocking the Nintendo Online Family Membership subscription deal. The image promoting this looks like the usual array of box covers used by Nintendo, except in among them appears two games we didn’t know were on the way, and they’re doozies.</p> <p>Between the likes of all-time classics like <em>F-Zero</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong: Country</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 64</em> are GameCube games&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 2</em> and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Echoes</em>. Neither are listed among Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-gamecube-nintendo-classics-switch-2/">GameCube collection</a> for the subscription service, which currently includes just eight games, most recently adding&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663433"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663433">© Walmart / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 version of the ludicrously named Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so the small number of games added over what’s rapidly becoming the first year of the new console has been pretty disappointing. It certainly offers some stone-cold classics, like&nbsp;<em>SoulCailbur II</em>,&nbsp;<em>Zelda: Windwaker</em> and&nbsp;<em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, but it’s perhaps harder to get overly excited about&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Srtikers&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure!</em> Given Nintendo could already have included <em>Zelda: Twilight Princess</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>, they do seem very odd choices.</p> <p>Of course, a lot of the best Nintendo-published GameCube games become tricky prospects for the company to add, as Nintendo’s endless recycling of its properties becomes a little starkly revealed if it does. <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Party 4, 5, 6 </em>and<em> 7</em>,&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Mario Power Tennis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime</em>,&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>…any of them might eat into attempts to sell either recent remasters or current sequels.</p>

 <p>Even the two Walmart has seemingly revealed are on the edge of this phenomenon, although a <em>Pikmin 5&nbsp;</em>appears to still only exist in Miyamoto’s animation-obsessed mind, and perhaps the addition of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime II</em> suggests we’re not likely to see a remaster of the sequel any time soon. Given just how brilliantly 2023’s <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> worked out, that’s a proper shame if the case.</p>

 <p>Let’s hope these two titles are for real, and not just an over-excited Walmart employee getting slap-happy with Photoshop. Given the image is still up on Walmart’s site many hours after&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Life</em> broke the story it seems Nintendo hasn’t scrambled, although it could be because everyone involved is in bed.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project Guide—All Requirements & Rewards, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/</link>
            <guid>1417195</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Headwinds update for ARC Raiders is here, and perhaps the star of the show is the new Project, the Trophy Display. Similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flickering Flames Project</a> that arrived with the Cold Snap update, it has five stages for you to complete, and if you couldn’t tell by the title, you’ll be hunting a lot of ARC.</p>



<p>It’s not all for glory, though, as there are some genuinely exciting rewards up for grabs this time around. However, it won’t come easily, as it’ll have you pitted up against a whole variety of ARCs; from small Ticks to feisty Leapers, you’ll need to keep your wits about you.</p>







<p>If you don’t want to waste any time and make your raids efficient, then you’re in the right place. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Trophy Display Project in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-trophy-display-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It starts off simple enough. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Trophy Display Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil. </strong></p>



<p>Frustratingly, you cannot cycle through the stages to see what you’ll need down the line, and since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds update</a> is so fresh, only the first stage of the Project is visible. However, as more and more of the Trophy Display Project is unveiled, Insider Gaming will be sure to update the guide with the next stages.</p>



<p>For now, though, here’s every known stage of the Trophy Display Project, including the requirements as well as the rewards:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Project Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Project Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Roaming Threats</td><td data-align="center">– 3 Rusted Bolts<br>– 15 Pop Triggers<br>– 15 Tick Pods<br>– 5 Surveyor Vaults</td><td data-align="center">– 10 Mod Components<br>– 3 Power Rods<br>– 10 Raider Tokens<br>– 1 Light Gun Parts Blueprint</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Project Completion</td><td data-align="center">Complete all 5 Stages</td><td data-align="center">– Howl Emote<br>– 1 Legendary Jupiter Sniper Rifle<br>– 1 Acoustic Guitar<br>– 5 Energy Clips<br>– 300,000 Coins</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>There’s an incredible incentive to complete the project, with the likes of 300,000 Coins and a Jupiter Sniper Rifle up for grabs—and that’s not including the Blueprints and Raider Tokens along the way! It’s undeniably an exciting Project, but do you need to rush through it to claim the rewards before time runs out?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-end">When Does The ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You won’t want to miss these rewards. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, there is no expiry date on the Trophy Display Project in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>That means you can take as long as you’d like to grind through the Project and earn the rewards, and it’s a welcome change when compared to the rush that was the Flickering Flames Project. Embark Studios also confirmed that progress will not be reset between Expedition resets, so there’s no risk heading out on the next departure if you’re only halfway through the Project.</p>







<p>That doesn’t mean that an end date won’t be added to the Project in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future</a>, though. It could be months away yet, but it might be best not to leave it too late, especially as it seems like there’s a solid grind on the cards here. </p>

<p>Walmart has leaked two titles coming to the Nintendo Switch Online service, including the addition of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, damaging hopes that a remake was in the works.</p>



<p>Fans have been clamouring for a remake of Metroid Prime 2 ever since the release of the original Metroid Prime remaster in 2023, with many speculating the absence of the second title on the Nintendo Switch Online service was due to the game being set to receive similar treatment.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-2-amp-pikmin-2-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">Metroid Prime 2 &amp; Pikmin 2 Coming to Nintendo Switch Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked. Image via Walmart</figcaption></figure>



<p>An image on the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Walmart website</a> advertising the Nintendo Switch Online subscription showcases several of the major games available in the service, though two of those have not been officially revealed.</p>



<p>The image shows that Pikmin 2 and Metroid Prime 2 are due to be added to the service, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Direct being showcased next week</a>, official confirmation could be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 2 would join the slew of titles from the franchise available in the service, though Metroid Prime itself is not available, with those who want to play the title instead having to splash out on the remaster.</p>



<p>Given that Nintendo would be highly unlikely to release a classic version of Metroid Prime 2 into the Nintendo Switch Online catalog if a remake of the title was planned, the news means that, at the very least, a remaster is still a way off, if it’s even in the pipeline at all.</p>

            <p>In a year full of awesome new game releases (many of which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusives), many agreed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders</a> was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">2025's top bangers</a>. Now, a new surprise patch has made it even better.</p>
<p>Players were hoping for meatier post-launch support than what Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">with his no DLC comments</a> back in October. Moreover, he said post-launch development on Kirby Air Riders would end soon as the development team planned to disband.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">the 1.3.0 patch</a> is such a pleasant surprise. It dropped on 26th January and added several big new features to the game, with GameShare, a Grand Prix mode, and online matchmaking for two local players being the biggest additions.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/">GameShare feature</a> has been a strange one so far, with the game giant and some third-party developers adding it to some multiplayer-oriented games and skipping others. It essentially allows Switch 2 owners to "share" their game with other Switch systems close by or via GameChat (though there are restrictions for Switch 1 players who are limited to local GameShare). Casual racers are typically go-to games for local play, so Kirby Air Riders getting this extra is a welcome addition.</p><p>The Grand Prix mode is exactly what you think it is, but a bit of a bigger deal for Kirby Air Riders, since the game's regular racers are characterized by how blazing fast they are. A longer "match" that chains a bunch of them together is a great way to allow players to go sweatier and develop rivalries with random racers. Similarly, online play is also gaining a boost by allowing two local players to queue up for quick matches; hopefully, other online modes will be supported at a later date.</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">patch notes</a> are rather substantial and include many balance adjustments and fixes, with the market, customisation, and the central-show City Trial mode receiving the most love after the aforementioned additions.</p>

<p>Fur real</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Raptor Claw's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron">FUR Squadron</a> rather proudly wore its <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations on its sleeve when it flew onto Switch back in 2023, and its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fur_squadron_phoenix">FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>, isn't shying away from things either.</p>
<p>This on-rails space shooter arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>25th February</strong>, and it looks every bit as McCloud-ian as we'd hoped. There's a crew of fluffy pilots, nimble space ships, an interplanetary "system" under threat from an evil force — yeah, this is Star Fox.</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, however, there's a certain psychedelic sheen over the whole thing that stops FUR Squadron from feeling like a complete retread of things we've seen before. With neon visuals, CRT scan lines and mech battles (!!), there's a pretty intriguing vibe under all of the familiarity.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A roguelite campaign where every run reshuffles the levels, keeping the action fresh and unpredictable.<br>
- Upgradeable ships, unlockable weapons, and skill trees that let you craft your own path to becoming an ace pilot.<br>
- Massive bosses, dynamic environments, and intense battles across space, air, and sea.<br>
- A dazzling arsenal: unleash power beams, multi-missile barrages, and even a nuke strike. Forget the basics—this is war with style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raptor Claw claimed that the game was heading to Switch 2 last year, shortly after the console's first tease reveal, and while it will certainly be playable on the new system, Switch 1 owners won't miss out. Based on the studio's reply to a comment on the above trailer, FUR Squadron Phoenix has been designed for Switch 1, but will see "boosted performance" on the new hardware.</p>
<p>With Nintendo showing no sign of releasing a new Star Fox game anytime soon, we'll be relying on projects like this to fill the Lylat-shaped hole in our hearts.</p>

Reader, I am about to venture into that terrible ninth circle of videogame journalist cringe known as pitching your own game in an article. A while ago, I <a href="https://x.com/dirigiblebill/status/1501695516035403780">mused aloud on Xitter</a> that a Batman game (or offbrand spiritual homage) from the perspective of people trying to commit petty crimes in Gotham City would be Interesting and/or Countercultural.</p>
<p>You could portray Batman himself as both a lone vigilante and a pervasive environmental factor - a morbid, hallucinatory tendency of the architecture itself, gradually provoked and intensified by tiny acts of larceny and vandalism. Kind of like the Eye of Sauron, but it’s the Bat Signal, and instead of fighting the urge to wear the Ring, you’re stealing candy bars and writing on toilet walls.

<p>
The above “Batman but it’s the pedestrian POV” video from Gaming with Griff Griffin – disclosure, he’s an old colleague of mine from my time at Future Publishing in the early 2010s – isn’t really what I’m talking about. It shows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> from the perspective of random civilians, spectating on fights (with the usual slowmo) or watching the Caped Misbehaver glide and zipline through the cloudy night.</p><p>Still, it’s close enough to my Twitter concept that I’m going to sue the pants off Griffin. Or burst through his window in a latex suit and delete all his browser tabs… then open and close the browser again so that he can’t restore his previous webpages. With any luck, he’ll become the Joker and we can have a proper vendetta. It’s at least two years since I last had one of those.
</p>
<p>
The accompanying voiceover and editing elicit the quickfix reaction energy of TikTok and similar shortform video platforms. It works well enough, not least because Arkham Knight’s city is so sheeny, dirty and convincing. But it leaves me hankering for a longer video or write-up with fewer changes of POV - perhaps *ominous roll of thunder* a diary series like the ones we used to read on RPS before half the writing team got Thanos-snapped or rode off triumphantly into the sunset. I’m thinking of coverage akin to role-playing a peasant in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, treating it like a medieval life sim. But perhaps what I’m really thinking of, again, is a standalone game.
</p>
<p>
How would it feel, to be remotely anti-social and rebellious in a city prowled by Batman? You could lean into the Adam West absurdity of Bruce chasing after kids for sticking gum to park seats. Or you could give your character more of a backstory, and embrace pathos. Maybe you’re breaking into a pharmacy to get medicine for your mum. 
</p>
<p>
You could also use the format to play with the idea that Batman is, you know, kind of a big dirty fascist and one-man militia, deploying his billions to terrorise poor people who are always characterised as loudly dressed freaks or irredeemable hooligans in vests. You could investigate the idea that Batman is absolutely off his rocker, and that his derangement pervades the very stones and skies of Gotham City, sharpening the spires and filling the sewers with bats. You could play with the thought that we are all trapped in Batman’s dreadful dreams.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft have proposed a round of voluntary redundancies at their Paris headquarters, which could see as many as 200 jobs cut. These plans follow a major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations and restructuring</a> by the publishers last week, which came with a mandate demanding staff return to working in-office five days a week (an annual allowance of work-from-home days was part of that proposal). All of that understandably drew the ire of unions representing Ubisoft workers, with a number now having reportedly agreed to a three day-long strike next month. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">IGN</a> of the proposed Paris layoffs. If those cuts do see 200 jobs eliminated, that would affect around 18% of workers at Ubisoft HQ, whom IGN cite as currently numbering approximately 1100 in total.</p>
<p>"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the Ubisoft spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."</p>
<p>The union response to these layoff plans appears to have been swift, with French financial paper <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a> reporting this morning that all of the French unions representing Ubisoft workers have agreed to a three day-long strike set to run from February 10th to 12th. The five French unions - the Video Game Workers' Union (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, the CFE-CGC, the CGT, and Printemps écologique - are also reported to be reaching out to unions outside of France who represent Ubisoft workers in an effort to make sure the pushback isn't limited to a single country.</p><p>The Solidaires Informatique union previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">called for a half-day strike on January 22nd</a> as "an initial response to the absurdity of management decisions". "It is out of the question to let a boss run rampant and destroy our working conditions,” they wrote at the time, in comments addressed to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. "Perhaps he needs to be reminded that it is his employees who make the games."</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.service-public.gouv.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F37509">Rupture Conventionnelle Collective</a> process requires any staff departures as part of it to be voluntary and subject to terms agreed upon by employees and unions, the question is what might happen if Ubisoft don't end up viewing it as having seen enough workers agree to give up their jobs. The answer in that case could well be regular old layoffs, as Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">recently inflicted</a> on The Division devs Massive and Ubisoft Stockholm after a voluntary redundancy scheme at the former reportedly didn't get rid of enough staff to satisfy Ubisoft management.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-streaming-ratings-down">Fallout Season 2</a> has been great fun so far, and it seems folks continue to tune in to find out what's next for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. Its ratings are positioning it as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">one of Prime Video's biggest seasons of TV ever</a>. Now, we've received word straight from Amazon MGM Studios that episodes 7 and 8 will drop a bit earlier to accommodate East and West Coast viewers.</p>
<p>The second season's penultimate episodes now premiere globally on Prime Video Tuesday, 27th January, at 6pmPT/9pmET. Next week, the Season 2 finale will be on the platform at the same time on Tuesday, 3rd February. That's a six-hour change to allow all American viewers to catch the episodes before bed time. As for us Europeans, these are still dropping in the middle of the night, which is, uh, not ideal.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news and the start of this season's final stretch, Amazon also shared a new poster featuring most of the show's key players, a menacing Deathclaw, and an all-new suit of NCR-inspired power armour that will surely get diehard fans talking.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-three-filming-starts-sooner-than-expected">Work on Season 3 is already underway</a> after an early renewal in late 2025, with Amazon, Kilter Films, and game developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bethesda-game-studios">Bethesda Game Studios</a> all interested in keeping the hit show going and moving as fast as possible. We've yet to see where the lead characters end up at the end of Season 2, which could determine the third season's central setting. The key plot threads (so far) suggest a return to the LA area at some point, but meanwhile, the show could explore more iconic regions of the post-Great War United States as first introduced in the RPG games.</p><p>We know for sure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-5-will-exist-in-a-world-where-the-stories-and-events-of-the-show-happened-or-are-happening-says-todd-howard">Bethesda will be acknowledging the show's world-shaking events</a> one way or another when Fallout 5 becomes a tangible reality, but with rumours of <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/bethesdas-todd-howard-says-we-are-doing-other-things-with-fallout-that-we-havent-announced-and-therell-come-a-time-for-that/">more projects being in development</a> (inside or outside Bethesda's core studio), chances are the Fallout universe will see a lot of changes and additions in the coming years.</p>
<p>For now, the live-action show is leading the creative charge by essentially acting as a sequel to all previous games in the franchise, and that thankfully isn't stopping it from being its own thing. Can we get more video game adaptations like this one, please?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Thrustmaster eSwap X2 H.E. Gaming Controller Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/thrustmaster-eswap-2-h-e-gaming-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>1417153</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While some manufacturers throw out older designs and emblazon their logo across a swathe of all-new devices and designs, iteration has become more powerful than revolution. You can look to products like the iPhone or Google’s Pixel line for design language and ideas that have shifted and developed, rather than being wholly replaced. That’s Thrustmaster’s approach with their eSwap range of controllers. These wired, modular PC and Xbox-centric controllers got so much right the first time around, that they’re fully committed to incremental improvements. That’s certainly the case with the eSwap X2 H.E. , a new, hall-effect-equipped version that retains all of the eSwap’s previous strengths while upgrading the sticks. It once again places the eSwap at the top of our favourite wired controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hall Effect H.E.A.R.T. explanation | Thrustmaster" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4hfhoz4pG1s?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The eSwap X2 H.E. is a thoroughbred pro controller. The wired USB connection ensures the lowest latency, while there are four additional ‘pro’ inputs on the back that you can customise as you see fit. It’s the Hall Effect sticks though that are the headline feature, boasting much improved longevity and accuracy over the previous potentiometer sticks.</p>


<p>Calling the Eswap X2 H.E.’s build quality ‘bombproof’ is something of assurance of how well-built it is, short of actually attaching it to some sort of explosive. This is the third iteration of the eSwap that we’ve covered, and each of them continues to serve faithfully, no matter how many hours of Overwatch 2 we put into them.</p>
<p>The eSwap X2 H.E. is crafted from sturdy black plastic, weighing in at a hand-friendly 300g. Thanks to the lack of an internal battery, it easily undercuts devices like Microsoft’s Elite Pro 2 at 345g, while still maintaining enough heft and firmness to feel like a premium device.</p>


<p>There’s no textured plastics to help with grip, but two rubberised pads down either of the controller’s arms provide some extra purchase. The key to how the eSwap X2 H.E. feels is the swappable modules, which let you switch from asymmetrical to symmetrical stick layouts, buy additional modules to turn it into a competent fight pad, or even a diminutive steering wheel.</p>
<p>Each module is held in by strong magnets, but they’re easy enough to pull out whenever you need to do it. In fact, it’s pretty moreish to do so, and I find myself treating the eSwap range like some kind of fidget toy, removing and moving the modules while waiting for things to download or update. This is the third iteration I’ve reviewed, and no matter how many times you mess with them, they just keep on going. They are incredibly well built, and the eSwap X2 H.E. continues that.</p>
<p>The Hall Effect stick units are the key point of improvement here, and they feel very good indeed. I prefer the feel of Thrustmaster’s Hall Effect sticks over the previous Potentiometer versions, and they give a perfect response via HardwareTester.com. The longevity for Hall Effect sticks is far higher, and they shouldn’t ever develop the dreaded stick drift. The industry is beginning to view TMR sticks as the next iterative step for gaming controllers, but Hall Effect’s reliability and tried and tested tech will make the eSwap 2 H.E. a long-term gaming companion.</p>

<p>It’s a shame not to also find Hall Effect analogue triggers round the back, with the added reliability and precision that would have brought, but there are two ways you can tailor them to your playstyle. Firstly, there’s physical lockouts that reduce the trigger travel, making them fast and easy to activate. While playing another heap of Overwatch 2 this is tech that now feels essential, and I really don’t enjoy using controllers that don’t have this feature.</p>
<p>The other key to customising the trigger response lies in the ThrustmasterX software. Available for PC, Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, you can dig into all aspects of your controller setup, including the trigger activation point, as well as the Hall Effect sticks’ deadzone and sensitivity and your button mapping.</p>
<p>The four ‘pro’ inputs are obviously amongst the buttons you can customise, and the eSwap’s inputs definitely set it apart from the competition. There are four circular buttons, incrementally raised to sit beneath your fingers. The buttons are definitely smaller than most of the other rear pro inputs out there, but, for me, they sit really well beneath my middle and ring fingers. I could easily activate them precisely when they were needed, and I think they helped give me a much-needed edge in Overwatch 2. To be fair, I need all the help I can get.</p>

<p>The main face buttons are also here to make you as fast as possible. The four face buttons and the D-pad are all mechanical, giving an excellent click every time you press them, and reducing your response time further than ever before. That’s the resounding feel of the eSwap X2 H.E.. It feels lightning fast, rock-solid and reliable. It’s not flashy: there’s no RGB, no OLED screens, and it doesn’t even have a wireless option. It’s just an excellent, well-made controller.</p>
<p>Therein lies its strength, but you do have to wonder if we couldn’t have expected more from this version. Wireless and Bluetooth connection options would definitely make sense at this point, as would an enhanced package with case, different D-pad tops and perhaps other modules included. It feels like Thrustmaster are in a holding pattern with this release, rather than keeping pace with the competition.</p>
<p>At £139.99, the eSwap X2 H.E. is certainly a premium wired option. There’s a couple of competitors in the modular space though, with the first being Turtle Beach’s Stealth Pivot at £119.99, which has rotatable sections that perform a similar function to the eSwap’s units. However, the sticks are much shorter, and the body of the controller just isn’t as comfortable as the eSwap. That said, it gains both wireless and Bluetooth functionality.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there’s also the Victrix Pro BFG, which is a good deal more expensive at £179.99, but you also get the six-button fightpad module included in the box, as well as both wireless and wired connections. Swapping your units around is a little more complicated, needing the included square screwdriver to remove them, but it’s a much more generous package overall.</p>
<p>If you’ve got any of the previous versions of the eSwap controller, though, you can simply buy the new eSwap Hall Effect modules for a very reasonable £24.99, with two different heights available to tailor your setup even further. This has to be one of the most consumer-friendly approaches in the peripheral market, and one which puts Thrustmaster at a clear advantage. More of this sort of thing, please.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The free-to-play PvP 'raid shooter' <strong>Highguard</strong> was released yesterday on PC and consoles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as covered in our previous article</a>. Right away, it reached a peak of around <strong>97K concurrent players</strong> on <strong>Steam</strong>, though that's not so big considering that the game is free. Perhaps the poor reception <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when the game was unveiled at <strong>Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, as the final trailer of that show, played a part.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ultimately-we-could-have-made-a-different-trailer-highguard-ceo-responds-to-that-poorly-received-game-awards-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In an interview with PC Gamer</a>, Wildlight Entertainment CEO and founder Dusty Welch acknowledged that it was the team's responsibility to make a better trailer to show off their own game:</p>



<p><em>Look, I wish Highguard had been received better. I wish the feedback had been better. Part of that's on us, right? We didn't put our heads in the sand. We, as a team, saw the feedback. We're gamers ourselves. We're online ourselves reading the feedback.</em></p>



<p><em>I think, ultimately, we could have made a different trailer—a better trailer that wasn't about entertaining, which is what we think The Game Awards was about. We could have made something that did a better job of highlighting the unique loop of the game. So that's on us. We take that, but the team is resilient.</em></p>



<p>The development team has a far bigger issue than the trailer, though. Now that the game is out, <strong>it's being ripped apart in user reviews on Steam</strong>, which are currently <strong>'Mostly Negative'</strong> with only around <strong>32%</strong> giving Highguard a thumbs up.</p>



<p>One of the most common criticisms is that <strong>the game map is way too large</strong>, especially in the current 3v3 format. Players believe teams should be at least 5v5, if not 10v10. Some users are also complaining about the game's PC optimization. The game runs on Unreal Engine 5, by the way.</p>



<p><strong>Highguard is definitely not off to a good start</strong>, that's for sure. However, <strong>we've seen live service games make comebacks before</strong>. It's tough, but if the developers work hard at it while following the community's feedback, it's doable. We'll keep an eye on future updates and revamps to see how it goes for this new game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Gets 18-Min Leon Gameplay; CAPCOM Confirms PS5 Pro Has RT and 120FPS Modes]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-leon-gameplay-ps5-pro-specs/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>CAPCOM</strong> has released a final <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong> media blast ahead of the game's planned launch in late February. Speaking <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2026/01/27/20260127-requiem-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with the Japanese PlayStation Blog</a>, CAPCOM Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> outlined the <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro modes</strong> that users equipped with the more powerful console will be able to choose from: <strong>ray tracing at 60 frames per second</strong> or <strong>up to 120 frames per second (with an average of 90 FPS) without ray tracing</strong>.</p>



<p><em>When playing on PS5 Pro, you can take advantage of the ray tracing on/off feature. When it's on, you can play at 4K output, 60fps, and full ray tracing. When it's off, those with a monitor that supports high frame rates can play at a maximum of 120fps, with an average of 90fps. We've spent a lot of time optimizing it.</em></p>



<p><em>What personally impressed me about the PS5 Pro was its high frame rate. You might be wondering if you can really tell the difference, but when you go back to 60fps, it still feels a bit lacking. The difference in the amount of information makes the world seem more persuasive.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, Nakanishi also mentioned how the developers of Resident Evil Requiem have utilized the unique <strong>DualSense controller features</strong> (haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and controller speaker) to augment the player's immersion.</p>



<p><em>We utilize these features to create a sense of horror. For example, if you get killed by a zombie, you'll end up getting bitten, and we made sure that you can feel the texture of your arm being grabbed and the sensation of being bitten in your hands holding the controller through haptic feedback.</em></p>



<p><em>Of course, the trigger weight when firing a gun also changes for each gun, thanks to the adaptive trigger. Reloading a gun also causes vibrations and a sound to be emitted from the controller's microphone. When solving puzzles by spinning a box containing jewels, the feeling of the jewels rattling inside is recreated through vibrations and sounds from the controller, making the game world feel even more realistic and immersive.</em></p>



<p>These should hopefully be available on PC as well when using the DualSense to play the game. </p>



<p>Lastly, YouTuber Punish has uploaded <strong>a new gameplay video of nearly eighteen minutes featuring Leon Kennedy</strong>, one of the game's two protagonists, who was kept secret (at least officially) <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">until last month</a>. You can find it embedded below.</p>

<p>Last weekend, Nintendo aired a special Direct presentation for its upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-release-date-cast-trailers-everything-we-know-so-far"><strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong></a>, which is due out in cinemas this April.</p>
<p>This particular clip focused on Mario's pal Yoshi, who will join the crew in this new adventure, which takes place across all sorts of familiar locations. To celebrate this big reveal, Nintendo and Illumination have now released a new promotional poster, and it looks absolutely stunning.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, here's a look. As you can see, it shows Mario actually riding Yoshi:</p>
<figure data-uuid="8c1b96029652a"><a title="The Super Mario Galaxy Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8c1b96029652a/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo, Illumination</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-a-new-movie-poster">promotional poster released in November</a> last year featuring Mario and Luigi in what appeared to be the Sand Kingdom from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. This looks to be the same location in the new trailer where Yoshi is discovered.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen the new trailer, be sure to check it out in our previous post. This latest update from Nintendo and Illumination also notes how the movie's release date has shifted "in the US and many additional markets globally" and is now releasing at the very beginning of April.</p>
