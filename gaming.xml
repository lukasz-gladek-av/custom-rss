                <p>Sega released a rather interesting trailer for Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5. It features a brief overview of the beat-'em-up action that the series is known for, as well as a few surprising additions--including a new online multiplayer mode called Red Light Raid. What's most interesting though is the hotline number near the end of the trailer.</p><p>Dialing the number 1-888-YAKUZA0 (1-888-925-8920) will take you to a weird automated system with a variety of options. For instance, it'll ask if you'd like to talk to speak with fan favorite Kazuma Kiryu by pressing 0. Doing so will get you different messages explaining why he can't come to the phone; either he just isn't around or he's in a "bind" because of a murder. The same goes if you try to talk with Goro Majima. That said, the system will still allow you to leave a message for ... someone? There are other options as well. These include placing a takeout order from Smile Burger--a real burger chain that also exists in the game. It won't work of course.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2nhjslX9as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U2nhjslX9as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yakuza 0 was originally released for the PS3/PS4 in Japan back in 2015. Since then, it’s been successfully re-released on various consoles. This marks the first time, however, that Yakuza 0 has been given an upgrade of sorts. Players looking to relive the early days of Kiryu and Majima will be met with new never-before-released cutscenes. Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio also added the Red Light Raid, a new four-player cooperative mode. Players will be able to choose from 60 different characters and team up with friends (or randoms via online matchmaking) in hopes of completing challenging missions.</p><p>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut will seemingly be the best option for returning fans and newcomers alike. The new cutscenes will offer a deeper look into the lives of its protagonists while the Red Light Raid could be an exciting alternative to the game’s lengthy campaign. For those worried about how much it’ll cost in comparison to other Switch exclusives, don’t: Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut will retail for $50 when it releases alongside the Switch 2 on June 5.</p>

		<p>The first week of June is a big week for <em>Remap</em>, between quietly hoping that everyone wants us to keep doing this, while also preparing to head to Los Angeles for several long days and nights. I'm doing my best to avoid thinking about attending a wedding on Saturday, one likely to end late at night, before waking up ass early to catch a flight to Los Angeles. I can't even check into my hotel by the time I land, but will have to immediately scoot over for an appointment. SGF is always an odd event, because it's not always clear how many interviews I can book, but I'm sure I'll come away with something for y'all. And I know I do this sappy thing every year, but thank you for supporting us and getting us this far. I hope it's just one of many anniversaries to come.</p><p>-pk, who recommends that you double check your <em>Remap</em> membership to make sure the correct credit card is being charged</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>HOA</em> – I learned about Rob buying a house the same way you learned about Rob buying a house: live on last week's Remap Radio. But I get it. Buying a house is often full of disappointments, especially these days, because there are a million reasons for it to fall apart. Even Rob is hardly over the finish line here. Literally as I'm typing this he's at an inspection for the house. That stuff is scary!</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Remap's 2nd Anniversary</em> – Come join as we spend a day streaming  to celebrate making this adventure last two years! It feels like just yesterday that I learned I'd accidentally been laid off because an executive misread an organizational chart, but here we are, folks. We'll start in the morning and go until sometime late in the afternoon/early evening.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> – One of the first lines in Rob's opening to me this week is "let’s see how far we get in this before this turns out to be about aging or the Chicago Bears."</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – I'm heading to a all-encompassing family wedding this weekend, before heading to Los Angeles for a few days to cover Summer Game Fest, but we'll be together for Remap Radio before all that.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Summer Game Fest</em> – I'll be attending wedding festivities when this is all happening. (If I'm lucky enough to have a spare moment, I'll pop in!) But you can expect Rob and Chia, at least, to hold things down for Keighley's event.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

                <p>For the last couple of years, one of the go-to options for Xbox Series X|S users looking to expand the storage capacity of their console has been the Expansion Cards sold by Seagate. It looks like the company has a new 4TB memory card on the way, but don't expect it to be cheap. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Seagate+Releases+4TB+Xbox+Expansion+Card+And+It%27s+Very+Expensive&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-02+10%3A06%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-02+10%3A06%3A59&amp;fnarticle_id=6531989&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FEEV072&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fseagate-releases-4tb-xbox-expansion-card-and-its-very-expensive%2F1100-6531989%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy did have a listing up for it</a>--possibly too early, since it was quickly taken down--with a price of $430. Seagate hasn't officially confirmed the new Expansion Card yet, but with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Showcase scheduled for June 8</a>, we wouldn't be too surprised to see it formally revealed during the livestream.</p><p>Seagate usually sells <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB Expansion Cards</a>--the 512GB Expansion Cards seem to have been discontinued for a while now--and like its predecessors, the 4TB Expansion Card is a plug-and-play solution to upgrading your console storage. All you have to do is insert it into the dedicated port at the rear of your Xbox, and you're good to go.</p><h3>Seagate Xbox Series X|S Expansion Cards</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB</a> -- $220 (<del>$360</del>)</li></ul><h3>Western Digital Xbox Series X|S Expansion Cards</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">512GB</a> -- $96</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a> -- $150</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB</a> -- $250</li></ul><p>Even better, the Expansion Cards are compatible with Xbox's Velocity architecture--so you're still getting lightning-fast load times with your games--and if you have multiple consoles, you can easily transfer data over using this little drive.</p><p>The nice thing about these Expansion Cards is that you're getting <em>most </em>of the listed storage on the box. For example, the 1TB Seagate Expansion Card gives you 920GB of usable space to install games on, and in comparison, a 1TB Xbox Series X console only gives you 802GB of space to work with, as some of it has to be set aside for the system's OS. While we're not certain how much usable space you'll get with the 4TB Expansion Card, it should still be a lot.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Seagate has competition in this space from Western Digital. The company launched its C50 Expansion Card back in 2023, and it offers <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44B1VSH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">512GB</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0C44XVWCH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1TB</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Storage-Expansion-Card-WDBMPH0010BNC-WCSN/dp/B0DK74LG91?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2TB models</a>. Prices have come down substantially since these were first released, as the WD Black 2TB Expansion Card originally sold for $400, but it now retails for $250.</p>

And the first of those worlds, it now transpires, will be a familiar one to RPG fans; Wizards of the Coast has announced it's signed a deal with Giant Skull to create an "all-new, single-player action-adventure title set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons". Details are limited at this seemingly early juncture, but we do know it's in development for PC and console using Unreal Engine 5, with more information promised "at a later date".
</p>
<p>
"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen wrote in a statement accompanying today's announcement. "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace."
</p>
<p>
Giant Skull's new game is just one of a number of Dungeons &amp; Dragons titles confirmed to be in development over the last few years. Payday developer Starbreeze, for instance, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-and-dragons-game-in-the-works-from-payday-developer-starbreeze">working on a co-op live-service game</a> currently expected to release in 2026, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> studio Game Loft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-dungeons-and-dragons-game-on-the-way-from-disney-dreamlight-valley-team">developing a co-op adventure built around "real-time survival and action"</a>. And then there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dungeons-dragons-triple-a-unreal-engine-5-game-in-development">triple-A Unreal Engine 5 project from Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance developer Invoke Studios</a>, first announced back in 2022.
</p>
<p>
It's a busy time in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games, then, and amid all this, Wizards of the Coast's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">search for a new studio to take on the Baldur's Gate series</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">developer Larian's departure</a> seemingly continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/newest-edition-of-warhammer-horus-heresy-introduces-advanced-characteristics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced big changes for the newest edition of Warhammer: The Horus Heresy. This new edition, set in dark ages of the grimdark sci-fi world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, will be introducing new advanced characteristics to all of its units.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/fstxtjge/rules-in-the-age-of-darkness-how-do-advanced-characteristics-work/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop stated that all units in <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em> will be getting an expanded statline. That statline will contain three new Advanced Characteristics: Cool, Willpower, Intelligence, and Leadership. These stats may be familiar to those who played the original <em>Rogue Trader</em> back in the day or have played the recent edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/necromunda-hive-secundus-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Necromunda</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-advanced-characteristics-statsheet.jpg?itok=q8gXOkpy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-the-horus-heresy-advanced-characteristics-statsheet.jpg?itok=3cSPszby 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>How these advanced characteristics work in <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em> is simple. When called upon to make a check, the player rolls two dice. If the result is equal to or lower than the score, the unit is fine. If the result is higher, the unit suffers a penalty&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cool represents how the unit is calm under pressure. Intelligence refers to the unit interacting with technology. Willpower is used for manifesting or resisting psychic attacks. Lastly, Leadership represents the unit's receptiveness to orders. It is also used to determine rallied or panicking units.</p>

<p>There is some nuance to these new advanced characteristics. When these tests are made against a group of units, the unit with lowest score is used. The exceptions to this rule are Sergeants, who can make the test on behalf of their unit, and Commanders which can lend their stats to any ability check.</p>

<p>The post includes a look at the revised statlines for some <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em> units. It shows certain tactical squad units having advanced characteristics around 7-8. Given the median of rolling 2d6 is around 7, these units are on a razor's edge.</p>

<p>By comparison, named units like the Space Marine Primarch Vulkan have advanced statistics exceeding 10. Unless there are some penalties to dice rolls, they'll be fine.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there is no concrete release date for the newest edition of <em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em>.</p>

In our review of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet at launch, we noted that the fps was really just one issue of many. At the time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">Scarlet and Violet were riddled with bugs</a> ranging from harmless visual goofiness to game crashing, and features such as raid battles seemed to be broken by design. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-the-indigo-disk-dlc-review">Multiple DLC releases</a> didn't alleviate most of those issues, either.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see how much of a difference a Nintendo Switch 2 makes to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet when the upgrade patch releases on June 5 alongside the console.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/one-elden-right-nightreign-player-got-their-solo-nightlord-clears-in-before-the-nerf-heres-how<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> Patch 1.01.1 is live now, taking aim at the single-player experience to hopefully ease up the difficulty on those trying to clear the new FromSoftware game by themselves. One player, however, decided not to wait, and cleared every Nightlord solo before the patch made anything easier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Single-player difficulty in Elden Ring Nightreign has been one of the new game's hot topics, post-launch. Players have expressed frustration over how difficult running the game solo compared to trios has felt. Here's a bit of what our Elden Ring Nightreign review here at IGN had to say about it:</p><blockquote>"None of this is to say that solo play is outright impossible, and I <em>have</em> had a few successful runs on my own. Just that the balancing of solo play feels like a job half finished, and as a result, the frustration of playing alone wasn’t worth the triumph for me to have any desire to play more without a squad."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this built up to Bandai Namco and FromSoftware announcing a patch, arriving today, that took aim at easing the burden of solo players. For many, this might be a welcome relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the r/Nightreign subreddit, though, user "Valseran" <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l15x4o/managed_to_solo_all_nightlords_before_the_nerf/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted evidence of their solo clears</a> of each Nightlord, from the game's starting expedition to its final boss. Their reasoning? "Wanted to rush them down before the nerf."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's certainly an achievement. I'd heard tell of other players clearing big chunks of the game solo, and some, like YouTuber Ongbal, have been posting their solo victories against specific Nightreign bosses. Still, Valseran's effort to clear everything they could before the patch closed in is both impressive and fitting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see the clear times on the right-hand side, showing them advancing steadily and clearing bosses in the days ahead of the update, like they're outrunning the impending storm of the patch. These bragging rights were earned largely by Ironeye wins it seems, with the Duchess and Executor characters making cameo appearances early on. Thankfully, we don't have to intuit too much from just one screenshot alone, as Valseran went into further detail about their victory within the comments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Don't worry too much about getting a good bow so much as stacking weapon passives in your other slots," said Valseran, when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l15x4o/comment/mviszqy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about tips for Ironeye</a>. "Ranged dmg, dmg while Two-handing, and dmg while at full health can all stack and really cause your damage output to get absurd. Any purple quality bow will shine with some decent passives. Also his dash ability is great dmg output but i tend to save it as a dodge when i know an attack thats difficult to roll is on the way, I tend to use his Art for the same reason against bosses, more for the invulnerability than the damage."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Valseran primarily ran Ironeye, the ranged archer among the Nightfarers, they did say they prefer melee on some bosses, and even ran melee weapons <em>as </em>Ironeye on a few. Some bosses, though, are "just a nightmare solo" without ranged attacks, according to the lone wolf archer. They also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l15x4o/comment/mvjcusa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rank the final boss as the hardest</a>, but say they died to the centaur boss (Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow) the most.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extra lives also seem to be a big priority, which makes sense; without teammates to pick you up, you'd like to have a safety net or two. Valseran said they would prioritize acquiring the extra lives from merchants, and also some field bosses would also drop them depending on the expedition. "One of my boss fights i went in with 4 extra lives," said Valseran. "But at the very least, always get one early."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An extra life during boss fights is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1011-nerfs-solo-mode-difficulty-fixes-bugs-and-makes-more-balance-changes">one of the ways FromSoftware is handing solo players a helping hand with Patch 1.01.1</a>. The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat," which allows revival during a night boss battle once per night, has been added to solo expeditions, effectively handing players a free second life. Valseran did say they think the extra life will be "kinda substantial" in solo play. Since stacking them is already ideal for single-player, having a free one is a nice bonus.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the single-player Nightfarers might have an easier time with clearing some of the more challenging fights in Elden Ring Nightreign, at least one player has earned some significant bragging rights. For everyone else, Elden Ring Nightreign is out now, with a slightly easier burden to bear for the lone wolves, and waiting for more Nightfarers to attempt to clear its challenges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Nightreign tips and tricks</a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides">all the eight Nightlord Bosses</a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes">Nightfarer Classes</a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant">How to Unlock the Revenant</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess">How to Unlock the Duchess</a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters">How to Change Characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Players are currently putting the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 9 through its paces on the game's test server, and they've discovered a new combination of seasonal powers that will make it so every class can teleport a near-infinite amount of times.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">Diablo 4 Season 9, Sins of the Horadrim, will let players craft their own spells</a> by combining components like Catalysts, Infusions, and Arcana together. One such spell essentially teleports players to nearby enemies. While that doesn't sound too overpowered on the surface, it's actually a game-changer.</p><p dir="ltr">Using Propulsion as a Catalyst, which generates a large area-of-effect blast, players can then combine it with the Floaty Bobble Arcana to add a teleport effect. Finally, adding in the Bloody Charm Arcana makes it so enemies with less than 20% life hit by the blast are executed and reset the ability.</p><p dir="ltr">That essentially makes it so that as long as there are enemies nearby that will be killed by the blast, players can teleport forever. The spell will be especially powerful for speed-farming activities like Nightmare dungeons or The Pit, where enemies are clustered together. As shown in a video by Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNaVLls95NA&amp;t=135s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rob2628</a>, the teleport spell becomes even more powerful when paired with a controller and its auto-aiming functionality, which lets players snap to enemies even faster.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's absolutely crazy how fast you can go with this," Rob2628 says in the video.</p><p dir="ltr">Since this teleport trick is currently only on the Diablo 4 Season 9 public test realm, it's currently unclear if it will make its way into the release version of Season 9 or if Blizzard will adjust Arcana like the Floaty Bobble and Bloody Charm to make the overall spell less powerful. However, nerfing the Arcana that make it possible will also nerf other potential spells players could create, making for a tricky balancing act for Blizzard to walk.</p><p dir="ltr">Players on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1l0bp4w/new_teleport_tech_from_s9_powers_is_going_to/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/season-9s-new-teleport-trick-lets-every-class-speed-farm-in-diablo-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Diablo 4 subreddit</a>, at least, don't seem to think the spell will go unchanged, with many top comments making clear that the "fun police" aka Blizzard will put an end to it before Season 9 goes live. For now, players will have to wait and see.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 is scheduled to arrive July 1. The game's currently live <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-patch-notes-introduce-endgame-boss-overhaul/1100-6531150/" data-ref-id="1100-6531150">Season 8 brought major endgame boss changes</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">limited-time Berserk crossover</a>.

			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/split-fiction-amazon-mgm-studios-in-talks-acquire-sydney-sweeney-1236420431/">Deadline</a>, Amazon MGM Studios has won the bidding war to make the Split Fiction movie adaptation that is set to star Sydney Sweeney and be directed by Wicked's Jon M. Chu. Deadline reports that the deal with Amazon MGM Studios is currently being finalized, and that the whole deal is coming together for a little over $2 million USD.</p>
<p>Reports of a Split Fiction movie happening first appeared during <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-video-game-adaptation-1236344367/">GDC 2025,</a> where Deadline points out a bidding war had begun between studios, with Sony, Amazon MGM Studios, and others throwing their hat in the ring to try and sign the project. The following month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/">we learned that Sweeney and Chu had joined the project,</a> with Sweeney set to play one of the lead characters, and Deadpool &amp; Wolverine writers, Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, set to pen the script.</p>
<p>Now, Amazon MGM Studios has seemingly come out on top, which means that both adaptations of Hazelight's biggest games, It Takes Two and Split Fiction, are being made under Amazon MGM Studios.</p>
<p>When Sweeney's involvement in the Split Fiction adaptation was announced, it was the second video game-to-film adaptation she was confirmed to be involved in that week. She has also teamed up with Michael Bay to produce a<a href="https://wccftech.com/michael-bay-and-sydney-sweeney-have-reportedly-teamed-up-with-universal-to-make-a-film-adaptation-of-segas-out-run/"> film based on SEGA's Out Run</a>, though as it currently stands, there's no word that she will act in the movie as well.</p>
<p>Split Fiction had a "<em>hugely successful launch</em>" <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/">according to EA</a>, having sold nearly 4 million copies from its release in March to the beginning of May. It still has a long way to go to reach It Takes Two's incredible<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fco-op%2Fit-takes-two-sold-over-20-million-copies-and-won-goty-but-hazelights-josef-fares-says-all-the-numbers-looked-really-really-bad-before-the-co-op-studio-became-this-really-big-developer%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=ab11413a772246e29f01a48816e64440&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D"> 20 million copies sold milestone</a>, but it's definitely on the path to hitting that same marker, and a film with two of the most popular creatives in Hollywood right now certainly won't hurt its chances of becoming Hazelight's second game to surpass 20 million copies sold.</p>

            <p>
Hitman developer Io Interactive's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-james-bond-game-project-007-is-coming-from-the-makers-of-hitman">James Bond game</a> has been reannounced with a proper title, 007 First Light. It also has some new key art, which confirms some important Facts: unlike Hitman's depthless master mimic Agent 47, James Bond has hair, formed into a neat side-parting by the passage of a narrowly escaped bullet. He also has ears, a high-collared leather jacket, and a gun. 
</p>
<p>
Or what looks like a gun. He could be just doing a finger pistol to fake us out. I do not trust this particular James Bond. He is, after all, a cousin of Agent 47, that barcode-blazoned Fury peering out of every mirror. Io Interactive's James Bond doesn't even have a face right now. The face is hopefully forthcoming in the world premiere later this week during Summer Game Fest 2025, along with James Bond's legs and feet. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Why no, I'm not padding out a nothingburger of a news story. I'm just artfully buying James Bond time to circle behind you and karate chop you in the neck. Let these be the final words you ever read: the world premiere will include "never-before-seen footage". Who knows, I might be at SGF in person to check it out.
</p>
<p>
Here is what little we know about Io Interactive's Bond game so far. It's a prequel story, as suggested by the marketing catchphrase "earn the number", featuring a brand new 007 who is not based on any of the movie ones. No fear of a Brosnan/Moore turf war in the comments, then.</p>
<p>Io are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/io-interactives-james-bond-game-will-be-an-origin-story-with-its-own-007">"rediscovering new sides of the agent fantasy with James Bond"</a>. The translation here could be: "we're trying to work out how to do stealth in a gameworld where we're contractually forbidden from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hitmans-humour-evolved-because-of-47s-penchant-for-disguises">murdering chefs with homing briefcases while dressed as a clown</a>". I feel like the easiest way to square that circle would be to make a Bond game in the tradition of the older Bond films, less the sexism. Go back to Bond at its daftest and most gadget-driven, long before Daniel Craig rolled up with his bulletproof glower. Agent 47 would have done well in that era.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-showcased-state-of-unreal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A first in-engine look at the highly anticipated The Witcher IV could be coming during tomorrow's State of Unreal 2025 presentation.</p>
<p>Today, CD Projekt Red confirmed on <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> that the studio will showcase some of the innovative technology and features that will power the next entry in the series and beyond during tomorrow's State of Unreal 2025 presentation. As images, or footage, in this case, speak louder than words, there's a very good chance we will get a first in-engine look at the game to showcase some of these features better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We'll be coming together with <a href="https://twitter.com/UnrealEngine?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@UnrealEngine</a> to present during the State of Unreal.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to showcasing some of the innovative technology &amp; features that will power The Witcher 4, and beyond.</p>
<p>Join us at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnrealFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnrealFest</a> — 9:30 AM ET | 3:30 PM CEST on June 3:… <a href="https://t.co/IfrdVM539I">pic.twitter.com/IfrdVM539I</a></p>
<p>— The Witcher (@thewitcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/thewitcher/status/1929538495355494826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As most PC players are painfully aware, the vast majority of games powered by Unreal Engine 5 are plagued by stuttering issues, which newer versions of the engine are attempting to mitigate but seem far from completely solving. CD Projekt Red is well aware of these issues as well, as detailed in a presentation from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-stuttering-fix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>, so there's the possibility that some of the innovative technology to be showcased tomorrow could have something to do with addressing what has become the biggest issue in PC gaming in the past few years.</p>
<p>Though the first in-engine look at The Witcher IV may not be too far off, it will be a while until we will be able to play the game. Earlier this year, CD Projekt Red confirmed it won't launch until <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/">at least 2027</a>, so it will take a few years to see how the developer will manage to convince players that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-challenge-ciri-important-geralt/">Ciri is as important as Geralt</a> in the series' universe, something that those who read the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski already know well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>IO Interactive has finally revealed its upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game, which will officially be titled&nbsp;<em>007 First Light</em>,&nbsp;and more information is coming later this week.</p>

<p>The game's name and artwork were revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> earlier today, and although there's not much to go on, it's nice to know that IO is still working on the game, given how long it's been since the initial announcement.</p>

<p><em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be an origin story for Bond, detailing how he earned his 007 designation. In case you need a reminder, in the world of Bond, the 007 classification grants whichever agent carries it a license to kill in the field.</p>

<p>We don't yet know where&nbsp;<em>First Light&nbsp;</em>will be set, nor do we know much about the gameplay, although given that it's IO Interactive on development duties, we can assume it'll at least be a little similar to the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>It's been quite some time since&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>was first teased. We first got wind of IO's intent to make a&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/developers-of-hitman-franchise-are-making-james-bond-game" rel="nofollow">all the way back in late 2020</a>, and with not much info coming between then and now, you'd have been forgiven for thinking the game had been quietly canned.</p>

<p>That is, until July 2023, when IO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-new-studio" rel="nofollow">opened up a new studio in the UK</a>. At that point, it was also confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Project 007</em>, as it was then known, was still in development, along with something known as&nbsp;<em>Project Fantasy</em>&nbsp;(which still hasn't officially been revealed).</p>

In October last year, it was revealed that the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-publishing-ex-rockstar-thriller" rel="nofollow">would be publishing&nbsp;<em>MindsEye</em></a>, the upcoming action-adventure game from ex-Rockstar head Leslie Benzies.</p>

<p>More info on&nbsp;<em>007 First Light&nbsp;</em>is coming later this week, so stay tuned for that as soon as we get it.</p>

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian now off doing their own thing and making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-larian-discuss-making-two-new-games-at-once-in-practice-we-will-probably-be-miserable">multiple games that aren't Baldur's Gate 4</a>, BG IP owners Wizards of the Coast have just revealed something that might help fill that void. They've agreed to a publishing deal that'll see relatively new studio Giant Skull create a new game set in the D&amp;D universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/respawn-veteran-stig-asmussen-forms-giant-skull-to-build-aaa-single-player-games">Giant Skull</a> were founded by Stig Asmussen, director of stuff like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and God of War 3, back in March 2024, and said way back then that it'd be aiming to make "gameplay-driven, story-immersed action-adventure games".</p>
<p>Well, they get points for sticking to that goal thus far. This WotC-published game they're working on (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/wizards-of-the-coast-and-giant-skull-announce-original-dungeons-dragons-action-adventure-game-for-consoles-pc">Gematsu</a>) is an "all-new, single-player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> title set in the world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons" that'll be coming to console and PC at some point between now and the end of time.</p>
<p>"Our talented and experienced team at Giant Skull is built on creativity and curiosity," Asmussen said in a press release, "Our goal is to craft a rich new Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe filled with immersive storytelling, heroic combat and exhilarating traversal that players will fully embrace.”</p>
<p>"In our time working together on God of War I got to see firsthand Stig’s artistry and expertise, and he and the Giant Skull team are the perfect fit for our new game," added Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro digital gaming president John Hight, "Worldbuilding and storytelling is in our DNA, and this collaboration reflects our evolution and commitment to our Playing to Win Strategy, building a stronger presence in digital play. We look forward to revealing more about this brand-new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game in the future."</p>
<p>So, concrete details about the game and what it'll end up looking like are pretty scarce right now - as you'd expect for a thing that's only just tied the publishing knot. There's no indication of how it may or may not be tied to the BG games we've already gotten, or whether any of the characters BG3 famously inspired War and Peace-length fanfictions about will star in it.</p>
<p>Given the fact it hasn't been declared <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">an RPG</a>, it could well turn out to have very little in common with BG3, aside from the obvious D&amp;D connection. We'll just have to wait, ponder our orbs like those coastal wizards, and see.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
