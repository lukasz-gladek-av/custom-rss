While we were all set for showcases from Summer Game Fest on Friday and Xbox on Sunday, this is a surprise (but a welcome one). Sony's involvement in the yearly rush of summer showcases has been up in the air since it backed out of E3 in 2019, and now all the major players are accounted for (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/here-are-the-retailers-selling-nintendo-switch-2-on-launch-day-without-preorders">save Nintendo, but it has plans of its own this week</a>).</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVBLJYjSAhg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The showcase will air at 2 PM PT/5 PM ET and will include "news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">according to the PS Blog</a>. It will be available to watch on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PlayStation">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation">Twitch</a>.</p><p>Aside from that, we don't have any specific details on the games to be featured, but given the time of year, it's fair to assume we'll see some big titles from Sony's upcoming catalogue. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-set-for-october-collectors-edition-revealed">Ghost of Yōtei, which launches this October</a>, is perhaps the most obvious candidate, but there are other PlayStation studios we haven't heard from in a while, including Insomniac, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">which is working on a Wolverine game</a>, and Sony Santa Monica, which we haven't heard much from since <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/opinion/2023/12/13/god-of-war-ragnaroks-valhalla-is-so-much-more-than-just-a-roguelite-dlc">God of War Ragnarök's Valhalla DLC</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To catch the rest of the summer showcases live, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/26/the-2025-summer-showcase-schedule" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c895c5c0-7239-4e3c-ac2b-a4d3d1713a08" data-entity-substitution="canonical">check out our big 2025 livestream schedule</a>, giving times for everything from Summer Game Fest to the Wholesome Direct.</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to see from this showcase?

            <p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera</a>: Zau, has revealed its next game, which will be published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a>'s Pocketpair.</p>
<p>In a change of tone, Dead Take is a horror game about "power and corruption in the entertainment industry", and promises to have a star-studded cast, though few details are yet known.</p>
<p>"We're being secretive for a reason," said Abubakar Salim, CEO of Surgent Studios. "The subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this'."</p>

<p>A teaser trailer (see above) has been released for the first-person psychological horror game, though it's all quite abstract for now.</p>
<p>Dead Take is set for release later this year, on PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Back in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-maker-pocketpair-to-publish-tales-of-kenzera-studios-next-game">Surgent and Pocketpair revealed their new partnership</a> on what was then an unknown horror game. Pocketpair Publishing is the company's new publishing wing following its success with Palworld.</p>
<p>Dead Take isn't the only game Surgent is working on, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">The studio also has Project Uso</a> (the Swahili word for 'face'), which will be an Afrofuturist gothic-horror RPG.</p>
<p>Both games will follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-review">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, a metroidvania released last year with a distinct setting based on African folklore and exploring themes of grief. The game recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">won the Game Beyond Entertainment award at this year's BAFTA Games Awards</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/40-minute-playstation-state-of-play-announced-for-tomorrow/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has announced a new State of Play event for tomorrow, June 4, 2025, at 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT / 11pm CEST, that will be more than 40 minutes long and feature "<em>news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe</em>."</p>
<p>The news was announced with a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">PlayStation Blog</a>, as these kinds of events always are now, with nothing more than the short description quoted above to give a very opaque, general idea as to what players will see at the show.</p>
<p>It's the first big game-announcements-focused show of the week ahead of the big Summer Game Fest 2025 kick-off show, which technically makes it the real kick-off event of this announcements-driven week that we're about to have.</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | June 4, 2025 [English]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bYaEtALe00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As far as what we'll see, the news of this showcase makes the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9 reveal rumors</a> feel all the more possible, as we've previously seen major Resident Evil games, like Resident Evil Village, get their reveal during a PlayStation event.&nbsp;Another game to look out for is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, which is still without a release date, but is due to get a release date soon after the<a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-shown-in-gorgeous-new-year-of-the-snake-gameplay-trailer/"> gameplay trailer we saw earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>Also, it's a State of Play event, which doesn't always feature first-party PlayStation games, but it wouldn't be too outlandish to expect to see <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/">Ghost of Yotei</a> once more, or even just the news that a specialized Ghost of Yotei event is coming ahead of that game's launch in October. We'll have to see what tomorrow holds.</p>

There’s likely going to be a lot of news from the show; the company’s Unreal Engine is used as part of making many of the world’s biggest video games and entertainment, and <em>Fortnite</em> is still a huge game that’s getting new experiences all the time thanks to the Unreal Editor for Fortnite.</p><p>At the show, Epic will be hosting its annual State of Unreal keynote, which will begin at 9:30AM ET on June 3rd. The company hasn’t said much about what will be announced, but it’s promising that it will “share what’s next for Unreal Engine and the Epic ecosystem.”</p><p>The show also follows the major ruling in <em>Epic Games v. Apple</em> that blew up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">Apple’s control of the App Store</a>, and it seems likely that Epic CEO Tim Sweeney might have something to say about it.</p><p>Here’s our coverage from the event.</p></section><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6Njc4NDYz" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo">Epic showed off Unreal Engine 5 with an impressive Witcher 4 tech demo</a></h2><div><p>An ongoing tradition at Epic’s big keynotes is a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273832/epic-unreal-engine-demo-troll-rebirth-ray-tracing-gdc-2019">gorgeous</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256079/epic-unreal-engine-5-playstation-5-demo-next-gen-graphics-release-date">tech demo </a>that shows off what its game engine is capable of. For this year’s State of Unreal, the company turned to <em>The Witcher</em> and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt Red. This new demo a beautiful glimpse at its fantasy world, filled with blood, fire, and monsters — and more importantly, a new horse.</p><p>The demo was built using Unreal Engine 5.6, and shows new protagonist Ciri exploring some forested lands and a marketplace known as Valdrest. Epic says the demo is designed in part to show off how the latest iteration can handle both bustling scenes and foliage in an open-world setting. It also shows how much horse technology has improved since <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Epic says that the demo is running on a base model PS5 at 60 frames per second, with raytracing enabled, and the presentation included a live demonstration, with the developers playing the game on stage.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>A Ciri-ously good start.</p><p>Things kicked off with a beautiful tech demo for <em>The Witcher 4</em>.

            <p>Good news, people who've been struggling to form the perfect <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-best-character-tier-list">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> trifecta and don't fancy taking on the task of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-update-fixes-a-graphics-problem-and-makes-the-rpg-easier-in-single-player">battering Nightlords solo</a>. FromSoft have now confirmed that duo expeditions will be coming to the game later this year, as part of post-launch plans which also include "enhanced" fights against existing bosses.</p>
<p>"The Night is far from over," the studio <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096">tweeted today</a> as it celebrated 3.5 million players having hopped in so far, "In addition to the DLC releasing later this year, new additions will be gradually implemented, including enhanced fights against existing Nightlords starting this month, as well as Duo Expeditions at a later date. Thank you for your support."</p>
<p>So, no concrete dates yet, but at least you know that duos-centric post-launch support the game's director had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/couples-afraid-of-being-third-wheeled-rejoice-fromsoftware-might-add-in-a-duos-option-to-elden-ring-nightreign">previously hinted at</a> has now been locked in, alongside some other goodies. I mean, you can't really go wrong giving Fromsoft lovers another excuse to batter some big baddies, even if they've battered said baddies before.</p>
<p>Until these additions start to drop, those on PC do have the option of using mods to play as a terrifying twosome, with Seamless Co-Op maestro Yui having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/while-you-wait-for-an-official-update-elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod">whipped out a duos mod</a> quicker than the average <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-malenia-walkthrough">Malenia</a> attack.</p>
<p>Fromsoft may have chosen to focus on trios and lone fighters, but the people demand the chance to propose Nightreign as a date night option without having to link up with a third wheel. We'll see how those relationships fare if the studio opts to ratchet the difficulty up for duos, creating a test even tougher than having the in-laws over for tea and biscuits.</p>
<p>If you've not given Nightreign a go yet, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Nic's review of it</a>. Go on, you know you want to.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A console powerful enough for big cinematic games but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata-san before the launch but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day.”</p><p>Iwata passed away after more than a decade as the head of Nintendo in July 2015 from cancer, just two years prior to the launch of the original Switch. NES <em>Golf</em>, one of the first games he ever worked on, was hidden in the original hardware as a tribute to the executive and developer that would only unlock when the console date <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-is-still-oddly-tight-lipped-about-the-switch-s-1820050815&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-is-still-oddly-tight-lipped-about-the-switch-s-1820050815">was set to the day of his death</a></span>. Nintendo has been tight-lipped about that easter egg, and rarely reflects on its own legacy and the people who created it in a public setting, making Huang’s mention even more striking. </p><p>The Switch 2, like its predecessor, runs on a custom Nvidia chip. While the tech last time around was repurposed from smartphones, the processing unit this time around appears to cater much more closely to the needs of a gaming machine, with the inclusion of DLSS, variable refresh rate, and other processing techniques aimed at boosting performance and visual clarity even on moderate specs. “Switch 2 is more than a new console, it’s a new chapter worthy of Iwata-san’s vision,” Huang said. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Elden Ring developer From Software has announced that Nightreign will indeed add two-player co-op following the studio's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-doesnt-elden-ring-nightreign-have-two-player-co-op-the-reason-may-surprise-you/1100-6531760/" data-ref-id="1100-6531760">admission about overlooking this in development</a>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, From Software said it will add "Duo Expeditions" sometime down the road. On the more immediate horizon is the introduction of "enhanced fights with existing Nightlords" beginning this month. The developer did not provide any specifics on what it meant by "enhanced."</p><p>Nightreign is also getting unspecified DLC in the future as part of the game's ongoing support.</p><p>As for why Nightreign launched without two-player co-op, game director Junya Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the studio "overlooked" this possibility during development. "So we're very sorry about that," he said.</p><p>Ishizaki explained that Nightreign is balanced for people to play solo or with groups of three. With From Software spending so much time and attention trying to nail the experience for solo and three-player <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">co-op</a>, this meant two-player co-op wasn't considered.</p><p>"In putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect," Ishizaki said. Just this week, Nightreign received a patch that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-include-promised-improvements-for-solo-play/1100-6531974/" data-ref-id="1100-6531974">helped improve the experience for solo players</a>.</p><p>After five days, Nightreign has reached 3.5 million players, From Software announced. Big success was expected, given Elden Ring itself sold more than 30 million copies and had fans clamoring for more.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Nightreign, be sure to consult GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guides-hub/1100-6531889/" data-ref-id="1100-6531889">Nightreign guides hub</a>, in which we discuss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-you-need-to-know-before-you-play/2900-6611/" data-ref-id="2900-6611">top tips to know</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">how multiplayer works</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-skins-in-elden-ring-nightreign-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6614/" data-ref-id="2900-6614">how to unlock all the skins</a>, among other things.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Nightreign review</a> scored the game a 9/10.

                <p>Sony has announced the latest PlayStation State of Play presentation. Airing on June 4 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, the show will run for roughly 40 minutes and feature "news and updates" on a variety of as-of-now-undisclosed PS5 games.</p><p>The presentation will be available to stream on PlayStation's official <a href="http://play.st/twitch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="http://play.st/YouTube" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> channels.

Sony has a number of previously announced games in development at its first-party studios, including Marathon from Bungie and Saros from Housemarque. The next big PS5 exclusive is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which launches later this month.</p><p>One other studio that is staying very busy is Naughty Dog.

            <p>Joining the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">upcoming rush of summer's various showcases and reveals</a> is PlayStation, which has announced its next State of Play.</p>
<p>Those interested in finding out more about what Sony has been cooking up behind the scenes will be able to tune in tomorrow, 4th June, at 10pm UK time. That's 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST.</p>
<p>While the team is remaining coy about what will be shown - this isn't a game specific State of Play a la <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-some-new-borderlands-4-gameplay-to-go-with-that-revised-release-date">April's Borderlands 4 showcase</a> - there should be plenty to whet appetites for the coming months.</p>

<p>"Watch live for news and updates on must-play games coming to PS5. The show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe," reads an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/03/state-of-play-returns-june-4/">accompanying PlayStation blog post</a>. The show will last for "40+" minutes.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a chance we will hear more about the PS5's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, which is set for release on 2nd October. Developer Sucker Punch previously said it is going to ensure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-follow-up-will-have-a-less-repetitive-open-world">Ghost of Yōtei has a less repetitive open world compared to its predecessor</a>, with criticisms for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> often directed at its somewhat repetitive activities, so maybe we will get a taste of that later this week.</p>
<p>The PS5 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> will also likely be part of the upcoming State of Play even if it is more of a brief teaser rather than anything too chonky, given that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-upcoming-death-stranding-2-panel-and-gameplay-showcase-will-be-streamed-online">Kojima Productions is hosting its own dedicated On the Beach showcase this coming Sunday</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, South Korean developer and publisher NEOWIZ (Lies of P) announced the signing of a new publishing deal with the Chinese company Shadowlight. Founded in Shanghai by five recent graduates, this team has known each other for years and participated in many university-level game development competitions in China, earning numerous awards. In 2023, HYPERGRYPH, the developer of Arknights, invested in Shadowlight and has been part of their COREBLAZER incubator program ever since.</p>
<p>The publishing deal is for an upcoming detective adventure game titled Kill the Shadow, which is centered on a protagonist who can rewind time. Kill the Shadow features a unique aesthetic that blends high-definition 3D environments with 2D pixel characters. In Kill the Shadow, players must investigate and deduce various bizarre cases in an alternate post-war divided city. During Steam Next Fest last year, Shadowlight <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947640/Kill_The_Shadow_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a demo of the game, which received a very positive user rating. Several comments praised the game's story, reasoning system and visual novelty.</p>
<p>Kim Seung-chul, Co-CEO at NEOWIZ, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>What initially drew us to Shadowlight was a collaborative development philosophy to deliver premium narrative games for PC and console audiences. We look forward to working closely with the team to release Kill the Shadow globally, and we hope audiences find the same charm we experienced as we reveal more about the title.</em></p>
<p>Black, CEO of Shadowlight, added:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is a reliable global publisher, and we were grateful to find a partner who shares our philosophy on game development. As we see the games industry evolve to be inclusive of other cultures, it’s important to have a publisher that is open to collaborating and emphasizing the significance of your content.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, NEOWIZ has recently signed other publishing deals with Western developers like <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wolfeye Studios</a>, Zakazane, and Lizard Smoothie.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/torchlight-3-developer-echtra-games-shut-down-by-parent-company-zynga.1205466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Echtra Games, the studio responsible for 2020's&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>, has been closed down by its parent company Zynga, presumably leaving its as-yet-unannounced cross-platform action RPG abandoned for eternity.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-publisher-shutters-studio-founded-by-torchlight-diablo-creator-before-it-could-announce-its-new-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN report</a>, Echtra's shutdown is part of a "strategic realignment of [Zynga's] resources and priorities", which is pretty typical corporate-speak that generally appears to mean "the studio wasn't making us any money and wasn't likely to in future".</p>

<p>Echtra's only game was&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>, which began life as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-frontiers-release-date-wont-be-in-2019" rel="nofollow">pseudo-MMORPG</a> by the name of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight Frontiers</em>. Eventually, however,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-frontiers-torched-torchlight-3-rises-from-free-to-play-ashes" rel="nofollow">development scope shifted</a>, and the project became&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>instead, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-3-release-date-announced-for-next-month" rel="nofollow">release</a> moving from publisher Perfect World's Arc platform to Steam and consoles (and later the Switch).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torchlight-3-echtra-games-shut-down-zynga.jpg?itok=-b8dBHBl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torchlight-3-echtra-games-shut-down-zynga.jpg?itok=kEPOfTVV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>was Echtra Games' only release.</figcaption></figure><p>Following&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3</em>'s release in 2020, Echtra Games was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/torchlight-developer-echtra-games-acquired-by-zynga" rel="nofollow">acquired by mobile giant Zynga</a> in 2021, a few months before the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zynga-buys-golf-rival-and-developer-starlark-for-525-million" rel="nofollow">acquired&nbsp;<em>Golf Rival&nbsp;</em>and its developer StarLark</a> in August that same year.</p>

<p>Several months after that, in January 2022, Zynga itself would be acquired by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-acquires-zynga-to-strengthen-mobile-gaming-division" rel="nofollow"><em>GTA&nbsp;</em>IP holder Take-Two for $12.7 billion</a>, which was the most expensive gaming acquisition until Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" rel="nofollow">purchase of Activision Blizzard</a> just a few days later.</p>

<p>When Echtra was acquired by Zynga, the company said its new acquisition was working on a "new, yet to be announced RPG for cross-platform play in partnership with Zynga's NaturalMotion studio".</p>

<p>That project was never announced in full, and it now looks like it never will be, unless work on the game is transferred to another studio within Zynga. We'll have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>

<p>Other studios to shut down in recent months include&nbsp;<em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>and <i>Shadow of War&nbsp;</i>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">Monolith</a>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">Seattle NetEase studio</a> responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>,&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/risk-of-rain-2-hopoo-games-valve" rel="nofollow">Hopoo Games</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">EA studio Cliffhanger Games</a>, which had been working on a&nbsp;<em>Black Panther&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

According to a post on Reddit (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-reportedly-sending-out-of-stock-signs-to-switch-2-retailers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-reportedly-sending-out-of-stock-signs-to-switch-2-retailers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span>), gaming stores in the U.S. are being supplied with large “Out of Stock” displays for the Nintendo Switch 2, apparently sent by Nintendo itself to prepare for the forthcoming over-demand for the brand new console.

But it’s still pretty novel to perhaps see the console manufacturer itself preparing for the eventuality.</p><p> And canny, too! Traditionally, when your local GameStop or Best Buy has run out of stock, you’ll be greeted either with the dead-eyed stare of beleaguered employees, or perhaps at most a hastily printed sign made in Word and stuck into a plastic stand. But something like the sizeable cardboard signs Nintendo appears to be shipping not only look far more professional, but also perform the handy task of also being giant reminders that the Switch 2 is a thing that exists.</p><p>We don’t know for sure right now that these are official Nintendo signs (although this is what the original poster claims), and reached out to those involved to try to find out. But even if it’s just something one particular chain has put together, it’s testament to just how popular the Switch 2 is going to be when it releases June 5.</p><figure id="" data-id="2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-recommend-id="image://2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-recommend-id="image://2f042b8b5593bf7de3a2fc54009391e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario runs furiously in front of messages about Switch 2 pre-order cancelations." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Availability of the Switch 2 feels a bit all over the place just now.

Everyone else will be pacing back and forth, up and down their driveway, waiting for the delivery van to show up. And when that’s done, we can all begin speculating about whether supply will recover in time for the holidays.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The idea, many thought, was that Activision was intrusively trying to push microtransactions on players in a new way.</p><p>Now, Activision has disabled this and claimed it was only a "test" that was added to the game by accident. Fans aren't buying that explanation, however.</p><p>"A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game," <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision said.</a></p><p>The replies to Activision's post are full of people claiming Activision is gaslighting fans and offering a poor excuse for what happened. Some people replied to say the new UI feature was helpful to them, as it surfaced a specific weapon or bundle that they might have otherwise never seen.</p><p>In any event, the feature is now gone, but its removal isn't likely to do much to quell the concerns of some that Call of Duty is pushing microtransactions on players. The game regularly highlights paid DLC bundles that players can spend money on to acquire new operators, guns, and other items.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-60fps-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the performance update coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2 will see the game running at what appears to be a silky-smooth 60fps.</p>

<p>As documented by the folks at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-footage-shows-60fps-gameplay-for-switch-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Life</a>, the news was posted on the Nintendo Today news app, and while several people have posted footage of the game running at 60fps on social media platforms, it's probably best to watch the footage on the original app if you can thanks to the "wonders" of compression.</p>

<p>In essence, the update shows&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>running as they arguably always should have done, and hopefully, this will convince more folks to love the games like I do. That story really shouldn't be missed.</p>

If you haven't already checked the games out, it looks like Switch 2 will be the place to do it.</p>

<p><em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>are just two of the games getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">free Switch 2 performance patches</a> on the console's launch day (that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">this Thursday</a>). Others include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>,&nbsp;<em>Arms</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</em>.</p>

<p>These updates are distinct from Nintendo's Switch 2 Edition initiative, which will charge you a fee to upgrade your game to a Switch 2-native version with more substantial visual and performance improvements.</p>

<p>Games getting Switch 2 Edition versions include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">Level-5's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em></a>.</p>

                <p>Roblox game Grow A Garden is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">continuing to see massive numbers</a> of players, reaching a new high that's more than triple the Steam concurrent players record set by PUBG back in its heyday. The Roblox game is a farming-sim-meets-idle-game, but there's something about Grow A Garden that's seen it smashing records both on Roblox and off.</p><p>After a new update was released for the game--which are officially referred to as "experiences" on Roblox--the concurrent-player number shot to a new high of 11,694,315, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-game-grow-a-garden-suddenly-shatters-several-all-time-player-count-records-3196238/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reports</a>. The <a href="https://guinness-world-records.fandom.com/wiki/Roblox_records" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records Fandom wiki</a> has Grow A Garden breaking multiple Roblox platform records, including most visits in 10 minutes, most visits in 1 hour, most visits gained in a day, most visits gained in a week, and overall most concurrent players.</p><p>To put that in context, the record for most concurrent players on Steam belongs to PUBG, which saw an all-time high of 3,257,248 back when it started the trend for battle royale games. That's less than a third of what Grow A Garden is seeing on Roblox. To compare to another evergreen battle royale title, Fortnite's all-time concurrent record is over 14 million--a record Grow A Garden hasn't beaten yet, but it is surprisingly close to it.</p><p>Grow A Garden released in late March, and since then its popularity has eclipsed other popular Roblox games like Dress to Impress, Blox Fruits, and Adopt Me. The game was developed by an unknown teenage developer, but a studio called Splitting Point has now stepped in to manage it.</p><p>The farming genre has produced a number of surprise hits before--Farmville enjoyed similar viral success on Facebook over 15 years ago, while Stardew Valley remains popular almost 10 years after it was first released. Grow A Garden's idle gameplay likely adds to its popularity--players can plant seeds and let them grow while they're offline, making it an easy game to get into even with little time to play.</p>
