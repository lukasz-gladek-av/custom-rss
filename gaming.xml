            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has delisted&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>from both major mobile storefronts, so if you want to play a round of the battle royale FPS, you'd better hope you've already got it installed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923470814357385447" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on Friday</a>, Activision said that while it's proud of its "accomplishment" in creating an "authentic" mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, the mobile edition of the game hasn't "met [Activision's] expectations" in the same way as the PC and console versions have.</p>

<p>As such, new gameplay updates and seasonal events will no longer be added to&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile</em>, and you won't be able to buy in-game points or the BlackCell battle pass using real currency either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted-stadium.jpg?itok=TQP886zh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-delisted-stadium.jpg?itok=5Cr1jzqK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>can no longer be downloaded from either major mobile storefront.</figcaption></figure><p>If you had&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>downloaded and installed prior to today, then you can still enjoy it now, provided that it's still on your system. However, if you didn't have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>installed on your device before today, then it's gone for good.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like you can redownload it if you previously gave it a shot, either; you've got to have it on your device already, or your access to the game has been permanently revoked.</p>

<p>If you're lucky enough to have&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>on your phone or tablet, then you can continue to play it, and cross-progression will still be available, as will servers complete with matchmaking for online play.</p>

<p>You can also continue to spend whatever COD Points you have left over on "available content in the Store"; you just can't purchase any more with your real currency.</p>




<p>For a limited time, if you sign up to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Mobile&nbsp;</em>using your Activision account (and you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone Mobile&nbsp;</em>player), you can nab yourself some&nbsp;<em>Mobile&nbsp;</em>COD Points by way of an incentive.</p>

<p>More info about this, as well as all other things pertaining to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>'s shutdown, can be found via Activision's official <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on the matter.&nbsp;If you're a&nbsp;<em>Warzone&nbsp;</em>player on PC or console, don't fret; that version of the game isn't going anywhere.</p>

Siege X launches alongside a new season called Operation Daybreak. It redesigns the Defender Operator named Clash, who can now deploy her shield and activate its taser remotely. Operation Daybreak also brings other balancing updates to the game, such as electricity slowing Operators rather than damaging them now, reducing limb damage, and adjusting the abilities of Blackbeard, Jackal, Jäger, Thunderbird, and Sledge. The developers also plan to be more efficient in making anti-cheat updates throughout the season.</p><p>When Season 3 arrives several months from now, it will introduce a new Operator to the game, who is from Switzerland and wields a new weapon. It will also remaster the Nighthaven, Lair, and Consulate maps, feature the return of a Halloween event, and bring some changes to Dual Front to set up the new Operator. Then, Rainbow Six Siege will celebrate its 10th anniversary during Season 4, so Ubisoft will have a special in-game event for it. More Operator and map remasters, updates to training mode, and a new playlist called Testing Grounds will also arrive in Season 4.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X and Operation Daybreak will launch on June 10 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A test server for Siege X will run between May 20 and June 9.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-says-his-stealth-game-physint-is-%E2%80%9Cfive-or-six%E2%80%9D-years-from-release.1192962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-stealth-game-physint-is-five-or-six-years-from-release-by-kojimas-estimate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-plans-to-continue-making-games-in-some-way-even-after-he-has-passed-away/">Hideo Kojima</a> and Kojima Productions next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-could-last-nearly-twice-as-much-as-the-original-has-more-combat-because-people-ask-kojima-for-mgs/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is due to release in a little more than a month. After that, it's anyone's guess as to when the next games we know Kojima has cooking, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">OD</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-return-to-stealth-physint-spurred-by-brush-with-death/">Physint</a>, are going to hit store shelves.</p>
<p>Kojima's guess, at least regarding Physint, is that we won't see its release for another "<em>five or six years</em>." That's what he told French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/">Le Film Français</a> in a recent interview (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/">VGC</a>), when talking about his future projects, and aspirations to make movies, now that Death Stranding 2 is nearly out the door.</p>
<p>"<em>Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film. I grew up with cinema. Directing would be a kind of homage to it. Besides, I'm getting older, and I would prefer to do it while still young.</em>"</p>
<p>Kojima doesn't talk about OD, so perhaps OD is right in the middle of the five-to-six-year period, or it'll come afterward, with him working on OD alongside his first big film project. That's all just speculation, but unless we're due to hear that OD has been canceled, it arguably has to be somewhere in the next decade.</p>
<p>I mean, realistically, how much longer will Kojima keep working? He's currently 61, and if his estimation for Physint is correct, then he's technically also just confirmed the first cross-generational release between PS5 and PS6, unless, of course, the PS5 sticks around for more than a decade. And by that time, he'll be 67, looking to start directing movies, and maybe even still working on OD.</p>
<p>This all puts even more importance on Death Stranding 2. Whether you like Kojima's work or not, he's been one of the video game industry's most influential creators for years now. DS2 is officially one of the last game's we'll see from Hideo Kojima, and marks the closing of an era in video games with him officially looking at the exit door, even if he's not yet put a foot over the edge.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a>'s development team has issued an apology following a recent and poorly received update to the game, which led to an influx of negative feedback on Steam.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki - a cute and colourful dress up game with gacha elements - released towards the end of last year, offering players the opportunity to partake in some cosy RPG fun. However, while the free to play game was well received on its initial launch, things have since soured.</p>
<p>On 28th April, the developer released Version 1.5 or "Bubble Season" for Infinity Nikki. This update was meant to add things such as new challenge levels, tasks and gameplay features, but it also added a number of bugs which included players being unable to start the game on PS5, meaning it had to be redownloaded completely. Other issues included crashes and Nikki not moving, to name but two. Meanwhile, the developer retconned Infinity Nikki's story, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4bFJK5BZ2E">in the words of one player</a>, "dived deep into scummy monetisation practices" with this update.</p>

<p>When the update went live, the game recieved a number of negative Steam reviews. And now, two weeks down the line, the team has issued an apology to its community, adding it has "decided to extend Version 1.5's end date to ensure greater stability and prevent similar issues from recurring" in the game.</p>
<p>"We're acutely aware that these recent issues have impacted your experience and damaged the trust and affection you've placed in us. To all stylists, we offer our deepest apologies," <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1923937697745469653">the developer wrote on social media</a>.</p>
<p>The Infinity Nikki studio continued: "Throughout the development journey since launch, we've faced a multitude of challenges and uncertainties. From optimising performance across diverse devices with varying capabilities to tackling unexpected technical roadblocks, many of these hurdles were unprecedented for our team.</p>
<p>"Rather than offering premature communication, we chose to tackle these problems methodically - responding to your expectations only once we had secured concrete solutions.</p>
<p>"But rest assured, we've heard your feedback loud and clear."</p>
<p>It went on to clarify that the Threads of Reunion storyline's absence in this version of Infinity Nikki was "never intended as a removal" from the game's narrative, and its associated outfit remains on the development roadmap.</p>
<p>"Due to technical hurdles in Version 1.5, we were unable to properly refine the introduction of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> chapter and the narrative setup for Threads of Reunion, which regrettably led to confusion," it said.</p>
<p>"These elements are planned for future updates. Plans are underway to expand tiered cumulative top-up rewards in upcoming versions; new gameplay systems will undergo rigorous design scrutiny to ensure seamless integration into the open-world experience and lore consistency. On top of that, adaptation, performance, and stability issues across various platforms (including PS) have been identified and are being resolved systematically."</p>
<p>Other "adjustments" are also being discussed, the studio said. "Some changes require extended development cycles, but we commit to implementing them through phased updates. We will share progress once plans solidify and milestones are reached. In the meantime, we humbly ask for your continued patience and trust."</p>

</figure>
<p>The studio additionally clarified "the delay arrangements, compensation plan, and key optimisation priorities", which are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Extension &amp; Adjusted Event Schedules</strong></p>
<p>Due to version scheduling adjustments, Version 1.5 "Bubble Season" will be extended until June 12 (UTC-7).</p>
<p><strong>Version Timelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Version 1.5 End Date: June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7)</li>
<li>Version 1.6 Launch Date: June 12, 2025, 20:00:00 (UTC-7)</li>
</ul>
<p>*The maintenance schedule of Version 1.6 may be adjusted based on actual conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Events:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of the following Bubble Season events is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7): [Chase the Bubbles!], [Rainbow Album], [Where Are the Gifties?], [Floating Bubbles], [Rainbow and Pattern], and [Adventure Together].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Version 1.5 Store:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of [Pear-Pal Selected/Store: Clothing] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The end date of [Heartfelt Gifts] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The end date of the [Shake Up Bubble Jar!] cumulative top-up event is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>All items in [Bubble Market] will be unavailable on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The [Serenity Resonance Packs] and [Prismatic Plenitude Packs] in [Store: Featured] will be unavailable on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Version 1.5 Adjustments:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The end date of Version 1.5 [Mira Journey] is extended to June 12, 2025, 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
<li>The limited-time items in [Starlit Shop] will be removed on June 12 at 12:49:59 (UTC-7).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weekly Tasks "Starlit Pursuit" Delay Notice:</strong></p>
<p>After Version 1.5 launched, we received extensive feedback on co-op features and gameplay. Based on this, we are optimising related systems, and the new weekly tasks [Starlit Pursuit], originally scheduled for May 20 (UTC-7), will now debut in Version 1.6. This delay allows us to refine task mechanics for a smoother experience. Additional details will be announced at a later date—please stay tuned.</p>
<p>In light of this change, 360 [Starlit Crystals] will be given to all players as compensation. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every stylist for your understanding and continued support.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Infold</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The development team said it recognised its communication efforts "may not meet every stylist's expectations", and it is therefore launching a new initiative known as Miraland Round Table. This will allow players to share feedback with the Infinity Nikki team via email (include the keyword [Table Advisor] in the email's subject line and send it to the support team at <a href="mailto:infinitynikki_cs@infoldgames.com">infinitynikki_cs@infoldgames.com</a>) or in-game via the Customer Service tab.</p>
<p>These channels will be prioritised, the Infinity Nikki team said, but added it will still continue to monitor feedback elsewhere as well.</p>
<p>"All collected input - past and present - will be compiled, with key issues receiving direct responses. Your candid feedback - both critical and encouraging - has prompted deep reflection. Drafting this message stirs mixed emotions: guilt over delayed promises, yet gratitude for your unwavering support," the developer said, offering compensation in the form of in-game Diamonds and Energy Crystals.</p>
<p>"Thank you for standing with us," it closed. "Together, we'll make Infinity Nikki shine brighter than ever!"</p>
<figure>

<p>Recent changes aside, Jessica Orr had good things to say about the game on its release, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly", in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">Eurogamer's Infinity Nikki review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In classic me fashion, I swanned off for a few days just as another graphics card fracas has spilled out into public view. At the centre this time is the previously unassuming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidias-rtx-5060-gpus-are-launching-soon-with-price-cuts-on-the-rtx-5060-ti">RTX 5060</a>, which you may have noticed is due for launch today yet only has a handful of "hands-on previews" to tell you how big of a graphics it does. Allegedly, that’s because Nvidia have been keeping hold of the drivers needed for full reviews, only providing them at the eleventh hour to press outlets that have previously run these previews. No preview? No review, at least until the drivers release publicly later today, and what's more, the same reports say that these previews were only offered under strict testing provisos set by Nvidia themselves.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-grants-rtx-5060-drivers-access-to-media-willing-to-publish-previews">VideoCardz</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtFDz-BQLew">Hardware Unboxed</a>, the mandated test conditions supposedly range from only allowing certain games for benchmarking – judging from the <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5060-first-impressions">previews</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/desktop-pc/i-spent-my-first-few-hours-with-the-rtx-5060-playing-doom-the-dark-ages-and-it-feels-pretty-slick-for-under-usd300/">currently</a> <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/i-tested-the-rtx-5060-is-8gb-of-vram-really-enough-in-2025">online</a>, these were <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> – to the more egregious demand that RTX 5060 performance figures would focus on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-dlss-4-explained">DLSS 4’s Multi Frame Generation</a> (MFG). And, in turn, would only be compared to results from older XX60 GPUs that lack DLSS frame gen support entirely.</p>

<p>"We worked with a few chosen media on previews with a pre-release driver," an Nvidia spokesperson told me this afternoon. No comment on the review driver situation, other than a 5pm BST release time, was given.</p>

<p>RPS was not invited to take part in these previews, and I can’t imagine agreeing to such terms if we were. Although it doesn’t appear that Nvidia required previewers to give positive RTX 5060 takes, with several highlighting the shortcomings of its 8GB VRAM limit, the limited game selection and emphasis on frame-genned performance versus the much older RTX 3060 and RTX 2060 Super are clearly intended to push a particular narrative: one that at best downplays the drawbacks of frame generation and at worst misleads readers with an unhelpfully narrow view of relative performance. GameStar, a German site that took Nvidia up on the offer, <a href="https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/geforce-rtx-5060-preview-benchmarks,3433080.html">said in their preview</a> that the GPU giant even specified the in-game settings that each game should be tested with.</p>
<p>The sense that a big, green thumb is pressing down on the critical scales is deepened by the alleged trading of earlier review drivers for a compliant preview. Even if, by that point, reviewers are free to use their own, independently-set benchmarks, the initial wave of RTX 5060 reviews will come from publications that Nvidia has – accurately or otherwise – deemed more friendly than others. Those who refused the locked-down previews, and have thus demonstrated less of a willingness to go along with the desired messaging, will be forced to wait before sharing impressions.</p>
<p>I can’t claim absolute moral superiority here because again, I wasn’t invited, and thus didn’t have the chance to send a "Thanks but no thanks" email (even I <em>hadn’t</em> simultaneously been too busy recovering from gin-assisted groomsman duty). Still, yeah, not a fan.</p>
<p>I have recently noticed Nvidia PRs becoming unusually pushy about how great it would be to test such and such frame generation in such and such game, but functionally those have only ever been suggestions, and I’ve never faced even a veiled hint at retribution for ignoring them in my reviews. Nonetheless, I now find myself in the bizarre position of having had physical possession of an RTX 5060 for nearly a week (posted by Zotac, with no strings attached other than to please not lose or break it), yet don’t have the software means to test or appraise it on the day of release. Like, man, at least Bethesda didn’t send us copies of Starfield while they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-starfield-review-is-going-to-be-a-little-late">withholding the activation keys</a>.</p>

<p>More disturbing still is that this isn’t even the only accusation of editorial manhandling to be laid at Nvidia’s feet today. Big-deal tech YooToobers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamersNexus">Gamers Nexus</a> claimed in a video (above) that Nvidia have, with varying levels of subtlety, threatened to cut off their interview access to Nvidia engineering staff in response to a perceived lack of focus on DLSS and MFG performance testing in their reviews. Gamers Nexus have, in fact, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nfEkuqNX4k">produced</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nh1FHR9fkJk">multiple</a> long-form vids on these topics specifically.</p>
<p>It isn’t unheard of for, nor technically outside the rights of, companies to pick and choose who gets primo access for coverage. In tech media especially, there may even be a minor, ethically unbothersome quid-pro-quo involved: attending a virtual briefing, for instance, in exchange for getting onto the review list. But there’s a honking great difference between asking journalists to sit through a thirty-minute slideshow and, essentially, demanding editorial jurisdiction over how their products are evaluated. Nvidia, one of the richest, most powerful firms on Earth, should know better – and should have at least had an idea that being caught fiddling with the independent review process might cause more damage to the RTX 5060 than a few variations of "It’s not much faster than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review">4060</a>, is it?"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft have finally broken their silence over reports about the use of Azure and Microsoft generative AI tech by the Israeli military during the latter’s on-going invasion and bombardment of Gaza, which has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of Palestinians.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">unsigned statement published 15th May 2025</a>, Microsoft confirm that they have supplied technology to the Israeli armed forces during the assault on Gaza, which began following the killing and abduction of Israeli civilians on October 7th 2023. They contend, however, that their own internal reporting has found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." The news comes a few weeks after the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions movement <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">called on people to avoid Microsoft games and gaming services in protest</a> at the company’s dealings with the Israel Defense Forces.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to several investigations earlier this year, including <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">a sizeable February report from the Associated Press</a>, the IDF have made use of Microsoft’s generative AI services extensively for combat and intelligence activities since October 2023. This includes the alleged use of genAI models to analyse and prepare data for the purpose of targeting airstrikes. The AP investigation - which is based on interviews with current and former members of Microsoft and the Israeli armed forces, together with internal company data and documents - also discusses the Israeli military's relationship with other big tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Palantir, Cisco, and Oracle.</p>
<p>These reports have intensified fears among many Microsoft staff that their work is being used as an instrument of war and oppression. Back in May 2024, Microsoft workers <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">launched a petition</a>, "No Azure for Apartheid," demanding an independent audit for potential human rights violations. Microsoft leadership have taken a hard line with certain, more visible protests about the sale of Microsoft services to the Israeli military. In April this year, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-fire-employees-who-protested-the-sale-of-genai-tech-to-the-israeli-military">fired two people</a> who spoke out at company anniversary events.</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft are trying to reassure those who remain. In the blog post, Microsoft announce the completion of an internal review of claims that Microsoft technology has been used "to target civilians or cause harm in the conflict in Gaza," with "additional fact-finding" supplied by an external firm. The blog post comments that Microsoft’s supply of tech to the Israel Ministry of Defense is "structured as a standard commercial relationship," and is therefore subject to their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/terms/product/ForOnlineServices/all">acceptable use policy</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/ai-code-of-conduct">AI Code of Conduct</a>, together with their overall <a href="https://msblogs.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/5/2025/05/Microsofts-Commitment-to-Human-Rights.pdf">commitment to human rights</a>. Microsoft say that, based on "both our internal assessments and external review," they’ve found no evidence that the Israeli armed forces have failed to comply with either document.</p>
<p>The blog also notes that military organisations "typically use their own proprietary software or applications from defense-related providers for the types of surveillance and operations that have been the subject of our employees’ questions." Microsoft, it says, have not created anything like this for the IMOD.</p>
<p>The blog adds, however, that Microsoft did provide the IMOD with "special access" to their technologies in the course of "limited emergency support to the Israeli government in the weeks following October 7, 2023, to help rescue hostages". Microsoft say they retained "significant oversight" during this period, "including approval of some requests and denial of others," so as "to help save the lives of hostages while also honoring the privacy and other rights of civilians in Gaza."</p>
<p>The post also caveats that Microsoft do not have full awareness of how the Israeli military may have used any Microsoft technology that runs on their own servers. "This is typically the case for on premise software," it argues. "Nor do we have visibility to the IMOD’s government cloud operations, which are supported through contracts with cloud providers other than Microsoft. By definition, our reviews do not cover these situations."</p>
<p>It’s an extremely brief response to a lengthy and disturbing series of claims, which expects the reader to take a lot on trust. The blog post does not include the full text of Microsoft’s internal and external assessments, nor does it respond to the detail of the allegations made by the Associated Press and other publications. It doesn’t even name the firm hired to carry out "additional fact-finding" for their review.</p>
<p>The No Azure for Apartheid movement have already called on Microsoft to release a full copy of their internal review. "It's very clear that their intention with this statement is not to actually address their worker concerns, but rather to make a PR stunt to whitewash their image that their relationship with the Israeli military has tarnished," former Microsoft worker Hossam Nasr argues in a statement, circulated by Israeli newspaper <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-17/ty-article/microsoft-says-it-provided-ai-to-israel-for-gaza-war-but-denies-use-to-harm-palestinians/00000196-dbd0-d9a9-a99e-fbd5a6f80000">Haaretz</a>.</p>
<p>Nasr and his colleague Abdo Mohamed were themselves <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired by Microsoft</a> last year, after they helped organise a vigil at the company's headquarters for Palestinians killed in Gaza. They’ve since joined the BDS boycott on Xbox and Microsoft gaming products, which you can read more about on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox">the official BDS site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s recent delay, confirming the push was less than six months, while he stressed that another delay is unlikely.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBlLUo11qWg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, Zelnick said GTA 6's delay was "pretty short," amounting to "less than six months."</p><p>GTA 6's new release date is May 26, 2026. Six months prior to that is November 26, 2025. Rockstar never confirmed a specific GTA 6 release date, only stating that it would come out in Fall 2025. If the delay was less than six months, as Zelnick said, this suggests the company was originally eyeing a late-November or December release date for GTA 6. But of course, nothing is absolutely confirmed on that front.</p><p>Now that GTA 6 has a specific release date, Zelnick said it's unlikely that the game will be delayed again. "Generally, when we announce a date, we're able to hit that date," he said.</p><p>A delay for GTA 6 was always likely, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past 10+ years has been delayed.</a> It is indeed true that when Take-Two announces a specific date--not a vague release window--that the company sticks to its plans. That's not <em>always </em>true, though. GTA V's PS5 and Xbox Series X|S edition, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-delayed-to-march-2022-new-trailer-shown-at-playstation-showcase/1100-6496035/#:~:text=GTA%205%20On%20PS5%20And,Shown%20At%20PlayStation%20Showcase%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6496035">given a November 11, 2021 release date before shifting to March 2022.</a></p><p>For GTA 6, Zelnick said Rockstar's ambition to create something truly special is an effort that takes time.</p><p>"Rockstar is trying to create the best thing anyone has ever seen in entertainment. Not just interactive entertainment. That's a tall order," he added.</p><h2>"I don't play video games"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick was asked if he's played GTA 6. He apparently has not, as the executive replied, "I'm not a gamer. I don't play video games."</p><p>Zelnick said he does share his opinions "pretty openly" about what he sees with regards to game designs and concepts. However, he said his job as Take-Two's CEO is to attract, motivate, and retain the video game industry's best talent, and then to "get out of their way."</p><p>In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that the studio may be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2.</a></p>

In a new interview with French magazine <a href="https://www.lefilmfrancais.com/index.php?option=com_papyrus&amp;view=recherche&amp;searchword=hideo+kojima"><em>Le Film Français</em></a>, Kojima said Physint is five to six years away from release.</p><p>This timeline isn’t too surprising – Kojima Productions’ next release is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> on June 26, and the studio is already developing its next game after that, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-game-called-od-with-jordan-peele">OD</a>, for Xbox. Assuming Kojima Productions has no other surprises, Kojima claimed last year that Physint's development would begin in earnest after the launch of Death Stranding 2 (likely up to bat after OD), so the five-to-six-year timeline makes sense.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WEpK67JDLu8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Besides Death Stranding 2, there is Physint in development. That will take me another five or six years. Maybe after that, I could finally decide to tackle a film,” Kojima told <em>Le Film Français</em> when asked about directing a movie, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a>.</p><p>Kojima also told the magazine he received many offers to direct a movie when <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/15/opinion-how-kojima-leaving-could-be-good-for-metal-gear.aspx?amp">he left Konami in 2015</a>. Considering how much Kojima loves films and the people behind them, seeing him direct one wouldn’t be surprising. Consider those extra-long Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding cutscenes practice for his directorial debut.</p><p>While waiting for Physint, check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/building-a-stronger-connection"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Death Stranding 2 hands-on preview</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/preview/2025/05/08/how-death-stranding-2s-interactive-encyclopedia-helps-players-make-sense-of-the">Death Stranding 2’s interactive encyclopedia</a> helps players make sense of the lore.

			<p>Today, at Computex 2025, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-125-games-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-june-more-dlss-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now available in over 125 games and applications. Following the news, NVIDIA provided more details and trailers about upcoming games and existing PC games that are being updated to include DLSS 4 and other NVIDIA technologies.</p>
<p>Let's start with Portal with RTX, which was upgraded from DLSS 3.5 to the new version while also updating the Frame Generation and Ray Reconstruction models to the latest and greatest versions. Additionally, the game now supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neural Radiance Cache</a>. Taking advantage of the neural shader's capabilities to leverage AI to infer a great many rays and bounces from a limited set of indirect lights, the performance is improved even further. The flagship GPU, the GeForce RTX 5090, runs Portal with RTX at 277 average frames per second with full ray tracing enabled, according to NVIDIA tests. The RTX 5080 registers 171.5 frames per second, while the RTX 5070Ti achieves 143.7 frames per second.</p>
<p><iframe title="Portal with RTX | Improved Performance with DLSS 4 &amp; NRC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyS3TtOC7hA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tomorrow, Saber Interactive will release Roadcraft, a rather unusual game where players will use construction machinery to restore sites damaged by various natural disasters. The game includes DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution (with the transformer AI model), and DLAA on day one. NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation can be enabled via the NVIDIA app overrides and will be added in-game soon. As seen in the trailer, Roadcraft runs at over 250 average frames per second with everything enabled on the RTX 5090.</p>
<p><iframe title="RoadCraft | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pXDtRgeXrvQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Two days later, 1047 Games will launch SplitGate 2's Open Beta, which also features integration of the whole DLSS 4 suite: Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p>On the same day, the popular free-to-play melee-focused Battle Royale game NARAKA: Bladepoint will receive the <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously announced</a> path tracing update, greatly improving its visuals. The game already supported DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, but this update will also introduce Ray Reconstruction. In the NVIDIA trailer, the game runs at around 350 average frames per second with everything enabled.</p>
<p><iframe title="NARAKA: BLADEPOINT | Full Ray Tracing &amp; DLSS Ray Reconstruction Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ElOkr-bhS2E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On May 24, F1 25 launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-pc-specs-revealed-rtx-5080-for-path-tracing-at-1080p60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with path tracing</a> and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>
<p>In early June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dune: Awakening</a> will be released with DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation (which was not yet available in the recent beta), Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex. The NVIDIA trailer shows the game running at over 300 frames per second in some instances.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Awakening | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlYFajRAed0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The same technologies will be available in MindsEye, the single player triple-A action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-gets-june-10-release-date-pre-orders-and-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on June 10</a>.</p>
<p>A week later, Remedy's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> will make its debut with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, Reflex, and path tracing. You can check out the new showcase below.</p>

<p>On July 24, the Soulslike action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-opens-pre-orders-and-shares-pc-specs-ahead-of-july-24-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> also comes out with the full set of NVIDIA DLSS technologies (though there's no ray tracing.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fFzo_o8mH8w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>inZOI, the new life simulation game released in early access by KRAFTON, will receive its DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation update in August.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, NVIDIA also demonstrated the Horizon 'clone' Light of Motiram running at over 400 frames per second with Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LIGHT OF MOTIRAM | 4K NVIDIA DLSS 4 Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PgFVQ8BezLg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, Crimson Desert will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Reflex, and ray traced effects. Kyungjoon Cho, Head of Game Engine System Division, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Crimson Desert represents a major step forward for Pearl Abyss in intense action and open world design. With NVIDIA's graphics technologies, we're ensuring that players experience and explore the continent of Pywel through high-quality graphics and smooth gameplay.</em></p>
<p>Keita Iida, Vice President of Developer Relations at NVIDIA, added:</p>
<p><em>Pearl Abyss has crafted a visually spectacular and deeply immersive experience with Crimson Desert. By integrating ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 and Reflex technologies, they're providing players with breathtaking visuals, lightning-fast responsiveness, and exceptional frame rates that bring the game world to life.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-physint-five-six-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Physint&nbsp;</em>creator Hideo Kojima has indicated that it's going to be quite a while before we get to play his new take on the "espionage action" genre he helped to pioneer.</p>

<p>In an interview with French cinema magazine&nbsp;<em>Le Film Francais&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-reveals-his-next-espionage-game-physint-is-5-6-years-away/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kojima talks about his love of film, and he also addresses the multiple video game projects he's currently working on.</p>

<p>As well as the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in June</a>, Kojima also named&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, which he says will "take [him] another five or six years" to make. He's previously stated that the production of the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes" rel="nofollow">heavily impacted by SAG strikes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=XIPMjIJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/physint-kojima-comments-billboard.jpg?itok=DvhlVugs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideo Kojima says he'd like to work on a movie after&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">only revealed back in February last year</a>&nbsp;and that Kojima's games usually sport both high production values and a lot of polish, I don't think anyone was expecting to see&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>for at least the next few years. Still, knowing it's that far away is a touch disappointing.</p>

<p>After&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>are released, Kojima says he might like to try his hand at making a movie; he says he "grew up with cinema" and that he'd prefer to make a film "while still young" if he's going to do it at all.</p>

<p>As VGC points out, Kojima doesn't make any reference to&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, his <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">collaboration with filmmaker Jordan Peele</a>, but since he's promoting the Sony-exclusive&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, that might not be so strange.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, too, was announced during a Sony event, so it may well be a PlayStation exclusive.</p>




<p>For the time being, though, Kojima will be focused on the release of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" rel="nofollow">went gold earlier this month</a>, prompting the filling in of the second eye on Kojima's daruma doll.</p>

<p><em>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>&nbsp;will, if Kojima's estimates are correct, launch somewhere around 2030-2031, thus probably making it a PlayStation 6 title at this point. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has sounded off on increasing game prices, saying he questions why people are complaining about $80 games when that price is actually a "steal" in terms of what's being offered, at least for some games. He said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCTm-cxuYTQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Hits Games</a>, stating that many products in regular life have gone up in price over the years, so it was only a matter of time before video games did as well.</p><p>"I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-exec-says-usd70-or-usd80-games-are-a-steal-as-long-as-people-choose-carefully-how-they-spend-their-money-i-dont-think-they-should-be-complaining/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>In the '90s, many new releases sold for $60 USD. Adjusted for inflation, that's around $80 today, which is the price that Nintendo and Xbox will charge for some games this year. Sony, for its part, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">it might increase prices, too.</a></p><p>Not every game will become more expensive, though. Variable pricing in gaming has existed since the beginning, and it's going to continue into the future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-remastered-announced-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered</em>, a modernized remaster-slash-remake of the original point-and-click classic with revamped gameplay and improved visuals.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Syberia/status/1924150647177306347" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Microids promises that the remaster will feature a "stunning visual overhaul", as well as "redesigned gameplay". It will, however, tell the "same unforgettable story" as the original, so don't worry; the plot details haven't been changed.</p>

<p>The remaster will see protagonist Kate Walker and her automaton companion Oscar exploring "carefully rebuilt" environments which use an art style that "stays true" to original creator Benoît Sokal's vision while also utilizing "beautifully enhanced 3D", according to Microids.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=-7uZ5USf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microids-syberia-remastered-train.jpg?itok=4vGZpUCT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>​​​​​​brings gameplay and visual improvements to the 2002 adventure classic later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not that means the new game will feature pre-rendered environments in a similar way to the original isn't clear, but it does sound like Microids is overhauling the visual style completely, so perhaps you'll be able to explore a fully rendered version of Sokal's world this time around.</p>

<p>In keeping with modern design trends,&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>will offer "a fresh take" on the original's puzzles, which have been "redesigned to provide a smoother and more intuitive experience".</p>

<p>Additionally, the remaster will feature a reworked UI, as well as "improved 3D navigation", so it should be a little easier to move Kate around her environment now; the slightly clunky movement of the original sounds as though it's been addressed, which is nice.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it's still the same tale of Kate's "legal assignment" that transforms into "a profound journey of self-discovery". If you love the original&nbsp;<em>Syberia</em>, it sounds very much like this is the remaster you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=YyeEGrOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/syberia-remastered-town.jpg?itok=Z--j6_qQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Syberia</em>'s environments have been redesigned in full 3D, by the looks of things.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1999 with first-person adventure&nbsp;<em>Amerzone</em>, so&nbsp;<em>Syberia&nbsp;</em>is technically the second game in the series, although it's the first to bear what would become the franchise's name.</p>

<p>A sequel followed in 2004, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-3-gets-release-date-and-revealing-trailer" rel="nofollow">another thirteen years later</a>. The latest game in the series,&nbsp;<em>Syberia: The World Before</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-world-before-release-date-set-for-march-2022" rel="nofollow">released in 2022</a>, and is the first to launch following Sokal's death in 2021 from a long-term illness.</p>

<p>With regards to the future of the series, it's not just&nbsp;<em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>you've got to look forward to; an animated series based on the franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/syberia-animated-series-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">is also in development</a>, although we don't know when it's arriving yet.</p>

<p><em>Syberia Remastered&nbsp;</em>launches sometime later this year for PC. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660220/Syberia__Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it right now via Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-wz-ladra-attachments-1851781095<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the most interesting additions joining the fray in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 Reloaded </em>(what a mouthful!) is the Ladra submachine gun. It’s a fast-firing SMG reminiscent of the Tec-9. But with such a high rate of fire comes a lack of control, which we’ll aim to resolve with the right attachments. While I’m not the best player, I can hold my own, and I know how to build a loadout to suit my purposes, especially in CQB. As proof, I offer you a sweet Ladra loadout in <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone </em>that saw me achieve nearly 500 kills fast!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,195752" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><hr><h2 id="h683027"><a id="1"></a>Best attachment choices for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-recommend-id="image://a5f118754e800fe7c008274999ebeb88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The attachment screen for the Ladra SMG in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>For the Ladra, which already features a high Mobility and Handling rating, we’re focusing on increasing its Firepower and Accuracy</strong>. The latter is nothing to scoff at on the base weapon, but the goal here is to create a laser beam that’s capable for short- and mid-range engagements.</p><p>As such, I chose the following attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Remuda Mini Reflex</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Muzzle Brake</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Precision Foregrip</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Heavy Stock</li><li><strong>Laser</strong>: N/A</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs </li></ul><p>You can swap the Heavy Stock for the Combat Stock at will, and, as always, your choice of Optic. I chose the Mini Reflex for its accurate sight picture and small profile, allowing for easier target acquisition in and out of ADS.</p><h2 id="h683028"><a id="2"></a>Best perks for the Ladra</h2><figure id="" data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-recommend-id="image://32ccca841b6872fd6c2f87f9d9745084" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The perk and equipment loadout screen for the Ladra in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With your attachments squared away, let’s focus on the rest of the build. The right equipment and perks for the Ladra can really turn the tide of a round. In this case, we’re opting for flash-and-awe tactics with the fast-firing and highly mobile SMG. With the Flashbang, you can blind an entire room and sweep and clear with a mag or two.</p><p><strong>As for the perks, we’re opting for abilities that allow us to move quickly and quietly across the map</strong>, while uncovering enemy whereabouts to get the drop on everyone.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Flashbang</li><li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: War Cry </li><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ninja</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Vigilance</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Recon</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li></ul><p>You’ll note I chose War Cry instead of the Assault Pack. Typically, for this type of weapon, I’d say the Assault Pack proves most useful to replace all of that rapidly depleting ammunition. But here, speed and momentum become paramount, and War Cry’s movement buff is key!</p><hr><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>’s Season 3 Reloaded is available right now on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>and the Chelsea Flower Show might not be the most obvious crossover you can think of, but thanks to Xbox, Bethesda, and "leading bespoke firepit designers" The Firepit Company, it's becoming a reality tomorrow.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the medieval FPS will be getting a firepit display at the Chelsea Flower Show from May 20th to May 24th, thus "seamlessly blending the game's take on medieval stylings with cutting-edge craftsmanship".</p>

<p>The display will see several elaborately-designed firepit globes set among lush greenery, with the central firepit being built around the Doom Slayer himself and a number of other globes featuring designs of "intricate demons and elaborate adversaries" from&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=ud_h9JOL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-chelsea-flower-show-display.jpg?itok=J-kYh9RF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is getting, of all things, a Chelsea Flower Show display.</figcaption></figure><p>The centerpiece features not only the Doom Slayer, but also a number of "dark flowers", including dark variants of the likes of Zantedeschia, petunia, and Centaurea cyanus. You'll also find a pedestal with the Slayer's symbol carved into it.</p>

<p>Bethesda communications director Steve Merrett says it's "amazing" to see how&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>has been "adapted into a centerpiece worthy of any outdoor area", while The Firepit Company's Jason Andre describes the display as "iconic" and a "pleasure" to work on.</p>

<p>If you want to see the displays, you'll be able to do so in London <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">between May 20th and 24th</a>, although tickets <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/ticket-options" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">aren't cheap</a>&nbsp;and are limited in availability at time of writing.</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>franchise, and the third game in the reboot series, which began with 2016's straightforwardly-titled&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<p>A prequel to that game,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>sees the Doom Slayer battling back the forces of Hell in order to save humanity. It introduces a number of new weapons and combat mechanics to the series, including parrying, a throwable shield that can also be used to block projectiles, and more.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/doom-the-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
