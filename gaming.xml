Specifically fine-tuned for the PS5’s Tempest 3D Audio, this headset delivers an immersive sound experience that makes you feel like you’re right in the middle of the action. Whether you’re creeping through a dark corridor in a survival horror game or engaged in an intense firefight, the 3D audio creates a sense of space with sound that feels like it’s coming from all directions, making every gaming moment more intense and realistic.</p><p>Comfort is also a big plus with the Pulse 3D Headset. This is something that’s often overlooked when purchasing a headset, but if you’re planning long gaming sessions, you won’t be disappointed. </p><p>If you enjoy playing games online with friends, the built-in noise-canceling microphones ensure that your voice comes through clearly, even if there’s a bit of background noise. And with up to 12 hours of wireless playtime, you can game all day without worrying about recharging.</p><p>But the Pulse 3D isn’t just for the PS5; it’s also compatible with the PS4 and PC, and you can even connect it to PS VR and mobile devices with the included audio cable.

While it might not be for everyone, the PSVR2 is undeniably immersive and has improved upon so many things that the original PSVR didn’t get right.</p><p>The PSVR2 features 3D audio, eye tracking, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, finger touch detection, and more. For example, in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-saints-sinners-chapter-2-retribution-ps-vr2-review">The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners – Chapter 2: Retribution</a>, you have to physically put your hand down by your side to reach for your gun, and move the controllers in the direction you want to aim in.</p><p>Offering two 2000x2040 OLED displays, the 4K HDR visuals are unparalleled.

It’s designed to be customizable so that you can switch up your gaming style on the fly.</p><p>If you’re playing an FPS that requires fast-paced movements, you may prefer to set the travel distance on your controller’s triggers to be shorter, for example. No matter how you like to play, this controller will definitely give you the edge in any game. It is, however, really expensive, and since the original PS5 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-dualsense-controller-review">DualSense</a> controller is so popular, it might not sway enough users to invest.</p><p>Still, if remappable buttons and easily accessible profiles you can switch to at any time is a priority for you, then the DualSense Edge controller might be the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-controller">best PS5 controller</a> for you.</p><h2 id="poweracharger">5.

Simply place the controllers on the charging station overnight, and when you’re ready to get back in the action, your controllers will be ready for you.</p><h2 id="faceplate">6. innoAura PS5 Faceplates</h2><h3>Best Faceplate Alternatives for PS5</h3><div id="196695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>innoAura PS5 Faceplates</h3></p><div><p>Stand out from the crowd with easy-to-install faceplates for your PS5 console built with sturdy materials and ample ventilation. </p></div></div><div><div><p>Range of styles and colors</p></div><div><p>Not Sony’s official faceplates</p></div></div><p>Bored of the PS5’s standard white design?

The hard ABS material can withstand impacts and is shockproof, though I wouldn’t recommend testing this too much! </p><p>Just like Sony’s official faceplates, these are designed to fit the PS5 and will continue to offer you access to the console’s USB, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-hdmi-cables-for-ps5">HDMI</a>, and power ports.</p><h2 id="logig29">7.

The best solution for Remote Play is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review"><u>PlayStation Portal</u></a>, a nifty gaming device with a vivid 8-inch tiltable screen and built-in controls that lets you access your PS5 games over Wi-Fi. The experience on the Portal will blow your <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-phone"><u>gaming phone </u></a>and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-phone-controller"><u>phone controller</u></a> out of the water. </p><p>This device is essentially a DualSense controller split in half and stretched to fit a screen. So, you’ll still enjoy haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for a more immersive gaming experience. However, it’s missing Bluetooth support. That means you’ll need to use a wired headset or Sony's PlayStation Link-compatible options, like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-review"><u>PlayStation Pulse Explore Earbuds</u></a>, to avoid annoying your family by listening out loud. </p><p>Don’t expect to do anything other than play PS5 games on this device, as you can’t browse the web or stream. It’s also only as good as your Wi-Fi, so having a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-router"><u>great gaming router</u></a> and ISP can be helpful. If you want to play the Portal outside of your home, it’s possible, but the Wi-Fi you’re connecting to can't require a web browser to log in, and be sure you've got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-portal-cases">best PlayStation Portal case</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-portal-accessories">Portal accessories</a> to keep it safe. </p><h2>How To Choose a PS5 Accessory</h2><p>There isn’t really a one-size-fits-all answer that can tell you how to choose the best PS5 accessory as every gamer is individual. One person’s treasure is another's rage-inducing nightmare.</p><p>But the one thing you always want to check when buying an accessory for your PS5 is compatibility. Is that hard drive fast enough for your PS5 games to work, rather than just store them? Do those headphones take full advantage of Tempest 3D Audio? And more importantly, how is this accessory going to help me enjoy games more?</p><p>As with all things, make sure to check the reviews before investing in a new PS5 accessory. There are plenty of cheaper alternatives out there when it comes to accessories, but they’re often cheap for a reason. If gaming is a hobby you take seriously, you want to make sure you’re purchasing the best PS5 accessories possible, not only to maximize your enjoyment, but also to ensure high build quality and long-lasting products.</p><h2>PS5 Accessories FAQ</h2><p><strong>Does the PS5 need additional cooling?</strong></p><p>The PS5 does a perfectly good job of cooling without the need for any additional third-party PS5 accessories to help it. While there are plenty of PS5 cooling fans and stands out there, in honesty, they’re more likely to be a hindrance to the console's natural cooling ability, rather than assist it.</p><p><strong>Can I buy a USB hard drive for my PS5?</strong></p><p>If you want to keep things simple and install a USB hard drive, rather than a NVMe SSD, you can, but it does come at a cost. Due to the loading requirements of next-gen games, PS5 games require much faster write speeds of 5Gbps or higher to run. Sadly, USB drives cannot reach these speeds yet, meaning a USB hard drive could only store PS5 games, however, it can be used to play PS4 games without needing to move them to the console.</p><p><strong>Which brand makes the best PS5 accessories?</strong></p><p>Most of the best PS5 accessories come from Sony themselves. In fact, Sony is well known for creating tons of PS5 accessories, all designed to take full advantage of the console’s latest capabilities in order to improve your gaming experience.
<strong>When do PS5 accessories go on sale?</strong></p><p>Although the PS5 itself doesn't go on sale very often, PlayStation accessories will often see discounts throughout the year. The general rule of thumb is that the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-a-playstation-5">best times to buy a PS5</a> are also the best times to buy accessories for the console. Some of the more popular events where you're guaranteed to find discounts  on gaming accessories are <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Amazon Prime Day</a> in July and <a href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> in November There's also PlayStation's Days of Play sale which usually takes place at the end of May and into early June.</p><p><em>Kegan is an avid gamer who has been playing games since his Atari days.

Hardware Unboxed has tested the Zen 4-based Ryzen 7 7700X and the new Ryzen 7 9700X (Zen 5) on both Windows 11 version 23H2 and 24H2 and found a significant performance increase thanks to Microsoft’s OS update.</p><p>On average, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrlfTHCzBnnQ">Hardware Unboxed found</a> an improvement of 10 percent across multiple games running at 1080p resolution on the older Ryzen 7700X running Windows 11 version 24H2. On the latest Ryzen 9700X, Windows 11 24H2 provides an 11 percent performance improvement on average in the same game tests. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DyDzVWqncMFA">KitGuru has also tested</a> AMD’s best gaming CPU, the 7800X3D, and found similar increases in some games, alongside improvements to the older Ryzen 9 7950X thanks to Windows 11 version 24H2. </p><p>The new benchmark results come just weeks after AMD launched its Zen 5 desktop CPUs, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">failed to impress during early reviews</a>. Reviewers found that in gaming the previous generation Ryzen 9 7950X looked like better value than AMD’s new flagship Ryzen 9 9950X.</p><p>Windows 11 24H2 will certainly improve the performance of these new Zen 5 CPUs, but since it’s also improving older Zen 4 processors, the performance gap still seems to be a little disappointing between the two architectures. Microsoft’s 24H2 update is anything but disappointing for Ryzen owners though, as it literally allows them to download better performance for their CPUs.</p><p>We’re expecting Microsoft to release its 24H2 update for Windows 11 in late September, but if you want to grab it early you can opt into the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/">Windows Insider program</a> and enable the Release Preview builds on your PC.

<p>Black Myth: Wukong players can now play Game Science’s latest action RPG as Dragon Ball Z’s Goku, courtesy of mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the moment, there are two Goku mods available over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a>. Both mods replace the initial outfit of Black Myth Wukong and do not add any gameplay features or other elements to the title. The first is <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/84?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Son Goku</a>, which adds an anime-accurate character to the game. The second one is called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/99?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jump Force Goku</a>, and this adds Goku’s damaged character model from Jump Force to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-do-you-install-goku-mods-for-black-myth-wukong-nbsp">How do you install Goku Mods for Black Myth Wukong?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You must follow these steps to install Goku mods for Black Myth: Wukong.&nbsp;However, this is an experimental mod that only works with the first outfit of the game and could be bugged with other outfits. So remember to change to Tiger Hide Loincloth, Cotton Wristwraps and Cotton Legwraps. &nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>First, open Steam, right-click on Black Myth: Wukong and then head to ‘Properties’.</li>



<li>Here, you must type “-fileopenlog” in the Launch Options field. This will now allow you to install mods for the game.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Then head to Nexus Mods, decide which Goku mod you wish to use, and download it.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Once downloaded, head to Steam again, right-click on Black Myth: Wukong, click the ‘Manage’ button, and select ‘Browse Local Files’. &nbsp;</li>



<li>After that, use an unarchiving tool to unzip the mod files, then drag and drop the B1 folder into the game files.&nbsp;</li>



<li>That’s all. Now you can play Goku in Black Myth: Wukong.</li>
</ul>

<p>For those who don’t know, Black Myth: Wukong’s story is based on one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature, Journey to the West. Interestingly, the late Akira Toriyama, creator of Dragon Ball Z, was also inspired by this novel during the inception of the manga, which is why Goku shares so many similarities with Sun Wukong.</p>



<p>In other news, Black Myth: Wukong’s Xbox release is seemingly ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">indefinitely delayed</a>‘ due to a ‘memory leak’ bug. Also, the game is reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-is-reportedly-boosting-ps5-sales-in-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boosting PlayStation 5 sales in China</a>.

            <p>Having been officially revealed in a very un-fanfare-y way this weekend, a Valve developer has given us all an extra peek at a prototype of the studio's hero-shooter Deadlock.</p>
<p>The video itself was spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower">Gabe Follower</a>, which regularly keeps us up to date with titbits of Valve-related news (clue is in the name, really).</p>

<p>As you can see in the embedded post below, the prototype footage for Deadlock features a very rudimentary urban area, complete with placeholder assets such as those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a>'s alien insectoid creatures, Antlions.</p>
<p>As this is of course just a prototype for Deadlock, the footage itself is very basic, but having played Deadlock myself (I can actually say that now) you can certainly see the bones of the game as it is today.</p>
<p>In Deadlock, players make their way through its urban map accompanied by a gaggle of AI minions known as Troopers. These chaps "periodically spawn in the base and then run down a lane, fighting any enemies they encounter". This is much like the prototype's Antlions did for the player.</p>
<p>You can check out the prototype footage via the post below, followed by a screenshot I just took showing Deadlock's Troopers as they appear in the game's overview section.</p> <div>

<p>Deadlock reached a new peak concurrent player count this weekend, of 89,203. There is still no actual release date for Deadlock, however, and it can <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">only be played via invite at the time of writing</a>.</p>
<p>"Deadlock is in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay," the Steam page explains.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The slugcat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rain-world">Rain World</a> is a distinct little character. He flops around, squeezing through narrow tunnels with a movement that's both cute and mildly gross. When he is eaten by a passing disco lizard or ravenous skull-faced vulture, it is because he is basically a delicious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirmles">Squirmle</a> existing in a horrifying cryptozoological ecosystem. He is, however, never stepped upon by a mech with a missile launcher. He is never given a shotgun and tasked with shooting the other animals. Yet that basically seems to be the elevator pitch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/uruc">Uruc</a>, a sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> set in a distant future where strange life battles mechanical monstrosities. </p>

<p>Solo developer Stefan Haasbroek has been working on the game for over a year so far, recently launching a <a href="https://www.backabuddy.co.za/campaign/uruc-a-locally-developed-pc-video-game">crowdfunding campaign</a> (as spotted by enthusiastic RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/i-let-out-a-hell-yes-when-i-saw-this-game-stars-a-worm-fox-trapped-on-a-dying-world-and-an-even-louder-yes-dude-yes-when-the-trailer-got-to-the-metal-gear-mechs/">PC Gamer</a>). It seems a lot more focused on action and conflict, in contrast to Rain World's exploratory survivalism. At one point, your creature clambers into a minigun. Another moment seems to have the player piloting a mech with powerful weapons. Later, the player appears to be controlling a little ship with turrets. </p>
<p>Other features look very familiar. Your character rolls and tumbles in a similar way to the slugcat, it clambers up and down poles placed in the levels, it plops into water and swims with the same sense of weight. The few examples of dialogue in the trailer also lend a similarly cryptic atmosphere when set against Videocult's strange land, and even the symbol painted on a panel in the background of one shot brings to mind the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1owErvl-vKJuKbr5Bz7pnGwZbONjD7_8hkTSFvqWwxQg/edit#heading=h.lj49b77guhv8">meaningful glyphs</a> scattered around Rain World, such as those used on its "karma gates".  </p>
<p>All that said, it shouldn't be surprising that a developer has taken such thorough inspiration from the catslug. Rain World, for all its quirks and idiosyncrasies, displays a courage unlike many other games. It simulates a world that is unforgiving and beautiful, in which the player often merely feels like a visitor. If someone wants to pump more of that heady toxin into the game-o-sphere, who can blame them? I get the feeling Rain World's influence is going to be felt in more games to come, albeit perhaps more quietly than this. You can sense the shadow of its design philosophy in the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">Forever Winter</a>, for example, another mech-fuelled megawar in which you are merely a passing roach. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been a while since I last played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a>, but that doesn't stop me from listening to the Elwynn Forest theme whenever I need to decompress. And as I understand it, WoW's latest expansion The War Within adds to a game that's largely unrecognisable from those vanilla days. That's not necessarily a bad thing, and with TWW out this very second it does make me think, "Hmmm, what if I do make a return". This happens <em>every</em> time. I'd quite like to see the new continent, the new class features, and the expanded Skyriding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First on the agenda is the new continent: Khaz Algar, which lies off the western shores of Pandaria (a good time, that DLC) and fits with the theme of a subsurface, well, war within. Here you've got the surface level city of Dornogal that acts as the city centre, so to speak, with three other zones all under the surface: The Ringing Deeps, Hallowfall, and Azj-Kahet. The max level has been ramped up to 80, so each of those zones, starting with the Isle Of Dorn, will feature a gradual level climb with the aid of new dungeons.</p>

<p>New instances called Delves can be tackled with up to four pals, along with an NPC companion Brann Bronzebeard (who's customisable through a skill tree). These act a bit like bitesize dungeons, taking around "10-15 minutes on average" and offer puzzles, platforming challenges, boss fights, and rewards that'll help you in future Delves. Tick these off and you'll earn "endgame rewards", similar to those offered by dungeons, raids, PVP, and the like.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Hero Talents are unlocked for players at level 71 and let you specialise classes even further. Essentially, there are talent trees to pick from depending on classes and specialisations, you select a single talent tree to activate, then each time you level up you bang a point into it. They grant you buffs up the wazoo - the technical term. Here's Blizzard's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-gb/news/24125213/take-your-character-to-the-next-level-with-hero-talents">article on it</a>, which breaks it down into more detail.</p>
<p>More mounts are available for skyriding and now you can switch between dynamic flight (the zippy flippy type introduced in the last expansion) or steady flight (kinda normal flying introduced all the way back in The Burning Crusade).</p>
<p>There is, of course, a whole lot more that would take aeons to cover here. Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24116738/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-now-live">War Within page</a> has you covered on that front.</p>
<p>And hey, if you want to know what it was like starting WoW as a newbie a little while back, why not give our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RL05WItuMOI">Inventory Space vid a watch</a>? A relic from a bygone era of Edders and Liam (RPS in peace) doing fun vids together. I miss it dearly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Xbox is expanding its accessibility range with new accessories, including the Xbox Adaptive Joystick and 3D printable thumbstick toppers.
</p>
<p>
The Xbox Adaptive Joystick, due out next year, is a singular joystick with two triggers and four face buttons, essentially acting as half a controller that can be used with either hand, or other body parts.
</p>
<p>
The buttons are completely remappable using the same UI as the existing Xbox Adaptive Controller. Indeed, flexibility is key to all of Xbox's accessibility accessories: the joystick can be used directly with the console, or in conjunction with the Adaptive Controller or Xbox controller. It can also be mounted if unable to be held.
</p>

<p>

The joystick is wired and comes with a two metre cable. There were two reasons for this: firstly, it ensures the controller is lightweight and secondly, it ensures it is more affordable. Too often, accessibility accessories are complex and expensive, so Microsoft's aim was to keep the cost down.
</p>
<p>
Size-wise, the joystick is similar to the Xbox controller, though is slightly longer to allow room for the cable to be plugged in. It also features a simple shape for universality.
</p>
<p>
Development of the joystick began in 2022, with feedback from the community as a major catalyst. Xbox has then worked with players with disabilities and accessibility experts to design this joystick.
</p>
<p>
The joystick will also arrive in accessible packaging. The cardboard box easily unfolds with one hand, there's space around the product for easy removal, and there are no twist ties on the cable. This same packaging will also be used for consoles.
</p>
<p>
I was able to use the joystick at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> for a quick go on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a>, as well as see the packaging for myself. While the joystick is aimed at disabled players, it appears to be a useful addition to controller setups, and the packaging is welcome for all.
</p>
<p>
Further, Xbox has made 3D printable thumbstick topper designs available on the <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-us/configure/adaptive-thumbstick-toppers-xbox-wireless-controller">Xbox Design Lab</a>. This allows users to choose from a variety of different toppers, scale to their preference, and then download the design to be created separately with a 3D printer.

</p>
<p>
The toppers include a dome shape, stick shape, sphere shape, or a custom X shape that can be used with moldable plastic or clay for a unique design. These then clip on to any thumbstick, either on the Xbox controller or the Xbox Adaptive Joystick.
</p>
<p>
Again, 3D printing was chosen for its affordability and widespread use.

<p>These products are welcome additions to Xbox's official accessibility offering, though a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-games-need-a-thriving-third-party-accessibility-scene">thriving third-party accessibility scene</a> is also needed to allow for customisation and solve unique use cases.

		<p>Chainswords chewing through chitinous armour, gratuitous gore soaking the war-torn soil, you’d be forgiven for forgetting that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> has a story to tell. It seems like a long time since we last met Ultramarine Titus, and it is, with the original game launching on the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PC and even the long-forgotten streaming service OnLive in 2011.</p>
<p>Things haven’t turned out all that well for old Titus in the interim, and as we surmised in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/01/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-preview-better-the-boltgun-you-know/">our hands-on at last year’s Gamescom</a>, he’s been skulking around in the edges of the Imperium, dishonoured and sent to deal with the universe’s worst threats as a member of the Deathwatch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Heed the Call of War" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DchUEbEAt8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s forget about all that for a moment though, and go back to those chainswords. Space Marine 2 is the best representation of Warhammer 40,000’s brutalistic sci-fi world we’ve ever had, and while that might mean cribbing from Microsoft’s own Gears of War, I’m willing to bet that the guys at the Coalition and Epic Games have a few Ultramarines squirrelled away in their drawers.</p>
<p>Everything is circular though, as Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits is clear to point out: “40K has influenced so much. I mean, just look at my history; if you get the original Doom Space Marine, what does that look like? If you look at the Lancer chainsaw and Gears of War, where did that come from? If you look at the power armour in Fallout, what does that look like?”</p>

<p>Tim Willits is a man that knows about explosive gunplay. His CV is a cavalcade of weaponry-heavy classics, with his time at id Software covering iconic franchises like Doom, Quake, and Rage. He clearly loves the format, words tripping over themselves in his excitement to talk about Space Marine 2, and how they’ve pushed its own combat forward, “We looked at the push-forward combat in the original Space Marine, you know, and we discussed that and then we added glory kills in 2016 which looked gorgeous in Space Marine 2. I’m like, ‘that’s f****** awesome, do more of that!’ you know?”</p>

<p>That push forward combat is key to Space Marine 2’s feel. “You want to feel like you’re a Space Marine,” Tim says. “Like you’re indestructible, but you can’t make a video game where you’re indestructible. Yet, with the overwhelming and iconic enemies, and then the different varieties that come in, you’ve got to defend and you’ve got to move. It really is dance of death. I like to think that kind of makes you feel like a better Space Marine.”</p>
<p>One of the things that recurred through my hands on was how often I was absolutely on the edge of death. If you let too many Tyranids get in close, then all that armour, all your health, can very swiftly disappear, but it’s at this point that you’re suddenly more tuned in than ever. You parry, you dodge, you perform executions and suddenly gain back some of your armour. Tim loved this, punching the air as I told him my tale, “Yes! But you made it through right? That’s the exact balance that it needs!” Given how hard my heart was pumping at that point, it feels like he’s right.</p>
<p>Despite this being a sequel, Tim’s clear to point out that this is the perfect starting point for people to jump in, “Even if you haven’t played the original, if you’ve not played Space Marine 1, don’t stress it. It’s not a requisite, you know, because it’s hard to even play now.”</p>
<p>He continues, “I don’t want people to stress about that, because this is a different story. Yes, it’s Titus, but it’s been 200 years and he’s been in the Deathwatch. Then they do the Primaris upgrades, and he has his personal journey. So, now he’s got to adhere to the Codex, but he’s learned to kind of be more flexible, you know, so there’s that personal story that is just a great story.”</p>

<p>That’s one aspect we’ve only been able to get a small taste of during our hands-on time with the game, both this year and at last year’s Gamescom as well. If you’ve played the original, you’ll have a connection to Titus that incoming players won’t, but it feels like the bombastic gunplay, the startlingly vivid 40K world, and the incredible visuals will do just as good a job of drawing you in.</p>
<p>Despite the clarity with which Saber have captured the galaxy of Warhammer 40,000, it hasn’t always been the easiest journey. Given the franchise’s legacy and just how important it is to Games Workshop for things to be accurate, hasn’t always made a video game adaptation the easiest thing to create.</p>
<p>Tim tells us, “Games Workshop are super involved. Everything from the insignia to the expression on Titus’s face, they are hand-in-hand involved. Even, you know, I’ll make this example, our ankle armour was the wrong size and they’re like ‘the ankle armour…’”</p>
<p>He smiles, “45 years ago when they created the first Space Marine [figures], they probably didn’t think that he had to be in a video game 45 years in the future and get him to walk and to fight. That was very challenging, and the team’s been years working on that, but you know, everything’s there now thanks to the team.”</p>

<p>It’s been worth it. If you know Warhammer 40,000, Space Marine 2 is going to blow you away. The level of visual fidelity Saber has been able to bring to bear on this game would easily win the team <a href="https://golden-demon.com/">a Golden Demon award</a> or two. They’ve also taken the opportunity to further improve on the incredible swarm technology we originally saw in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/26/world-war-z-review-wwz-ps4-xbox-pc/">World War Z</a>, and if you want to experience terror, just wait until you see a swarm of Tyranids coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>“We’ve created a new evolution of the swarm tech in this game along with the AI director, so we’re now we’re able to create these truly holy s*** moments, every battle.” Tim continues, “When the Tyranid swarm comes at you and finally kind of starts to break apart – in World War Z the zombie kind of broke apart, but they’re just dumb zombies – in Space Marine 2 those Tyranids, they start thinking and they want to f*** you up, and that all goes back to the AI director coordinating these battles.”</p>
<p>It’s clear that Tim is loving his time overseeing Space Marine 2, and it feels as though that’s fed into the wider development team. Those lessons he learned at id Software – “Trust me, you learn best when you make mistakes.” – have meant that Space Marine 2 is an evolution of the old-school shooter, an evolution of the first game, and an evolution of Saber’s already impressive tech. If you’re looking for the action game of the year, you might well have found it.</p>

            <p>This morning I left my torpid flat in search of coffee, sniffed the restive wind, noted with approval the gloom gathering beneath the trees, and thought: at last, summer is over. At last, we quit the disgusting sunlit months. At last we leave all that is green and good behind, and return to the time of monsters.</p>
<p>Supermassive Games and Behaviour Interactive must have gotten the memo too. They've just released a demo for their next horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-casting-of-frank-stone">The Casting Of Frank Stone</a>, in which you are a policeman, Sam Green, who is investigating the disappearance of a child. The search leads you to Cedar Hills Steel Mill, "where chilling secrets await, revealing a far more sinister truth than anyone could have anticipated". I am anticipating: QTEs during escape sequences, branching choices that get people killed, and General Mature Content appropriate to the coming of Halloween.</p><!--more-->
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassive-reveal-the-casting-of-frank-stone-a-single-player-dead-by-daylight-game">Revealed in December</a>, The Casting Of Frank Stone is a single player endeavour that, going by what I've seen so far, takes the playable B-movie format of Until Dawn and applies it to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> multiverse of Dead by Daylight. "This demo serves as the prologue to the main game, offering a deeply engaging segment packed with twists, turns, and hidden Easter eggs that fans of Dead by Daylight will be eager to uncover," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223840/The_Casting_of_Frank_Stone/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"While the progression from the demo will not carry over to the full game, it provides a unique opportunity to experiment with the game's mechanics and explore various outcomes and secrets by testing different paths and choices," it goes on. The full game, out next week on 3rd September, features a young ensemble cast, and sees you pursuing a serial killer whose crimes "spawn horrors beyond comprehension".</p>
<p>The launch of The Casting Of Frank Stone follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">mass</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">layoffs</a> at both Behaviour and Supermassive, with both companies attributing the decision to "challenging" wider industry conditions. Supermassive are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">porting Until Dawn to PC</a> and working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. Behaviour's current focus appears to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lara-croft-is-the-next-survivor-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">chucking every halfway-horror-adjacent character ever imagined</a> into Dead By Daylight's woodchipper.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Considering its huge success during its first week, it's no surprise that modders are already busy tinkering with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>.
</p>
<p>
Mods so far range from small tweaks to new character models, though perhaps the most inevitable of all was adding Dragon Ball Z's Goku as the main character.
</p>
<p>
Both Black Myth: Wukong and Dragon Ball Z are based on the Chinese novel Journey to the West, and both The Destined One and Goku are based on the character Sun Wukong from the novel.

<p>

Modder <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/84?tab=description">NorskPL has therefore added Goku</a> as a playable character - his anime style is pretty out of place in the game's gorgeous environments, but Dragon Ball fans will surely have a laugh with this. There's also a second mod that adds the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/99">Goku model from Jump Force</a>.

That's not all though: the same modder has also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/80">created Darth Maul from Star Wars</a>, whose double-ended lightsaber is an easy swap for The Destined One's staff.

ApolloHoo, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/78">added in a jar helmet</a> in a nod to Let Me Solo Her from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>. Just remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-is-a-brilliant-boss-rush-but-is-it-a-soulslike">Black Myth: Wukong isn't a Soulslike</a>.

Or perhaps you're a Final Fantasy fan, in which case maybe you'd like to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/41">play as Tifa</a>? Thanks to modder Yui, you can do just that.

<p>
If you're after something a little more useful, though, modders wmm555 and bilibiliGM have created the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/blackmythwukong/mods/60?tab=description">Simple Map mod</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game has so far been criticised for not including a map, and while it's mostly linear, it can still be easy to get lost when fast travelling between areas.
</p>
<p>
The mod adds a fullscreen map that players can zoom in and out of, as well as display resources. Handy!
</p>
<p>
Black Myth: Wukong has already <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">sold 10m units in under a week</a>. Even on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">first day on Steam it hit over 2 million concurrent players</a> to become the platform's most played single-player game of all time.

		<p>If you are a fan of open world sandboxes such as Goat Simulator then Squirrel With A Gun might be the game for you, and it’s heading to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on October 15th 2024.&nbsp; As the name suggest you play as full armed squirrel with “love for crime and mayhem.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Squirrel with a Gun - Console Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeAQ9zpZg8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You can play as a nice or nasty squirrel and solve&nbsp; puzzles to unlock golden acorns, collect enough of those and you will unlock new areas of the game.&nbsp; Here’s more about the title:</p>
<p>
<h4>Squirrel, meet gun</h4>
</p>
<p>As the neighborhood’s most obnoxious rodent, develop a knack (and a love?) for crime and mayhem in pursuit of golden acorns in this nutty sandbox shooter and puzzle platformer. Fight tooth, claw, and gun to escape a secret underground facility and defeat the Agents.</p>
<p>
<h4>Fight tooth, claw, and gun</h4>
</p>
<div>
<p>Discover what an erratic squirrel is capable of with a gun in its paws (or just its paws) and how far how far this fuzzy fiend will go to collect its acorns. Escape a secret underground facility and defeat the Agents. Upgrade your weapons and locate the other secret bunkers to take down elite bosses, even blow up a tank. Swap out weapons to try your paw at all 12 types of enemy takedowns.</p>

</div>
<p>
<h4>Solve Intricate Puzzle Rooms to Collect Golden Acorns</h4>
</p>
<p>Navigate unique puzzle challenges to collect all the golden acorns by getting creative with how you use your arsenal of weapons, using weapon recoil to give yourself a boost. Collect enough golden acorns to unlock hidden sections of the game.</p>
<p>
<h4>Have Some Nutty Sandbox Fun</h4>
</p>
<p>Explore the world from a squirrel’s eye view or cruise around in your toy car. Harass the neighborhood or ask for nice pets from curious passersby. Help them out in exchange for goodies (or simply mug them), and unlock cosmetics to create your squirrely style.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
PlayStation multiplayer shooter Concord has suffered a terrible launch on Steam, where just 660 people played concurrently over the weekend at the game's peak.
</p>
<p>
The last 24 hours have seen this number falling further still - <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/2443720#3m">now</a>, with a daily peak of just 267 players.
</p>
<p>
Concord is also available on PlayStation 5, of course, though it doesn't seem to have made a huge impact there, either. Looking through Sony's <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/d0446d4b-dc9a-4f1e-86ec-651f099c9b29/1">PlayStation Store</a> by "Best Selling" games finds Concord around 30-something places down. (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, predictably, is currently top.)
</p>
<p>
After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">eight years in development</a>, Concord has arrived to muted fanfare, in a landscape already saturated by live-service games, and in the same week as breakout hit Black Myth: Wukong. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-08-27-103826.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Concord is the first game released by Firewalk, the PlayStation-owned studio founded by veterans of Activision and Bungie. It's a hero shooter live service with a £35 pricetag but no paid battle pass, with future seasons funded by the option to purchase additional cosmetic-only items. </p>
<p>A mix of Guardians of the Galaxy-style sci-fi humour and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>-style gameplay mechanics, the base game features six modes, 12 maps and 16 characters. Firewalk has committed to expanding this over time - firstly in October when Season 1 arrives, and then again in both January and April 2025 when Season 2 and 3 arrive.</p>
<p>
"Spare a thought for poor Concord, a kind and earnest shooter sent out to die," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spare-a-thought-for-poor-concord-a-kind-and-earnest-shooter-sent-out-to-die">Eurogamer's Concord impressions</a> last week. "I genuinely hope it does bang.  But like so many other nice young games with bright intentions, and all matter of other, rival forms of 'content', it's now Concord's turn to go dutifully over the top. Out of the trenches of development and into no man's land it goes."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-launching-on-november-14.964299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-launching-on-november-14/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The release date of LEGO Horizon Adventures was leaked by Sony itself via the PlayStation Blog. Reddit user foreveryoung1108 was the first to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1f21kp5/lego_horizon_adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">share</a> a screenshot of the announcement. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch on November 14.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-annonounced-release-date-pc-ps5-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at Summer Game Fest 2024 after several rumors. It is being co-developed by Horizon franchise creator Guerrilla Games and British developer Studio Gobo, which has previously helped make games like F1 2012, Disney Infinity: Toy Box 2.0, Disney Infinity: 3.0, For Honor, Forza Street, Hyper Scape, Hogwarts Legacy, and Synced.</p>
<p>The game's story will retread the events first narrated in Horizon Zero Dawn, albeit in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-will-feel-lighthearted-while-keeping-the-characters-as-they-are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lighthearted</a> and family-friendly way, given the different target audience. As such, the apocalyptic storyline will be downplayed, focusing instead on the environmental messages and Aloy's connections with her family and friends. The studio's goal was to make the franchise accessible to young newcomers, offering both the slapstick humor typically found in Lego games and the self-referential comedy found in the Lego movies. The Lego Movie reportedly inspired the visuals and animation.</p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures will offer cooperative play both locally via splitscreen and online. However, there won't be any cross-play between the platforms. Moreover, the absence of the Xbox is a bit of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mystery</a>, although the easiest explanation is that Sony simply doesn't want to bring even a spin-off of the Horizon franchise to its chief rival console.</p>

            <p>If you live in the UK, you may have noticed that this week is shy a working day. Credulous fools attribute this to the existence of a "bank holiday" on Monday 26th, but true initiates like ourselves know the sobering truth: <em>the Maw has eaten one of our weekdays</em>. We have dispatched our finest gastronauts equipped with extremely long pairs of tweezers to retrieve the missing Monday from the Maw's bowels. We can only hope it hasn't been digested yet - imagine living in a world with a four-day working week? The horror. Anyway, here are this week's PC game releases of note.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On Tuesday 27th August, an unholy gnashing of teeth and the early access release of mytho-MOBA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a>. Also, the launch of cat-in-hell metroidvania <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2394650/Crypt_Custodian/">Crypt Custodian</a>, together with sitar-playing Middle Eastern action-platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2816570/The_Land_of_the_Magnates/">The Land Of The Magnates</a>. On Wednesday 28th August, a ribald smacking of lips and the release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959580/Supermoves/">Supermoves</a>, aka multiplayer Mirror's Edge, aka first-person parkour royale. Also, immersive first-person-melee RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/corpus-edax">Corpus Edax</a> and apocalyptic anime girl rhythm game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2581050/KAMITSUBAKI_CITY_ENSEMBLE/">Kamitsubaki City Ensemble</a>. On Thursday 29th August, a mighty sneezing and the launch of Square Enix's latest RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/visions-of-mana">Visions Of Mana</a>. Also, the retro side-scrolling of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543760/Shadow_of_the_Ninja__Reborn/">Shadow Of The Ninja - Reborn</a>, the deck-building base defence of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2022930/WARCANA/">Warcana</a>, the defensively-inclined action of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodless">Bloodless</a>, and the self-explanatory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With A Gun</a>. And on Friday 30th August, an uncontrollable giggling and the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Also, office-based RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920570/Dale__Dawson_Stationery_Supplies/">Dale &amp; Dawson Stationery Supplies</a>, billed as "a covert battle of productivity versus procrastination". My goodness, they made a game just for me.</p>
<p>As ever, these are just the PC games that jump out as noteworthy while my brain spins up to its standard operating threshold of 15 RPM. There are probably some decent ones I've missed - please sing out about it in the comments. You can keep track of what we fondly call "our journalism" in the news liveblog below. Have a fun week! And yes, cross your fingers for the safe return of Mondays.</p><div data-live="true">

		<p>You can’t keep a good hedgehog down, even if you go through a 3D wilderness of mediocrity for a decade. Only a few years ago, Sonic looked as though he was on his way out. The mascot for a company that no longer makes the systems he was exclusively created for, the transition to polygons and 3D didn’t do many favours for a character whose sole purpose was to go fast in one direction. Still, a resurgence via the three pronged assault of Sonic Mania, Sonic Frontiers, and the surprisingly good Sonic cinematic universe – it’s a universe if there’s a TV show, right? – and old blue spikes is back on top.</p>
<p><iframe title="SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS - Doom Powers Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7N-64Uzx2ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Sonic X Shadow Generations we’re taking a step back and a step forward though, with the addition of a darker shade of hedgehog bringing something new to proceedings, alongside a shiny remaster of one of the few standout titles of the Xbox 360/PS3 era. And no, he’s not bringing his guns.</p>


<p>Sonic Team know exactly what they’re doing, and Generations remains a high spot in the most recent Sonic canon. It starts with the perfect Sonic opening jingle, and immediately sends you off to Green Hill Zone, giving you the much needed dopamine hit of nostalgia as you wonder how much slower your reflexes have become in the intervening years. I completed the first course with an S rating – based on Time, Rings and avoiding death – so they can’t be too bad quite yet.</p>


<p>Shadow Generations exists as its own game alongside the remastered Generations, and you can immediately see the key differences in the roller-blade equipped Shadow over his bluer brethren. Our first level, Space Colony Ark Act 1, sees Shadow gain a new move called Chaos Control, which slows time, allowing you to avoid danger, or just mash it into little pieces by hammering a button.</p>
<p>You’re constantly under pressure here from a dimension-hopping entity that shares a little bit of Shuma Gorath tentacle-ness as they mutter away at you about not being able to avoid your fate. This is all going on amidst some zippy 3D Sonic action, and it feels exactly as you’d hope, though it’s also a little constrained feeling after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/16/sonic-frontiers-review/">Sonic Frontiers</a>.</p>

<p>The new abilities come thick and fast though, as Shadow can also Doom Surf, riding across water on a dark wave of something that doesn’t look all that good – I suppose that would be the ‘Doom’ bit covered. Shadow does seem to have fallen into Lord of the Rings in Kingdom Valley, a level that has a fair bit of eagle grabbing, but admittedly, not a smidgen of Hobbit.</p>
<p>Our hands-on included checking out one of the bosses, with the Biolizard being a huge… well, lizard, with a variety of cables, tentacles, and pink bubbles coming off its body. This is classic 3D Sonic, with the homing attack combining with running around leading to a relatively swift victory. It was enjoyable enough, but the enemy design here certainly wasn’t up to the same level we’ve seen here otherwise.</p>

<p>It’s an interesting approach to a remaster, with the Sonic Generations buff-up feeling traditional and safe, while so far Shadow feels off-kilter and slightly weird. I’m here for it though, and if the level design remains as enjoyable as what we’ve seen here, then I’m sure fans of Sonic, and Shadow, will be well served this winter.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Right from its announcement, Sonic x Shadow Generations sounded more than a simple remaster. While the Sonic segment of the adventure would be left virtually untouched, besides some visual improvements, the all-new Shadow segment promised to bring something new to the table, with brand new levels and mechanics unavailable in the original portion of the game. After playing the game during Gamescom 2024, I can say that the game will indeed be more than a simple remaster, feeling closer to an actual direct sequel to the original.</p>
<p>My time with Sonic x Shadow Generations was not particularly long, so I focused primarily on the new Shadow content, only playing through the two Green Hill acts with Sonic. The game was exactly as I remember it, and had no trouble going through both acts fairly quickly. Those who never played the original are in for something rather good, as Sonic Generations is, in my opinion, one of the best 3D Sonic the Hedgehog games ever released.</p>
<p>The new Shadow content in Sonic x Shadow Generations seems to be as well realized as that of the original game. The Gamescom demo featured two full stages, including the Kingdom Valley stage revealed in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N-64Uzx2ac">latest trailer</a>, and two full boss battles - the Biolizard and Metal Overlord, the latter made more epic by Crush 40's What I'm Made Of playing in the background. Compared to Classic and Modern Sonic stages, Shadow's stages were way longer and more complex, featuring a lot of different paths to the end goal and what felt like a higher number of enemies, giving these stages a slightly higher combat focus. Shadow's moveset also felt a little more complex than Sonic's, with a clear influence from Sonic Frontiers. Still, the level design for the Shadow stages was still deeply rooted in Generations philosophy, so the new stages definitely did not feel out of place in the experience. Setting the character apart further is the Chaos Control ability, which allows the player to slow down time on command, which has a few interesting uses.</p>

</figure>


<p>The Sonic Frontiers influence was felt in the two boss battles as well. Both the Biolizard and Metal Overlord have multiple phases that require players to expose weak points and use Shadow's abilities to win, and they both felt decently designed, although the Metal Overlord battle was much better due to the soundtrack and bigger scale. The Biolizard battle felt a little more clunky, but it's almost tradition at this point to have clunkiness in a Sonic the Hedgehog game.</p>
<p>The Shadow stages in Sonic x Shadow Generations also looked more visually advanced, as even Shadow's model sported greater detail, better fur, and so on. Sadly, it seems like this comes at a cost, as these new stages did not run well at all on PlayStation 5. One of the stages ran at a very unstable framerate that felt closer to 30 than 60 FPS, so there could be some performance concerns in the final game. As we are a few months away from release, however, these issues could be solved with proper optimization, which is definitely possible, as Sonic x Shadow Generations doesn't exactly feature cutting-edge visuals that could have trouble running on current consoles.</p>
<p>While I would have been satisfied with just replaying Sonic Generations with some minor additions, the new Shadow content will likely bring the Sonic x Shadow Generations to heights that the original did not reach. As such, the game is setting out to be the one to get for fans of traditional Sonic the Hedgehog games that did not like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/">Sonic Frontiers</a>' open-world approach.</p>
<p>Sonic x Shadow Generations launches on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch on <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-releases-on-october-25th-new-trailer-released/">October 25th, 2024</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-hasnt-been-messed-with-says-konami-console-graphics-modes-confirmed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>KONAMI recently held a preview event for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, inviting select press to play the game.&nbsp;A few developers were also on hand to discuss the highly anticipated remake.</p>
<p>Producer Noriaki Okamura, for instance, a veteran who worked on Metal Gear Solid V, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/we-didnt-want-to-mess-with-the-original-hands-on-with-metal-gear-solid-3s-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> VGC:</p>
<p><em>This is one of my favorite titles as well, and since the game was already good, to begin with, we didn’t want to mess around the original creative direction of the game. There are a lot of things that we didn’t feel necessary to change.</em></p>
<p>That is not to say there are no changes in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. Okamura said:</p>
<p><em>This is a 20-year-old game. So when we decided to bring to modern platforms, we didn’t want to make it feel like an old game. We did refine a lot of things to make sure that for those who didn’t play the original, it still feels like a game that came out in this day and age.</em></p>
<p><em>We are well aware that some of the expressions may have been outdated. We have a content warning, however, we left the content in out of respect of maintaining the original creator’s vision that he had for the game. That was an executive decision to leave it in. There are parts that have been modernized and players are vastly different than they were 20 years ago, so there are definitely tweaks, but in terms of story and plotline, we left them as is.</em></p>
<p>Okamura also hinted that KONAMI's plan may go beyond Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater:</p>
<p><em>Our focus right now is to rebuild the creative team, we have some of the core members of the original team, but right our focus is making sure we can deliver the Metal Gear series in this day and age if that takes off, hopefully, we can do more with it.</em></p>
<p>At the event, KONAMI confirmed the console graphics modes. On PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, users will be able to choose between a dynamic 4K/30 FPS mode and a performance mode targeting 1080p resolution and 60 FPS.</p>
<p>There's no release date yet for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but this event proves we're likely not far from getting an announcement. Pre-orders have already been <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-opens-pre-orders-confirms-battle-scars-will-remain-on-snake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-jam-showdown-review.964275/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-jam-showdown-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’re on the hunt for an impractically large, American truck that doesn’t run on conventional fuel and looks ridiculous, are you going to go with a stainless steel Tesla triangle that wants to eat your fingers, or would you opt for an 11-foot tall, methanol-powered brute that can do literal <em>backflips</em>? I know which one I’d choose. If my friends and family are going to dunk on me for driving a truck that looks deeply unserious, it’s going to be because it’s dressed like a spooky pirate.</p><p>Monster Jam Showdown is equally devoted to these five-ton doofuses shaped like dogs and dinosaurs. While it’s very modest in scope, developer Milestone has injected this family-friendly racer with an enjoyably drift-heavy driving feel, a wild range of stunts, and great damage effects.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Monster Jam Showdown ditches the open world approach of the otherwise mediocre Steel Titans games. It’s not something I miss personally, but this may come as a disappointment to anybody that previously relished rampaging around those open environments between curated events.</p><p>The maps in Showdown may <em>look</em> like open worlds with races and events scattered across them, but they’re not. In fact, the map screens could have just been a bar of event thumbnails, or an ordered list; Showdown doesn’t gain anything from having us shuffling around and zooming into maps within maps seeking out the next available event. It actually feels like a waste of time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As with Steel Titans and 2020’s Monster Truck Championship, Showdown features independent rear-wheel steering controlled by the right stick.</p></div><p>The <em>driving</em> feel, however, is very good. I found it particularly nice to have all the handling aids off, and I enjoy the sensation of slinging these huge vehicles into drifts and seeing them squat back and powerslide through bends on the throttle. As with Steel Titans and 2020’s Monster Truck Championship, Showdown features independent rear-wheel steering controlled by the right stick. It’s a great point of difference with these sorts of racers, and it’s a very satisfying extra element of racing to master. My 10-year-old, on the other hand, was more comfortable with some of the assists on – particularly the steering aid that applies <em>some</em> angle to the rear wheels automatically, but also lets him crank a little more on himself as he got more confident using the right stick to really whip around tight corners. Splitscreen has been a success; if he’s losing and still laughing that’s generally a strong signal something is going right.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Crush Hour</h2><p>While the regular driving is rooted in a degree of reality, the stunt controls are far more fantastical and give us total control of the truck’s rotation in the air. Sure, it’s not especially <em>realistic</em>, but it is plenty of fun to string together lengthy, Tony Hawk-style combos in the stunt arenas. It wasn’t particularly challenging to accumulate huge scores (and building and maintaining a combo should be pretty simple for those with plenty of racing experience) but some of the moves do require a fair bit of finesse – like nailing a perfect nose wheelie and moonwalking your truck backwards. One noticeable blemish is the way trucks interact with crush cars; they collide with and bounce off them <em>way</em> too harshly. It made me more inclined to avoid them rather than squish them, which seems antithetical to monster trucking.</p><p>There are two layers of difficulty beneath the normal AI option, including an easy and very easy mode. Showdown does seem suitable for an audience that will invariably include very young players who are just here to see Grave Digger do donuts.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Showdown does seem suitable for an audience that will invariably include very young players who are just here to see Grave Digger do donuts.</p></div><p>On that note, Showdown is admittedly much smarter than Steel Titans 2 when it comes to unlocking trucks. It won’t hand over the keys to kid-favourites like Grave Digger or Megalodon <em>immediately</em>, but they’ll be earned relatively quickly. This gives you plenty of time to thrash with them on the track, well before you run out of events. For its part, Steel Titans 2 completely buried Monster Jam’s most iconic trucks as distant unlocks, meaning that by the time you secured the most famous ones, you were pretty much out of things to do. It was essentially the automotive equivalent of rolling credits with all the rocket launcher ammo still in your pocket.</p><h2>Big Truck Hunter</h2><p>There are 40 trucks in Showdown, many of which are starring in a video game for the first time. This includes independent trucks like Bad Company, which features a full holographic wrap that is recreated very effectively in-game. Showdown also sees the debut of Excaliber, the current version of a monster truck that’s been around since the ’80s. The trucks all feel the same to drive, but Excaliber’s retro livery and boxy, Chevy square body shell (complete with its array of classic KC Daylighters perched on the roof) have made it my favourite.</p><p>Detail is impressive, including small touches like the scuffed paint on the back of the chassis from standing up during wheelies. It’s things like this that help them feel like real, race-worn vehicles rather than big toys. Damage is also well translated as the trucks shed flapping segments of their fibreglass shells.</p><p>You can unlock and apply bonus liveries and buffs, and those buffs tend to give certain trucks better multipliers for specified tricks. This is an effective way to make us switch around , specifically when you’re looking for an edge to net enough points to earn one of Showdown’s many secondary objectives during the events. Winning is one thing, but often you’ll need to win while also racking up a specific amount of points doing a nominated trick.</p><p>However, there’s admittedly nothing else here to really immerse you into the behind-the-scenes world of monster truck competition as an actual <em>motorsport</em>. Monster Truck Championship still stands alone there. At a minimum, Showdown would’ve really benefited from some kind of custom truck system. Maybe an assortment of plain pickup shells that could be painted and thrown on a standard chassis? Milestone does already have a great, working livery editor in its excellent Hot Wheels Unleashed games, after all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It might have also benefited from a format that better reflects Monster Jam as a touring show, rather than a straightforward list of events to tackle. There are just over 120 events in Showdown, split across circuit races, short head-to-head stages, and freestyle arena activities. Events are short and only tend to take a few minutes.</p><p>The racing is frantic and full of contact, and Milestone has done well to imbue it with a nice sense of speed considering monster trucks top out at 100 miles per hour. The head-to-head races on tight, short stages are the toughest to master against the high-level AI; since you can’t really make a single mistake in these instances I found them rewarding to win. It does all get a bit repetitive, though. Monster Jam Showdown’s mid-price sensibilities appears to have kept the selection of tracks a bit modest and, in order to save fresh ones until late in the game, Showdown will have you racing on the same (or mostly similar) courses in consecutive races. The weather conditions may change, but overall this gets a bit tedious. More stadium and arena variety would’ve helped, also.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters.964272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/gundam-breaker-4-review-build-fighters<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As someone who has been a Gundam fan for a long time, it was always inevitable that I’d cross paths with Gunpla at some point. Gunpla, which is short for Gundam and Plastic Model, has long been a staple of the series and even surpassing traditional media. It’s become fitting then, that it looped back around to the realm of video games with endless customization potential.</p>
<p>But this isn’t the first time that’s happened, as we’re now up to <em>Gundam Breaker 4 </em>– the fourth game in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/new-gundam-breaker-review-gunpla-galore"><em>Gundam Breaker</em></a> series that brings the customization and building aspect of real-life Gunpla into a virtual space.</p>
<p>That virtual space aspect is played up quite a bit in <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> as players are introduced to a digital arcade-like world from the jump, and it’s in this lobby where everything in the game takes place.</p>
<p>The story of <em>Gundam Breakers 4</em> is simple but effective enough in the way it’s told through chapter-based missions. While it is a sequel to the events of the previous game, it’s clear from the jump that it’s not required for any sort of understanding. The player in-game is a newcomer, and they’re here to take part in the beta test version of the Gunpla Battle Simulator that has since expanded to a home console release.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-01.jpg?itok=NWiLCsnw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-01.jpg?itok=BsDal4oq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In the game lobby, another newbie known as Tao along with a female fighter known as Rin start up a clan together with the player, and from there, other fighters of all ranks and experience will show up to try and become allies too – all while some mysterious glitches and curious characters keep appearing in the Gundam Battle Simulator.</p>
<p>Certainly, the story isn’t as crazy as something you might see in say, the <em>Super Robot Wars</em> series, but as a vehicle to get Gunpla parts, it serves its purpose enough with more engaging turns happening after a fairly slow start. I was expecting perhaps a little more narrative-driven focus given the concept of <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> isn’t too far removed from what the anime series <em>Gundam Build Fighters</em> did before it, but the most interesting part is meeting all the different quirky characters and the whole concept of them playing a beta test together where things can go awry at any moment.</p>
<p>The gameplay is a little more exciting with an action-focused rogue-like that relies very much on how you customize and put together Gunpla. You’ve got the option to install two ranged weapons such as rifles and other guns, and two melee weapons like the beam saber or axe. There’s actually a huge assortment to choose from and this is the part that makes <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> shine the most.</p>
<p>During missions, the base gameplay loop involves executing combos, and the longer you chain one up, the better rewards you might get, which can in turn give you more options for Gunpla building. The key is to land higher ranks at the end of every mission, with S-Rank being the best. Ranking is also determined by how fast you get through each challenge, and how many enemy parts you can Break off by dealing lots of damage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-02.jpg?itok=0tJ6BlF6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-02.jpg?itok=ZS4lWE_h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are even additional abilities aside from normal attacks. In the Gunpla build menu, you can set Optional and Builder Part skills, which grant special OP Skills based on how much the EX Guage bar is filled up and can deal out stronger attacks. They’re important to set up because some of the boss battles can be really challenging, and you’ll need any advantage you can get.</p>
<p>That said, the hack-and-slash gameplay can get repetitive over time, even when the missions start mixing it up as part of the main story. There’s also an online mode you can play with other people including online leaderboards, as well as a practice mode to test the waters before taking a new build out into the field.</p>
<p><em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> also has some quests that unlock Gunpla parts and a Diorama Mode that lets you pose your Gunpla after all your hard work.</p>
<p>So there is a decent amount of things to do in <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em>, but again, the biggest draw is the Gunpla building. There are hundreds of kits available, and just as many parts to collect through the course of normal gameplay. I found the most fun I had with the game just trying to make the ugliest, most extra mobile suit I could.</p>
<p>But after a while, you can collect enough parts to have most of them in a set, and they’ve all got different stats and rarity labeled so it makes it easy to build the best one you want to battle with.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-03.jpg?itok=hMidOjO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gundam-breaker-4-03.jpg?itok=1nCG8ugY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After playing the story for a while, collected parts can be upgraded using the Synthesize menu, with the ability to swap out traits to build the most powerful Gunpla. I could spend hours just trying to put together the best kit, it’s really impressive just how much <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> lets you customize all while bringing in those familiar mobile suits from the series.</p>
<p>I could spend hours just trying to put together the best kit, it’s really impressive just how much <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> lets you customize all while bringing in those familiar mobile suits from the series. These familiar suits also show up during situations like boss encounters as well, so for example, I ended up having to take on a giant version of the powerful Unicorn Gundam that required a bit more strategy to defeat than the usual grunts.</p>
<p><em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> keeps a somewhat stylized 3D look throughout, with characters appearing in an anime style similar to the modern anime series. The mobile suits have a fairly clean look, but they fit when you realize they’re representing Gunpla.</p>
<p>My only gripe is the environments are pretty basic, there’s not much going on in terms of modeling, but it’s a small complaint when there are so many Gunpla parts in the game.</p>
<p>Overall, <em>Gundam Breaker 4</em> is a game designed for the fans of Gundam. There’s plenty to interact with and recognize from the original series, all while spending time making your own custom model with a massive supply of parts to do so.</p>
<p>The story isn’t the greatest and the hack-and-slash gameplay does get repetitive after a while despite the ability to mix up skills. That said, if you’re just looking for a model kit simulator, there’s plenty of fun to be had until the next <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs-maxi-boost-on">Gundam game</a> comes around.</p>

<p>On August 30, Rainbow Six Siege’s Operation Twin Shells will be released worldwide, bringing a fresh update to the platform. This major update will bring the new Operator, Skopos, but we’ll also see a range of tweaks applied to existing Operators. In this update, Ubisoft is also introducing enhanced anti-cheat measures and a few quality-of-life features.</p>



<p>Let’s find out what’s coming in Operation Twin Shells.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-plenty-in-store">Plenty in Store</h2>



<p>Operation Twin Shells is the next major Rainbow Six Siege update, and it arrives globally on August 30.</p>



<p>At the top of the update table sits Skopos, an all-new Operator with a unique twist. Owing to a disability, Skopos cannot enter the battlefield directly, but she can control two robot characters, each with their own purpose in the fight. One is more active and can be controlled like a regular Operator, while the other assumes a defensive position and a monitoring-focused role.</p>



<p>Players will be excited to learn that <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6md8NyzcybEjZ2bMROA5fP/rainbow-six-siege-operation-twin-shells-operator-and-gadget-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft is introducing</a> a range of anti-cheat and anti-toxicity measures when Operation Twin Shells is deployed. This includes multiple concurrent detection systems, binary hardening to protect the game’s code, and a faster ‘Time to Ban’ metric.</p>



<p>In terms of anti-toxicity measures, Ubisoft is introducing an overhaul of the Reputation system <strong>and </strong>enhancing reporting systems and censorship mechanics.</p>



<p>Several changes are being made to what’s already in the game, too. For instance, Solis, Dokkaebi, and NOKK are all being balanced to address some ‘overpowering’ elements – or <strong>underpowered</strong> mechanics. Ubisoft has expanded the Versus AI mode, implemented ‘After Action 2.0’, and created something called Siege Cup.</p>



<p>The Siege Cup platform is in beta and will only be available for PC players at present, but it offers a solid competitive structure for teams to take on all comers. Those successful in the Siege Cup will win a new currency that can <strong>only </strong>be unlocked in competitive playlists, and it’ll be used to unlock special packs and boosters.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Operation Twin Shells?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Canadian Leaves DarkZero On Rough Terms After Three Years On the Team]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/canadian-leave-darkzero-three-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/canadian-leaves-darkzero-on-rough-terms-after-three-years-on-the-team.964260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/canadian-leave-darkzero-three-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Troy ‘Canadian’ Jaroslawski, one of the most decorated Rainbow Six players of all time, has stepped back from DarkZero and will be moving to Soniqs to play out the remainder of the season. In 2021, Canadian joined DarkZero after a brief retirement, and not long after he came back, the team won the Six Charlotte Major.</p>



<p>Now, he’s moving away from the team, but it’s not an amicable departure.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-deserved-better">‘I Deserved Better’</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, DarkZero announce the departure of Canadian with a montage of some of the player’s best moments, but the man himself fired back with a damning statement:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After putting the time, effort, sacrifice, and thought that I did into this team for 3 years<strong> I thought I deserved better </strong>than this coming without any sort of discussion or attempt to resolve issues. I’d be remiss not to say I’m disappointed in how most of the team handled this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He followed up with a post explaining that he ‘didn’t belong’ at DarkZero and that he’s wholeheartedly looking forward to his future at Soniqs.</p>



<p>Canadian is a two-time Six Invitational champion and has picked up countless chips elsewhere during his lengthy career. Earlier this year, I had the pleasure of watching Canadian compete in Manchester, England during the BLAST R6 Major, which now stands as one of his closing events with DarkZero.</p>



<p>There isn’t a whole lot left in the season, but Canadian will play out the remainder of the year with Soniqs before looking to what comes next.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/in-car-gaming-rise-popular/</link>

<p>In-car gaming isn’t something that I thought I’d be talking about today, but here we are. In recent weeks, we’ve seen car manufacturers strike deals with game developers to bring titles into the confines of a range of motor vehicles. It’s a growing trend that was somewhat started by Tesla when the titanic EV firm gave users the ability to play Steam games through the in-car computer.</p>



<p>Tesla stripped that functionality from vehicles earlier this year, but other manufacturers have since stepped up their in-car gaming capabilities.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-passing-the-time">Passing the Time</h2>



<p>On August 26, Volkswagen announced a partnership with AirConsole, a platform that recently struck a deal with BMW. Through the AirConsole system, users can park up and enjoy a range of games from the comfort of their car. While the games available are rather mundane, this is serving as a baseline of what’s possible.</p>



<p>Presently, users can take advantage of the likes of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (using speech recognition technology) or family-friendly games like Uno. The latter uses mobile phones as input devices, which means anyone sitting in the car, front or back, can get in on the <strong>action</strong>.</p>



<p>Even though Tesla removed Steam functionality from the line-up it operates, it <strong>has </strong>still left the ability to run many other titles on the in-car screen. These include the likes of Stardew Valley, Sky Force, and Fallout Shelter.</p>



<p>They’re all designed to be played when the car is stationary – which means <strong>parked</strong> and not just sitting in traffic somewhere. The idea is that you’ll power up a game while you’re charging your car or taking a break from driving. It was a year or two ago that we saw the likes of Cyberpunk being played through a Tesla, but the expectation is that we’ll be back there soon enough.</p>



<p>Do you think in-car gaming is a waste of time or are you excited to see where it goes?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Horizon Adventures Releasing November 14, According to PlayStation]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-horizon-adventures-releasing-november-14-according-to-playstation.964248/</guid>

<p>It hasn’t been officially announced, but eagle-eyed users have noticed that the PlayStation store page for LEGO Horizon Adventures states the game will be released on November 14. This game was revealed just weeks ago at the Summer Games Fest event, but it garnered a lot of attention given the serious popularity of the wider Horizon franchise.</p>



<p>If the listing on the PlayStation Store isn’t an error, there isn’t all that long to wait before LEGO Horizon Adventures is released worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-but-cute">The End of the World, But Cute</h2>



<p>Horizon is a prestigious franchise that was kickstarted on PlayStation 4 back in 2017 with ‘Zero Dawn’. This gorgeous, post-apocalyptic series has since been expanded with a follow-up title, a VR game, and now, a LEGO title. It has also transcended PlayStation and found its way to PC, and bizarrely, LEGO Horizon Adventures will also be released on Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Netflix was poised to develop a series based on the franchise, but in July, reports surfaced that the production had been canned.</p>



<p>However, according to PlayStation, it won’t be all that long until we’ve got another iteration of the series, this one in the adorable form of a LEGO game. It’s the Horizon that we know and love, and Aloy is still the protagonist, but it’s all a bit more tongue-in-cheek and humorous, such is the nature of a LEGO game.</p>



<p>It’s also the first Horizon game to boast cooperative gameplay elements – <strong>and </strong>it has couch co-op, which is a rarely seen sight these days.</p>



<p>Per the listing, LEGO Horizon Adventures will be released on November 14.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-the-gathering-bloomburrow.964164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The current&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>&nbsp;set,&nbsp;<em>Bloomburrow</em>, is basically the unofficial&nbsp;<em>Redwall</em>&nbsp;trading card game. It features cute critters, from mice to otters to raccoons, accomplishing adorable and audacious feats. Along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-foundations-beginner-box-helps-new-players-start">recently revealed Foundations Beginner Box</a>, it's the perfect entry point to&nbsp;<em>Magic.</em></p>
<p>But which ones are the most charming, the most precious? As the objective arbiter of all things cute, I've gone through 45 set boosters and both starter decks to serve you only the best that <i>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</i>&nbsp;has to offer.</p>
<p>Instead of breaking things down by mana, I've separated them by animals that stood out to me, with two extra buckets. So without further ado, let's dive into this empirically derived, scientifically sound list of the cutest cards we pulled in&nbsp;<em>Bloomburrow</em>. Spoiler alert: The best ones are at the bottom.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Ravishing Rabbits</h2>
<p>Just look at this little dapper gentleman. Intrepid Rabbit is just a sweet little scout, searching for carrots and resources in the forest. I couldn't pull its token, but the general Rabbit token is also an adorable foot soldier.</p>

<p>Something that really stood out to me with the rabbits in&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>&nbsp;is how giddy I get seeing them use human tools. Head of the Homestead is a picturesque representation of a mother taking care of her children, while Druid of the Spade feels like the rabbit is saying, "Look upon my mystic artifact, the spade!"</p>

<p>Continuing the trend of rabbits using tools, look at Finneas, Ace Archer. Finneas looks kind of slick, sort of like a bunny Legolas. And I can't help but think they trained that little tyke on the Short Bow.</p>

<p>To round out the rabbits, Hop to It is such a pure display of celebration and joy, it was hard not to include it here. And the Carrot Cake? My goodness, it's the cutest way to be both incredibly wrong and immensely accurate.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Sweet Squirrels</h2>

<p>Moving onto the squirrels, let's start off with Bushy Bodyguard. I'd trust this little guy with my life, along with his somehow even cuter offspring. No, I will not question the ethics of sending squirrel children into the wars of Bloomburrow.</p>

<p>Squirrels are of course known for foraging for nuts, and these two cards capture that perfectly. Thornvault Forager is just hangin' out, searching for his next meal. And once he gets it, Cache Grab (A+ pun, too) depicts the end result. Just look at those pinchable cheeks!</p>

<p>Foraging squirrels are so cute, it even gave black mana cards an opportunity to be on this list. I'll be honest, I didn't vibe with the black mana cards overall as much, but the desperate squirrels in Consumed by Greed made the cut. And Corpseberry Cultivator, while morbid, also made the mark for me.</p>

<p>But the cutest black mana card in&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>&nbsp;is easily Stargaze. This squirrel looks so high out of its mind, it's about to go on a vision quest.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Adorable Otters</h2>

<p>Next up are the otters, which I primarily found in red and blue mana. Many are also wizards, and there's something about watching sea dogs be mystical that just hits that cute note so well. Like see how amazed the Coruscation Mage looks?</p>

<p>The Thundertrap Wizard gets ready to cast a spell, whispering to voices only he can hear. Or is he sleeping? Unsure, but when I found the token, I had to put it here. Look at its staff--it's actually an oar!</p>

<p>Daring Waverider and its big brother, Bria, Riptide Rogue, really capture that "dog about to go on a walk" energy. There's so much joy in their faces, and they're just out there, carvin' up some waves.</p>

<p>Otterball Antics, however, was&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>card that made me want to make this list. That otter just wants to play fetch, and he got that ball because he's a good boy (yes he is!). Pearl of Wisdom had a similar energy to me, with that look of pure happiness.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Trash Pandas</h2>

<p>The raccoons of Bloomburrow, aka the trash pandas, live up to their stereotypes as the scavengers of this animal kingdom. Take Out the Trash, Keen-Eyed Curator, and Peerless Recycling all capture that, and they're all adorable, especially Peerless Recycling. He's a little guy on a mission!</p>

<p>Wandertale Mentor also stood out to me, because it feels like it's telling a story. This raccoon bard has so many friends and is just trying to bring everyone together! It's so sweet.</p>

<p>But when raccoons need to get down to business, they're still pretty cute. Brambleguard Veteran is keeping an eye out, and Brazen Collector has an&nbsp;<em>Ocean's Eleven</em>&nbsp;vibe going on.</p>

<p>But all the other raccoon cards pale in comparison to Kitnap. Just look at this snoozing little baby! And ignore the Mad Hatter vibes in the background.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Mighty Mice</h2>

<p>Finally, we get to arguably the protagonists of this set, the mice. It's honestly unfair--almost all of the mice I found were cute. Like look at Emberheart Challenger; he's definitely a mighty warrior, but I also want to give him pets. Heartfire Hero arguably looks intimidating, but he's a hero. He wouldn't hurt me for petting him.</p>

<p>No matter what these little rascals are doing, they look cute. Brambleguard Captain is rallying the troops,&nbsp; but all I'm doing is staring at its whiskers. And what's Mouse Trapper doing? We caught it mid-Bigfoot walk, and it's owning the moment.</p>

<p>See what I mean? Every one of these mice soldiers are just too sweet, like they're straight out of a children's picture book.</p>

<p>It was really hard to be choosy here. Valley Rally, Blooming Blast, and War Squeak show some of the cutest war criminals ever, but their names are also illustrative of&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>&nbsp;as a whole. There's a cadence to them that's whimsical. There's rhyme, alliteration, and brilliant word choices. A war cry is barbaric, but a war squeak? Perfection.</p>

<p>Even when these mice are injured or challenged, like in Dewdrop Cure and Early Winter, they're still absolutely adorable. No wonder Disney picked a mouse to be their icon. Just look at their big ears!</p>

<p>To put a bow on the mouse chapter, I want to really drive home just how much this set feels like a children's picture book. Heirloom Epic is so meta, showing a scene of children reading a book with art that looks right out of&nbsp;<em>If You Give a Mouse a Cookie</em>. And Might of the Meek, despite the snake, shows a brave little hero at the climax of his own tail (pun intended, thanks).</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Precious Pairings</h2>

<p>Some of the bets of this set comes from the illustrations of unlikely friendships and pairings that tug at your heartstrings. That childlike hunger in the Bakersbane Duo's eyes is just chef's kiss, and the wonder on Lightshell Duo's faces is just as adorable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While Ruthless Negotiation is a little more violent than Playful Shove, they both show cute scenes of playful antagonism in the animal kingdom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And between Parting Gust and Brave-Kin Duo, there's a story of a rabbit-rat alliance that has waxed and waned as time has passed.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite card out of all of these, though, is Run Away Together. It's so sweet, the conclusion of a long story about the forbidden love between Libo and Pulla.</p>
<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>'s Other Standouts</h2>

<p>Now, you might be wondering where the frogs are. And there were a few I found cute; but for the most part, they weren't doing it for me. But Polliwallop has some roguish charm to him, with those piercing eyes. And Sunshower Druid makes me laugh, like he's presenting the sky to you.</p>

<p>Splash Portal might be the cutest frog in&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Bloomburrow</em>. It's tiny but with big eyes, which is an instant path to the top of the charts. However, I love Overprotect. I want to protect him. I will always call this card Overprotecc.</p>

<p>There are some possums in in this set, and Tender Wildguide felt like a great representation of them. It's like a parent and child, braving the big forest. And the child! It's adorable and hungry!</p>

<p>Lizards don't do it for me much either, in real life or in this set. But Iridescent Vinelasher looks like he's trying to be intimidating but just really isn't, and that sort of juxtaposition always gets me. And the flying lizard in Feather of Flight is so elated!</p>



<p>Speaking of juxtaposition, hear me out on this one. Yes, this terrifying badger definitely lifts, and he is crushing a skull. But also, his name is Hugs. And a few of his scars tell jokes!</p>

<p>The last card I wanted to share is Sugar Coat. The art style stood out to me as the most different across the 45&nbsp;<em>Bloomburrow&nbsp;</em>boosters I pulled, but the shocked rabbit gingerbread cookie was just too hard to pass up.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are many, many more we probably haven't pulled yet that are just as cute if not cuter. After all, this is the unofficial&nbsp;<em>Redwall</em>&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>&nbsp;set (I mean, have you seen Arthur, Marigold Night?). Now I'm off to build the most adorable, very viable Commander deck out there.</p>
