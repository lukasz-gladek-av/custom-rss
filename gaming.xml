            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-async-compute-mod-performance-boost/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Kingdom Come: Deliverance II mod now available online brings significant performance improvements by enabling Async Compute without conflicting with other mods.</p>
<p>The FPS Boost - Enables Async Compute mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/440?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, brings significant performance improvements, mostly on high-end hardware, by enabling the aforementioned tech that is disabled in the vanilla game. The performance boosts vary depending on the hardware, but they are still consistent at every resolution. As showcased in a new video put together by Compusemble, the mod brings a 9.83% average FPS boost at 4K resolution, highest Experimental settings, an 11.88% boost at 1440p, and a 14.52% boost at 1080p on an RTX 4090. Other users are reporting significant performance improvements on other GPUs as well, so the mod is definitely worth a try, although it comes with some reported issues, such as broken lighting effects during rain.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II - Async Compute Mod Delivers Free Performance Boost!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/glKXld7JNTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While a performance boost is always welcome, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is one of the very few games released in the past few years that doesn't require mods to run acceptably on PC. The game developed by Warhorse is a polished day 1 experience that almost feels <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-polished-impeccable-smoothness/">old school</a> in how it did not need any patch to improve either performance or image quality. The game also delivers on pretty much every other front, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">review.</a></p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>A new Pokemon TCG Pocket leak has revealed the upcoming booster pack Triumphant Light, which will feature the Legendary Pokemon Arceus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming from reliable Pokemon TCG Pocket leaks source <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1894551923203637657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CentroLeaks</a>, their new post on X reveals information on the upcoming pack, Triumphant Light. The post features a video that was “uploaded early to Pokémon’s TikTok”, where we see new Eevee, Magnemite, and Goldbat cards coming out of the new pack. At the end of the video, an Arceus Ex card is showcased, and the Legendary Pokemon’s battle skills are revealed, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Underneath the new post, CentroLeaks has commented that the TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light set is “confirmed” and will be released “this week.” This information aligns with the source’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-set-a2a-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous leak</a>, which said the next themed booster pack (A2a) will be released on February 28, 2025, which arrives this Friday. </p>



<p>As per TCG Pocket’s Triumphant Light leak, the Arceus EX card will feature two abilities: Fabled Luster and Ultimate Force. Fabled Luster makes Arceus immune to any Special Conditions and doesn’t cost anything. Ultimate Force, on the other hand, inflicts 70+ base damage and 20 more points for each benched Pokemon. Players need three energy points to use the Ultimate Force and two to Retreat with Arceus Ex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Pokemon TCG Pocket card listings were recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-cards-are-being-listed-on-ebay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted on eBay</a>. Also, the game recently gave away <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-gifting-players-free-trade-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free trade tokens</a> after the community’s feedback on the restriction of the feature.

<p>Rebellion’s 2025 has Atomfall as a headline maker. The survival title shows a new side of England, and Game Pass subscribers—and everyone else—could benefit from a unique history lesson if an agreement is in place between the two companies.</p>



<p>There are genres and tropes it’s hard to get bored of. A dystopian world operating on an alternate timeline is fascinating. Atomic Heart showed us a terrifying look into an alternate-history Soviet Union. Whereas Wolfenstein’s Nazi-dominated world is also an eye-opening prospect. But Fallout is arguably where the focus usually falls.</p>



<p>Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic franchise looks at different areas of America in a world where nuclear war devastated the world. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> doesn’t focus on nuclear devastation but more on radioactive consequences. The concept alone deserves attention, so let’s see if Game Pass is happy to risk it for a radioactive biscuit.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-atomfall-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Atomfall on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Danger lurks everywhere. Credit to Rebellion</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The good news is Atomfall’s release day also coincides with a day-one debut on Game Pass—Xbox’s subscription service.</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft users must apply their radiation suits, arm themself, and prepare for an unpleasant trip to the Lake District. Thankfully, the Lake District is a lovely area of the UK in real life, but in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/atomfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, it’s likely to be riddled with mutants and cultists.</p>



<p>It’s more than tolerable when it’s free though, and this is the benefit you get if you have Game Pass. Rebellion is enjoying a nice partnership with Microsoft as another 2025 release has already gotten the Game Pass treatment—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-sniper-elite-resistance-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Elite Resistance</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-atomfall-on-xbox-game-pass">How to Play Atomfall on Xbox Game Pass</h2>



<p><strong>A valid Game Pass subscription, a working Xbox or PC, and a stable internet connection are all you need to play Atomfall on Xbox Game Pass.</strong></p>



<p>This is how to enjoy Atomfall for free through Game Pass:</p>



<ol>
<li>Log in to your Microsoft account—or make one if you haven’t got one already.</li>



<li>Check your Xbox Game Pass status.</li>



<li>If you don’t have one, go to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Join Xbox Game page</a>&nbsp;and subscribe.</li>



<li>Make your way to the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox Store</strong>&nbsp;once you’ve done this.</li>



<li>Search for&nbsp;<strong>Atomfall</strong>.</li>



<li>Obtain Atomfall through Game Pass on its game page.</li>



<li>Download it.</li>



<li>Once this process is complete, you can play Atomfall.</li>
</ol>



<hr>



<p>If you have some spare time, watch the latest <a href="http://Atomfall Trailer Shows Game’s Features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall trailer showing off the game’s features</a>.</p>



<p>Atomfall is set to fill a Fallout-sized hole in the gaming calendar. With Bethesda’s next post-apocalyptic foray likely several years away, I think Atomfall should work. Do you think this could be the start of a new franchise? Leave a comment and let us know.</p>

        Let Ars help you find some needles in Steam's massive haystack of game trials.
      </p>

<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?tab=23">the Steam Next Fest charts</a> right now, Valve will offer you a glimpse of the 2,228 games offering free downloadable demos as part of the event through Sunday, March 3. That is way too many games to effectively evaluate in such a short time, even with the massive resources of the Ars Orbiting HQ.</p>
<p>But we haven't let that stop us from trying. With the assistance of some early access provided by Valve and game publishers, we've spent the last few days playing dozens and dozens of the most promising Next Fest demos in an attempt to pull out some interesting-looking needles from Valve's massive haystack. Below are the results of that search—a varied list of 11 titles we think are worth investing some time (and zero dollars of money) into a demo download.</p>
<p>But this is just a starting point. Please use the comments below to share any other diamonds in the rough you think your fellow Ars readers need to know about.</p>
<h2><em>Afterblast</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KwBKiG_bVhk?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Lumino Games<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> April 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> FPS, Online Co-Op, Action Roguelike, Roguelite<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1338490/AFTERBLAST/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Start with the roguelike, room-based shooting action of <em>Returnal</em>. Move it to a first-person perspective and add in the double-jump-and-dash movement system of the new Doom games. Throw in a <em>Halo Infinite</em>-style grappling hook that can be used for traversal or combat. The result would come pretty close to <em>Afterblast</em>, a twitch-action shooter that shines from the jump in this fast-paced demo.</p>
<p>This is the kind of game where halting your movement for even a split second often means being instantly overwhelmed by enemies that swarm from all angles. Rather than being hard to handle, though, the game's zippy movement makes it feel relatively simple to jump and dash from ledge to ledge, avoiding bullet-hell style projectile patterns as you do.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The grappling hook is by far the most satisfying part of the demo, though. Beyond jumping out of the way of opposing fire, you can also use it to drag yourself over to stunned enemies, exploding them into piles of goo and collectible items. Bouncing from enemy to enemy in this way, with a few well-placed jumps and dashes in between, felt like being a kid bouncing on a trampoline.</p>
<p>The <em>Afterblast</em> demo provides a feel for the game's randomized item system, which gives access to automated drones, powerful grenades, and other superpowers that should make each run feel unique. We can't wait to see more.</p>
<p><em>-Kyle Orland</em></p>
<h2><em>Castle V Castle</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3WHiA2nZrRE?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nopopo<br>

<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Card Battler, Roguelite, Card Game, PvE<br>

<p>If you remember cult-classic Flash game <a href="https://www.quickflashgames.com/games/castle-wars/"><em>Castle Wars</em></a>, you already know the basics of <em>Castle V Castle</em>. You and your opponent take turns using a handful of cards to either build up your own castle or break down the castle on the other side until one castle has been reduced to rubble. You then improve your deck and do it all again.</p>
<p>Playing effectively means figuring out when to attack, when to defend, and when to use cards to bulk up the various resources needed to play future cards. Strong play requires thinking a few moves ahead, both to avoid being left with a hand of unplayable cards and to counter or reflect potential incoming attacks from your opponent (or deny them the resources they might need).</p>
<p>An extremely clean black and white interface and quick, amusing animations make this a very easy game to pick up and play. But it's the strategy of taking on short-term risks to get long-term rewards that will keep you coming back for round after round. And while the demo's extremely punishing daily challenges are good for some continued longevity, we're hoping the final game will add online multiplayer battles rather than just letting us beat down the AI over and over again.</p>

<h2><em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ulKicq4lig?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>

<p>If you've grown tired of <em>Diablo IV</em> but are looking for another dark, mouse-based action RPG to scratch the same itch, <em>Dragonkin: The Banished</em> should be right up your alley. Just like in <em>Diablo,</em> the name of the game here is clicking to move and attack swarms of enemies in dark isometric dungeons, throwing in some magical attacks with the number keys on your keyboard as needed.</p>
<p>The <em>Dragonkin</em> demo leads you through a lot of extremely expository and overwrought cutscenes, broken up by short playable vignettes that introduce you to the main character classes: the heavy, the archer, the fire mage, etc. These introductory characters seem extremely overpowered for the early game, cutting through enemy grunts like butter while barely taking a scratch from underpowered opposition attacks. But it gives a good feel for the wide variety of available attacks available, from radiating lightning to a satisfying bull charge.</p>
<p>It's only after this introduction that you're thrown into a more standard challenge, clearing out a dungeon with a low-level character that needs all the help they can get. While the moment to moment gameplay will be familiar to <em>Diablo</em> heads, a few small touches like a handy dash-dodge maneuver make it all lean a bit more towards the "action" side of "action RPG."</p>
<p>If you're looking for pyrotechnic explosions, cinematic cut scenes, and plenty of things to click on, you could definitely do a lot worse.</p>

<h2><em>Glum</em></h2>

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235550/GLUM/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>First-person shooters are obviously all about the shooting—it's right there in the name, after all. But the most satisfying part of these games is often running right up to an enemy and pounding them with a suspiciously powerful close-range melee attack.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><em>Glum</em> takes this satisfying melee bit and makes it the focus of the whole game. Instead of fists or a bludgeoning weapon, though, your main melee weapon in <em>Glum</em> is a steel-toed boot. You'll see that boot hovering menacingly and incongruously in front of you as you zip around vaguely medieval-themed rooms, charging back with a bent knee for perfectly timed strikes as soon as an enemy gets in your face.</p>
<p>The <em>Glum</em> demo already takes this "first-person booter" concept in some interesting directions, providing plenty of barrels and other heavy objects you can convert into single-use projectile weapons with a kick from the right angle. You can also kick off of walls and other angled surfaces to fly through the air in some surprisingly satisfying and floaty platforming, which is key to finding the many secrets hidden in the demo's tutorial-esque rooms.</p>
<p>But the most satisfying part is still kicking an enemy directly and watching the ragdoll corpse fly off a wall and back toward your boot, where you can send it flying into other encroaching foes. The light-hearted comedy action is especially welcome in an industry that sometimes seems full of first-person games that are too full of themselves.</p>

<p>Seeing and hearing the pre-game logo screen for Ghost Ship Games immediately puts my brain into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/"><em>Deep Rock Galactic</em></a> mode: headset on, workday stress abandoned, beverage ready. <em>Guntouchables,&nbsp;</em>published by Ghost Ship and developed by Game Swing, could readily fit into that slot. It's a multiplayer-first overhead shooter in which you and up to three other sausage-y folks with tiny stick legs grab loot, kill baddies, and get the heck out of there. If it's been a moment since you and your squad have shot some things together, send them a message and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2543510/GUNTOUCHABLES/">link the demo</a>.</p>

<p>A horde of mutants have overrun the world, and you and your fellow redneck preppers are having their moment. You pick a weapon, like the precise but slow hunting rifle or pray-and-spray SMG, and a character, each with their own secondary weapons and skill trees. The game shows you a map with stuff to grab or destroy and the car you need to reach to escape. Then you're off, moving with WASD keys and aiming in a circle with a mouse. The demo wasn't ready for controller play yet, but I could see it coming in the future (along with another justification for the trackpads on the Steam Deck).</p>
<p>I cajoled a friend into playing, and we had a great time, both blasting and winning, but also explaining to each other just how dumb that last move was. The game could do more to help you quickly identify and distinguish among your teammates, as they're currently all green names and health bars. And an optional tutorial mission would go a long way to help explain weapon and item mechanics that we had to test out live. But it's a demo, and the core experience—shoot, run, grab, swarm coming, panic—already feels plenty strong. There's a goofy, lightly icky charm to the voice-overs and visuals, and the upgrade paths are pleasantly addictive. It's a ridiculous game with a ridiculous name, and I recommend it.</p>

<p>When you play an RPG or strategy game, do you spend hours just staring at the tech tree, trying to figure out the upgrade path that will maximize your power going forward? If so, you'll probably love <em>Hyper Empire</em>, a super-condensed 4X space simulation where a good 80 percent of the game is spent staring at a menu screen and deciding how best to spend your limited resources.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That's actually more interesting than it might initially sound. You need to spend money on a fleet of ships to defend your carrier from potential attack, of course. But spending too much on powerful ships means you can't invest in the outpost stations and tools that will bring in even more resources (and more powerful ships) later in the run. The balance between short-term risk and long-term reward seems well-tuned for those who like to agonize over every potential decision.</p>
<p>When battles inevitably happen, they play out as automated orgies of interstellar explosions that can be a joy to watch, especially once you hit a critical mass of defensive ships. And while random happenings can influence your resources between those battles, none of them have seemed too impactful in the demo so far.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with <em>Hyper Empires</em> right now is that the demo caps out at 30 turns, right when the "just one more turn" resource-building loop is starting to get good. We can't wait to continue to juggle a bunch of numbers like an intergalactic accountant in the full game.</p>

<h2><em>Monaco 2</em></h2>

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063030/Monaco_2/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>It's been well over a decade <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/12/the-prince-of-monaco-andy-schatz-talks-up-his-indie-heist-simulator/">since the first <em>Monaco</em> wowed us</a> with its ultra-stylish overhead "heist simulator" gameplay. This long-delayed sequel keeps the same basic find-the-Macguffin-and-escape gameplay, but now with vibrant 3D graphics and more complex, multi-floor building layouts.</p>
<p>As with the first <em>Monaco</em>, this is a stealth game that doesn't absolutely require stealth. Sure, it's easier if you sneak by the guards and cameras without raising the alarm, using handy sightlines and quiet movements to avoid detection. But if you're found, the game quickly transitions into something of a 3D game of <em>Pac-Man</em>, where you have to outrun the guards and use hidden corridors or hidey-holes to outsmart them.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The <em>Monaco 2</em> demo includes four classes of thieves, each with their own unique way of distracting or avoiding the guards. I especially liked the socialite, who uses a toy poodle to charm nearby guards into ignoring her, and the tech specialist, who can use a drone to interact with doors and items while he hides in relative safety.</p>
<p>The updated 3D viewpoint loses some of the simplistic charm of the original's overhead perspective. Still, this modernized version of the classic stealth game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, especially with a few friends in co-op mode.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLmMkqeH_9w?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>

<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Strategy, Card Game, Roguelike, Demons, PvP<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">Steam page</a></p>
<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>is a lot more <em>Monster Train</em>. Given that the original is in my top five of all-time Steam game hours, I'm happy about that. Just 30 minutes into testing it, I had to tell myself, "No, <em>this</em> really is the last round," and physically walk away to enforce it. Well, the last round, and then some upgrade shopping. OK, one more and <em>then</em> no more.</p>
<p><em>Monster Train 2</em> is, like the original, an amalgam of turn-based tactics and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">roguelike deckbuilding</a>, with a heaven-versus-hell backstory that is arch, goofy, and entirely skippable. Enemies enter your train on the bottom of three decks and fight their way upward, turn by turn. Your card deck has hellish monsters that you place across three levels of your train and spells that can damage, buff your monsters, and debuff their misguided angels. The music is high-energy melodic metal, the art pops off the screen, and the challenge is largely the same: balancing momentary threats against the need to prepare for future baddies.</p>
<p>Besides new monsters, cards, and clans, the sequel adds some new things, all of which might add up to be a bit too much to manage for some folks. Hero-type creatures can have abilities with cooldowns. New card types include equipment you can put on creatures and abilities you can apply to train floors. You can customize your train and upgrade its core pyre with abilities. This demo had me forgetting monster abilities and feeling overwhelmed with where to focus my upgrades. And yet I had a good time, and I'll probably learn a new approach to turn actions over time. Hell, after all, devours the indolent.</p>

<h2><em>Reignbreaker</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vpVDO7G_5eM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Studio Fizbin<br>
<strong>Planned release date:</strong> March 18, 2025<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Indie, Hack and Slash, Action Roguelike, Combat<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129810/Reignbreaker/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>The surface similarities between <em>Reignbreaker</em> and <em>Hades</em> are hard to ignore. But <em>Reignbreaker</em>'s flavor of isometric run-and-gun-and-bash gameplay sets itself apart instantly with an extremely compelling steampunk aesthetic, full of clanging metal sound effects and relentless robotic enemies. That extends to the art direction, with thick outlines making it easy to pick out the color-coded hazards from the dull blues and grays of the metal-and-stone backgrounds.</p>
<p><em>Reignbreaker</em> also stands out for some extremely chunky-feeling melee attacks and a javelin that can be used for powerful ranged projectiles or slammed down as a temporary turret. Tight controls make it a joy to dash between enemy projectiles as you wait for the opportune moment to go in for the kill. The <em>Reignbreaker</em> demo also shows off a few of the powerful bosses that will require most players to acquire a few permanent power-ups before making it too deep into the game's randomized corridors.</p>
<p>This is one to keep an eye on as <em>Hades 2</em> continues to barrel through Early Access toward its eventual final release</p>

<h2><em>Shuffle Tactics</em></h2>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LG0WEHIL7RQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p><strong>Developer: </strong>Club Sandwich<br>

<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Singleplayer, Roguelike, Tactical RPG, Isometric<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186580/Shuffle_Tactics/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>Like any good game with the word "Tactics" in its title, <em>Shuffle Tactics</em> is all about positioning. Move your units on a grid to maximize the damage they can inflict on enemies while minimizing the counterattacks that will inevitably come on their next turn. You know the drill.</p>
<p>But <em>Shuffle Tactics</em> adds just a hint of <em>Slay the Spire</em> into the mix, limiting your actions to those drawn from a deck of cards that you can build and modify between battles. As the game goes on, that means you might not be sure what options will be available on your next turn, forcing some quick improvisation if you want to maximize your chances.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>I'm already a big fan of the demo's satisfying sword-throwing mechanic, which lets you toss your melee weapon for a ranged attack and then call it back for more damage when it returns to your hand. I'm also enamored with the game's evocative pixel-art animations, which make every movement and attack a joy to watch.</p>
<p>My biggest problem is that the demo gets very difficult very quickly; I had quite a few runs fall apart incredibly early when faced with an unavoidable "Elite" matchup that I wasn't yet powerful enough to conquer. Hopefully. the developer can work out the balancing issues before launch because this mix of tactical strategy and card-based luck is a match made in heaven.</p>

<h2><em>Squirreled Away</em></h2>

<strong>Planned release date:</strong> "Coming soon"<br>
<strong>Popular steam tags:</strong> Exploration, Third Person, Cute, Relaxing<br>
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">Steam page</a></p>
<p>"Be the squirrel" is Far Seas' description of its upcoming game, and while that's a big promise, <em>Squirreled Away </em>seems on track to deliver. You're not <em>just</em> a squirrel, mind you, but a tool-crafting, home-building, achievement-unlocking squirrel, owing to the demands of the gaming format. But when moving around, you get to experience the manic, sticky-pawed, and often weightless nature of squirreldom. Why do squirrels run corkscrews around the perimeter of a tree instead of climbing straight up? Maybe because, like me, they're trying to keep up with their camera view on their right controller stick while moving with the left.</p>
<p><em>Squirreled Away</em>'s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3453320/Squirreled_Away_Demo/">demo</a> gives you a taste of its core mechanics, like stashing away items in a cache for winter or building an axe out of a pebble and twig so you can break larger branches into sticks for a fellow squirrel. The look, feel, and sound of the experience are decidedly calm, with single-instrument melodies lilting in and out as you scamper about, gather resources, and unlock quests and areas. You have health and stamina bars, but the game is gentle if you run them out, sending you back to safety or reminding you to eat some food.</p>
<p>It feels like a more kinetic <em>Animal Crossing</em>, with friendly animals and low-stakes challenges. Except that at any time, you could bail on your tasks, scamper upward, and leap from one far-out branch to another, living out the daydreams of anybody who works next to a window overlooking a tree.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken">Tekken</a> boss Katsuhiro Harada has responded to a fan on social media criticising the new design of Anna Williams, stating "there will always be people like you".</p>
<p>Yesterday Bandai Namco revealed Anna would be the next fighter to join <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> as part of its ongoing DLC roadmap, complete with a redesign of her look - as with many returning characters.</p>
<p>However one fan shared their disappointment on social media requesting the old design return. "I don't like the new design," they wrote, "replacing Anna with this new character is the devs way at getting back at Anna fans for all these years of support makes me feel sad."</p>

<p>"While 98 percent of the fans are welcoming this, there will always be people like you," wrote Harada in response. "I understand and sympathise that it may not suit your personal taste, but if you prefer the old design, past works already exist. I am not taking those away from you.</p>
<p>"Also, you refer to yourself as 'Anna fans,' as if you represent all Anna fans, but you should express your opinion as an individual."</p>
<p>Harada then referred to the impossibility of pleasing players, writing: "You threaten to quit if she isn't brought back. You complain the moment she is brought back. You demand that she be reverted after she has been completely redesigned from scratch, including her model and framework. And if she actually were reverted, you'd just say, 'That's recycling!'"</p>
<p>"Either way," he concluded, "your method of expressing your opinion and the content of your argument are entirely unconstructive, utterly pointless, and, above all, disrespectful to the other Anna fans who are genuinely looking forward to her."</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1894542252967649717">Harada additionally responded to a more positive response</a> to Anna's design, and explained why he often responds to negative opinions.</p>
<p>"It's because these negative folks tend to have a narrow perspective," he said. "If I don't respond, they start spreading toxicity, saying things like, 'Why won't they engage with the community?!'"</p>
<p>He responded to other negative comments too, stating: "If you don't like something, you don't have to buy it, you don't have to comment, and you can simply leave."</p>
<p>Harada's comments exemplify the frustration of developers battling online toxicity. Take former PlatinumGames boss Hideki Kamiya, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-calls-out-shty-leakers-in-wake-of-switch-2-reveal">called out "shitty leakers" in the wake of Nintendo's Switch 2 reveal</a>, or Riot Games' head Anna Donlon who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valorant-studio-head-tells-toxic-players-to-play-something-else-we-wont-miss-you">discussed the "current state of player behaviour" in Valorant</a> and told toxic players to "play something else, we won't miss you".</p>
<p>Harada caused confusion last month when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">set his LinkedIn profile to "open to work"</a>, causing fans to worry he would be leaving Bandai Namco. He responded saying he wanted to "broaden [his] horizons by connecting with more people".</p>
<p>Before Anna, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-clive-coming-to-tekken-8-as-first-seasons-final-dlc-character">Tekken 8 added Final Fantasy 16's Clive Rosfield</a> as a DLC character.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Microsoft has confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fable">Fable</a> has been delayed until 2026, giving developer Playground Games more time for their revival of this classic RPG series.</p>
<p>The news came from Head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan – formerly the Rare Studio Lead until being promoted last year – who was speaking on the latest official Xbox podcast.</p>


<p>“<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/fable-gets-another-cinematic-trailer-and-a-release-window/">We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025</a>, we are actually going to give Fable more time and it’s going to ship in 2026 now,” he said. “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait, and I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team.”</p>
<p>Duncan also shared some new snippets of footage, beyond what was previously shown in the trailer last year, showing a snippet of combat against a werewolf, goblins, bandits in the city, and a cutscene with some cooked eggs and a bear trap. Nothing too deep, but little snippets to demonstrate the continued quality of the visuals that Playground are cooking up.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Game Studios Update With Craig Duncan | Official Xbox Podcast" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=853&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground Games,” he said, “plus amazing gameplay, British humour, Playground’s version of Albion inspired by what’s gone before with the franchise, but their take in quite frankly the most beautifully realised version of Albion you’ve ever seen.</p>

<p>“So really excited about the plans and really excited about the future and I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games and the teams, and ultimately that results in the best games.”</p>
<p>This time will naturally be used to refine and polish the game further, but there’s probably some broader strategic planning here. It’s potentially a similar situation to the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/18/avowed-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-fall-2024-release-window/">That game was set for a late 2024 launch</a>, but with Microsoft seeing that the end of last year was (at the time) packed with other big game launches, they chose to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/03/avowed-gets-new-release-date-of-february-18th-2025/">bounce it back to early 2025</a> to try and find it a little more breathing room.</p>
<p>For Fable, the elephant in the room is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">GTA 6</a>. While Rockstar’s games have traditionally been prone to get a big delay, Take Two has<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/"> repeatedly stated that it’s on target for the end of 2025</a>. Other publishers are sensibly wary of going up against what is inevitably going to be the biggest game of the decade, so we’ve already seen <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">EA announce the next Battlefield</a> with a flexible release window to try and dodge GTA. It makes sense for Microsoft to do the same, even though Fable is in a completely different genre.</p>
<p>Fable is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC, at the moment. Who knows if it’ll pop up elsewhere later down the line. Probably will, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/26/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Almost 30 years on from its debut, Tomb Raider is still one of the most recognisable names in gaming. Sure, we’re quite far removed from the series’ heyday, and are currently in a lull for both the modern games and movies, but Lara Croft’s adventures haven’t been entombed and forgotten by the public. Revisiting the original games seems like a great idea, to go back and have a look at where it all started. After playing these remakes, I have to say that maybe they are better left in our memories where the nostalgia can do all the heavy lifting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tomb Raider IV-VI Remastered - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vF9-JeSRRaI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now let’s get this straight, the remasters here are precisely what you expect them to be. We’ve got better quality textures, better lighting, and much better quality character models, which if you’re not familiar with the original PlayStation, didn’t really have many more polygons than the absolute minimum needed for a humanoid silhouette. You can jump between the new remastered visuals to the original graphics with the press of a button – something that still amazes me every time I see it, even if it’s a common trick for retro remasters.</p>



<p>But this second trilogy of Tomb Raider games is a bit different from the first, jumping ahead a generation to Angel of Darkness for the PS2 – Core Design’s sixth and final game in the series. After playing the first two games it can be a little hard to tell if you’re looking at a remastered version or the original in Angel of Darkness, until you examine things a little more closely. Lara’s model is the biggest giveaway, which is noticeably improved, but with the environments it’s hard to really spot the difference, some things even look untouched.</p>

<p>The biggest issue here is that this isn’t the ground breaking original Tomb Raider trilogy, it’s the second trilogy where Lara didn’t really know what to do with herself. The first two games are very much in line with their predecessors mostly, but even in the late 90s they were critiqued for retreading increasingly familiar ground. Heck, Core Design even tried to kill off their iconic heroine in The Last Revelation, only to have to create a kind of narrative clip show for Chronicles, while another team worked to bring her back for a jump to the new generation.</p>

<p>Angel of Darkness looked to revitalise the series, though making Lara into some kind of anti-hero in one of the weirder turns I’ve seen a series take. It’s not very good either, nor is it good at making it clear where you’re supposed to be going in the streets and rooftops of Paris that replace the tombs you’d expect to be raiding earlier on. There’s some cut content that’s been restored here with the Parisian Back Streets training area, and some other tweaks to subtly improve Angel of Darkness’ flaws, but these three games just aren’t Tomb Raider 1-3, which makes me far less willing to forgive the issues that remain.</p>
<p>Controls are still the biggest problem with these games, even if you still have the muscle memory from playing the original releases. The difficulty in these games comes almost entirely from absolutely horrendously bad tank controls, as they’re known, where left and right turn your character on the spot instead of strafing. Every single little thing you do, whether it’s pulling a lever, reaching a ledge, jumping for a rope, whatever, is made into a frustrating battle with the controls whilst you try to maneouvre yourself into just the right position.</p>

<p>A simple jump isn’t simple anymore, because you have to ensure you’re positioned perfectly beforehand, so it becomes a case of stopping and rotating on the spot before you can continue. Are you lined up right to grab that rope from a jump, or will you end up being two inches too far to the left? It doesn’t feel like “real” difficulty – as in, Dark Souls is difficult but it’s a challenge that’s fun to surmount, these remasters never feel challenging, they just feel annoying and success is just relief that you’re finally rid of whatever fiddly rubbish you were doing rather than celebrating overcoming a challenge.</p>
<p>As with the first batch of remasters, this trilogy does also come with a modern control setting that allows you to, shockingly, point your analog in a direction and move in that direction rather than turning like a tank. This is a little bit better when walking around but, once you get into a small platform that you need to rotate on so you can position yourself, you’ll likely walk off the edge trying to do it. There’s also the awkwardness of moving when the camera switches to fixed positions, and more generally, the run animation has to end for a moment before you can start moving again.. These games were designed with tank controls in mind, so annoying as they are, manoeuvring without them is almost as frustrating.</p>
<p>There isn’t much else to say really. The first two games look nicer than they once did, the third looks almost the same, and other than that the games are so old that they came from before controls stopped being terrible. I’ve always wondered why I didn’t really like the Tomb Raider games, never made much progress, and mostly messed around in the mansion. It turns out it’s because they’re bad? If Aspyr decide the remake the next trilogy of Tomb Raider games, though, it will begin with Tomb Raider Legend, the first genuinely good Tomb Raider because Lara, the titular tomb raider, can climb a wall without five minutes of prep first.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 is going all out again to deliver a spectacle like nothing else. It’s the latest release in 2K’s vision of professional wrestling, and Xbox Game Pass Subscribers wonder if they can get a piece of the action.</p>



<p>Every new WWE 2K release feels like Wrestlemania. You have months of build-up and anticipation leading to a special payoff. Once a new game is out, attention naturally diverts toward DLC and updates, but behind the scenes, 2K is busy readying for their Wrestlemania next year. When WWE 2K24 was released, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> presumably became the focus.</p>



<p>It’s nearly time for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a> to walk the aisle. But if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, let’s see if you can score a front-row ticket for cheap.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-wwe-2k25-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play WWE 2K25 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This is setting Priest on the warpath. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It doesn’t look like WWE 2K25 is a day-one Xbox Game Pass option for subscribers as no advertising or marketing suggests this.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox is proud of games coming to Game Pass and advertises them at all costs. Announcement trailers usually have the Game Pass logo stamp on them. It’s also mentioned in press releases and news articles.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 has had countless trailers and press releases to this point. However, there’s no indication of WWE 2K25 being on Game Pass. Another tried and tested insight into a game’s Game Pass status is Microsoft’s Xbox Store.</p>



<p>If you go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/wwe-2k25-standard-edition/9P6NQMP5LXD6/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a> game page, you’ll find <strong>no mention of playing the title through Game Pass</strong>. Instead, it’s a case of paying full price digitally or physically or finding yourself a tasty bargain.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-wwe-2k25-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will WWE 2K25 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>The chances of WWE 2K25 coming to Xbox Game Pass are very low—borderline not happening.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-pga-tour-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is another 2K sports title released within a month of WWE 2K25. That’s also not coming to Game Pass, and 2K sports titles generally don’t. They don’t even come to Game Pass a year or two after release.</p>



<p>If you’re desperate to step into the squared circle and engage in graps, you must buy WWE 2K25 outright.</p>



<hr>



<p>Should 2K and Microsoft tighten up their partnership stronger than a sleeper hold and deliver 2K sports titles on Game Pass? Or are you not bothered and are committed to buying each new WWE 2K title anyway? </p>

            <p>Last night, Warner Bros shocked the industry when it was announced the closure of three studios, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">including Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor's Monolith Productions</a>. Founded in the 1990s and part of Warner Bros since 2004, the studio was best known for Shadow of Mordor and its follow-up Shadow of War, which both used the studio's patented Nemesis system.
</p>
<p>The Nemesis system, for those unfamiliar, is a clever in-game mechanic which tracks a player's actions to create enemies that feel capable of remembering past encounters. In the studio's Middle-earth games, this allowed foes to rise through the ranks and enact revenge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monolith-is-making-a-wonder-woman-game">Nemesis system was set to be utilised again in Monolith's Wonder Woman game</a>, though that project has now been cancelled alongside the studio's sudden closure - leaving the Nemesis system seemingly now lying unused, and protected by Warner Bros due to its successful patent application.</p>

</figure>
<p>The patent itself - <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en">which you can view here</a> - was originally filed back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-is-trying-to-patent-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordors-nemesis-system">before it was granted in 2021</a>. It is dubbed "Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games". As it stands, the patent has an expiration date of 11th August, 2036.</p>
<p>So, even though Monolith is getting shut down, Warner Bros will be able to retain the patent for the Nemesis system for another 11 years, should it keep up the patent's associated fees.</p>
<p>Many are upset that this may well mean the death of the Nemesis system. "They really patented the Nemesis System only to do absolutely nothing with it," <a href="https://x.com/MarsSuccessor/status/1894469391846105516">wrote one social media user</a>. "RIP the Nemesis system, I guess," added <a href="https://x.com/Cade_Onder/status/1894486393952317771">video game journalist Cade Onder</a>. </p>
<p>"Monolith literally created a one-of-a-kind system that procedurally generated a complete hierarchy of unique enemies that interacted with the player and itself in the Nemesis System," <a href="https://x.com/counterscottGO/status/1894467261261389908">another wrote</a>. "WB took that from them, patented it, and then closed their studio. Fuck them."</p>

<p>Needless to say, the news of Monolith's closure last night, along with the closure of Player First Games and Warner Bros Games San Diego, has been met with sadness across the industry.</p>
<p>Comic book writer Gail Simone, who was serving as a consultant on Monolith's Wonder Woman title, said the game was both "gorgeous and expansive".</p>
<p>"It was beautiful to look at. I am not going to give details for a number of reasons, but every effort was made to make this not just a great game, but a great WONDER WOMAN game," Simone wrote on social media, calling the project a "showpiece epic". The consultant added the team wanted to "make the best game ever", however "sometimes, you give your all and it doesn’t work out".</p>

<p>The cancellation of Wonder Woman comes amid an extremely rocky period for Warner Bros' games division, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-latest-patch-adds-a-tough-new-15-floor-heroic-assault-raid">Warner Bros Montreal's Gotham Knights</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-chapter-brings-game-to-a-cheap-end">Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">IP-heavy party brawler MultiVersus</a>, and last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions all failing to make an impact with consumers.</p>
<p>Last month, Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment president <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">David Haddad announced he was stepping down after 12 years in the role</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/edge-of-eternity-studio-announces-jrpg-follow-up-with-xenoblade-and-chrono-trigger-talent<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
The French developer behind million-selling indie role-player Edge of Eternity has announced a fresh follow-up, Edge of Memories.
</p>
<p>
This new game - a blend of JRPG mechanics and French animation - is set in the same world, and will launch this autumn for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Once again, the Montpellier-based Studio Midgar has recruited JRPG veterans to join the game's development, with Edge of Eternity featuring an expanded roster. This includes Nier writer Sawako Natori and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-10">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> character designer Raita Kazama.

</figure>
<p>
For the game's music, some of which you can hear in the game's reveal trailer above, Studio Midgar has called in Nier and Nier Automata singer Emi Evans, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> and Xenogears composer Yasunori Mitsuda, plus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> composer Mariam Abounnasr.
</p>
<p>
Edge of Memories is being designed as an action RPG, with real-time combat focused on chaining combos across the game's plague-ridden new continent of Avaris. Today's teaser ends with the game's main character looking like she can draw power from the plague too - intriguing!
</p>
<p>The game's Kickstarter-funded predecessor Edge of Eternity launched on PC back in 2021 to a decent if not overly-enamoured response. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-jrpg-edge-of-eternity-headed-to-consoles-next-year">console version turned up in 2022</a>, including a cloud version for Switch. I wonder if we'll see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a> port announced down the line?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Fable has been delayed to 2026 for a few different reasons, according to rumors circulating online, but the delay may not be all bad news for PlayStation 5 owners.</p>
<p>Well-known Xbox leaker eXtas1s reported in a new video that one of their sources who informed them about a possible delay for the new entry in the series at the end of last month, said Fable has been delayed to next year for a few reasons, which include technical reasons caused by the Forza engine that powers the game that has been created for racing games. Also, additional development time was required to make some other adjustments to the game, including gameplay adjustment and pace of progression improvements, as gameplay in one of its first forms wasn't considered too fun. While it wouldn't have been a proper Fable game without a delay caused by technical issues, the comments on gameplay are certainly more concerning, so hopefully, the additional development time will help in this regard.</p>
<p><iframe title="FABLE en PROBLEMAS! RETRASO 2026 por PS5 o GTA 6? 😨 SORPRESA ACTIVISION GAMEPASS 🟢 XBOX EVENTO MARZO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRqCBq1OsI8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While this unnamed source said that Fable hasn't been delayed specifically due to the development of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 ports</a>, a simultaneous console multiplatform launch is within the realms of possibility, according to well-known insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot34-reseteora.1090722/post-136273683" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a>. As the game was apparently scheduled to launch on other consoles one year after its PC and Xbox debut, it's definitely possible for Fable to launch on all consoles and PC at the same time in 2026.</p>
<p>The Fable delay to 2026 was confirmed yesterday during the latest episode of the official Xbox podcast. You can head over<a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-delayed-2026-stunning-gameplay/"> here</a> to learn more about the announcement and check out some pre-alpha gameplay.</p>

            <p>The upcoming reboot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a>, the fantasy role-playing game of British chortles 'n' chuckles, has been delayed until next year, says head of Xbox Game Studios Craig Duncan. Developers Playground Games need "more time" to create the world of Albion, it turns out, but Xbox has offered a sparse sprinking of of game footage as compensation for the delay. There's nothing particularly mind-blowing among it. Some combat, some vistas. But it's something.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>"We previously announced the date for Fable as 2025," said Duncan in an interview during the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8?feature=shared&amp;t=857">Official Xbox Podcast</a>. "We are actually going to give Fable more time and it's going to ship in 2026 now. While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it's definitely worth the wait... I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team."</p>
<p>Duncan goes on to talk over some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h77gcgE1b8">pre-alpha footage of the RPG</a>. There are scenes of the player character walking through a city, riding their horse, and fighting what looks like various fantasy staples such as werewolves and goblins. At one point the player is being accosted by a giant violent chicken, which fans of the old games will undoubtedly welcome with feathery fondness (the humble chicken is the butt of many jokes, basically a series mascot). At another point the hero is using sausages in a frying pan as bait in a bear trap. I can cofirm this is how the British aristocracy spend their time ever since fox hunting got banned.</p>
<p>Playground Games are best known for their work on the Forza racing games, which are often hyper-realistic and glistening with The Graphics. Which would be why Duncan reassures prospective players that their RPG will be "the most beautifully realized version of Albion you've ever seen". That werewolf's hair is very detailed, to be fair. But as ever we'll reserve judgement until we get our hands on the beast ourselves.</p>
<p>The Fable reboot was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brand-new-fable-announced-for-pc-and-xbox">officially announced in 2020</a> but there had been rumours about it as far back as 2017. We've seen a couple of cinematic trailers since the announcement, starring the likes of comedy actors <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-trailer-doesnt-have-much-fable-does-have-richard-ayoade">Richard Ayoade</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g">Matt King</a>. But now it'll be a whole other year until we see if their jokes land.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s always nice to start the day with some positivity, especially when the gaming world seems to be mostly redundancies and failures right now. NACON have brought the sunshine today though, with the announcement of Edge of Memories, the sequel to the fantastic JRPG Edge of Eternity. They’ve even brought us a lovely announcement trailer to go with it, which you’ll find below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edge of Memories | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/08wjvnGkQQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The observant amongst you may notice the change to the art direction from the first game, and I’m sure that’s likely to be divisive for returning fans, leaning into more of an anime or French animation look rather than the original’s Unreal Engine-powered Final Fantasy-esque visuals. There’s some serious talent at work on Edge of Memories too, including character designer Raita Kazama (Xenoblade Chronicles X), while the rest of the team includes writer Sawako Natori (NieR), singer Emi Evans (NieR / NieR: Automata), as well as composers Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger/ Xenogears) and Mariam Abounnasr (Xenoblade Chronicles 3 / ONINAKI). This should have anyone who knows in fits of excitement!</p>
<p>The original Edge of Eternity launched in 2021, and went on to sell over a million copies, making a follow-up something of a no-brainer. Despite its JRPG trappings, and the various members of the team that hail from there, Midgar Studios is actually based in France, and they’re returning once more for Edge of Memories.</p>


<p>The story synopsis tells us, “The beautiful, serene landscapes of Avaris are under the threat of a powerful corrupting influence, Corrosion, as it spreads across the land. Mutating anything in its path into horrific abominations. As a Soul Whisperer, it’s your job to travel the world, easing the people of their burdens, and fighting back against the monsters inhabiting the world. During her journey, Eline awakens to a mysterious power that may hold the answer to thwarting the oncoming apocalypse.” Sounds pretty good to me!</p>
<p>If the trailer has piqued your interest, or you’re a fan of the original game, Edge of Memories will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in Autumn 2025. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more on this one!</p>

<p>I can't be certain, but the music for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/castle-v-castle">Castle V Castle</a> sounds very much like it was made on an old Roland TR-808 drum machine or equivalent plug-in. Your ears will be familiar with the 808 even if your brain isn't - it's about as ubiquitous in hip hop as the <a href="https://youtu.be/NkU4hsaFglU">Amen break</a>. That's actually quite fitting, because this minimalist <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game has the rhythms of a call-and-response rap battle. That's something you could say for all I-go-you-gos to an extent, but the bellicose back and forth here is especially sizzling, snappy, and scintillating.</p><p>

(The game music is very different from the trailer music.)

<p>You've got three Mates in the Castle (MCs for short): a witch, a knight, and a hard hatted builder. Each generates different resources each turn - magic, weapons, bricks. The cards in your hands cost resources from one those three categories, and you play or discard one a turn. Your goal is to either smash your opponent's castle to bits or build yours up 25 bricks high. Some cards boost your castle or attack your opponent's, some level up your MCs so they produce more resources a turn, some steal your foe's resources or block their next card, and some summon a giant robot with a ten-turn countdown after which it absolutely decimates the opposing structure. You could pretend it's made of goat poo and superstition juice if you wanted to stay immersed in the middle ages, I suppose. Uh, the builder's hard hat is made of... congealed acorn porridge? Sure, that'll do.</p>
<p>Very simple, very minimal, but you will get donked in the donkables very quickly if you just haphazardly sling cards like a malfunctioning shuffler that is also shit at videogames. I found a good tac was to play one category until I was out of cards and move on to the next. Spend a few turns building up and buffing, then go all out offensive, that sort of thing. The danger here is trapping yourself in a position where you're stumped into either hording resources, or making space in your limited hand for more cards by discarding for multiple turns. A few goes is all it takes for a towering bastion of victory to crumble into a ruin barely more structurally sound than a bag of blueprints and regret. When a castle is down to its last few bricks, a sign on legs that reads "the end is nigh" waddles over and then leaves again if the castle gets repaired.</p>
<p>Needless to say I'm in love with how Castle V Castle looks, too. I've started really appreciating minimalism in both digital and physical games after spending many years backing massive, billion-miniature Kickstarters and playing obscenely large 4X games. So when I spy the digital equivalent of one of Grey Gnome's <a href="https://greygnome.com/our-games/">lovely games in a tin</a>, I'm chuffed. This one is funded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a>'s Casey Yano and developed by Nopopo (I agree). You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">the demo here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO Announcement Images</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Let’s face it, an MMO is the greatest timesink in the gaming world, and it’s one that can create and develop stories, adventures and friendships that most games can only dream about. Blade and Soul NEO has remastered and remade the highly successful Korean MMO Blade and Soul, and brought it kicking and higher kicking back to the forefront of multiplayer gaming. It’s also Free To Play, and, as of <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/neo/trailer#LaunchTrailer">yesterday, available to download now</a>!</p>
<p><iframe title="Blade &amp; Soul NEO: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V2212dxe4aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Blade &amp; Soul remains one of the biggest Korean MMOs of all time, and despite the fact that the sequel arrived five years ago, it’s a beloved property that players continue to return to 12 years after its original release. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will see players transported back to the Wuxia-themed fantastical world, so that they can experience the story and gameplay once more with modernised graphics and improved systems.</p>
<p>A free-to-play MMO set in a world of Asian mythology, combat has always been the star of Blade &amp; Soul, and it looks to be carefully reinterpreted here in the updated Unreal Engine 4. There’s new combat techniques to learn, and the fighting system, which has more in common with fighting games than it does with most RPGs, has gained even more depth, which will be perfect for returning players. It certainly looks beautiful, and if you check out the new trailer you can see the side-by-side comparisons between the original and the NEO version.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features has been the inclusion of Infinite Windwalk, an ability that was originally limited by your character’s stamina meter. Now you can take to the skies, and you’ll be able to get around the world with your party of players in a much more efficient and enjoyable length of time.</p>


<p>The renewed character customisation options also take advantage of the enhanced visuals, with player characters now more visually impressive than ever before. You can even download and share your character template for other players to use, and this is a great feature if you see a design you simply must have.</p>
<p>Make sure to check this one out, especially if you’ve got an MMO shaped hole in your life.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/edge-of-memories-is-a-new-japanese-inspired-action-rpg-from-the-edge-of-eternity-devs-out-in-q4-2025.1119171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-is-a-new-japanese-inspired-action-rpg-from-the-edge-of-eternity-devs-out-in-q4-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a few years of quiet, French developer Midgar Studio has announced Edge of Memories, a sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/edge-of-eternity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Edge of Eternity</a>. However, while that game was a traditional JRPG, this one will be a full-fledged action RPG with real time combat, although still inspired by Japanese games in terms of art style and animation. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it will be published by Nacon, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-eternity-developer-midgar-studio-acquired-by-nacon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> the studio in 2022.</p>
<p>This time, the game takes place on the other side of the world of Heryon, on the continent of Avaris, where the nomadic inhabitants are also now battling the Corrosion plague. The protagonist is Eline, an itinerant Soul Whisperer who fights relentlessly against this force that is turning the once-thriving flora, fauna, and people of this lush land into grotesque abominations. After a mysterious encounter, a dark power awakens within her that may hold the key to ending this apocalypse: the ability to control the corrosion within her own body. She won't be alone in her journey, thanks to the presence of her mentor Ysoris and Kanta, the shaman prince of a lost tribe.</p>
<p>Edge of Memories features a combo-based combat system where players will have to alternate quick strikes and devastating techniques to be more efficient. Customizing companions and using their abilities in the most appropriate way will also be crucial to success. Lastly, Eline can transform into a berserker to deliver powerful blows and executions.</p>
<p>The continent of Avaris features various vibrant biomes, including the idyllic sandy shores of the port city of Sarlah-Durah and the snow-capped peaks of the Kezal Mountains. Players will traverse them with the help of a Nekaroo, a rideable and agile feline companion that helps the player reach otherwise inaccessible areas.&nbsp;According to the developers, as the story moves forward, the game transforms the places the player has traveled before, creating strange new paths for them to take. Midgar Studio also promises that there won't be any filler quests, each mission adding depth to either the story, the characters, or the relationships between them.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edge of Memories - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vk8JHTjxoHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lastly, there's good news on the soundtrack front, too. Cédric Menendez is taking care of it, and the final theme features the voice of Emi Evans, known for her work on NieR: Automata, and the work of Yasunori Mitsuda, known for his work on games such as Chrono Trigger, Xenoblade Chronicles, and Sea of Stars. Edge of Memories is slated to launch in Q4 2025 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738170/Edge_of_Memories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

			<p>Pathologic 3: Quarantine is a free prologue for <a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-3-announced-will-launch-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pathologic 3</a>, and it will be released in just a few weeks, as revealed yesterday by developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher Hype Train Digital. It's been described as a story-driven adventure about a young scientist, Daniil Dankovsky, and his quest for immortality and a mysterious plague outbreak in a small town.&nbsp;Players will learn how the scientist's story began and what drove him to leave his acclaimed lab. They'll examine patients, uncover strange secrets, and take their first steps toward defeating death.</p>
<p>The developers have prepared a significant narrative twist: the narrative is told through unreliable narrators, including Dankovsky's subjective lens and the lens of his persecutors. The story is also said to be non-chronological. That is to say, it will be told out of order.</p>
<p>As a doctor, Dankovsky will try to fight the Sand Plague by examining and diagnosing patients, but also by investigating their lives to find out the unpleasant truths they may be hiding. He can also issue decrees based on new findings to save more lives. Moreover, Dankovsky has a sharp mind, and everything he sees can tell a story and become part of his mental map of the world, encouraging Pathologic 3: Quarantine players to pay attention to everything in the environment.</p>

<p>In first-person stealth game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skin-deep">Skin Deep</a> you are a "deep freeze insurance commando" who gets defrosted whenever pirates board the space vessel you're aboard. The ships you work are crewed by talking house cats with big personalities and a poor track record in information security. It's your job, when things go wrong, to save them from their captors. We've seen a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skin-deep-the-next-game-from-the-creator-of-quadrilateral-cowboy-has-resurfaced">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-skin-deep-cats-have-recruited-you-to-fight-space-pirates">trailers</a> for this sci-fi Die Hard homage before but now we have a full demo to blast through, in which you can throw fishbones at elevator switches and overflow an entire laundry room with soap suds, useful if you want your enemies slip up and donk their heads. Just be careful, because it'll do the same to you. The demo takes about 90 minutes (if you're taking your time like me), but it already feels like Blendo Games at their most playful. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's full of great dialogue, for one thing. When two guards discuss torture options for the hostage crew, they settle on shaving the cats for information. "Shaving cats is against the Geneva Convention!" mutters Nina from behind her steaming pipes and wall panelling, voice filled with disdain for these interlopers. Later, she finds the same guards running into lethal flame jets, but their life-saving skull-gizmos allow the pirates to ressurect and live in perpetual idiocy. They try to get past the fire again and again by mindlessly jogging into the flames. "Just sneak past it!" orders one freebooter, running in headlong and dying for the fifth time.</p>

<p>The love of colourful capers extends to your abilities and the useable items (everything comes labelled with funny instructions right on the object). Pepper can be thrown to daze a pirate. Soap dispensers let out a flammable aroma that you can spark by bashing an electrical walkie talkie off the wall nearby, or flicking a cigarette lighter on. You could also save that walkie talkie for later - if you've been spotted and set off a security alert, you can call in with a mimicking bad guy voice ("Uh, all clear") and watch as the pirates go back to their stations. </p>
<p>There's a lot of other stuff going on. You can eject into space and float around the ship, looking for another entry point. A "sneeze" meter grows when you crawl into vents, and will alert nearby patrolfolk if you succumb. Step on glass and you have to take your time pulling the shards out of your feet to stop from bleeding out with each step. Bananas can be eaten for a pip of health, and the peel thrown on the ground to slip up guards, every one of whom has a name. Gladys, Walter, Patty - do not get attached, they want to shave cats! </p>

<p>Once in a dazed state, you can pounce on baddies and ride them around to bash their heads into sinks and other objects, smashing porcelain to bits and knocking them out cold. But to properly dispatch a patrolling foe, you have to pluck off their head and flush it into space using a toilet or trash chute. Combat animations are buggy and wild right now; the demo has plenty of jank to spare. But there is already so much potential for hijinks in the short span of this demo alone, I'm excited to see what else is in our hero's bag of tricks. </p>
<p>There are copious other gags in the demo. It is dense with great lines, throwaway silliness, and laugh-out-loud stylistic flourishes. I won't cheapen it by spoiling its best surprises. But I will confirm it follows in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heat-signature">Heat Signature</a> by allowing you to slurp your foes into space through judicially smashed windows. </p>

<p>If you recognise the art style, it's probably because you've played something by Blendo Games before. Skin Deep so far has plenty of the studio's other calling cards. It's in the smash cuts between areas, the endless examples of entertaining signage, and the simple, bright sci-fi textures. The machinery is chunky and satisfying and quick to operate (when it doesn't spectacularly fail in a shower of sparks). There's even a mention of Nuevos Aires, the fictional city familiar to those who played Blendo's previous hacker heist 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quadrilateral-cowboy">Quadrilateral Cowboy</a>. And the return of a cat called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e411qjs5Ll8">Chu-Chu</a>. Confirmed: this is all part of the Blendoverse. I am fully enthused.</p>
<p>If you also remember other Blendo games fondly, just go wishlist this one already. And if this is your first time learning about the studio, I implore you to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3483180/Skin_Deep_Demo/">play the demo</a> released as part of Steam Next Fest, and get toying with these cats yourself. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Warner Bros are closing three video game development studios as they seek "to get back to a 'fewer but bigger franchises' strategy", according to a leaked staff memo from Warner Bros head of games and streaming JB Perrette. The three studios in question are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> developer Player First Games, free-to-play specialists Warner Bros Games San Diego, and Monolith, the 30-year-old studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-one-lives-forever">No One Lives Forever</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>, and a troubled forthcoming Wonder Woman adaptation that has now been cancelled.</p><!--more-->
<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-25/warner-bros-shuts-three-video-game-studios-in-restructuring">broke the story last night</a>, and Warner Bros have now confirmed the studio closures and Wonder Woman's cancellation in a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">Kotaku</a>. "We have had to make some very difficult decisions to structure our development studios and investments around building the best games possible with our key franchises -- Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC and Game of Thrones," they say. This "strategic change in direction" is "not a reflection of these teams or the talent that consists within them".</p>
<p>As for Wonder Woman, the company's "hope was to give players and fans the highest quality experience possible for the iconic character, and unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities." The release concludes with the rousing note that "as difficult as today is, we remain focused on and excited about getting back to producing high-quality games for our passionate fans and developed by our world class studios and getting our Games business back to profitability and growth in 2025 and beyond."</p>
<p>The closures continue a terrible couple of years for Warner Bros, who have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-says-it-plans-to-transform-its-biggest-franchises-into-live-service-games">doubled down</a> on live service adaptations of their many licenses, but struggled to convince players in sufficient droves. The big recent disaster was Rocksteady's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a>, a handsome but creaky game-as-service extravaganza reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">imposed on a studio known for rich single player fare</a>, which has lost Warner Bros hundreds of millions of dollars. Following the latter failure, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">announced</a> that he would depart the company this January, after 12 years as boss.</p>
<p>JP Perrette comments a little on all this in the leaked staff memo, circulated by Bloomberg. "The quality of too many of our new releases has really missed the mark," he wrote. "We need to make some substantial changes to our portfolio/team structure if we are to commit the necessary resources to get back to a 'fewer but bigger franchises' strategy."</p>
<p>Player First Games are arguably the saddest victim of Warner's cuts - founded in 2019 and acquired by Warner Bros in July 2024 off the back of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">an initially positive response</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-and-dc-smash-em-up-multiversus-joins-the-pile-of-dead-live-service-games">now-shuttered</a> Smash Brother-from-another-mother MultiVersus, a whole six or seven months before getting axed. I also feel for Warner Bros. Games San Diego, who had yet to release a single game. But I grieve most of all for Monolith.</p>
<p>I had sort of assumed that Monolith would never be closed, because how could you close the studio who gave us F.E.A.R., Condemned and Shadow Of Mordor. It's been a while since those releases and I'm sure many of the team members have long since moved on, but their legacy is infectious. F.E.A.R. is the definitive Matrix FPS: its rippling bullet trails and gusts of muzzle smoke have become something of an indie shooter subgenre, revisited by swaggering upstarts like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trepang2-review-its-an-indie-fear">Trepang</a>. Condemned is perfectly atrocious in its Finchery pipe-wielding cellar fights. And Shadow Of Mordor is the game that lifted the Orcs out of interchangeability and procedurally transformed them into amazing, evolving archvillains.</p>
<p>Monolith's Wonder Woman appears to have been living on borrowed time for a while - announced in 2021, it had <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">reportedly</a> "struggled to coalesce" amid leadership changes and project reboots, costing Warner $100 million in the process. Still, there was cause for some hope. While it seems likely the game would have been afflicted by the same live service rot as Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-mordor-studio-are-making-a-wonder-woman-game-with-the-nemesis-system">once planned</a> to make use of Shadow Of Mordor's Nemesis system.</p>
<p>Warner Bros have yet to announce how many jobs will be lost in the course of the studio closures. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-metro-devs-working-on-%E2%80%98la-quimera%E2%80%99-a-sci-fi-shooter-that-looks-like-killzone-leaks-suggest.1119135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/la-quimera-former-metro-devs-leaks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A series of articles that were seemingly posted too early have revealed a new studio founded by former Metro developers from 4A Games. The studio, dubbed ‘Reburn’, is developing a futuristic sci-fi shooter that looks as though it could be straight out of the Killzone series. It’s named ‘La Quimera’, and an announcement trailer for the game was <strong>almost </strong>grabbed by eagle-eyed users.</p>



<p>Instead, we have a series of screencaps to go on. These images showcase an attractive, intense first-person shooter, the origins of which are hard to pinpoint. One screenshot shows the player character fighting with soldiers who have bright orange eyes on their helmets, which utterly smacks of Killzone, the long-abandoned PlayStation FPS series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-out-of-nowhere">From Out of Nowhere</h2>



<p>La Quimera translates directly from Spanish to English as ‘The Chimera’. That’s a mythological monster created by combining elements from multiple creatures, which immediately gives La Quimera a kind of ‘experiment gone wrong’ vibe. The game’s story has reportedly been penned by Nicolas Winding Refn (<em>Drive</em>, <em>The Neon Demon</em>).</p>



<p>One Spanish-speaking publication revealed several details about the game. First, it’s set ‘in a Latin American megalopolis’, </p>



<p>The screenshots that were captured and <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-metro-series-devs-form-new-game-studio-reburn-reveal-new-sc-fi-shooter-la-quimera-trailer.1118565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared on ResetEra</a> showcase a futuristic first-person shooter that could be Killzone 4 if you weren’t privy to this news.</p>



<p>In the post on ResetEra, users shared several screenshots that reveal what looks like a remarkable game at first blush. From hulking, animalistic robot enemies to dramatic showdowns between what looks like a resistance group and heavily armoured soldiers, a lot of lore is already being established for La Quimera.</p>



<p>In some scenes, we get a look at a world that appears to be somewhat devastated and overgrown, suggesting some post-apocalyptic vibes might be present. That theme fits perfectly into the wheelhouse of these developers, given that they worked on Metro.</p>



<p>There’s also a title splash that reveals the player character, an armoured individual reminiscent of a Halo Spartan or ‘Prophet’ from the Crysis series. This title splash suggests the game is only coming to PC platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-imminent-reveal">Imminent Reveal</h2>



<p>It has been claimed that La Quimera is an ‘ambitious’ game that fuses ‘exoticism and Latin folklore’ with ‘weapons and technology of the future’. The ‘Metro touch’ is front and centre from the 110 developers working on the project, many of whom have acquired experience from years of working at 4A Games.</p>



<p>It has been mentioned that it’s set to be a narrative-driven adventure playable either solo or in a group of up to four players.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known when Reburn plans to fully reveal La Quimera, but given that at least three outlets have their hands on a trailer and screenshots, it could be any day now. Studios and publishers will rarely share content like this too long before an announcement is made, for <strong>this very reason that we’re discussing</strong>.</p>



<p>Remember – <strong>it’s not confirmed until it’s confirmed, and this content is all subject to change.</strong></p>



<p>What do you think about La Quimera? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-preview-exclusive-hands-on-with-new-character-chum-and-dongtian-map</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-preview-exclusive-hands-on-with-new-character-chum-and-dongtian-map.1119108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fragpunk-preview-exclusive-hands-on-with-new-character-chum-and-dongtian-map<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of the global success of Marvel Rivals and with other popular live-service games like Naraka: Bladepoint and Once Human under its belt, NetEase has turned its attention to the hero shooter genre with FragPunk. New internal development team Bad Guitar Studio is made up of young, hardcore FPS fans, and after joining them for a one-hour play session where we tried a new character and map revealed exclusively in this preview, the team’s eye for detail is clear to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FragPunk’s main game mode is the 5v5 Shard Clash mode. On its surface, this mode resembles your typical Overwatch-like hero shooter skirmish, but it also pulls from a variety of influences to mix up the gameplay. The rounds in this mode are closer to the bomb-defusal objectives of Counter Strike, with one team planting bombs at specified locations and the other defending, with relatively small arenas that keep rounds tight and focused.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As with any hero shooter, players can choose from a selection of characters – named Lancers – who each have a selection of unique skills, meaning plenty to learn in terms of individual character preferences and team makeup. For our session, we tried the newly unveiled character Chum, a stone robot who is accompanied by a mechanical pet angler fish named Chomper. In addition to using the game’s arsenal of satisfying guns, Chum can toss projectiles similar to sticky mines and smoke grenades, as well as sending Chomper out as support. Chomper can track and bite enemies for multiple low-damage attacks, essentially like a walking turret, or can be modified with pet treats that make it explode on contact or trail a thick smokescreen in its wake, adding several strategic layers that felt fun to mix up. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Chum is a stone robot who is accompanied by a mechanical pet angler fish named Chomper.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And being made of stone, Chum is also a strong defence character, making him a great all-round option for newcomers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many other Lancer abilities are not only offensive but defensive or tactical – walls for cover, traps, speed boosts, skills that highlight enemies on the map, and so on. We tried several Lancers, and found a varied effect on gameplay. Using Nitro, with her directly-controllable four-legged drone and gun turrets, we were able to rack up multiple assists; while Axon was another favourite thanks to his more aggressive selection of skills, including projectile bombs and a cool guitar-gun. In the Lancer selection screen, you can watch a short video clip for each ability to help you quickly grasp what they do. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FragPunk Screenshots and Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what really sets FragPunk apart is its Shard Cards system. At the start of each round, each team is randomly assigned a set of three cards, which they can swap in and out, each of which changes the rules of the round for your entire team. Some are simple stat percentage boosts or buffs, while others do things like increasing the size of your enemies’ heads, decreasing your own or equipping helmets, affecting the difficulty of headshots for that round. Others still are much more unusual, and completely change the gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, one Shard Card gave our team a kind of proximity detector so that we got an aural and visual signal whenever an enemy was nearby, while another slowly regenerated our health gauge, both of which gave us a welcome advantage. Some cards affect the environment, such as shrouding the map in fog that adds tension as enemies are harder to spot. Others have active effects – press the Z key to swap health bars with an enemy, or to swap gear with them, or to jump into a parallel world where you can essentially run unseen to a new location and then pop back into the fight to ambush your foes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fragpunk - Dongtian Map</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a lot to take in. You only have around 30 seconds to finalise your hand for each round, and at first each of the 150+ cards will be new to you. “We deliberately made the rule for each card as simple as possible so that they can be quick to understand,” Creative Director Xin Chang told us. “We also made the description text for each card as short as possible, and used visual design to make its effects more obvious.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The ruleset-shuffling Shard Cards were inspired not only by other videogames, but also by sports. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After a few rounds, the Shard Cards system began to make sense, and really paid off in terms of making each round feel different. We were forced to engage differently with every round, rethinking strategies and responding not only to our team’s current hand but also the enemy team’s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, the ruleset-shuffling Shard Cards were inspired not only by other videogames, but also by sports. The development team’s building has a large gymnasium with facilities for activities such as basketball, table tennis and badminton, its walls adorned with photos of the developers in competition.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FragPunk Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chang explained, “I play soccer and basketball, so I like games with a two-team system. I also watch a lot of NBA, and they often make changes to the rules to keep the sport interesting. Based on that idea, I also wanted to have a system of tweaking the rules in our game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sports also influenced the team’s approach to FragPunk’s maps. Level Designer An Yuan added, “In level design, we divide the map into areas that are good for attack or defence phases, so that the player has to keep moving. It’s kind of like basketball, where you have different spatial design around the court that suits the different roles of the players. We applied that concept in our game, and also in the Shard Cards, which can turn a good hiding place into a bad one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FragPunk also features a Duel mode. When a match ends in a tie, it changes to a one-on-one showdown, a little bit like the mano a mano face-offs in Call of Duty: Warzone’s Gulag, but inspired by soccer’s penalty shootouts. Each player takes their turn in the queue for a series of short and sharp winner-stays-on rounds in small but vertically layered arenas. With all our teammates spectating during our turn, we totally felt the pressure, making for a fun and different tie-breaker mini-game. It’s so cool, the devs even added it as a separate standalone mode called Duel Master.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each map has interactive gimmicks that players can use strategically to gain the upper hand. First, we tried the newly unveiled map Dongtian. This is the Hangzhou, China-based dev team’s stab at an Asian-flavoured map, and its two bomb sites can be rotated by players for tactical advantage. When the switch in the middle of the map is activated by a player, the core cover at the bomb site rotates, altering strategies for both the offensive and defensive teams.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Each map has interactive gimmicks that players can use strategically to gain the upper hand. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to use these rotating walls to switch the edge between the attack team and the defence team,” explained Yuan. “So we encourage players to fight for that core area to maintain their edge or get the edge for themselves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other maps have their own gimmicks – BlackMarket’s manually controlled bridge allows players to change the map’s layout and even pull the ground from under their opponents’ feet; Akhet has an underground river that allows sneaky players to move directly from the middle area to a bomb site; and Tundra has magic portals that instantly zap players between gates to outmanoeuvre the other team. It was fun to explore these maps, and clearly players who take the time to learn them properly will gain an advantage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dongtian is the home setting for the Lancer Kismet. Narrative Director Wenhe Fu explained, “The game has a multiverse concept, which allows us to have each character come from quite a different universe. We’ll take some time in future phases to introduce those background details to players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Built into a mountain and dotted with ancient wooden temple buildings, mystical statues and wizened trees with gracefully warped trunks, Dongtian’s Eastern aesthetic brings a smart visual twist to FragPunks’ colourful world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Art Director Yiming Li told us, “We wanted to blend ancient buildings that look like they could come from China with near-future science and technology elements, as well as some religious elements. While each map will have its own distinctive cultural features, we want them all to fit into the game’s overall sci-fi feeling. It’s like in Star Wars: Each of the civilisations are very different, but when they are viewed as a whole, they also exist under a harmonious sci-fi setting.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that brings us to FragPunk’s visuals. This is a really gorgeous game. The punk-influenced and sci-fi-tinged fluorescent aesthetic is rich and appealing, and its kill animations are punctuated by dazzling bursts of colour. Its maps are extremely readable, and player characters pop, making it easy to follow the action. Even its menus are pretty to look at, with the flashy presentation you’d expect from a Persona game or Street Fighter 6, with bold layouts accented by graffiti scribbles. It really stands out in the hero shooter space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FragPunk will be free to play, with a small selection of Lancers available at the start so that players can learn them gradually, unlocking more as they go through in-game currency accrued through play or paid microtransactions. Other optional purchases will be strictly cosmetic. We’ll have to wait until launch to see how the service side pans out – other NetEase games like Marvel Rivals and Naraka: Bladepoint have seen complaints about pricing, but that aside they have managed to keep players satisfied, so hopefully that’s a good sign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Shard Clash and Duel modes we tried, FragPunk will feature a mix of modes at or after launch that are targeted at both hardcore and casual players, including one where all players are forced to use the same Lancer, or melee weapons only, and so on. The development team is apparently largely made up of pro-level players, but it’s clear they have also taken steps to make the game accessible to newbies and even streamers and their viewers.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
