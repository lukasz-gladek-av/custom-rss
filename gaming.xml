			<p>Nioh has been one of my favourite takes on the Soulslike genre ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/07/nioh-review/">the original launched in 2017</a>. Not only does this series have a stellar aesthetic, but you get to enjoy being surrounded by some of the coolest monster designs going (thanks to the Japanese folklore that they’re based on), and the more fluid approach to combat and Diablo-style loot progression means you’re always moving forward and you can dive in deep or just enjoy hitting things.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/10/nioh-2-review/">Nioh 2 was substantially better</a> than the first one, and I’m very happy to report that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> is substantially better than the second one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Launch Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MyenuEg-z1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as Tokugawa Takechiyo, the grandchild of Tokugawa Ieyasu, your goal in Nioh 3 is to save the world from his nefarious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, who has upended the natural order of the world. Spanning multiple periods of Japanese history, each has been corrupted by a massive Yokai known as the Crucible, which is drawn to a mineral known as Crucinite and turns people into monster.&nbsp;The actual characters and story are a little derivative, but the writing and spectacle of it all really help cement it as being something very enjoyable. That’s just why you’re fighting though, and frankly it’s <em>how</em> you’re fighting and exploring the world that makes this game so very special.</p>


<p>Where you could always build your character to suit different playstyles in the first two games, Nioh 3 gives you two forms to switch between,&nbsp;with one being Samurai and one being Ninja. These dictate which weapons you can use, along with which special abilities as well. Samurai can still switch stances, as with the previous games, and restore stamina in combat with a well-timed Ki Pulse, while Ninja get access to ninjutsu that recharge as you deal damage to enemies and has an evasive Mist move as a Ki Pulse alternative.</p>


<p>You can build these two styles separately, having Samurai being a tank with low movement speed and the Ninja being a lot faster, but that’s just the most obvious direction to take and there’s more flexibility to choose your own playstyles. There are benefits to both, and the game looks to encourage you to swap back and forth, most notably by letting you can deflect otherwise unblockable attacks by switching between the two with good timing. Oh, and you can just do auto-equip for both as well, where it’ll keep your weapon preferences in mind and then just optimise your armour at different agility levels.</p>
<p>Along with that, you get access to Onmyo magic, which gets stronger if you invest in it. This lets you summon the souls of defeated Yokai to help you, but can also turn them into consumable items that recharge when you pray at a shrine. You can then further go down all of these as you level up by allocating stats, picking skills to take for each form, and more. All of this is an awful lot to deal with, and can feel daunting for the sheer wealth of possibilities, but don’t worry, you can re-spec whenever you want. It makes for a wonderfully flexible system.</p>

<p>When it comes to exploration, instead of going on missions or having a more wide-linear path through the world, you’re now just let loose in an open sandbox set in a particular time period. There are a few of these periods to explore, and each one is split into multiple individual regions which let you pick up buffs the more you explore them. There are multiple areas that feel like individual Nioh missions just put into an open world, and that’s incredibly. There’s something wonderful about just wondering into a cave and finding out it’s a whole adventure all on its own. You even gain new exploration abilities as you go through the game, acting almost like a Metroidvania-style secret system.</p>
<p>The result of all of this is an incredibly expansive game that never feels empty, encourages multiple playstyles and the ability to flit between them at will, and a gorgeous world to explore with some of the coolest boss designs I’ve had the pleasure to fight. It can be a bit silly sometimes, with enemy AI not noticing you assassinating a friend of theirs just a few feat away with lots of loud and squishy noises, but it’s just too much fun for that to be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, you have the returning ability to play through the whole game in co-op, though I’ve not had a chance to do so prior to release. You can still summon people to help you just for a particular boss battle – either other players or NPC characters – &nbsp;but the idea of running around these massive regions with a friend is one that’s just deeply appealing to me. I’ve been wanting to play another open-world game for a while, and I’d sort of forgotten that’s what Nioh 3 was promising. This game is hitting the spot in every possible way.</p>

		<p>While tennis fever won’t sweep across the UK until the strawberries are ripe and the hills have sprouted Henmans, Aussies would tell you that the tennis season is well underway. And so would Nintendo, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-swich-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in just a couple weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever arrives in what, to my mind at least, is the strange scenario of its direct predecessor still being eminently playable on the Switch 2. I’m sure you can imagine how I felt when I was reminded that Mario Tennis Aces actually came out in 2018? It’s been eight years? When did that happen? Perhaps the curious memory hole that Aces found itself in isn’t helped by, well, this fundamentally still being a tennis game… with Mario and crazy super-powers.</p>


<p>Our hands-on time started with a brief tutorial, running through the core controls and new Fever Rackets. It’s immediately very familiar, with your standard shot types spread across the four face buttons, the ability to pull of a strong double-tap Powerful Shot, and the held Charge Shot. Positioning is important, but this is a thoroughly forgiving game in terms of shot timing. If you or your opponent misstime things, then a Star Shot smash opportunity is highlighted on the court for you to race to and try to take advantage of.</p>


<p>Where Mario Tennis Fever starts to distinguish itself from Aces is with the much larger roster of characters to play as – introducing Baby Waluigi for the very first time alongside the lesser seen Baby Wario – each with particular stats and attributes, and that your Special Shot is now determined by which racket they are holding. Fever Rackets can do all manner of things, from leaving burning chunks of rock on the court to whipping up localised tornadoes, summoning shadowy allies, and more. The trick to the Fever Rackets is that these can be returned with good positioning and timing, bouncing their ill effects back to the other side of the court.</p>
<p>With the basics mastered, we hopped into multiplayer for 1v1 and 2v2 matches, and I had a great time of it. There’s a great arcade foundation for this game, and I loved being able to send truly wicked slices that swerved off the court, while the quick double-tap Powerful Shot was my mainstay for a rally.</p>

<p>But things got silly as we started to lean on the Fever Racket shots, with this meter building up much more quickly than in Mario Tennis Aces. While I only really got to explore a handful of the effects the rackets offered, the way that some of the effects would stick around between points made them very powerful. Being able to lock off certain parts of the court with burning coals, or purposefully aiming for twisters to try and send the ball in befuddling directions, and having these affect multiple points was a huge advantage. The Mud Racket, though, is massively overpowered. This creates pools of mud that splatter the screen like the squid ink from Mario Kart… but it will do it every time the ball splats into a muddy patch! At the very least, you need to try and return this to the other side of the net to try and share some of the pain, but it feels like a very powerful racket, so long as you don’t suffer the backsplash.</p>
<p>Running into damaging hazards will also drain a player’s HP, and getting hit by too much damage will knock them out of the match for a few moments. It was particularly tense when this happened in doubles, as I frantically tried to hold out until my partner was able to (miraculously) rejoin and hit the winner from the net.</p>

<p>Things already get pretty chaotic when there’s four players, all with distinct racket abilities, but what if you threw even more modifiers into the mix? The Mix It Up mode adds further special rules and special courts. The Racket Factory spawns new rackets for you to grab if you hit a quadrant on the other side of the court, and there’s also Ring Shot, Pinball and a tricky-looking Forest Court which grows and shrinks over time.</p>
<p>Perhaps the wildest of the bunch is the Wonder Court Match. Inspired by Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it tasks you with collecting Wonder Seeds that float above the net with your directed shots, but halfway through the match, a Wonder Flower will appear and bring a grand transformation to the court. We’ve seen the net turn into a set of green pipes that can move up and down, while another has Piranha Plants walking back and forth like it’s the Mushroom Kingdom Fashion Week or something. You still need to keep grabbing Wonder Seeds in order to win.</p>

<p>Mario Tennis Fever has plenty in common with Mario Tennis Aces, but the focus has shifted just a little to give it more of a party game vibe. The Zone Shot system of before felt like it was all about hitting a finisher for a single point, but as you direct a Fever Shot in this sequel, it’s more about injecting another wild variable and obstacle. If the adventure mode can be a bit more engaging this time around, this could be a really fun entry for all players.</p>

<figure data-uuid="ea95192144bd1"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ea95192144bd1/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, we had an inkling that it might be on the horizon, and Nintendo has just made it official. A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has been announced for <strong>Thursday, 5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The Direct will kick off at <strong>2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 6am PT</strong>, and it promises "roughly 30 minutes" of news and announcements for third-party games heading to Switch 2 and Switch 1. As ever, you'll be able to watch along on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a>, your regional variant, or on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>

						</p></div></div>			
			<p>I am not going to lie: I love <strong>Team NINJA</strong>. If you have been checking out my coverage over the past few years, you likely know this already. Ever since first picking up the PlayStation port of <em>Dead or Alive</em>, I was hooked. There is a specific feel to their combat that <strong>no other developer quite replicates</strong>. That admiration for the studio founded by the legendary Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away last October</strong></a>, only deepened as they pioneered the genres I love most: the high-octane character action of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/"><strong>Ninja Gaiden</strong></a></em> and the punishing Masocore depth of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-complete-edition/"><strong>Nioh</strong></a></em>. Even when they stumbled, as they did with the original <em>Ninja Gaiden 3</em>, their DNA remained unmistakable.</p>



<p>It is this refusal to be a mere imitator that allowed the <em>Nioh</em> series to <strong>thrive</strong> in the Soulslike flood of the 2010s and 2020s. While others were content to <strong>copy FromSoftware's homework</strong>, adding a few tweaks on the way,<strong> Team NINJA went their own way</strong>, crafting what I've always described as a <em>"Ninja Gaiden meets Diablo"</em> hybrid. It was a match made in heaven, or hell, depending on how many times a boss has sent you back to the shrine.</p>



<p>Following <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh 2</strong></a></em>, the studio entered a more experimental era that I still maintain is<strong> terribly underappreciated</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/"><strong><em>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/"><strong><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/"><strong><em>Rise of the Ronin</em></strong></a> are all deeply engaging titles whose reputations were unfairly marred by underwhelming visuals and launch-day performance issues. <strong>But these games didn't exist in a vacuum</strong>. On the contrary, the evolution of combat in <em>Stranger of Paradise</em>, the vertical stage design in<em> Wo Long</em>, and the movement and open world structure in <em>Ronin</em> were clearly <strong>stepping stones</strong> for <em>Nioh 3.</em></p>



<p>What we have now is a journey through time that, simply put, is excellent. A journey that, for me, confirms the high hopes I had during my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>extended preview session last year</strong></a>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is not just a sequel; it is the proper first new entry in the series<span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>one of the best games Team NINJA has ever made</strong>, held back only&nbsp;</span>by some technical issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-journey-through-japanese-history">A Journey Through Japanese History</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Story-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 bring players on a journey through time in search of Kunimatsu</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking a page from the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 2 </em>DLC expansions' overarching story involving <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">time travel</strong>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em>'s story is centered on traveling through time to <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">different periods of Japanese </strong><strong>h</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">istory</strong> to put a stop to the evil that has been gripping the nation since <strong>Kunimatsu Tokugawa</strong> showed his true colors on the eve of the appointment as Shogun of <strong>Takechiyo Tokugawa</strong>, the game's fully customizable main character.</p>



<p>Kunimatsu's betrayal goes <strong>much deeper</strong> than just a struggle for power, as the hellish landscapes of the Crucibles, powered by the material known as Crucinite, are <strong>reshaping</strong> both the land of Japan and its history, giving extraordinary, and evil, powers to some of the <strong>central figures of Japanese history</strong>, such as Takeda Shingen and his generals, corrupting both their minds and their Guardian Spirits.</p>



<p>Guided by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Guardian Spirit Kusanagi</strong>, Takechiyo will travel to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Warring States</strong> period to assist his grandfather, Ieyasu Tokugawa, against Takeda Shingen and his clan, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">taking part in famous battles</strong> such as the Battle of Mikatagahara, before continuing their journey across time to multiple time periods, including the <strong>Heian</strong> and <strong>Bakumatsu</strong> period, meeting and befriending real history figures of Japanese history.</p>

<p>In terms of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">story and characters</strong>, Nioh 3 doesn't differ much from its predecessors, combining real elements with a fantasy story featuring Yokai and other elements of Japanese folklore. While the plot isn't particularly deep, it is definitely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enjoyable</strong>, especially if you are into Japanese history, as many of the situations presented in the game are potential what-if scenarios of real history. With a few twists along the way, though far from being the central element of the experience, the story definitely gets its job done. I ultimately enjoyed <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 2</em>'s story a bit more for how it weaved the Shiftling Hide's story with Hideyoshi Toyotomi's, but it's more a matter of preference than <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> doing something worse in this regard.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-reborn">Nioh Reborn</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Open-Fields-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Nioh 3'</em><em>s </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">open-fields shake up the series formula significantly</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <em>Nioh 3</em> doesn't shake up the series' typical narrative and themes, the new entry in the series <strong>significantly alters the formula</strong> of its predecessors and other Team NINJA games, doing away with the overhead maps from which to select missions and linear stage design in favor of a more <strong>open-ended approach.</strong></p>



<p>Before release, the developer stressed multiple times that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not an open-world game</strong> but an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">open-field game</strong>, which connects the more linear locations that serve as the typical mission setting from the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>I have to admit I wasn't too excited about <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">losing the immediacy that Team NINJA's games</strong> provided. I generally like open-world games, but I feel many <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fail at making traversing these big maps interesting after a dozen hours or so</strong>, bloating what could have been tighter experiences. However, after spending over 50 hours in <em>Nioh 3</em>, <strong>my fears have been allayed.</strong></p>



<p>Though the open-field maps in Nioh 3 diminish the immediacy of the experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">they in no way feel like a pointless bloating of the experience</strong>. They essentially function in the same way as the overhead maps did in previous entries in the series, only that now the player can look around to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">find all sorts of secrets</strong> inside chests, which include some critical parts of character progression such as Skills, Samurai and Ninja Points required to unlock Martial Arts via the game's numerous skill trees, fight formidable enemies and Masters to unlock new Martial Arts and Transformed Arts, unique variants of Martial Arts with altered elemental properties, start-up and recovery, rescue Kodama spirits and pray at Jizo Statues to unlock their Blessings and chase after Scampusses to find even more secrets.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-open-fields-challenges-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Challenges aplenty await Takechiyo in Nioh 3's open fields</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played any of the previous entries in the series, you can probably already understand what <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> did: take most of the content upon which <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">separate sub-missions</strong> were built on, and placed them on a bigger map for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cohesive experience</strong>, where even usually shallow elements like enemy camps are twisted in a Nioh series fashion to provide even more challenges to face outside of the traditional missions. Delivering so many benefits that enhance <strong>combat and character progression</strong>, which are what Team NINJA always does best, <strong>exploring maps is both an integral part of the experience and one that is surprisingly fun.</strong></p>



<p>Exploring these open-field maps in Nioh 3 is made even better by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">solid</strong><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">, varied map design</strong>, which features</span> increased verticality thanks to the introduction of jumping. While the first few regions of the Warring States starting map may not seem all that interesting, everything past the first Crucible is <strong>much more interesting</strong>, with the complexity of each region increasing in the other open-field maps. More often than not, you will find <strong>multiple paths</strong> available to you, each one with a good reason to explore fully.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-everything-is-an-open-field">Not Everything is an Open-Field</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-linear-missions-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Linear missions return in Nioh 3, and they are better than ever</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not everything is an open field in <em>Nioh 3</em>, though their <strong>design philosophy</strong> permeates the game's entire level design. The locations where main and sub-missions take place are more in line with what was seen in the first two entries in the series, but they are <strong>much more open</strong>, featuring multiple paths to the goal and optional challenges such as stronger Yokai, traps, and more.</p>



<p>These elements are brought to eleven <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">in the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Crucibles</strong>, the hellish landscapes that constit</span>ute&nbsp;the game's main dungeons. Sporting a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">multilayered design</strong> with some platforming sprinkled it, these locations also offer an increased challenge with the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Life Corrosio</strong><strong>n</strong> mechanics, which cause a reduction of your maximum health when attacked by enemies. These effects can be offset by the Jizo Statues' blessings obtained while exploring the open fields, adding another element that ties into the game's big gameplay features.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> also offers something to those who preferred how previous games handled mission selection via <strong>Battle Scrolls</strong>. <span>Unlocke</span>d after completing select missions, these additional missions are accessed straight from the Shrine to offer some of the&nbsp;<strong>most challenging content of the game</strong>, including some intense boss rush-style missions that are very difficult to complete without proper preparation and a good grasp of the game's mechanics.</p>



<p>The inclusion of Battle Scroll missions also increases the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">amount of content</strong>, which would be staggering already with just what can be found in the open-field maps. Although there's only a few of them, they are packed with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">activities and meaningful rewards</strong>. To make an example, it took me nearly 30 hours to explore a good portion of the Warring States map, and I didn't even complete every Myth sidequests nor find every item and point of interest. So no worries about a lack of content: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> is as huge as its predecessors, if not even more so.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-samurai-or-ninja-why-not-both">Samurai or Ninja? Why Not Both?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-or-Ninja-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 features the ultimate evolution of the series' combat mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The gameplay changes over past entries in the series featured in Nioh 3 don't stop at the introduction of these well-crafted open fields, but extend to the one element that defines a Team NINJA action game: <strong>combat</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>combat basics haven't changed much</strong>, on the surface. You still get multiple weapons with unique movesets that can be wielded in three different stances and Ki Pulse to restore your stamina by pressing a specific button at the right time after completing a technique.</p>



<p>Appearances, however, can be very deceiving, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">little has truly remained the same over <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em></strong>. The biggest addition to the combat system is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">two fighting styles</strong>: Samurai and Ninja. Samurai style is essentially the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">classic <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh</em> combat st</strong>yle with the traditional elements outlined above, an Arts Proficiency mechanic that empowers Strong Attacks and Martial Arts, the special techniques performed with button combinations, whose effects can be renewed by stringing these techniques one after the other, and Deflect, a beneficial parry and the core defense mechanic of the fighting style.</p>



<p>Ninja style, on the other hand, is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">mobile fighting style</strong> coming with a single stance but the ability to use Ninjutsu techniques, many of them brought over from Nioh 2, with the difference that their uses can be restored by attacking enemies, blocking, and dodging their attacks. Besides this, what sets Ninja style apart is its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">inability to use Ki Pulse</strong>, which is replaced by a Mist maneuver that can be used to dodge attacks. Both styles can also jump and attack from the air, but Ninja style has the edge in this regard, with more varied aerial Martial Arts, and the ability to jump off enemies for increased airborne time.</p>



<p>Besides the different techniques at their disposal, Samurai and Ninja styles differ the most in their <strong>weapon selection</strong>. While there are Samurai and Ninja style equivalents of the same weapons, such as Swords, Dual Swords, and Caestus/Talons, some are entirely exclusive, such as the Switchglaive and the Tonfa.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-and-Ninja-Styles-Depth-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 doesn't punish you if you stick to one fighting style, but you would be missing out on a lot</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This locking specific weapon types to specific fighting styles, I feel, will remain the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">most controversial</strong> aspect of the game's combat changes. I personally did not mind this, as one of my main weapons in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, the Tonfa, works as it always had, but for other weapons, the changes are big, and it's undeniable that the <strong>Kusarigama and the Splitstaff do feel a little gutted</strong> compared to their Nioh 2 iterations.</p>



<p>The existence of the Samurai and Ninja styles, <span>like the weapon mechanics, doesn't feel&nbsp;<strong>limiting</strong>&nbsp;at all, except in</span> some specific cases. In no way whatsoever the game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">forces you to switch between them</strong> like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Stranger of Paradise</em> incentivizes to switch between Jobs on the fly: if you so wish, you could play the entire game in either style and, after defeating a certain boss in the Warring States map, you won't even need to switch to unleash Burst Counter, a very effective counter against the red aura-coded Burst Attacks.</p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sticking to one style only</strong> is definitely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not the optimal way</strong> to play <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, as the two styles' unique capabilities are so tightly interwoven that there will come a point when s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tyle switching will become a core strategy</strong>, also thanks to some Skills which grant you some very nice bonuses for doing so near enemies, including powering up Martial Arts and restoring some Ki when critically low.</p>



<p>The Samurai and Ninja styles are further enhanced by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Living Artifact</strong>, a powered-up temporary state that mixes Living Weapon from the original Nioh and Yokai Shift from its sequel. This not only grants Takechiyo invincibility and elemental properties to their attacks, but also some new techniques which are perfectly woven into every weapon's moveset and the unique abilities of each fighting style.</p>



<p>For every intent and purpose, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the increased freedom offered by the open-field maps seems to have been replicated in the combat system</strong> (whose intricacies are explained in the guides in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-complete-walktrough-and-guides-hub/"><strong>Nioh 3 Walkthrough and Guides Hub</strong></a>). These changes not only make combat even deeper, but also move the experience closer to the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninja Gaiden</em> roots of Team NINJA, turning <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> into a game that's closer to a character action game than a soulslike, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">matching combat depth and quality map traversal as few other action RPGs do.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-the-growth-of-the-shogun">The Growth of the Shogun</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Shogun-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The series' deep character customization returns in Nioh 3</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides being able to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fully customize</strong> Takechiyo Tokugawa at the beginning of the game with a new iteration of Team NINJA's solid character creation system, you have almost complete control of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how to build your protagonist</strong>. You can allocate points to stats at bonfire-like Shrines after obtaining enough Amrita to level up, influencing everything from weapon damage to Ninjutsu potency, and mix and match every piece of equippable gear to further refine the character build with their passive abilities.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Onmyo Magic</strong> abilities, unleashed by using Talismans that have always been a core part of character building in the series, have been radically changed in Nioh 2 and fully integrated into the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Soul Cores system</strong>. These cores dropped by enemies upon defeat can be equipped in the Onmyo Box in either Yin or Yang position to gain access to multiple passive skills, Yokai summoning Talismans, which were the Yokai Skills in <em>Nioh 2</em>, but without the same combo potential or the traditional Onmyo Magic Talismans.</p>



<p>Alongside the split of exclusive style weapons, <strong>the changes to Onmyo Magic</strong>, and the removal of the dedicated skill tree are among <strong>the most controversial changes</strong> to the series' systems in <em>Nioh 3</em>, as most of the community felt the magic-focused playstyle was getting <strong>sidelined</strong>. In some ways, this is true: Onmyo is still effective for buffing and for fighting enemies with elemental spells, but it's undeniable that <strong>introducing a hard limit to how many spells you can carry limits this playstyle</strong>. I do feel this was inevitable with the more action-oriented philosophy in which combat is now grounded, but it will inevitably disappoint those who played as Onmyo Mages.</p>



<p>What did disappoint me more, on the other hand, was the changes made to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai Skills system</strong>, replaced by two set Guardian Spirit skills for each spirit, which work essentially in the same way as emergency animation recovery canceling and elemental ailments procurement. Make no mistake: these skills are quite varied and fun to use, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">they lack the same versatility as Yokai Skills</strong>. The new system still lets you use them in some form, but the time required for the skill to activate makes them unsuited for the same intense combo play possible in Nioh 2, even with a specific skill learned fairly early on, which lets you cancel any animation with a Yokai summon. Farewell, Ippon-Datara stun combos, see you in my next <em>Nioh 2</em> playthrough on who knows when.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Nurikabe-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You can still fight powerful Yokai using Onmyo Magic, but the changes made to the system limit its potential</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Don't let my disappointment for losing some of the crazy combos that could be pulled off in <em>Nioh 2</em> with Yokai Skills fool you. Though maybe <strong>less creative</strong> (at least until I figure out how to use the new version of the Yokai Skills properly), <em>Nioh 3</em> still has a lot to offer in this regard. Martial Arts are way <strong>easier to chain into one another</strong> in both Samurai and Ninja style, so it's still possible to pull off some stunning strings with some practice, which is likely due, again, to the changes made to combat as a whole.</p>



<p>Much like Onmyo Magic, however, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Martial Arts underwent a significant change</strong> in Nioh 3, and one that disappointed me. The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Arcana System</strong><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">,</strong>&nbsp;which allowed customi</span>zation of Martial Arts with different properties, is&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">completely gone</strong>, replaced by the aforementioned Transformed Arts that alter select Martial Arts with elemental properties and more. Such a closed system, however, <strong>doesn't make up for the loss</strong> of a complex system that probably only the most die-hard Nioh players used to its full potential.</p>



<p>Small personal disappointment aside, although streamlined in places, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> character progression systems don't leave much to be desired</strong>. Obviously, their full potential remains to be seen, but as things stand, the depth has only been moved around to better suit <em>Nioh 3</em> combat.</p>



<h2 id="h-wrath-of-the-yokai">Wrath of the Yokai</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Enemy-Design-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3's enemy design is in line with the rest of the series, featuring both new and returning enemies</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With so many tools in the hands of the player, it stands to reason that enemy design would take this into account. However, this seems to hold true only for new enemies.</p>



<p>As expected, <span>given its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;features many&nbsp;<strong>returning human enemies and Yokai</strong>, with some new variations equipped with</span> new weapons and using different attacks. The vast majority of returning enemies and bosses haven't changed much since previous entries, so if you’ve already <strong>mastered their patterns</strong>, you’ll likely find yourself taking them down with muscle memory alone.</p>



<p>The new enemy and bosses, on the other hand, seem to have been designed with the new mechanics in mind. For example, a good number of new Yokai have a <strong>very easy time hitting you out of the air</strong>, forcing you to pay attention before launching in an aerial combo that might be interrupted.</p>



<p>The new <strong>boss design</strong> is, as expected from Team NINJA, very good. Without spoiling anything, some of the bosses Takechiyo will face in their journey through time are all very unique and come with very personable fighting styles and gimmicks that will put your skills to the test, but <strong>never in a frustrating manner</strong>. In the past few years, I couldn't help but start to dislike FromSoftware's boss design philosophies, starting from base <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a></em>, with most bosses unleashing wide range attacks that are difficult to avoid, and <strong>I'm happy that Team NINJA isn't following suit</strong>, preferring to further evolve their tough-but-fair design philosophy.</p>



<p>This is something I appreciated not only in boss fights but also in the <strong>general balancing approach</strong>. This time around, the <strong>difficulty curve is different</strong>. <em>Nioh</em> and <em>Nioh 2</em> were difficult at the beginning, but much easier once you learned how to take advantage of the mechanics to destroy enemies and even stun-lock every boss with the right setup. In <em>Nioh 3</em>, the curve is more natural, <strong>increasing consistently with each new region and map</strong>. Also, enemies don't stay out of Ki for too long, so touch of death combos require overpowered builds that are hardly possible in the first playthrough.</p>



<p>Although s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ome veterans will inevitably be disappointed by what may feel like an easier game</strong>, especially in the Warring States first few regions, I feel this difficulty curve <strong>benefits the game</strong> both in single player and in co-op in the first playthrough, leaving any possible frustration for the higher difficulties that are sure to come with the DLC expansions in the future, in proper Team NINJA fashion.</p>



<h2 id="h-graphics-and-performance">Graphics and Performance</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Graphics-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Nioh 3 is not the best-looking game of the generation, but it's not the worst either</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While Team NINJA has always delivered on gameplay, <strong>their latest efforts have left something to be desired in the visuals</strong>. On this front, <em>Nioh 3</em> definitely fares better than, say, <em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, but it's still far from sporting the best visuals of the current generation.</p>



<p>Still, this doesn't mean that the game looks bad. The contrary, actually: it is definitely <strong>one of the most visually advanced games from the studio yet</strong>. Character models are a definite step up from previous games in terms of model complexity and detail, and this is easily noticeable with the returning Yokai, whose looks are improved over their previous iterations. Animations have also been improved, subtly but sensibly, making combat feel even more satisfying. The texture work has similarly been improved, building upon what was seen in <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.</em></p>

<p>Considering how Team NINJA games have often left s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">omething to be desired with their PC ports</strong>, there was some justified concern regarding <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> as well. Unfortunately, the new entry in the series is no different, and the full version is plagued by the same issues many have reported in the demo. <strong>High CPU usage</strong> in certain parts of the open fields, <strong>VRAM usage</strong> increasing for no reason during gameplay, and stuttery camera movement are only the tip of the iceberg</p>



<p>One <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">major technical issue</strong>, aside from the low graphics settings generally looking terrible and the inability to run the game at native resolution without being forced to use NVIDIA DLSS (DLAA), AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS, significantly impacts the experience. This issue has forced me <span>to</span>&nbsp;cap<strong> my FPS at 60</strong> for the best responsiveness in open-field areas.</p>



<p>The issue occurs when Dynamic FPS Adjustment is disabled with a 120 FPS cap. No matter the location, the tools report frame rates in the 100s, but <strong>the entire game is significantly slowed down</strong>. I tried changing every setting, reducing resolution scaling, and even dropping resolution from 4K to 1440p, but the issue persisted. If it is turned on, it automatically caps the framerate to 60 FPS. The only way I had to have the game run at the 120 FPS cap was by enabling Frame Generation, but then again, the experience wasn't as responsive as it is in other games, as the base framerate is stuck at 60 FPS and not at the higher range my system (i7-13700 CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) can hit in the game.</p>

<p>I had a similar issue a few years ago with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</em> at launch (and on another system to boot!), so this is definitely an engine-level bug that needs to be sorted. However, after a few hours of adjustments, I have found the game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sticks to its 60 FPS cap most of the time</strong> on my system, aside from the occasional stuttering, so if you are really looking forward to the game and don't mind this issue too much, you can still have a great time until it is fixed.</p>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Closing-Thoughts-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Everything considered, is Nioh 3 a step forward for the series?</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The more I played <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, the more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">I liked what Team NINJA has done</strong>. However, the fact that I wasn't having too much trouble against humans and Yokai, for the most part, was something <span>I<strong>&nbsp;couldn't</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> easily put to the side</strong>. Is the game too easy? Have the RPG mechanics been simplified so much that anyone could have the same experience <span>I did, or am I so accustomed to&nbsp;<em>Nioh</em>&nbsp;and Team NINJA games that I have a distorted</span> perception of the game's difficulty?</p>



<p>This, alongside the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">technical bug which forced a 60 FPS cap to me</strong>, made me <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">wrestle with the score for a long time</strong>.

However, a game of this caliber <strong>deserves</strong> <strong>a PC port that doesn't feel like it's fighting the player's hardware</strong>. While <strong>the game itself is a 10</strong>, the technical issues hold the overall package back just a hair from that perfect mark. But make no mistake: <strong>this is the new gold standard for hardcore action RPGs</strong>.</p>

				<p>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> season 28 launches on February 10th, and appears to add competitive glazing to the now 7-year-old battle royale. The game's "newest tactical mechanic", so says the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-game-updates">announcement post</a>, is Hardlight Mesh, a glowy, bullet-resistant window that teams can either throw up to defend a hidey hole or, with enough lead, rockets, and/or angry kicks, break down to form a new ingress point. Holes in walls? That’s old hat. ApeLegs is <em>disrupting</em> holes in walls. There’ll probably be a TechCrunch article on it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here’s a little teaser trailer, which opens with a tribute to Respawn Entertainment co-founder Vince Zampella, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-co-creator-infinity-ward-and-respawn-entertainment-co-founder-and-battlefield-head-vince-zampella-dies-aged-55">died last December</a> in a high-speed car collision along with his passenger. Said tribute is then immediately followed by someone hurtling through a window. O...okay.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNJoZD_nvQ">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNJoZD_nvQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AccidentalP">Accidently Partridgian</a> video edit aside, we can see that Hardlight Mesh panels do actually play a lightly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a>-y - or dare I say it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-impressions">Highguard</a>-y - role in dynamic point defence. Though I’m always unnerved by attempts to make Apex gunfights more locked-down and static; all its best action tends to be more scrappy, dynamic, and three-dimensional, with lots of panicked scrambling up walls and near-constant bumslides. That said, these panels are also the source of an agurably needed buff to the oft-overlooked Controller Legends class – yer Wattsons and yer Catalysts – who, alone, gain the ability to repair and reinforce these fresh new takes on glass sheets. Next-gen windows, they is.</p><p>It also sounds like they can be countered by certain Legend abilities, including those of Fuse, who’s getting a rework in S28. His ultimate, instead of drawing a ring of fire, will instead pepper the target area with cluster bombs – and judging by the trailer, the initial projectile can lodge inside shields and dump its payload onto the opposite side, nullifying Hardlight’s defensive advantage.</p>
<p>That’s fine, if a bit similar to the tactical ability of rival Legdge (and lore buddy) Mad Maggie, which does basically the same thing but worse. More worrying are the promised Bloodhound buffs, detailed to us in a separate email from EA: they’re getting an "improved Tactical Scan and massive reduced Ultimate cooldown", as well as the power to extent their ult's duration by knocking enemies while it’s active. More legal wallhacks, then. Cool. COOL. What’s even the point of having Windows 2 to cower behind when a rampaging plague doctor can x-ray-vision you from six thousand miles away?</p>
<p>Respawn may or may not answer that question on February 6th, when a more in-depth Designer’s Note blog on the season update goes live. That’s ahead of the full patch notes on the 9th, and the update's release on the 10th.</p>

            <p>Friends, I think I have unearthed the next Hidden Gem, though Hidden Arrow Trap might be the more appropriate framing. It’s a 2D precision platformer called the The Pale Piper that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>. It’s the work of FreeTimeDev, who is also known for Godot tools and synthwave jams on <a href="https://freetimedev.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925120/The_Pale_Piper/">out today on Steam</a>, and the demo has killed me eleventy million times. </p><!--more-->
<p>The Pale Piper is a sequel of sorts to the German folktale (folktail?) about the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Pied Piper of Hamelin was a musical exterminator who used his magic ditties to lure away all the rats infesting a village. When the villagers wouldn’t pay him, he unleashed his Satanic melodies to lead all the local children away too. The moral of the story is: kill bards on sight, especially when they’re dual classing. It turns out the Pied Paper story may have been inspired by a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/travel/article/20200902-the-grim-truth-behind-the-pied-piper">real historical incident</a>. </p>

<p>The Pale Piper invites you to “silence the cursed melody” of a post-Pied world. Typically, when videogames try to build on folk legends it results in stories of the “What if Goldilocks mastered the blade and overthrew Porridge Inc” variety. FreeTimeDev’s approach seems relatively elegant so far. You are some kind of resurrected wraith with glowing blue eyes and an extendable jump. You are exploring a metroidvania labyrinth of crushing blocks and spike pits and things with glowing red eyes that kill you instantly.</p><p>“Looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>!” screech we pitiful headline writers, like chicks after worms, but alas, not quite, because the Pale Piper is unarmed. Your only defence against the labyrinth’s many terrors is a combination of excellent pattern reading, even excellenter timing, and the capacity to die repeatedly and respawn at the area entrance without pulling your own ears off in consternation.</p>
<p>You can gather coins in each area, if you want to make life even harder for yourself. There are some traversal abilities to unlock, as well. From the trailer, it looks like they’ve got post-Dreamcast Sonic’s homing attack in there, and a local variation on Metroid’s morph ball.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I have the fortitude to keep plugging with The Pale Piper, but the softly crumbling industrial fantasy setting definitely grabs my gizzards, and I like the needling menace of the writing. Early on in the game you free a man from a cage and are asked to track down and slay the Rat King. He remarks that silence is "the only law that still obeys him". I will bet you several of those optional collectible coins that the caged man is the Pied Piper, and that the protagonist is actually one of the abducted kids, and that the Rat King is actually one of the good guys.</p>

              <p><span>The Ultra Beasts in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-moon-ultra-alolan-raichu-kanto-evolve-2000660687"><i><span>Pokémon Ultra Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ultra Moon</span></i></a><span> kind of look like they came from a different franchise. In the fiction of the games, these monsters are from another dimension than the one we inhabit, which is why they look less like Pokémon and more like distorted creatures you’d see in the margins of an edgy middle schooler’s notes. In actuality, however, it turns out these creatures’ otherworldly looks were inspired by rejected Pokémon designs.</span></p> <p><span>Yusuke Omura, an illustrator and character designer who worked at Game Freak up until 2016, </span><a href="https://x.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2018851331562500430%7Ctwgr%5Eff03ca65227bcca9dc9ca4fb124e4ddac79541bc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fpokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy%2F"><span>revealed on X</span></a><span> that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ultra-sun-and-moons-pokemon-encounters-is-some-c-1820774121"><span>Ultra Beasts</span></a><span> were based on designs of monsters that studio co-founder and artist Ken Sugimori turned down during Omura’s time at the company.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Translation via </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy/"><i><span>Automaton</span></i></a><span>:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I designed the Ultra Beasts by recalling some of the designs I made which were rejected by Mr. Sugimori, and I decided to deliberately use the very reasons for why they were rejected and base the artistic direction of the designs on them. So in some way, they’re like a manifestation of my own resentment– pretty scary.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, this doesn’t mean that I hate Mr. Sugimori or anything like that.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Omura also responded to a fan theory that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/competitive-pokemon-player-risks-it-all-with-fragile-ul-1795927379"><span>Ultra Beasts</span></a><span> were meant to look distinctly un-Pokémon-like, as if they broke the “rules” of what usually constitutes a Pocket Monster, and Omura </span><a href="https://x.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018838936848896168"><span>said that was the intention</span></a><span> and he’s glad it came through in their designs.</span></p> <p><span>This is also supported by how Ultra Beasts have a significantly low catch rate in the games, as Poké Balls don’t recognize these uggos as Pokémon, thus leading to the creation of Beast Balls, which can capture these creatures, but are far less effective on standard Pokémon. The Ultra Beasts haven’t been featured in a mainline </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game since </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>’s DLC, but have appeared in multiple spin-offs like the MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite </span></i><span>and the gacha game </span><i><span>Pokémon Masters EX</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is a risk-taker. Shaking up what fans have come to expect from the series, it tosses out the old formulas of straightforward missions and replaces them with an open-world twist that works shockingly well. In the midst of wandering the hidden corners of Japan, players will find fantastic secrets and evocative battles, but what’s gained from this ambitious scope is just as often hampered by a surprising lack of challenge and a deadweight story that completely overstays its welcome.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>When </span><i><span>Nioh </span></i><span>released in 2017, only two years had passed since the arrival of </span><i><span>Bloodborne</span></i><span> and the market wasn’t quite as flooded with action-RPGs of that form. While many such games have come since then ranging from the impressive </span><i><span>Lies of P</span></i><span> to the more middle-of-the-road </span><i><span>The First Berserker: Khazan</span></i><span>, when </span><i><span>Nioh </span></i><span>released, there weren’t as many options for ultra fast-paced “Soulsborne” experiences. Team Ninja was ahead of the curve, kicking off a series packed with intense boss fights, responsive gameplay that contrasted with FromSoft’s weightiness, and a quintessentially Japanese sensibility mixing historical fiction with broad epic storytelling. And it kicked ass.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> continues this tradition and thrusts players into the role of Tokugawa Takechiyo, grandchild of the famous shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu. Awakening one morning to find the capital city under attack by an army of demonic yokai, Takechiyo is eventually whisked back in time to the war-torn Sengoku period. This kicks off adventures that take you through all kinds of fantastical places as Takechiyo works to prevent future tragedies, all caused by a mysterious Great Evil Demon Guy.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665672">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>To match this epic scale, </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> makes one very big change to gameplay and structure that breathes a fresh bit of life into the yokai-smashing antics: it shifts (mostly) to an open-world design. Split between multiple maps, </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s world is expansive and packed with areas that you can tackle in mostly any order. While there is a main story route if you want to keep things focused, the greater rewards come from wandering off the beaten path. You might find a hidden dungeon packed with loot or even run into a boss out in the wild. There’s many surprises.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s hard not to draw comparisons to 2022’s </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> but the more obvious and meaningful antecedent is Team Ninja’s own </span><i><span>Rise of the Ronin</span></i><span>. Adapting lessons learned from that open world, </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> expands the possibility space of the series and at the best moments, which are usually found on the less rigidly structured early maps, playing </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is surprisingly relaxing. You are never far away from something interesting and time will melt away as you explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>From time to time, this structure builds unique stories. In one early game map, I needed to dispel some barriers in order to reach the Great Evil Demon Guy; each of the barriers was guarded by a boss. Instead of going the route which </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> intended, I moved in reverse order and hit the highest-level boss first, encountering a tricky soldier who fought with a cadre of summoned demon minions. It wasn’t the hardest fight but the fact I could cut my own path to face this challenge is a real testament to </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s world design. It was a lot of fun.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This openness starts to constrict as the game moves along and some of the most interesting maps are less a collection of “zones” than levels connected by corridors. The freewheeling early game gives way to a more traditional endgame and while that means losing the freedom that helps </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> stand out from peers, fans of the prior games will appreciate the chance to dive into more demanding and focused dungeons explorations with a bit more spice.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665684"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665684">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The most impressive of these are areas taking place within something called “the Crucible.” This hellish red nightmare realm envelops certain castles and hideaways, populating the area with highly aggressive monsters. Take damage in these areas and a portion of your health bar is removed entirely until you can attack a few monsters and undo this dire debuff. </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> continues the series’ mixed-results level design when it comes to dungeons—other games are simply more clever—but shifting between open-world exploration and Crucible areas is always exciting.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>This all comes with the series’ love it or hate it approach to loot. Team Ninja action games are packed with loot, even the most basic enemies popping into multi-colored pinatas of weapons, armor, and other goodies. Progression is slow but certain as you pick up a slightly better helmet here or find a rare spear there. For players who hate inventory management, it might be annoying to occasionally pause exploration in order to sell off extra gear or break it down for crafting parts. Sickos who love shiny things and the thrill of slowly optimizing their character over the course of lengthy adventure, meanwhile, will have a blast. The gear rains like manna from Heaven.</span></p>

 <p><span>How does this all play out when you’re fighting the baddies? Isn’’t that what this is all about? The short pitch is: combat kicks ass and </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> remains a best-in-class action game. The messier version is that for all the excitement, your victories aren’t always satisfying.</span></p>

 <p><span>The conventional wisdom on the internet is that games journalists are chumps who don’t know how to play games. They are weak-willed and entirely unable to complete the most basic of tutorials. I am afraid I must complicate that cliche by saying that </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is not only the easiest of the </span><i><span>Nioh </span></i><span>games by a wide margin, it is also perhaps the easiest of this particular brand of Soulsborne game that I’ve played. Some of the reasons for this are good, some are bad.</span><span><br> </span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665683">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At the top of the list is the fact that </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> has refined what was an already stellar and responsive combat system into what might just be the best-feeling action game I’ve ever played. That’s right! This game is often too easy because the gameplay is so goddamn good. The slightest touch of the analog stick allows for pinpoint movements on the battlefield, parry and dodge timings are intuitive and well-communicated, and your attacks flow gracefully no matter your choice of weapon. </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> feels amazing and consistently gives you the tools to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The special sauce that turns this action-burger into a flavor bomb unlike any of its peers in the genre is the new ability to swap between a Samurai combat stance and a Ninja stance. With the simple push of a button, you can switch from the more traditional samurai style, featuring reliable weapons like swords and spears and axes, to a flashier ninja style. The samurai style is the one that </span><i><span>Nioh </span></i><span>veterans have come to know and it’s defined by the ability to switch into different sub-stances. A “low” katana stance, for instance, consumes very little stamina but mostly cat-scratches enemies. Meanwhile, a “high” stance will be much slower and leave you open if you miss but break the enemy’s guard.</span></p> <p><span>In the Ninja style, you have access to quick weapons that don’t do much damage but can stagger enemies with their unrelenting pressure. You can also stock up on different ninja tools ranging from elemental talismans to poison or paralysis-causing shuriken, and much more. Swapping between these stances at the right instant interrupts dangerous enemy attacks, staggering them. </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is constantly encouraging you to change your weapons and stances to meet the moment-to-moment needs of a fight. As a result, you rarely if ever feel ts a loss for options mid-battle.</span></p> <p><span>This system, a variation of the job-changing action that Team Ninja experimented with in the underrated 2022 action title </span><i><span>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</span></i><span>, means that </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s gameplay is highly customizable and each player will find their own individual ways of expressing themselves in combat. And while these two modes don’t feel excessively different from each other, they’re distinct enough that you’ll certainly have a favorite fighting style.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665677">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>If that already sounds like a lot, brace yourself. I’ve not even mentioned the fact that eventually each stance can eventually carry two weapons—a samurai might have a katana and the transforming switchglaive—and you can also stock up on different magical spells and summons unlocked by consuming the left-behind souls of fallen yokai. When I say that </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is the easiest game in the series, it is first and foremost because of how simple it is to adapt to new challenges.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>You might start with a fight with your switchglaive in the “medium” stance that has it take the shape of a spear. As you poke at a boss and learn its attacks from a safe distance, you might gain the confidence to switch to Ninja style and attack it with a flurry of small blows from a pair of tonfa, timing your dodges for the last moment—perfect dodges mostly conserve stamina—until you can get behind them and attack their back for double damage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As the boss goes into a rage, you might then decide to fall back entirely and summon the soul of one of the bosses you previously defeated to attack with a special ability, maybe a hard-hitting lighting nuke attack. You are constantly making micro-decisions throughout your battles and the potency of these options will often mean that even the gnarliest demons don’t stand a chance.</span></p>

I'm excited to go back and dive into some of the areas I left less explored. </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>That said, I would be lying if I left out the fact that for a surprisingly large stretch of time the enemies you encounter don’t offer the greatest challenges in and of themselves either. In one story section, an ally warned me that a foe was “a presence more powerful than we’ve ever faced.” That wasn’t true; they died on my first attempt. Mileage will vary from player to player but this was a common occurrence in my playthrough. It took until maybe my fortieth hour before I started encountering bosses that felt threatening, and that’s a long time for things to feel “easy.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>When difficulties reared their head in my playthrough, only some of them were due to the designs of the bosses themselves. Eventually, </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> does start to pull out the standard tricks to add difficulty to encounters—two-phase boss fights, attacks that need to be perfectly dodged—but if you’re a player who doesn’t intend to do many side quests, it’s more likely that the threat will simply be honest-to-God numbers. By the end of my playthrough, I was nearly 30 levels below what the game recommended. This meant I died in one to three hits from basically everything and while that generated a lot of excitement, it came about not because of intricate boss design or sudden gameplay shifts that shook my playstyle. It was just statistics.</span></p> <p><span>For some players, </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s strangely managed difficulty curve might prove a true disappointment. If you’re someone who comes to these games for the grand boss battles, I’m sorry to say that many of them will not live up to your expectations. If you’re a more casual player, I expect you will hit a strange mid- to endgame spike that hampers your momentum.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665680" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665680"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665680">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In the moments where players do encounter one of </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s more demanding sections, it offers the extra-help features which have now become characteristic for the series. Chief among these is an ability to spend easily farmable materials to summon the ghosts of other player characters. These non-player-controlled shades bring an extra set of hands into boss fights or else help clear out obstacles as you progress through levels. They’re not the smartest companions but they can be very helpful. If somehow that’s not enough, you can spend your trinkets at a checkpoint shrine to summon an actual player into your game to help you instead. </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is best played without too much extra assistance and barring a few moments, such help isn’t necessary.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Some of this may sound really dire, especially in light of the fact that, again, I think this is The Best Feeling Action Game Series Ever. </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is both one of the most fun games I’ve played when considering the moment-to-moment gameplay, and also one of the most frustrating games I’ve ever played when it comes to structure, pace, and especially narrative.</span></p> <p><span>Whoever wrote this game’s story has quite possibly never read a story in their life and it’s entirely possible that they’ve never spoken to another living human being. The initial leap back to the time of Tokugawa and those fateful Sengoku battlefields is familiar enough and the time-traveling concept creates interesting possibilities to expand the scope of the story beyond what the series usually offers. Without spoiling what that means specifically, this adventure truly ends up going in surprising directions. The problem is that they forgot to write characters or give players a reason to care about anything that is happening throughout the narrative.</span></p> <p><span>Complaining about the story in a </span><i><span>Nioh</span></i><span> game can feel a bit like complaining about a free T-shirt you got at a rock concert. Who cares? You weren’t even here for that shit anyway. I would normally agree if not for the fact that </span><i><span>Nioh 2</span></i><span> managed, in spite of some clumsiness, to have a compelling story thanks to a well-written buddy relationship between the player character and their charismatic pal Tokichiro. Humble beginnings grew into a tragic epic that connected to the original game. Not high art but fun stuff! It was the best kind of pulp storytelling.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665670" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665670"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665670">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s story, such as it can be said to exist, is a mostly flat affair that lacks a lot of the vigor of previous games. The core cast is smaller, opting to avoid the previous games’ cavalcade of historical cameos, but they are incredibly underwritten. Some of this is a matter of structure since you can get more nuance and character beats through side questing, but it is more honest to say that </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> doesn’t really have a story. It has a collection of zones and maps bridged together with the thinnest of connections, and while the game’s large scale may please players looking for the most bang for their buck, it drags out the tale far longer than is welcome.</span></p> <p><span>By the time I had confronted the Great Evil Demon Guy for the third time only for a cutscene to play in which I was teleported away by someone saying “Actually, this next section of the game is where you will finally defeat the Great Evil Demon Guy,” I made a wrathful gurgle touched with a ferocity I did not think my heart could hold. The stage was set, the story had somewhat found itself and led us to a climax. This was it. Just kidding! Demon’s in another castle! Not only that but the bad guys are going to try the exact same plan you prevented multiple times before!  </span></p>

 <p><span>The frustrating part of </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s inability to fashion a compellingly paced narrative comes from a sense of wasted potential. That annoying shift away from what I thought would be the climax was immediately followed by some of the coolest stuff in the game. Taking a leap that I’d hoped the series would make for years (which I will again not spoil here), I suddenly felt like I was playing a </span><i><span>Nioh</span></i><span> game again! They could do it all along! The levels were replete with interesting gimmicks, the combat continued to flow, and to my amazement I was finally encountering cool characters.  </span></p> <p><span>This is the fundamental core of</span><i><span> Nioh 3</span></i><span>. It manages to take huge structural risks and the result is that what could be an amazing epic feels more like a variety of half-written story pitches stitched together by an ape with a nail gun. I have never played a more inconsistent game within this genre, both in terms of narrative focus and difficulty curve. And yet in spite of that dissonance, which dominates hours and hours of a game that doesn’t know when enough is enough, the high points are genuinely magnificent. When it’s good, you will be hooting and hollering.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665671"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665671">Team Ninja / Koei Tecmo Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Even so, in the worst moments of the game I was neither frustrated by hardcore boss fights nor annoyed at the ways in which the open world eventually contracted. Instead, </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>’s most dire moments did something I rarely encounter when reviewing games: they simply bored me.  </span></p> <p><span>All of this to say that the challenge of</span><i><span> Nioh 3</span></i><span> is rarely found within a boss fight arena. The true challenge of </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> is one of endurance. In overstaying the welcome and failing to craft compelling reasons to push forward and explore the world or see this story through to the end, it ultimately demands a great deal of trust from the player. Grant it that trust and you will, from time to time, be treated with genre-defining quality. And yet in spite of these highs, I would not fault anyone who poured dozens of hours into this game only to experience another time-direspecting rug pull for deciding to not only shut the game off but never boot it up again in their life. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>I’ve spent a lot of time stressing the negatives of </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> but it should be reiterated again and again that if you are looking for furious action that forces you to constantly make interesting decisions in the middle of a fight, this is the game for you. No one does it quite like Team Ninja. Other games might have more evocative worlds and more realized characters. They might offer more difficult bosses to tackle. And yet after nearly a decade of reviewing these games and many others within this genre, I mean it when I say nothing else plays like </span><i><span>Nioh</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span> also does something that established franchises, especially today, sometimes seem allergic to: it takes risky swings to switch up a beloved formula. In the moments where everything aligns and the shift to a more expansive, exploration-focused experience fires on all cylinders—creating surprising stories and unique victories—it’s not hard to imagine how successive games could build on these changes and continue to offer further excitement.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>In my review of </span><i><span>Nioh 2</span></i><span>, I said that the game’s genre was one in which “you are with swords what Mozart was with music,” and that’s never been more true than in </span><i><span>Nioh 3</span></i><span>. You’re not always engaging in this deadly dance and the downtime between movements can feel interminable, but once the chips are down you probably won’t care. You will dash and parry, sneak and backstab. And it will feel so good that you’ll eagerly push through all the extra bullshit&nbsp; to your next battle.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-the-kotaku-review-2000665666]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Many of Japan’s top gaming companies have seen their share prices decline recently. </p>



<p>Just a few days ago, it was revealed that shares of some of the biggest gaming companies fell right after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gaming-stocks-fall-drastically-google-project-genie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Project Genie announcement</a>. Companies like Unity, Roblox, Take-Two, CD Projekt Red, and others are experiencing significant declines, and it seems the effect has extended to Japan as well. </p>











<p>Spotted on <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/2018921195136229462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) by Japanese gaming industry analyst, Dr. Serkan Toto, Japanese gaming companies like Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami, Bandai Namco, Square Enix, and more have seen their share prices fall. Check out the exact dip for each company at the time of writing below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Nintendo is down by 10.98%</li>



<li>Sony is down by 4.56% </li>



<li>SEGA is down by 2.11%</li>



<li>Capcom is down by 9.86%</li>



<li>Bandai Namco is down by 2.92%</li>



<li>Square Enix is down by 2.96%</li>



<li>Konami is down by 8.28%</li>



<li>Koei Tecmo is down by 6.57%</li>



<li>Kadokawa (Parent) is down by 4.40%</li>
</ul>



<p>The reason for their stock drop has not been highlighted; it could be due to the rise in memory prices, or it could be the Google Project Genie announcement messing with these stock prices. However, these are just speculative reasons. </p>



<p>Nintendo held its earnings call yesterday, during which it was revealed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 has remained the company’s fastest-selling platform</a>. Moreover, Sony, Bandai Namco, and SEGA’s earnings calls are scheduled for this week. </p>







<p>In other news, Ubisoft shares crashed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by more than 30%</a> after the restructuring was announced.

            <p>Nintendo has announced a Direct showcase for later this week.</p>
<p>This Direct will be focused on third-party releases, the company has said. As for the when and where, you will be able to watch the partner showcase on YouTube tomorrow, 5th February, at 2pm UK time.</p>

<p>"The livestreamed presentation will feature roughly 30 minutes of upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Nintendo Switch games from publishing and development partners," Nintendo said of tomorrow's Direct.</p>
<p>So, what can we hope to see? Well, I am sure many of you are champing at the bit to find out a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">release date for Elden Ring on Switch 2</a>. When it does arrive on Nintendo's console,  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition (as it is known) will include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between</a>.</p><p>Then, sticking with the FromSoft, we are also still quite light on news about The Duskbloods. Announced last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods is a "PvPvE title with online multiplayer"</a>, which features up to eight participants vying for "supremacy among themselves and against challenging foes". It is quite an eclectic offering by the looks of things, complete with jetpacks, creepy moons and, erm, dinosaurs!?</p>

<p>We may also get to see something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>-flavoured tomorrow. This chap <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-coming-to-switch-2-next-year">was announced for Switch 2 last year</a>, so a release date isn't out of the question.</p>
<p>What do you hope turns up during tomorrow's Nintendo Partner Direct?</p>

<p>Investors be fickle</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="27c7018aad0d4"><a title="Mario Toy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/27c7018aad0d4/mario-toy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo released its latest <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203e.pdf">financial report</a> this week for Q3 of fiscal year 2026, confirming that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/switch-2-storms-towards-its-forecast-target-with-17-37-million-units-sold">Switch 2 has sold 17.38 million units</a>.</p>
<p>Despite all of the numbers going up, investors have nevertheless flinched at immediate market conditions and ongoing concerns around component prices. As such, Nintendo's share price has dropped pretty significantly, currently sitting at 8,973 JPY compared to a high of 10,180 JPY on Tuesday afternoon, representing a fall of just over 11%.</p>
<p>It shows just how fickle investors can be, and Nintendo's newly released <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf">Q&amp;A</a> (currently only available in Japanese) contains several questions relating to component prices and profits. In addition, one could argue that the Switch 2 is currently lacking a major upcoming first-party release, and Nintendo's signature secrecy around its plans means that investors really have no clue as to how the coming months might play out.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b4c416c390e03"><a title="Nintendo Share Price" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b4c416c390e03/nintendo-share-price.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/7974:TYO?sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj99ffD9b-SAxW3nf0HHZHyA8MQ3ecFKAN6BAgoEAQ">Google Finance</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've seen this all before, and we'll see it again. Nintendo's share price reached record highs in 2025 as excitement for the Switch 2 reached fever pitch, but it's since dropped to more familiar levels in the following months. No doubt we'll see another spike as Nintendo announces more games throughout 2026, and it'll probably fall again soon after. On it goes.</p>
<p>Nintendo's president, Shuntaro Furukawa, has stressed that increasing memory prices <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/nintendo-will-carefully-consider-a-switch-2-price-increase-says-furukawa">will have no immediate impact</a> on the company's financial performance, though acknowledged that it may put pressure on profits from FY2027 onwards.</p>
<p>Right now, we think it's probably wise to just keep cool and wait for Nintendo to reveal its plans for the rest of the year – whenever that may be.</p>

<p>The NES version of <em>Yoshi </em>launched as part of the inaugural Switch Online haul <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-revealed-includes-20-nes-games-at-launch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fc0ced9-ef21-4d57-8fc2-f219e6f3c917" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in September 2018</a>, but it's nice to be able to play this alternate edition, even if it is a little more basic than even its NES counterpart.</p><p>Your other Game Boy game joining Switch Online today is <em>Balloon Kid</em>, which was originally released back in October 1990.

You can check out a trailer for both titles here.</p>
<p>Both <em>Yoshi </em>and <em>Balloon Kid </em>are available to check out right now on Nintendo Switch Online, along with a host of other retro titles. It'll <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cost you $3.99 a month</a>, although three-monthly and yearly plans are also available if you'd prefer.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-soundbar-drops-back-to-black-friday-price-just-in-time-for-super-bowl-tv-audio-upgrades-2000665557</link>
            <guid>1425115</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose TV Speaker is a compact soundbar that addresses thin, weak TV audio with a single unit. It’s easy to use. You simply set it on the stand in front of your TV or mount it on the wall, connect it with a single cable, and you’ll hear a wider and more natural soundstage than you would with most built-in TV speakers. The two full-range drivers are angled outward to create a wide sound field in the room. Additionally, there is a dialog-enhancing feature that helps you hear dialogue above the din of special effects and ambient noise in films, television, and video games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">You can get the Bose TV Speaker on Amazon today for $199, 29% off its standard price of $279, for a savings of $80.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A soundbar to enhance your TV’s built-in audio</h2>
<p>The sound from this bar comes from two full-range drivers, angled outward to disperse sound throughout the room rather than being directed from a very small TV frame. The Dialog Mode feature enhances the voice range so you can clearly understand what the actors are saying during noisy parts of the film, show, or game. There is also a bass enhancement button on the remote that lets you boost low-end bass when needed, such as during action scenes, music, and big sound effects.</p>



<p>The connections give you a great deal of flexibility in how you connect the bar to your TV and other components, and in what you choose to send through the bar. HDMI ARC, Optical In, and Aux In are the three major methods for extracting sound from your TV, and you can connect up to four devices to the bar at the same time. When you turn a device on, the bar will automatically switch to the correct input, so you don’t have to constantly cycle through each input source.</p>
<p>An optical cable is included to connect most TVs to the bar for a single audio connection. After connecting the power and audio cables to the bar, it is operational after checking a couple of settings on the TV side. If you wish to expand this bar’s capabilities in the future, it can support a Bose Bass Module 500 or 700 via a direct output on the back of the bar. With the appropriate cable, you can expand the low-end response and produce a more cinematic experience. On its own, the bar provides a solid base for TV viewing, sporting events, and casual music listening, while maintaining a minimal footprint and an intuitive operation scheme.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/"> The Bose TV Speaker is available today on Amazon for $199, 29% off its normal price of $279,</a> and provides dialog clarity, wider stereo sound, multiple input options, Bluetooth streaming, and the option to add a subwoofer in the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mini Review: The Perfect Pencil (Switch) - A Sharp, Horror-Tinged Metroidvania With Splashes Of Hollow Knight]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-perfect-pencil</link>
            <guid>1425091</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Metroidvania revival (did it ever really go away?) keeps rolling, and here comes another stylised combat-platformer where a strange little hero gets lost in a dark, labyrinthine fantasy world.</p>
<p>This time, our protagonist is John, who stumbles into a bizarre realm full of somnambulist weirdos and giant babies. Studio Cima has crafted a disturbing, stylised trip that deftly builds on themes of psychological trauma and fear. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/perfect_pencil">The Perfect Pencil</a> can be pretty impenetrable at times, but it stays compelling throughout.</p>
<p>John’s actual goal is never fully clear, which only adds to the fever-dream vibe of the world he wanders through. Initially headless, he acquires an old projector for a <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/bonce">bonce</a> and ventures out armed with nothing but a giant pencil.</p>
<p>Bedtime iconography is everywhere: NPCs speak in riddles, and you’re never totally sure who’s trying to help you and who’s planning to stab you in the back. Both enemies and allies are equally creepy. John meets dead‑eyed sleepwalkers wrapped in random junk, or oddball creatures offering to teach him martial arts.</p>
<p>The Camera Obscura atop John’s neck lets him scan the environment, which helps with navigating the (sometimes pretty convoluted) map and uncovering secrets tied to the main quest.</p>
<p>While a lot of recent Metroidvanias lean heavily on tough combat and tricky platforming chains, The Perfect Pencil is more focussed on exploration. You’ll poke around its surreal dreamscape, run side‑tasks for NPCs, and upgrade John’s projector with ability‑boosting filaments.</p>
<p>There’s still a solid amount of combat as you battle with those sleepy enemies scattered across the games diverse biomes. They’re not especially tough, but their placement can lead to some annoying deaths and long runbacks. Boss fights are fun setpieces with bigger enemies that are literal manifestations of the game’s themes. Like their smaller counterparts, they also love flattening John and sending him back to distant save points.</p>
<p>John fights these Tim Burton‑esque foes with a simple melee offence. His most useful skill is a heal strike that converts the energy from consecutive attacks into a health‑restoring hit. It’s a neat ability that stays handy throughout the game. His attacks can be upgraded by spending a resources scattered throughout the levels and by defeating enemies.</p>
<p>Combat and traversal across this uniquely designed world feels smooth in both handheld and docked modes, with zero performance issues. This has none of the razors-edge twitchiness of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> or the recently released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mio-memories-in-orbit">Mio</a>, but it's nice to see the painstaking art style in clear detail during John's tribulations. The Switch continues to be a comfortable home for artistically-driven Metroidvanias.</p>
<p>Despite being another in an ever increasing genre stable, The Perfect Pencil brings a uniquely twisted world to the genre. Its mysteries can be a bit dense, but the eerie atmosphere, complex themes, and strange landscapes make it worth exploring.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-perfect-pencil]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Clearing Out Samsung’s Nintendo Switch 2–Friendly MicroSD Card at Its Lowest Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-clearing-out-samsungs-nintendo-switch-2-friendly-microsd-card-at-its-lowest-price-2000665521</link>
            <guid>1425085</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s pretty unlikely that the “wee but mighty” metaphor that goes all the way back to Shakespeare was created with the very wee, very mighty Samsung P9 Express microSD card in mind. In fact, if you were caught with such a device back in the Bard’s day, you probably would have been burned for witchcraft. But considering that the P9 Express is 0.59 x 0.43 inches in size and less than 1 one-hundredth of an ounce in weight, yet able to boost the storage on literally dozens of different devices by over half a terabyte, its wee-but-mighty status is undeniable.</p>
<p>Also wee? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">The P9 Express microSD card’s price, which is just $80 right now at Amazon</a>. But if you’re looking to score big, reliable, fast-moving storage to your Nintendo Switch 2, drone, camera, laptop, tablet, or most anything else, you should get to Amazon mighty fast, because the shelves are emptying and emptying fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Switch 2 Superstar</h2>
<p>Samsung is leaning hard into selling the P9 Express microSD card to Nintendo Switch 2 owners, which is smart thinking when you consider just how big a smash hit that handheld gaming console has been. The selling point for Switch 2 games isn’t just the great sale price or the 512GB of storage the P9 Express adds to the console. It’s the speed, which as any gamer will you, is absolutely essential.</p>
<p>The P9 Express moves data at speeds of up to 800 MB/s, which is four times faster than even Samsung’s standard microSD cards. When you’re booting up a game from a parallel storage unit rather than the Switch 2’s built-in storage, a standard microSD card might lag, but the P9 Express will have your game up and running in a snap, and more importantly, it will run smoothly and lag-free.</p>
<p>As a game and downloadable content repository, the P9 Express will get a serious workout inside a Switch 2. But Samsung’s Dynamic Thermal Guard technology keeps things cool within the tiny P9 Express to ward off overheating-related slowdowns or bricking.</p>



<h2>Universal Storage</h2>
<p>Even if the Samsung P9 Express only worked with the Switch 2, there would be a pretty solid case to hit this Amazon deal and snag one for just $80. But the list of tech items the P9 Express brings seamless, fast, reliable storage to is long indeed. Basically, any device with a microSD slot, since the P9 Express is also reverse-compatible with UHS-I devices. That covers a lot of ground — everything from smartphones and tablets to digital cameras and drones. It also comes with a 3-year warranty, and chances are you’ll never need to file a claim since the P9 Express is built to withstand x-rays, magnets, drops, water, high and low temperatures, and the wear and tear that comes with being inserted into and removed from devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5799/">With Amazon’s 33% off deal in place, the $80 price for the 512GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card</a> is a small one indeed for a tiny chip that&nbsp;<em>triples</em> the storage of a Nintendo Switch 2, and also works across such a vast array of tech devices. But Amazon’s hung out that big red “Deal Selling Fast” tag on this one, so move fast before you miss out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NetEase Has Told Their Studios Not To Use AI “At All”]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netease-has-told-their-studios-not-to-use-ai-at-all/</link>
            <guid>1425082</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture has stated that NetEase doesn’t allow any of their studios to use AI. </p>



<div><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>In a statement sent to Insider Gaming, NetEase has denied telling its studios to no longer use AI. </p><p><strong>“The situation described did not occur, and we have not published any related policies,” </strong>a NetEase spokesperson said. </p></div>



<p>Due to the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI), the gaming industry has become increasingly concerned about its application in games. Opinions on this matter vary: some support AI for its ability to expedite mundane tasks, while others argue that it should not be utilized in any artistic capacity. Additionally, some have outright rejected the use of AI altogether. Recently, Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-genai-has-zero-part-in-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discussed</a> generative AI in relation to GTA 6, and now we also know NetEase’s stance on the issue. </p>







<h2 id="h-netease-shuts-down-ai-usage-across-all-internal-game-studios">NetEase Shuts Down AI Usage Across All Internal Game Studios</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/romeo-is-a-dead-man-suda-51-generative-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the co-founder of Grasshopper Manufacture (NetEase acquired it in 2021) and the director of Romeo is a Dead Man, Goichi “Suda 51” Suda, elaborated on his perspective on AI use in games. Talking about his game first, Suda 51 stated that Romeo would be “fake”, “hard to relate to”, and “kind of creepy” if he were made with AI. The director also stated that the work and passion developerss put into creating can be felt by players, whereas AI won’t invoke the same feeling.</p>



<p>Suda 51 then spoke about NetEase banning AI use, stating that they “originally had a section researching and developing AI-related stuff.” However, they decided not to work on that section anymore, shutting it down and telling “their studios to not use AI in games, to not use it at all.”</p>



<p>When asked why, Suda 51 said he doesn’t know the exact reason but speculates there could be two. First, a vast majority of players “don’t like AI and having it in their games,” and second, “issues with copyright infringement” also come into play. Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase Games for clarification and will update this story once a response is received.</p>







<p>In other news, the Indie Game Awards <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disqualified Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> for using generative AI. Divinity devs have stated that they will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refrain from using GenAI tools</a>” for concept art.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has discussed the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> hardware sales were lower than expected outside Japan towards the end of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to shareholders this week, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged that "overseas sales were slightly weaker than our expectations," something that had <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/did-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-have-a-bad-holiday-we-asked-analysts">previously been reported and discussed with IGN by analysts</a>, though not stated out loud by the company itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, in an investor meeting following the release of this week's latest financial earnings, Nintendo shareholders repeatedly questioned the company on its western sales shortfall, even as the Switch 2 overperforms within its homeland of Japan. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While our forecasted global hardware and software sales volume remains unchanged, the breakdown by region and product is based on different assumptions from the revised forecast announced at the time of our second-quarter financial results announcement," Furukawa <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260204.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, via machine translation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, as you understand, domestic hardware sales volume exceeded our expectations, while overseas sales were slightly weaker than our expectations," he continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sales figures collated by The Game Business last month showed that U.S. Switch 2 sales over the holiday period were down around 35% versus the Switch 1's first holiday sales performance back in 2017. In the UK, a similar comparison saw Switch 2 lagging Switch 1 by 16%. Even in Nintendo's homeland of Japan, Switch 2 holiday sales couldn't match Switch 1, and were down by 5.5% over the year's final nine weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In France, 2025's final tally of Switch 2 sales was down by "over 30%" versus the amount Switch 1 notched up back in 2017, meanwhile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While these numbers may take some of the shine off of a successful first year for Switch 2 overall, it's not all doom and gloom. Switch 2's lifetime sales in Japan are still above what Switch 1 managed in its first year, with less time on sale. And in the UK, Switch 1 continued to sell well enough that it made up Switch 2's holiday sales deficit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kirby Air Riders: Official Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Asked for more detail on why hardware sales in Japan were doing better than expected, Furukawa has now highlighted the release of two games in particular that had resonated with the country's audience: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> and the Switch 2 exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We believe that the reason for the stronger-than-expected hardware sales in Japan is that, amid the continued momentum of the initial launch of the Switch 2 hardware, new titles such as Pokémon Legends: Z-A Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and Kirby Air Riders, released during the holiday shopping season, [leading] to a relatively high trend of existing Switch owners switching to the Switch 2 compared to overseas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Pokémon franchise is hugely popular globally, it enjoys a particular level of devotion within Japan. Kirby games also sell especially well in the country, with mixed success historically overseas. Essentially, then, Furukawa is suggesting that the Switch 2's level of success in Japan has been fuelled by two titles that have resonated particularly well with Japanese audiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a statement that gels well with what a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-source-blames-switch-2-holiday-sales-slowdown-on-the-economic-landscape-and-the-absence-of-a-major-western-game-despite-the-release-of-metroid-prime-4-beyond">recent, unnamed western Nintendo source reportedly said of the company's softer Switch 2 sales overseas</a>, which were blamed on the lack of a key first-party game for the holidays. The remark raised eyebrows at the time due to the fact it appeared to overlook <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (as Metroid Prime has traditionally been seen as a sub-franchise with a stronger western following than in Japan). However, as we learned this week, Metroid Prime 4 has indeed gotten off to a slow start sales-wise, something Nintendo appeared to have anticipated to some degree.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There was next to no mention of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4 in Nintendo's financial results this week, and no sign of its Switch or Switch 2 versions </a>on the company's lists of million copy-selling games. Switch 2 exclusive Kirby Air Riders was recorded as having sold 1.76 million units since its arrival on November 20, but there was no mention of how well Metroid Prime 4 had fared following its arrival on December 4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the launch of Metroid Prime 4, Nintendo admitted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backtracking-development-again-was-out-of-the-question-nintendo-says-metroid-prime-4s-open-world-hub-was-a-victim-of-the-games-lengthy-development">it knew the game's open-world concept risked feeling outdated</a>. Last month, Metroid Prime producer and Nintendo veteran <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-producer-reportedly-leaving-nintendo-after-40-years-unsure-if-there-will-be-another-game-to-wrap-up-syluxs-story">Kensuke Tanabe abruptly announced that the game would be his last project for the company</a> after four decades of service. When contacted for more detail by IGN, Nintendo did not comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-raises-hardware-forecast-as-switch-2-sales-hit-1036-million-continuing-streak-as-the-biggest-console-launch-of-all-time">Switch 2 remains Nintendo's fastest-selling console at launch ever</a>, with an explosive arrival propelled by the recent success of the original Switch (something it, in turn, didn't have as it followed Wii U). But all eyes will be on Nintendo now to shore up its line-up of Switch 2 games for the rest of 2026 — when fans hope they'll finally get a new 3D Mario platformer in time for Christmas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upcoming first-party Switch 2 games include Mario Tennis Fever (February 12), Pokémon Pokopia (March 5), Super Mario Bros. Wonder Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Meetup in Bellabel Park (March 26), Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream (April 16), and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, which has a vague "spring" launch window. Simply listed for 2026 are Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave, Rhythm Heaven Groove and Pokémon Champions, while Splatoon Raiders has a "TBA" launch date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two has said that development on the game's Switch 2 version is officially now on "pause" following its last-minute delay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Switch 2 port for the Gearbox looter shooter was initially announced during Nintendo's big April 2025 Direct and then pegged to arrive on October 3, 2025, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/while-battling-performance-problems-on-pc-xbox-and-playstation-gearbox-delays-borderlands-4-on-nintendo-switch-2-just-a-week-before-launch-and-cancels-all-digital-pre-orders">before its release was scrubbed just a week prior to launch</a>. Pre-orders were cancelled, though Gearbox framed the move as a delay, not a full scrapping of the project. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the developer said it hoped to "align" its Switch 2 release with the addition of cross saves to the game — something which now seems to no longer be on the cards.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-release-paused-take-two-ceo-gta-online-1236651227/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> this week, a Take-Two spokesperson has said that work on Borderlands 4's Switch 2 edition was no longer ongoing, as Gearbox prioritized continued "improvements" to the game on its existing platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a curious situation, not least because the game's Switch 2 version got so close to release, and had been played publicly in demo form at various events last year, such as at Gamescom 2025 in Cologne. Opinion on the game's Switch 2 demo was mixed, though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting">Borderlands 4 has also suffered from technical issues even on the more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X</a>. The game's Steam review rating has also suffered from negative comments regarding its PC performance, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We made the difficult decision to pause development on that SKU," Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Variety this week. "Our focus continues to be delivering quality post-launch content for players on the ongoing improvements to optimize the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're continuing to collaborate closely with our friends at Nintendo. We have PGA Tour 2K25 coming out and WWE 2K26 [for Switch 2], and we're incredibly excited about bringing more of our titles to that platform in the future."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last sentence is intriguing, too — the suggestion that Take-Two may now be focusing its Switch 2 plans elsewhere. Could Nintendo's console become home to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date">looks increasingly likely to make its late 2026 launch date</a>? Time will tell. Last night, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-denies-rumors-that-gta-6-will-be-digital-only-at-launch">we also learned that GTA 6 will not skip a physical edition at launch</a>, despite rumors to the contrary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a> turn 10 this year. Feel old yet? It doesn't matter, as we're only just now learning new fun tidbits about their development and what the hell was up with the very divisive Ultra Beast designs.</p>
<p>Renowned illustrator Yusuke Omura, former character designer at main Pokémon developer Game Freak and lead designer on Sun and Moon, took to X/Twitter to comment on several fan theories that popped up over the years about the mysterious extradimensional beings which shook things up when they were revealed:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">ウルトラビーストは、僕がそれまで杉森さんにNGを出されてきたデザインを思い出して、その理由を逆に利用しながらディレクションをした<br>なので僕の怨念の集合体みたいな側面もありましてこわいですね<br>杉森さんを憎んでいるということでは全然ないです</p>— 大村祐介 (@yusuke_omura) <a href="https://twitter.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy/">Automaton</a>, we got a translation of his post, where he explained the Ultra Beasts were essentially based on designs for Pokémon that "were rejected by Mr. Sugimori." He talks about Ken Sugimori, who's been the primary character designer and art director on the iconic franchise for a long time. "I decided to deliberately use the very reasons for why they were rejected and base the artistic direction of the designs on them. So in some way, they’re like a manifestation of my own resentment– pretty scary," Omura added.</p>
<p>So there you have it: We were right to be put off by most of those designs. The news straight from the designer should also quell <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/qnmhbo/ultra_beasts_arent_just_from_a_different/">fan theories on the matter</a> which have been around since the games came out in 2016. It turns out most of them were right on the money.</p><p>Personally, I'm not much of a fan of the designs even if they were meant to represent totally different beings from another dimension, but at the same time, I appreciate Pokémon getting weird from time to time. Most of the valid recent criticisms of the franchise are about its fear of breaking new ground, and if you ask around now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1h0ub6a/why_did_people_hate_sun_and_moon_and_usum_when/">players are far more positive on Sun and Moon</a> than they were a decade ago. Maybe the fact they were actually polished products also has something to do with it, ey?</p>
