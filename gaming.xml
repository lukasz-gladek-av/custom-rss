		<p>1047 Games has made some major announcements today regarding Splitgate 2, the original Splitgate, and changes at the studio. First, and most importantly, staff are being let go from 1047 games as the studio reassesses its resources to work on Splitgate 2. Splitgate 2 will be going back into beta though will remain available to play, and the original Splitgate servers will be going offline next month due to the costs associated with keeping it running.</p>
<p><iframe title="Splitgate: Battle Royale Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In its statement, 1047 Games stated it was shutting the servers of the original game to minimise job losses at the studio. As the rebuild for Splitgate 2 gets underway, 1047 Games has said that it will be carrying out more playtests and player surveys, so feedback shapes the way the game evolves to meet player expectations. You can read the full statement from 1047 Games below.</p>
<p><em>“We believe in Splitgate 2. This game means everything to us – it’s been our life for almost 10 years, starting in our dorm room, and we’re more committed than ever to delivering the incredible experience you deserve.&nbsp;<wbr></em><em>We’ve heard your feedback and we agree with you:&nbsp;we launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew. We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn’t give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>So we’re going back to beta.&nbsp;We’ll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special. That means reworking progression from the ground up, adding more portals to our maps, simplifying monetization, refocusing on classic game modes you’ve been asking for, and more, which we’ll share soon.<wbr></em></p>

<p><em>Now more than ever, we need your help.&nbsp;We’re returning not just to our roots in what we build, but in how we build it – with you. That means more playtests, more surveys, more listening, and truly being community first. Our goal is to combine the DNA of the first game with the best improvements from the second.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>Rebuilding the core experience isn’t a quick fix; it’s a long-term commitment. To give ourselves the time to build the Splitgate you deserve, we’ve made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles and shift our resources to focus on this rework. This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today. They’re receiving severance and job placement support, and we’re committed to doing everything we can to help them through this transition. We hope to bring them back when we can.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>In an effort to retain as many team members as possible, we’re also going to be shutting down OG Splitgate servers in a month. While we’d love to keep servers online indefinitely, it’s cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team. Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches. And when we return, we plan to have a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original.<wbr></em></p>
<p><em>In the meantime, Splitgate 2 will remain playable,</em> and we’ll still be shipping Chapter 3, as well as fixes and high-priority changes. We hope you will continue to play and support the game. As always, please keep the feedback coming. <wbr><em>We’ve faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we’ve learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn’t have it any other way. We’ve got work to do, but we aren’t giving up. <wbr>We love this game and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won’t.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/borderlands-4-everything-we-know-return-og-looter-shooter/">Borderlands 4</a> is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/">September 12, 2025</a>, but that's not the date that it'll be arriving on Nintendo Switch 2. Gearbox needs a little bit more time with that version of the game, and today, Gearbox president, Randy Pitchford, announced the separate release date in a video posted to X.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though he hams it up as if the Nintendo Switch 2 version won't make it in 2025, the actual launch date for Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 is October 3, 2025, making its release arrive a week and change less than a month from its arrival on other platforms.</p>



<p>"<em>Look, I know we promised that the game would come inside of 2025,"</em> Pitchford began<em>. "We promised that it would come before the end of the year, and...game development is very hard.</em> <em>But I do have an update for you, we do have a date now. We have a date for the Nintendo Switch 2 version, of Borderlands 4</em>. <em>You guys, that date...that date is...October 3! It's October 3 you guys! It's not next year, it's not even the holiday, it's so much before Christmas, it's so much before Thanksgiving, it's October 3 you guys, wooo! *horn noise.* I'm psyched, I'm psyched. Get it!</em>"</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the platforms, it'll be interesting to see how Borderlands 4 performs on the Switch 2, and though it's perhaps a bit upsetting for Switch 2 owners that they'll have to wait nearly a month after everyone else can get their hands on Borderlands 4 to play it themselves, they'll at least be able to see the beginnings of whether Gearbox is able to deliver on its promise that the endgame in Borderlands 4 is the<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-series-best-endgame-yet-gearbox/"> "<em>best endgame</em>"</a> in the series so far.</p>



<p>Especially if the Switch 2 version is somehow more expensive than the other versions of the game. That's not likely to happen, but with all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/">issues that Borderlands 4 has had around pricing</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">Pitchford having to apologize</a> for telling fans that even if it had ended up being $80, they should have found a way to pay it, the last thing this game needs is another pricing controversy.</p>

The clip is also themed heavily around the location of Avalon, leading players to once again speculate that it could be the location of Warzone's next map.</p><p dir="ltr">As seen in the video below, the Season 4's outro shows Woods and Adler preparing to leave Avalon. Pantheon has collapsed, and the team is fully pardoned and ready to go home. Woods is on a call with Sev, who says she's not leaving with them. She's going to stay in Avalon and guide local factions now that Pantheon is gone.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1947688085824934141" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">"I thought you were done working from the shadows..."<br>With the codenames finally cracked, Pantheon has collapsed. Woods and his team are coming home to finish the job... with one exception. The future of Avalon is unwritten. <a href="https://t.co/3jrEhKDBbh" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/3jrEhKDBbh</a></p>  — Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1947688085824934141?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's seasonal outro cutscenes usually tease a continuation of post-launch story for the next season, so some players are suggesting this could be a teaser to confirm the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">long-rumored Avalon map</a> for Season 5 of Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Avalon is a fictional city featured in the Black Ops 6 campaign, and it's also been teased in post-launch content. It's possible the developer has a surprise up its sleeve for Warzone, but most likely the Season 4 story outro is teasing a continuation of Black Op 6's post-launch narrative that is meant to tie into Black Ops 7 and build hype for the new game. This could just be a tease that we'll see some of Sev's impact on Avalon in the Black Ops 7 campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has confirmed that part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">Black Ops 7's campaign takes place in Avalon</a>, which was discussed on a recent Call of Duty podcast episode and shut down speculation that the Black Ops 7 reveal trailer was teasing Avalon as the next Warzone map. The clip in question showed a scene with a squad flying down onto Avalon with wingsuits, mimicking a drop into a match of battle royale. According to the podcast host, the scene is part of Black Ops 7's co-op campaign set on Avalon, which will support up to four players.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, they also didn't outright confirm the Avalon content wasn't also developed for Warzone, and it's worth noting that Call of Duty battle royale maps often include campaign and multiplayer locations. This means Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 could potentially still feature the rumored Warzone map at some point, but it's unlikely to launch at the end of Black Ops 6's cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone's Verdansk was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-devs-shows-off-faithful-recreation-of-verdansk/1100-6530323/" data-ref-id="1100-6530323">rebuilt from the ground up</a> as a collaboration between several Call of Duty studios, so a lot of time and resources went into bringing this map back, making it unlikely to have such a brief return. Data miners have also found new information in the game files to suggest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/">Verdansk's Stadium POI will be updated</a> in Season 5 to open up as a playable area, much like the map's original update in 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll learn more about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/">Black Ops 7 with the full game reveal</a> scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live next month. It's possible the Black Ops 7 reveal will also include details about the future of Warzone.</p>

Following Martinet's departure, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-new-voice-actor-may-have-been-revealed-thanks-to-a-hacked-demo/1100-6518372/" data-ref-id="1100-6518372">Kevin Afghani announced he'd taken over the role</a> shortly before the release of Super Mario Bros.

			<p>NetEase's Marvel Rivals accomplished the seemingly impossible by 'converting' none other than the son of Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios and head creative of the incredibly lucrative Marvel Cinematic Universe, to the Big M. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/kevin-feige-marvel-rival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to The Wrap</a>, Feige said that his son only 'feigned interest in a supportive way' in the movies and TV series and comics until he got his hands on the free-to-play hero shooter game. Afterward, he became interested in learning more about all those characters.</p>



<p><em>Suddenly, he was asking me to tell him more about Hela. Tell him more about The Punisher and these other characters. And then he started seeking them out in the shows.</em></p>



<p>Feige used this as an example of Marvel's struggles when winning over the newer generation. The president of Marvel Studios also underlined the success of the Disney Junior preschool TV series Spidey and His Amazing Friends, which also succeeded in bringing new fans to the superhero universe.</p>



<p>Kevin Feige's son is certainly not the only one whose attention was caught by Marvel Rivals. In February 2025, just two months after its debut, the game had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached</a> over 40 million players globally across the various platforms. The game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-3-gets-release-date-and-first-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kicked off its third season</a>, featuring Phoenix and Blade as new playable characters.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>With the imminent theatrical debut of The Fantastic Four: First Steps, Marvel Rivals is well-positioned to gain even greater interest. The Fantastic Four were already introduced in the game back in the first season, but NetEase is now adding new movie-inspired costumes, and even a brand new team-up ability featuring Human Torch (Johnny Storm) and The Thing (Ben Grimm), as shown below.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[OneXSugar: Playing with the first dual-screen transforming handheld]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onexsugar-playing-with-the-first-dual-screen-transforming-handheld.1250187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>I can’t believe they’re actually making these</em>, was my very first thought, as I powered on a working prototype of the OneXSugar Sugar 1.</p><p>This week, One-Netbook <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/onexsugar-1st-dual-screen-transformable-handheld">is crowdfunding a gaming handheld on Indiegogo</a> like none I’ve ever touched before. It’s got two OLED touchscreens, two power buttons, two sets of volume controls, and two <em>hinged rotating</em> gamepads that let it transform into entirely different modes.</p><p>Folded down, it’s like a Nintendo Switch, with a single 6-inch screen flanked by half-gamepads. Pop open the 3.92-inch secondary screen and rotate the gamepads, and it’s like a Nintendo DS with one screen on top of the other! Whichever mode you pick, the main controls instantly and automatically remap themselves to their new orientation.</p><p>And that’s just the start. Check out my video below for an extended look:</p><p>This is a handheld that can emulate Wii, GameCube, and play the most demanding Android games like <em>Genshin Impact</em> on high settings — and, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRKYoReFI0">according to <em>RetroGameCorps</em></a>, its flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 and 16GB of RAM can even play original Nintendo Switch games smoothly with <a href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers/releases/tag/v25.2.0-rc.14">the right drivers</a>.</p><p>But there’s only so much I can show you in a two-minute video, so I expect you’re wondering: just how competent is this handheld? How does it actually feel? Do you think it’ll be a worthy product by its planned September ship date? Will it be worth the $599 early bird price, let alone its now-revealed $799 MSRP?</p><p>I can’t say for sure — it’s a prototype, after all — but so far, the fun is outweighing the frustrations.</p><p>First, because I know you’ll ask: yes, the multitasking is real. I’ve played with dual-screen phones where the manufacturer artificially limits what you can do with the second screen, but that’s not happening here. You can send <em>any</em> app to either screen, even press a virtual button to swap which screen is “primary” as far as Android is concerned. You can turn off either screen to save battery, too, and use whichever you need. As I show in my video, there are all sorts of fun possibilities!</p><p>Second, I didn’t have to baby this prototype’s hinges, despite some worrying flex. I just flip them around and enjoy the loud <em>thock</em> as the pads magnetically snap into place. OneXSugar tells me the final hinges are SK7 tool steel and screwed directly into the aluminum alloy underframe, and will have more screws than the prototype. Still, I’m surprised the final hinge pins will still only attach to one half of the handheld’s frame rather than being sandwiched between top and bottom for more strength.</p><p>I’m continually surprised at how pleasant the Sugar 1 is to hold. The drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks and the microswitch buttons both feel smooth and responsive, and the grips feel quite sufficient in DS mode — with the secondary screen flipped out of the main body, it leaves a comfortable gap to place my fingers. The one notable caveat is there’s no real D-pad. OneXSugar includes a strong magnetic one that floats atop four face buttons of your choice, but I’m having trouble with accidental extra button presses that way; the buttons are better by themselves.</p><p>It’s not the mechanics that worry me most, despite many comments I’ve read about how unnecessarily fragile a multi-hinge device will be. What gives me pause is the software, which feels quite unfinished just over a month before it’s supposed to ship.</p><p>One-Netbook has been building miniature Windows laptops, tablets and handhelds for years now, but its first Android device will ship with the last-gen Android 14, with no promise of future upgrades for future game compatibility, and only a single “Sugar Console” app to make the OS gaming-handheld friendly.</p><p>Often, it works fine! But while I can generally just flip the controllers up or down and largely have gaming buttons instantly work the way my muscle memory expects, that’s not true of every button: the Start button, Android’s back button and the button that summons OneXSugar’s overlay are hard-coded for now, and I’ve had quite a few apps accidentally open or pause because I pressed the wrong button at the wrong time.</p><p>And since you can only swipe out of apps from the designated “primary” screen, I often try to close apps only to find it’s not working because I’m doing it the wrong way.</p><p>I’ve also had occasional issues charging the Sugar 1 reliably, or stretching some Android apps across both screens at the same time. Both are getting fixed in software, according to the company.</p><p>Though the Sugar 1’s primary selling point is the flexibility of its twin OLED screens, I was surprised to find OneXSugar doesn’t yet have a way to resize your games to use those screens optimally — it only offers the equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mat_(picture_framing)">picture frame matting</a> to minimize the black borders you see. In order to play Nintendo DS and SNES games at their proper aspect ratios on the Sugar 1, I was at the mercy of the resizing, window dragging, and arranging tools each emulator offers.</p><p>Some of the Android games I was able to download didn’t run properly quite yet, as they apparently haven’t yet whitelisted Qualcomm’s new handheld chip; <em>Fortnite</em> refused to run entirely, and <em>Genshin Impact</em> complained about overloading the processor as I ramped up the settings, even as the game seemed to run smoothly.</p><p>I wasn’t able to download a lot of native Android titles to begin with: prototypes went out to reviewers without any Google apps or the Google Play Store. That drastically limited what I was able to test, as many top English-language Android games require Google components, and many top Chinese-language games require Chinese logins. The company confirms to <em>The Verge</em> that final units will ship with Google Play, though.</p><p>Lastly, I suspect you’re curious about the battery life from its 21.5Wh pack, I won’t be able to give you a good idea yet because my tool was clearly misreporting the battery drain. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLRKYoReFI0">Over at <em>Retro</em> <em>Game Corps</em></a>, Russ seems to be seeing anywhere from 1 to 12 hours depending on the title.</p><p>I’ve seen lots of zany and droolworthy gaming prototypes in my 15-plus years covering gadgets, but transforming ones like this typically never ship because they’re too complicated and too niche to be worth a manufacturer’s trouble. But One-Netbook, a brand that’s built a reputation <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161887/onexplayer-x1-mini-handheld-gaming-pc-ssd">for modular portable computers,</a> sees this as an opportunity to make a splash in the crowded Android market, VP Jason Zeng tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>He says the goal was to “create something different,” and that his company actually wants to release more such splashy products in the future. For now, its gaming handheld efforts are indeed niche: the 200-person company has only sold around 100,000 pieces, Zeng estimates on a call, with 60 percent of those sales in China. But he says the US is One Netbook’s fastest growing market, and the company sees Android devices as a more affordable way to access a larger population of customers than it’s done with Windows handhelds so far.</p><p>One-Netbook has no plans for Windows on ARM yet, Zeng tells us, but would like to connect with Valve. He says the company would find it “very interesting” to discuss a potential SteamOS handheld.</p><div><div><p id="onexsugar-sugar-1-specs"><h2>OneXSugar Sugar 1 specs</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>6.01-inch 1080 x 2160 60Hz 450-nit OLED primary screen (18:9)</span></li><li><span>3.92-inch 1080 x 1240 60Hz 450-nit OLED secondary screen (8:7)</span></li><li><span>Qualcomm Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 8-core (1+5+2) w/ Adreno A32 GPU</span></li><li><span>16GB RAM (8533MHz), 512GB storage (UFS 4.0)</span></li><li><span>MicroSD expansion up to 1TB (UHS-I)</span></li><li><span>21.5Wh battery (5600mAh), bundled 45W charger</span></li><li><span>Hall effect joysticks</span></li><li><span>Microswitches for face, shoulder, and trigger buttons</span></li><li><span>Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.3</span></li><li><span>USB-C x1 10Gbps w/ 1080p60 DP output and USB-OTG mode</span></li><li><span>Aluminum internal frame overmolded with PC+ABS plastic composite; SK7 steel hinges</span></li><li><span>Stereo speakers, single microphone</span></li><li><span>1.07 lbs (486.3g)</span></li><li><span>Android 14</span></li></ul></div></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen]]></content:encoded>

            <p>SSR Wives: The Murder Of My Winter Crush is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> for people who like the chibi proportions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a> and also, people who hoot in adoration when they see a low-poly model of an iMac. I am both of these people. Created by Hen Studios with a demo on Steam, it's a sour and sugary blend of survival horror and romantic visual novel. You play one of several anime characters with names such as Tradgirl and Chudboy, all trapped in The Town That Time Forgot.</p>
<p>Those mouth-wateringly chubby iMacs? They are save points, the local equivalent for Resident Evil's typewriters. Excellent work, game. You have reminded me of my advancing age in a way I actually enjoy.</p> <!--more-->

<p>The Town That Time Forgot probably should have been named The Town That Time Deliberately Crossed Off The Xmas Card List Because It's An Absolute Shithole. Here you will find "liminal labyrinths", an abandoned missile silo, and a "clown carnival". Also an "antiquated bakery", but I wouldn't touch the bread. It's doubtless liminal bread, with always angries up my guts. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2880000/SSR_Wives_The_Murder_Of_My_Winter_Crush/">The Steam demo</a> offers up a bunch of rusty tunnels and toilets where you will encounter hungry giant rats. Later, there are gnashing pumpkin monsters and assorted mutant clogboggoes with guillotine arms.</p>
<p>Where does the romance component fit in? Well, if you get to know and carry out quests for the locals you might be able to date them, presumably paving the way for one of multiple endings. Beware, however, that the town's residents are "inflicted with disorder", that the game's terrors are projections of their sins, and that you must "balance their emotional connections with the need to survive". To which end, SSR Wives harbours a sizeable assortment of shiny, real-world guns, which look almost cute in each character's mitts until you fire one and turn a rodent into a casserole.</p>
<p>I worry SSR Wives might be throwback to the point of being obnoxious. This is a game that describes non-tank controls as for "cowards", which I would deem "feisty" if the controls worked perfectly: instead, I got chewed apart by a rat because my character refused to strike downward. The Steam page lists "classic door scene transitions" as a feature, which feels like pandering and makes the game sound like a jigsaw of references.</p>
<p>Still, this is a potent demo, and perhaps not as straightforwardly "retro" as billed: there's something going on here with the intersection of fourth-wall-nibbling anime puppetry and cathode-ray Konami squalor I'm still deciphering. The full game is out this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ssr-wives-is-a-sparky-throwback-survival-horror-with-romantic-intentions-and-imacs-for-save-points]]></content:encoded>

The event will run from July 23 to August 6 and features tons of unique content to complement the hottest time of the year.</p><p>As is typical, the event will run in-game for about two weeks and kick off with new summer-themed quests, but the big festival itself will take place in the Grand Hub. That means that players need to have at least reached Hunter Rank 16 to access the social area, which was added to the Wilds' in its <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunts-wilds-first-title-update-adds-grand-hub-new-monsters-and-more/1100-6530343/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjvsOKq_9COAxVyFFkFHW3ABGEQFnoECAcQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw0fllxHNqNxGFHEZgIYb1VH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first title update</a> this spring.</p><p>The Grand Hub will be redecorated and feature a new summer-themed meal as well as playable minigames, like throwing a beach ball around. Additionally, there's a water gun emote that briefly turns Monster Hunter Wilds into a third-person Super Soaker shooter, and Capcom seems to be encouraging players to party up and throw down in the Grand Hub throughout the festival.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf0Xw15oLHs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Yf0Xw15oLHs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the event trailer, it seems like there will also be fireworks and some kind of performance to catch in the Grand Hub. Participation in the Flamefete Festival and login bonuses throughout the two-week run will give players a whole host of extra goodies, like Seikret decorations and craftable gear for hunters and their Palicos that adopts a fiery aesthetic.</p><p>Outside of the festival grounds, there will be two new event quests that appear to add a skintight diving suit made from the skin of the poisonous Rompopolo monster and another that will yield a joke weapon called the Cornpopper, which is essentially a gunlance that looks like a huge corncob. Most previous event quests will also be returning during the festival.</p><p>If all of that leaves folks feeling particularly thirsty, the summer festival update is also adding new swimwear outfits for the hunter as well as many supporting NPCs, including Alma, Erik, and Gemma. Players can buy a DLC pack beginning July 23 that permanently unlocks these cosmetics outside of the event. Speaking of NPCs, this update also allows Fabius, who acts as the leader of Wilds' core members of the Hunting Guild, to join the hunter in the field as an ally.</p><p>The Flamefete Festival launches on July 23 alongside the arrival of the Arch-tempered Uth Duna, both of which are part of the RPG's second free title update.</p>

The game debuts on September 12 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it's coming to Switch 2 on October 3, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said in a <a href="https://x.com/duvalmagic/status/1947702377185763768?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post.</a></p><p>Some had theorized or feared that Borderlands 4's Switch 2 version might release later in 2025 or possibly in 2026, but that's not going to be the case.

It remains to be seen, however, what kinds of differences there could be between versions of Borderlands 4.</p><p>"We don't feel like we're fighting the system.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA has released a new deep dive for EA Sports FC 26, with the video expanding on what we saw in the announcement trailer which was the changes to the gameplay. That includes the competitive and authentic gameplay styles, which leads into how things will proceed on the pitch. You can check out the full details in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Every aspect of gameplay has been addressed for FC 26 including dribbling, pace, passing,<br>
tackling, shooting, goalkeeping, and physicality. There have also been things removed from this entry including agile dribbling, and timed finishing. Some of the updates that EA mentions are specifically for current generation consoles and not the previous generation. One of those updates is dynamic dribbling with animations refined to take into account player height, the distance between the ball and player when they are dribbling. The jog speed of dribbling has also been increased. Movement has been overhauled so players are more agile and do not feel as heavy as in previous games. Within this there are other acceleration types including explosive, controlled and lengthy. For explosive and lengthy player attributes are key, and are broken down as follows:</p>
<p>● Explosive<br>
○ Agility minimum 65<br>
○ (Agility – Strength) &gt;= 10<br>
○ Acceleration minimum 80<br>
○ Height has been separated between male and female players<br>
■ Male height maximum 182cm (~6’0”)<br>
■ Female height maximum 162cm (~5’4”)</p>
<p>● Lengthy<br>
○ Strength minimum 65<br>
○ (Strength – Agility) &gt;= 4<br>
○ Acceleration minimum 40<br>
○ Height has been separated between male and female players<br>
■ Male height minimum 183 cm (~6’1”)<br>
■ Female height minimum 164cm (~5’5”)</p>

<p>Controlled is for those players that do not meet the above criteria. Goalkeepers have also been reworked so they are more responsive, position themselves better, and are better to play as. One key element for goalkeepers is the use of machine learning in Reinforcement Learning goalkeeper positioning. EA states, <em>“This new system uses machine learning to help AI-controlled goalkeepers make more realistic decisions about where to position themselves in the box. By analyzing countless scenarios, the AI can now better cut down angles and react to different types of attacks while adjusting their position more intelligently. It’s important to note that RL Positioning is only active in certain situations, and is only used to position the Goalkeeper. The system is not active when making a save or </em><br>
<em>performing a catch.”</em></p>
<p>Passing is going to be more fluid as the animations have been improved so players can pass in wider angles, and first touch animations will be improved to. Through passes have been overhauled too, with the receivers better selected for ground and through passes. Lob passes will see the ball go into areas where there are fewer obstructions as well. With shooting, angles have been refined too so there are wider angles to fire from. Attacking and defensive movement has been addressed in FC 26 so player positioning is more fluid, with players more likely to remain onside too. When defending players will man mark when attacks are occurring near the goal.</p>
<p>There are a lot of changes coming to EA Sports FC 26, which has been needed after FC 25 failed to bring any significant changes following FC 24. EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Promises to Deliver on Players’ Demands to “Make Gameplay Better” in EA Sports FC 26]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-promises-to-deliver-on-players%E2%80%99-demands-to-%E2%80%9Cmake-gameplay-better%E2%80%9D-in-ea-sports-fc-26.1250139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">full gameplay reveal</a> for EA Sports FC 26 last week, EA followed it up with a gameplay deep-dive today.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay deep-dive starts out confident, as EA proclaims that its focus this year has been to respond to a request, or more accurately, a demand from players, to "<em>make gameplay better</em>." The entire gameplay experience is getting an overhaul, and EA promises that this year's gameplay is "<em>responsive, rewarding, and powered by your feedback</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the biggest changes, is that there are now two gameplay presets for players to choose from, Competitive and Authentic mode. Competitive is the preset that'll be attached to the online game modes like Football Ultimate Team and Clubs, and focus more on responsive player movement and player control for a more competitive game feel.</p>



<p>Authentic mode is what you'll be preset to for offline game modes, like manager mode and player career, and lean more towards a realistic gameplay experience. Within these two new presets are also a refinement of gameplay fundamentals like tackling, pace, passing, saves, player physicality, shooting, agility - essentially, every element of gameplay has been touched up, or changed in a significant way.</p>



<p>"<em>Responsiveness, consistency, and control</em>" are the three pillars on which the Competitive gameplay preset is built, while Authentic gameplay is the simulation-style gameplay. While offline and online modes will have their presets, you'll still be able to swap between Competitive and Authentic to suit your preferred gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Regarding the gameplay fundamental changes, EA went through common complaints that players have, and went through what they changed in EA Sports FC 26 to fix the issues players are having. Some examples boiled down to gameplay producer Paul Parsons, who was narrating the video, reading off a complaint before claiming "<em>we made it better</em>" this time around, but it at least represents EA is trying to fix certain pain points with the game that players have been nudging EA to fix for years.</p>



<p>We'll see if EA is actually delivering on these big promises when EA Sports FC 26 arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC, on September 26, 2025.</p>

What seemed like a straightforward experiment <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidturners.tcgs.co/post/3lukqyijn3c2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidturners.tcgs.co/post/3lukqyijn3c2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly went off the rails</a></span>. The bottle of spray paint he purchased wasn’t quite the warm, egg yolk yellow of the retro Nintendo cartridges. Then, he had to slice open the plastic to get the actual cartridge part with the game installed on it out. Then, he spray painted the plastic just to have it blow away under the force. </p><p>The final result was a messy but unmistakably yellow copy of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. It was a crude attempt, but one that almost inspired me to break my own cardinal rule of never mimicking stuff you see on TikTok. Then the Kong paw curled around Gardner’s knew creation: It wouldn’t fit in his Switch 2. At least not at first. </p><p>I guess he jammed it in or something, because he returned yesterday with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung/video/7529281718205910286?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung/video/7529281718205910286?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a></span> showing him trying and failing to remove <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>from his Switch 2. “The internet was clowning on me cause I decided to paint my Donkey Kong yellow and now it is absolutely stuck,” he said. Metal pliers seemed like the answer, but all they did was scratch up the new paint job and break off a piece of the plastic. “Again I’m chilling because I’ve been playing the game for a while but again I’d love your suggestions” he implored his viewers.</p><p>Instead of offering help, the internet continued to Monday morning quarterback the situation. “Shoulda 3d printed a new yellow shell or something for the cart instead,” one person wrote. Another chided Gardner for failing to sand the plastic before applying the paint for a smooth and better adhering coat. The most helpful responses were just people telling him to send it into Nintendo for an official repair. But the prognosis could be grim. </p><p>“The crazy thing is that the switch 2 cartridge reader isn’t a removable it’s a part of the motherboard,” one user noted. “So you can’t even get a new one to take it out at a repair shop.” Even if Gardner never gets to play another physical game in his Switch 2 ever again, he’ll at least have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@joshstatix/video/7529723624954072350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joshstatix/video/7529723624954072350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his own personal DK rap tribute</a></span> from fellow TikToker Joshstatix: “Ruined the cartridge, brought his console to shame, he’s sprayin’ paint like it’s an art class flex but now the game won’t boot it’s just an error text.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-yellow-spray-paint-cart-1851786727]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The indie game Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 billed itself as a sequel to a fictitious franchise. Now Strange Scaffold has teamed up with newcomer Pedalboard Games to produce a sequel, kind of, which is positioned as a remastered version of the first game in the series, which never actually existed until now. It's coming in September.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830150/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_1_ReRaptored/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1: ReRaptored</a>, you'll play as Jack Briar, an ATF agent dispatched to the Louisiana bayou to investigate strange dinosaur happenings. The game looks very similar to the original CRDM3 that released in April, albeit with new protagonist. The original game was a story-based match-3 metroidvania, which meant you would explore different story avenues and play match-3 battles to progress. This looks similar, as Jack Briar will earn new traits by exploring and use those to unlock paths. CRDM3 was also a cheeky commentary on game development itself, so we can probably expect that to continue.</p><p>Strange Scaffold produced the first game, but new studio Pedalboard Games is developing ReRaptored. This marks the beginning of Strange Scaffold's "Project Share" program, which allows new studios to access the original code and riff on their concepts. Strange Scaffold's Xalavier Nelson Jr. explained the philosophy behind the move on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lukkwvqj4k2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>.</p><p>"Video games is the only medium outside of music that can take the exact same component pieces and by modifying them and switching around their context, end up creating a new, valid, exciting artistic expression," he said. "And you can see this in the modding world, but not in traditional commercial video game development."</p><p>So Strange Scaffold sent the tools to Pedalboard Games under the care of original co-lead Colin McInerney, letting that team quickly iterate on the project and make a new game out of it.</p><p>"We don't intend to do a Project Share very often at Strange Scaffold, but we hope that by doing it at all and being so open about it that it empowers and encourages other developers to investigate ways to, in radical methods that aren't incentivized by capitalism, share resources with each other, and survive, and get games in players' hands more quickly, and at a higher quality than would otherwise be possible, in a way that's more sustainable, for all of our sakes."</p><p>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116510/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1: ReRaptored is coming September 23.</p>

		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is no longer going to be released on September 5th, Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau have announced. Instead, the new release date will be October 31st due to a couple of reasons. The main reason is that there has been a delay in manufacturing the physical copies of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and the second is that the extended window allows for additional development of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Terminator™ 2D: NO FATE - Announcement Trailer (PS5®, PS4®, Nintendo Switch™, Xbox &amp; PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkMFYMG3QLw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Reef Entertainment wrote, <em>“Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025. Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game. We apologise, and thank you for bearing with us. This delay will also give the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself and we would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of Terminator 2D: NO FATE together. As such, this delay will apply to both physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>From the moment we announced Terminator 2D: NO FATE, the response has been absolutely amazing and truly humbling.So, to all of you, thank you so much for your support. We know that this news is disappointing and we appreciate your understanding. We are dedicated to delivering the best release possible for Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we look forward to sharing more of the game with you soon.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.</p>

<p>The very fabric of puzzling</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Thunderful Publishing and Sad Owl Games have announced that their acclaimed 2023 puzzler, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a></strong>, will be coming to Switch consoles this winter, although they haven't gone as far as to give us a specific release date.</p>
<p>You can check out the game's trailer above for a little taste of its exquisite flavours, and we can tell you that this one really is quite the get for Switch fans. It's currently sitting pretty on a whopping Metacritic score of 86, and is an effort that's wowed across the board with its clever approach to puzzling and the twisting of its players' realities.</p>

<p>Here's some further details about the game from the official press blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a BAFTA and UKIE Video Game Awards 2024 winner, <em><strong>Viewfinder</strong></em> immerses players in a mind-bending first-person puzzle adventure that brings pictures to life by placing them into the world. Players will embark on an unforgettable story that digs deeper into the ever changing world, human experience and relationships, meaningful and misguided passion for change and overcoming loss. Viewfinder is currently available on PC and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Key gameplay features include:</p>
<p><strong>Reshape Reality</strong> – Players can bring photographs, paintings, sketches, screenshots and postcards to life while reshaping the world and uncovering what the founders left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration is Learning</strong> – Players will learn the secrets of the world, the reason why it exists and the freedom to create by exploring multiple hub worlds that are all cohesive and encompass similar, but complex, differences.</p>
<p><strong>Endless Experiences</strong> – Viewfinder’s narrative is player driven, featuring an approachable experience for players who just want to solve puzzles, and a rich well thought off world for those who want to learn more</p>
</blockquote>

<iframe title="Wildgate | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDcX7Kf_gTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The launch also came with a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530978642895831122?l=english">development blog</a> with patch notes and changes to the game based on feedback from players who had checked it out in open beta format, ahead of the full launch. </p>



<p>The patch notes include changes to player cards, and the introduction of new methods of progression, including an Infamy System, Streaks, and Milestones. It also includes the announcement of a new game mode, changes to ship balancing like updates to the health, design, and interactions between ships. There were also weapon, equipment, and loot updates, as well as balances to the combat overall, like adjusting the respawn time to 16 seconds for dying outside your ship and 12 seconds for dying on your ship.</p>



<p>Then there were also user interface changes, quality of life updates, and of course, several bug fixes to help make the launch run smoothly.</p>



<p>"<em>The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible,</em>" said co-founder of Dreamhaven and chief executive officer Mike Morhaime, in a<a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/22/wildgate-the-crew-based-space-shooter-from-dreamhaven-and-moonshot-games-available-now/"> press release</a>. "<em>It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun. Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds</em>."</p>



<p>When<a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/"> Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Wildgate</a> earlier this year in March, he wrote "<em>The game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the game is out for everyone, hopefully it's able to live up to that promise.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/supermassive-games">Supermassive Games</a>, best known for developing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-pictures">The Dark Pictures</a> Anthology, have announced they've begun the consultation process for a round of redundancies that'll affect "up to 36" staff. As part of this, sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Directive 8020 has had its release delayed to early next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Supermassive have confirmed that the development of puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a> hasn't been affected by these job cuts, with that game still being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better">on track to come out October 10th</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the studio blamed these layoffs on a need to "better align" with the games industry being "a challenging and ever-evolving environment", whatever that means.</p>
<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected," Supermassive wrote, "We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans."</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>This latest round at layoffs follow the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">laying off around 90 workers in February 2024</a>, citing similar reasoning to that which they've employed here in a social post that looked pretty similar too.</p>
<p>Directive 8020, a standalone entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020s-teaser-trailer-has-leaked">first leaked back in 2022</a>. Supermassive pencilled in a 2025 release for it as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-next-dark-pictures-horror-game-directive-2080-is-out-2025-and-looks-like-alien-meets-the-thing">a proper announcement last summer</a>, which showed off a game the very much looked like it'd be putting the phrase 'in space, no one can hear you scream' to the test. It's all about a colony ship called Cassiopeia crash landing on a planet and its crew then having further bad times as they're hunted down by an alien organism in true Xenomorphy fashion.</p>
<p>"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," reads the first line of Directive 8020's blurb, which I wish didn't vaguely feel like it unintentionally reflects the mood in the games industry right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-lay-off-up-to-36-workers-delay-interstellar-horror-directive-8020]]></content:encoded>

The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-10000mah-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W">INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225531"><div id="225531" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is ideal for carrying around when you've forgot to stick your phone on charge overnight, 45W is more than enough power to charge anything whilst using it, from phones to Nintendo Switch 2.
