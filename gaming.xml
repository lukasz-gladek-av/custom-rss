		<p>Whatever you might think of Disney’s handling of George Lucas’ sci-fi universe, it’s clear that we still can’t get enough of Star Wars. From the premiere of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-casey-hudson/">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a> at 2025’s The Game Awards, to the appearance of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/star-wars-galactic-racer-speeds-us-back-to-a-galaxy-far-far-away/">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/10/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-10-to-6/">a little earlier on this list</a>, the future of a galaxy, far, far, away, seems assured, and certainly so with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</a> making it to number four on our list of 2026’s most wanted games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Zero Company | Official Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcxnRaZ6slU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can stick your Cal Kestis lightsaber swinging, and your Sebulba-bashing pod-racing, Zero Company is Star Wars by way of XCOM. By that virtue, this is a tactical, strategic series of skirmishes through the darker, more serious side of Star Wars, with a turn-based combat style that will feel familiar to fans of games like XCOM, Baldur’s Gate 3 or Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</p>


<p>Coming from Bit Reactor, with support from Respawn and Lucasfilm Games, Zero Company is set during the twilight of the Clone Wars, the announcement trailer showcased an intriguing mix of characters, including a clone trooper, Mandalorian warrior and at least one rogue Jedi padawan. Your team is led by Hawks, a former Republic officer, who pulls the Zero Company together to complete a series of shadowy missions that look to have huge implications for the Star Wars universe. Quite how that plays out in terms of fitting into the wider canon, we’ll have to wait to find out.</p>


<p>The team at Bit Reactor have said that they want decisions to feel important, but that might be more to do with the customisation options for your characters and tactical choices on the battlefield, rather than overly impactful narrative moments. Either way, it’s hugely exciting to be able to explore the wider Star Wars universe from a new perspective, and there’s a huge range of possibilities with this period. Maybe you’ll complete a mission alongside Rex? Or come up against Maul as he works his way towards his takeover of Mandalore?</p>
<p>Bit Reactor definitely have the chops to pull this one off, not least because they’re a team made up of former XCOM alumni. XCOM, and its sequel, remain the benchmark for tactical strategy, so that bodes extremely well for Star Wars Zero Company’s gameplay, and with the XCOM license seemingly encased in Carbonite somewhere within 2K’s IP dungeons, this could well be the spiritual successor that fans have been waiting for, dressed up in one of sci-fi’s best and most beloved universes.</p>

<p>Star Wars Zero Company is coming to PS5, PC and Xbox Series consoles in 2026.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft expect to lay off 55 people across Tom Clancy's The Division developers Massive in Malmö, Sweden and cloud computing studio Ubisoft Stockholm, as part of wider cost-cutting. Reportedly, the job-lossenings are necessary because not enough workers have participated in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">an earlier voluntary redundancy scheme</a> at Massive.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This restructure follows the completion of the Voluntary Leave Program launched during the fall of 2025, a finalized long-term roadmap, and a completed staffing and appointment process, which together have provided clearer visibility into the structure and capacity required to support the two studios’ work and sustainably over time,” the publishers say in a statement passed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-with-55-staff-at-the-division-studio-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm-now-impacted">IGN</a>, who "understand" that the aforesaid Voluntary Leave Program didn't do numbers sufficient for management.</p>
<p>"These proposed changes are forward-looking and structural, they are not related to individual performance, recent deliveries, or the quality of the work produced by the teams," the statement continues.</p>
<p>Ubisoft add that “the long-term direction for the studios remains unchanged”, dangling hints about “an unannounced innovative tech project with a refined team setup”. For context, Ubisoft Stockholm <a href="https://stockholm.ubisoft.com/">currently state on their website</a> that “we’re working hard on something new and ambitious, and we can’t wait to share with you what it is”.</p><p>Ubisoft say that the impacted studios will continue to “play a central role” in development of Ubisoft’s Snowdrop engine – also used by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/settlers-2022">The Settlers: New Allies</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - and the digital distribution service Ubisoft Connect.</p>
<p>IGN report that development of The Division series “will still continue as a matter of priority”, based on conversations with Ubisoft. The publishers announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">“building a team” to make The Division 3</a> back in September 2023, alongside updates for The Division 2 (which will get a time-limited DLC Realism Mode in March, amongst other trinkets, as part of the series’ 10 year anniversary festivities). There’s also an upcoming extraction mode, The Division 2: Survivors, and most recently, reports of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-definitive-edition-looks-like-it-may-be-thing-assuming-this-poster-in-japans-the-real-deal">Definitive Edition of the original game</a>.</p>
<p>This is the second major round of cuts Ubisoft have announced in the whole entire two first weeks of 2026. Last week, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">closed Ubisoft Halifax</a> shortly after the studio voted to unionise, insisting that there was no connection between these events. Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-galaxy-s25-ultra-clearance-at-a-record-low-as-the-new-s26-launch-approaches-2000658989</link>
            <guid>1404301</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that’s its 2026, Samsung is likely to announced a refresh to its flagship lineup of smartphones with their anticipated S26 versions. Though a goods way to save some cash while staying mostly up to date with the latest tech is to pick up the previous year model whenever you’re looking to upgrade. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 aren’t going anywhere and still remain some of the best choices for Android users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h2>
<p data-start="30" data-end="301">The high-end Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in several configurations with different storage options. Samsung has eliminated the 128 GB model from the prior generation, streamlining the lineup into a 256 GB version ($1,300), a 512 GB version ($1,420), and a top-tier 1 TB option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/">Right now, Amazon has the 256GB model on sale for as low as $1,020 which is a discount of 22% saving $280.</a> Likewise, the 512GB model has come down to as low as $1,100. That’s 23% discount, saving $320. Amazon currently isn’t offering the 1TB model.</p>

<h2 data-start="303" data-end="319">What You Get</h2>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The S25 Ultra stands as Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone, packed with premium features throughout. Driven by Galaxy AI, many capabilities see notable upgrades compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">If you’re finding yourself increasingly relying on AI, Gemini Live allows you to speak freely and naturally with the onboard AI to attain information in real time like you would a regular person.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The 6.9-inch display delivers sharper imagery and more vibrant colors than ever before. The camera system features a 50MP Ultra Wide lens designed to capture the full scope of your surroundings. With the help of Galaxy AI, the camera intelligently detects ambient lighting to produce accurate skin tones and detailed textures, bringing portraits to life without the need for extra editing. Video recording is smoother than ever with Night Video and Audio Eraser, allowing you to shoot vivid footage in low-light environments while reducing unwanted background noise using Galaxy AI.</p>


<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Across the Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 lineup, you can choose from a handful of sleek color options. The S25 Ultra specifically comes in a titanium metal case, including the colors Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Whitesilver. The discounts are not equal between each color, though all are on sale for at least a couple hundred off. The most affordable of each storage size are the Titanium Black for the 256GB model and the Titanium Gray for the 512GB model.</p>
<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">These phones comes unlocked, meaning you can use them with your cellular provider of choice. No contracts locking you down at point of purchase.</p>

And I hope it’s a great game, but even if it’s just as good as Skyrim was, you’ll still get so many people throwing out hateful comments. I’m sure there will be more death threats again. All of that stuff. It’s really unfortunate that that’s the way things have gone.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In January last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-announcement-is-now-as-old-as-skyrim-was-when-the-elder-scrolls-6-was-announced"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement became as old as predecessor Skyrim was when The Elder Scrolls 6 was announced</u></a>. Skyrim was released on November 11, 2011, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/11/e3-2018-the-elder-scrolls-vi-announced-at-bethesda-press-conference"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 was revealed on June 10, 2018</u></a> — 2,403 days afterwards. It is now seven-and-a-half years since the announcement, and we’re no closer, it seems, to the release of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the six-year anniversary of The Elder Scrolls 6 announcement arrived in June 2024, even Bethesda chief Todd <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while"><u>Howard paused to say, "oh wow, that has been a while."</u></a> The Elder Scrolls 6 is at least in production, with Bethesda confirming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-officially-in-early-development-but-dont-expect-to-hear-about-it-soon"><u>it had entered "early development" in August 2023</u></a> and "early builds" were available in March 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, amid increasing pressure from fans for some information on the game, Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 wouldn’t be out for some time yet</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Elder Scrolls Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Informer</a>, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo pointed to GTA 6’s high-profile delays as the “smartest thing they could do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What do fans really want?” he asked. “Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know? That’s what I think people are going to want. So, we’re going to take our time and as long as it needs to be great.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile said he assumed Bethesda announced The Elder Scrolls 6 so early because the studio was announcing Starfield at a time when it had already been so long since Skyrim came out, so “we needed to make sure people were not just pissed at us.” He continued: “it’s a very expensive way to do that, though. Those trailers are not cheap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Purkeypile added that Bethesda’s experience with the divisive Starfield shows it’s happy to delay games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I would imagine that they will take a while to deliver it because there’s so much pressure behind that title, and I think it’s been proven with Starfield that they’re finally okay, actually delaying stuff,” he said. “That was not really the case early on. On Skyrim, it was like, ‘It’s coming out on 11/11/11’ and we were like, what?! Oh boy, no pressure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think there is less economic pressure to just get Elder Scrolls 6 out on a date, but there is more economic pressure to actually make sure it’s good, and I think that’s a good thing. That’s healthy so long as they’re also honest with the team about that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the GQ article, Howard once again admitted that it had taken too long to get The Elder Scrolls 6 out the door, but did tease a The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered-style shadowdrop — without confirming anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” Howard said of making The Elder Scrolls games again. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break — The Elder Scrolls has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.” Bethesda is currently playtesting The Elder Scrolls 6, Howard revealed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I like to just announce stuff and release it,” Howard continued. “My perfect version — and I’m not saying this is going to happen — is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear.” The Oblivion Remastered shadowdrop was “a test run,” Howard teased. “It worked out well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this year it was confirmed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-will-feature-a-memorial-character-for-a-much-missed-fan-following-85000-donation-to-make-a-wish"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 will include a character designed in memory of a much-missed fan</u></a> after a remarkable charity campaign that raised more than $85,000 for Make-A-Wish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>1404292</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has released update 1.11.0 along with its patch notes, below. It adds the Abyss cosmetic set along with some fixes and balancing changes to the Trigger ‘Nade and Kettle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These key nerfs to the Kettle and Trigger ‘Nade address some of the biggest complaints from Arc Raiders players in recent weeks.

            <p>"AI is bad, game will be deleted 30.1" reads the headline of the latest a Steam update post about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3435450/Hardest/">Hardest</a>, a rock-paper-scissors-themed roguelike card battler which includes AI-generated assets. "AI is evil, and game will be deleted 30.1" adds the sub-heading of that same update post, just in case the first line didn't make the situation clear enough.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developer Eero Laine, who also looks to go by Rakuel, then kicks off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3435450/view/525364745339929910?l=english">the post</a> in earnest by emphasising for a third time that their game - released in July last year - will disappear from the storefront on January 30th. The reason is a change of heart from Laine on the use of AI generation tech.</p>
<p>"I made this game during the summer in a couple of months and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free and so," they continue. "But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason they get more investment for their AI companies, that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the post, the dev credits "the girl I've been dating for a month" as having helped them come to this conclusion. As much as 'person meets woman, woman makes good points about the ethical concerns surrounding generative AI, person pulls game which uses generative AI from store' is a romantic tale worthy of big screen adaptation, I'm both slightly concerned and put off by Laine laying some of the blame at the feet of their university's alleged AI-positive brainwashing. I'd argue that by the age people typically go to uni, they should be mature enough to at least be somewhat prepared to make their own decisions and scrutinise things before committing to using them.</p><p>Regardless, Laine's come to this decision now. As for Hardest's future, they added: "I coded everything myself, so I can in the future make a new game with real assets if I feel like it, but the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players." So, a return without the AI-generated bits sounds like it may be on the cards down the line.</p>
<p>You'd hope this kind of update post is something we'll keep seeing from time to time going forwards, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">developers as prominent as Larian</a> facing vocal scrutiny from players regarding the use of generative AI in game development.</p>

            <p>No matter how you feel about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review">Arc Raiders</a>' use of AI for NPC voices, it's hard to deny the game has been a massive success that's "cracked open" the extraction shooter subgenre for casual players and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-games-performed-really-well-on-steam-last-year-shaking-the-dominance-of-the-same-old-live-service-games">even harpooned some older live service whales</a>. Now, it's hit a new milestone which positions it as one of the new online shooters to watch out for.</p>
<p>On 13th January, developer Embark Studios announced <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620?s=20">via its social channels</a> that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has recruited over 12 million players to date. That means over 12 million copies of the game sold, as the studio made a "premium entry" bet which has paid off big time. <a href="https://www.gamesmarket.global/arc-raiders-sold-over-12-4-million-units-in-just-ten-weeks/">GamesMarkt</a> shared a more specific number: 12.4 million copies sold in just 10 weeks. Moreover, the game reached "960,000 concurrent players on all platforms in January 2026."</p>
<p>For Embark Studios, the most important fact might be that <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#max">player retention has been notable</a>, with the game holding its ground against <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players">Battlefield 6's massive success</a> and capturing much of the attention that normally would've gone towards Call of Duty after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">Black Ops 7</a> was a disappointment that many longtime fans feared.</p>
<p>To celebrate, Embark Studios is gifting everyone "who logged in since launch till 23:59 CET, 13th Jan" a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool that will be added to their inventory upon logging into the game. The update is rolling out today.</p>

<p>We could also argue Arc Raiders is partially responsible for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Steam setting a new concurrent users record earlier this month</a> as it's managed to comfortably sit among olden heavy hitters like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/counter-strike-2-update-wipes-nearly-2-billion-off-skin-market-value-by-making-fancy-knives-and-gloves-easier-to-get">Counter-Strike 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">DOTA 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG: Battlegrounds</a>. That's no small feat.</p>
<p>With PlayStation and Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-months-after-being-delayed-indefinitely-bungies-troubled-marathon-finally-gets-release-window-and-price">Marathon</a> seeking to capture at least part of the same crowd's attention come March, more players being into PvPvE shooters after Arc Raiders could be a surprise blessing for the beleaguered game.</p>
<p>So, what's the next stop for this newborn franchise? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollywood-sure-sounds-keen-to-make-an-arc-raiders-film">A movie, probably</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="58c7791c4661c"><a title="Pokémon Lego" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/58c7791c4661c/pokemon-lego.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Lego</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lego recently revealed its new <a href="https://redirect.viglink.com/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fthemes%2Fpokemon&amp;key=ae68f205e9e6fcdefa7db1ab4f93a912" rel="sponsored noopener">Pokémon collection</a>, with 'Eevee', 'Pikachu and Poké Ball', and 'Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise' all up for grabs.</p>
<p>The latter set, which costs a whopping <strong>£579.99</strong>, has already been removed from pre-sale, suggesting that the initial allocation has already been met. As such, listings are popping up on <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/i.html?_nkw=pok%C3%A9mon+lego&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1313&amp;mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;siteid=3&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">eBay</a>, and when we filtered these out to 'items sold', it seems people are already paying stupid amounts of money for the collection's flagship set.</p>
<p>One listing for Venusaur, Charizard and Blastoise sold earlier today for a ludicrous <strong>£1000</strong>, which yes, is getting close to double the RRP. Other unsold listings have it at a slightly lower price of around <strong>£785</strong>, but this is still eye-gougingly expensive.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fnjzymh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Similarly, Lego offered customers an additional 'Kanto Region Badge Collection' set for free with pre-orders. At the time of writing, however, we can't see any mention of this on the official site, so it seems reasonable to assume that it's sold out.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/scalpers-are-already-trying-to-sell-the-free-lego-pokemon-pre-order-gift-for-up-to-300/">VGC</a>, then, this set is currently being sold on eBay for roughly <strong>£150</strong>, though unsold listings are still available for as much as <strong>£250-300</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5f1342a36eb22"><a title="Pokémon Lego - eBay" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5f1342a36eb22/pokemon-lego-ebay.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / eBay</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All three sets will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. It seems likely, given the initial popularity, that Lego will want to expand the collection with new sets in the coming months and years. We'll be sure to let you know of any announcements when they happen.</p>

Following that, Capcom will host a "post-show" discussion stream via its YouTube channel, suggesting there will be plenty to chew over. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What could Capcom have left to reveal about Resident Evil Requiem, with just six weeks to go until its launch on February 27? Well, despite Leon S. Kennedy's presence now being out in the open, fans still have plenty of questions about the game to be answered — such as, is any of it open world?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-reveals-bustling-city-location-in-a-what-looks-like-a-huge-departure-for-the-survival-horror-series">teasing trailer published by Nvidia featured clips of a bustling city environment</a> not yet seen in demos or other trailers. Featuring cars and pedestrians, the snippet looked more like an open world game than a Resident Evil title. Is this just a scripted gameplay sequence, or will there be more to explore? Fans are keen to find out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Artwork for the Showcase predominantly features the gun also seen on Requiem's cover, alongside what looks to be red-colored bullets. Resident Evil Requiem's director Koshi Nakanishi has previously suggested this gun will be important — perhaps we'll soon learn more of its signficance, and why it seems to pass from Leon to Grace during the game's events.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty more fans want to know, too. How action-y will Leon's sequences feel? Will any other classic characters make an appearance? What's up with that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-capcom-really-kill-leon-in-resident-evil-requiem-new-images-showing-a-mysterious-mark-on-his-neck-have-fans-worried">mysterious mark on Leon's neck that looks like a zombie bite</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders"><u>Arc Raiders</u></a> community believes high framerates and aim assist may be to blame for some suspicious gameplay clips after players accused streamer Nick ‘Nickmercs’ Kolcheff of cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans took a magnifying glass to the controversial controller accessibility feature after Reddit users took aim at a questionable gameplay video from the streamer last week. The post, which comes in at just 11 seconds long and accrued 2.4K comments on the social media platform, sees Nickmercs using a Renegade rifle (and an Xbox controller) to shoot down two Arc drones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the kind of clip many wouldn’t bat an eye at in passing, but a closer look reveals almost robotic precision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is super sketchy,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q8lli8/comment/nyog0px/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user commented</u></a> shortly after the post was published, “controller does have aim assist on ARC but it’s <em>not</em> like this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah that’s not aim assist,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q8lli8/comment/nyoj1ey/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user added</u></a> at the time. “I mean that’s just blatantly a cheat engine. The way it locks onto a rotor and then he has to move it off the Arc entirely to get it to lock onto the back rotor instead is sus as f**k.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video’s showcase of inhuman, snappy aiming quickly convinced a crowd of users the streamer must be using cheats to boost his performance for his audience. Upon closer inspection, however, it looks like Nickmercs’ may only have Arc Raiders and developer Embark Studios’ built-in aim assist feature to thank.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While no one was able to exactly reproduce the streamer’s mechanical control on console without a cheat tool, PC players had a little more luck. Just hours after fans caught wind of the cheating allegations, Reddit user roartex89 published <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q8qv2l/how_aim_assist_looks_on_controller_on_pc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video</u></a> showcasing what seemed to be a drastic difference in aim assist sensitivity on PC vs. console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further investigation from users like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q9f78z/arc_raiders_pc_aim_assist_is_tied_to_fps_value/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Razukee</u></a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q9h37k/aim_assist_is_significantly_stronger_with_higher/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>awhaling</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qay5iu/aim_assist_is_broken_and_does_not_work_as_intended/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ttvimShinyatheninja</u></a> seemed to find the culprit behind magnetic aiming wasn’t exactly platform choice but frames per second (FPS) values. PCs able to achieve higher framerates seem to be able to use aim assist to snap between targets with ease, while those on the lower end may see little to no benefit from the feature. So, for example, a popular streamer with a high-end PC reaching as much as 240fps would be able to use aim assist to snap to targets with more ease than a player on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X | S, where Arc Raiders is capped at 60fps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This basically [makes] aim assist pay to win,” ttvimShinyatheninja said in their post. “Whoever has the better PC wins. Everyone else is at a huge disadvantage and this [needs] to get fixed asap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nickmercs, who went on to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2668063841?t=00h25m54s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>deny the cheating allegations</u></a> during a January 12 livestream, seems to have been let off the hook, as the Arc Raiders community shifts its focus from one potential cheater to a wider discussion about aim assist. Embark is now being looked to for answers, with players taking to the company’s official channels across Reddit, X/Twitter, Discord, and more to ask for clarity or, ideally, a proper fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without comment from the studio, a section of the community questioning whether it's fair for console players to be matched against PC players has emerged. From cheating allegations to general confusion about how and why aim assist works, these fans now want to spread the word that crossplay should be turned off for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Until resolved console players should not be playing with PC players to preserve a fair environment if one side can do something another isn't capable of," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qay5iu/comment/nz6l3l9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user commented</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PC already have superior inputs with [mouse and keyboard] and now they also have better aim assist?" another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qay5iu/comment/nz6npph/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">replied</a>. "Yeah not a chance I'm ticking that crossplay box on Xbox."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The streamer happened to find himself in the crosshairs of a gaming community that had just spent recent weeks pleading for Embark to crack down on what many felt was a cheating epidemic. As nefarious fans took advantage of exploits to illegitimately gain the upper hand on other Raiders, the studio finally stepped in, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-significant-changes-after-players-report-widespread-issues-with-cheaters"><u>promising to clean up lobbies as January rolls on</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S on October 30, 2025. It’s steadily marching through its third month in players’ hands, with Embark currently working to address feedback with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-looking-into-balance-updates-for-trigger-nade-stitcher-and-more-after-holiday-delays"><u>updates that should arrive sooner rather than later</u></a>.

            <p>The dispute between <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> studio Rockstar and over 30 of its former developers rages on, with those affected denied interim pay by a UK tribunal.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 12th January, a judge ruled against making Rockstar to pay interim relief to its former developers, which the studio fired in October of last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">in a move called by many "union busting"</a>. Rockstar itself has claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). Soon after the dismissals, the organisation <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a>, noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-games-and-iwgb-clash-at-preliminary-hearing-for-fired-gta-6-workers">IWGB asked a judge to grant the fired developers interim relief</a>, which  is a method of financial support for people awaiting a full hearing. If the motion had been granted, the fired employees would have returned to Rockstar's payroll. However, it was not, though the union and its members remain undeterred in the fight for justice.</p>

<p>"We are emerging from this hearing, having now had a glimpse of Rockstar's flimsy grounds for defence, feeling bolstered in our claims that these firings were not just deeply unjust but also plainly unlawful," the IWGB said in a statement shared with Eurogamer.</p><p>It added "the judge stated in her ruling that: 'There was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings'". The IWGB additionally said Rockstar had broken multiple procedural guidelines with its firing of the affected employees. This included the lack of disciplinary meetings, employees being unable to appeal "until six weeks later", and zero evidence of an investigation.</p>
<p>"Comments relied on by Rockstar's lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using a private union Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring'," the union said. It added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">Discord members Rockstar claimed were journalists and competitors were in fact union officials and employees who had recently left the company</a>. The IWGB said those in the server were still bound by the same non-disclosure agreements as then-current employees.</p>
<p>Reflecting on the judge's decision to deny interim relief to the former Rockstar employees, the IWGB said it knew this was going to be a long shot, and had it been secured it would have been "unprecedented" for a group of this number. However, the union said this latest development does not mean that "Rockstar will not be found guilty of unfair dismissal" when the case goes to trial. IWGB president Alex Marshall stated the union is "more confident than ever that a full and substantive tribunal will find Rockstar's calculated attempt to crush a union to be not only unjust but unlawful", despite the refusal for interim relief.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an anonymous former Rockstar employee said: "This decision to fail to award [interim relief] is a gut-punch to everyone legitimately engaged in trade union activities. The real world consequences of this are forcing valuable people to leave this country, upending their families and destroying their lives, and all because of the actions of a ruthless, uncaring employer's quest to crush a trade union." </p><p>They added they will "continue to fight" in order to clear their name, and the names of other affected employees. "This decision, while not in our favour, is not an exoneration of Rockstar's behaviour and actions. Merely a stumbling block on the road to justice," they closed.</p>
<p><strong>[UPDATE 11.43am]</strong> A spokesperson for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> has just shared a statement with Eurogamer regarding this week's rejection of interim relief, which you can read below:</p>
<p>“The Glasgow Employment Tribunal has rejected the union's application for interim relief. We welcome the decision, which is consistent with Rockstar's position throughout.</p>
<p>"We regret that we were put in a position where dismissals were necessary, but we stand by our course of action as supported by the outcome of this hearing."</p>

<p>In addition to the IWGB's legal case against Rockstar, over <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">200 employees at Rockstar have signed a letter to management condemning the firing</a> of their fellow staff members.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">dismissals were also discussed in the UK Parliament last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer has since called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into the dismissals at Rockstar.</p>

			<p>Taking the medieval sandbox simulation of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/mount-blade">Mount &amp; Blade</a> from the sprawling continent of Calradia to the high seas wasn’t the sort of pivot we had anticipated, but that’s exactly what Bannerlord’s first major expansion, War Sails, brings to Mount &amp; Blade 2. In tandem with a new Nordic-inspired playable faction – the imaginatively named Nords – comes a web of new systems and maritime mechanics that greatly expands Bannerlord’s naval gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord - War Sails - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_cHCArYAehU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This isn’t the first time developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/taleworlds-entertainment">TaleWorlds Entertainment</a> has tried to implement sea battles in its flagship series though previous attempts have been surface level at best with the modding community also taking a punt here and there. War Sails offers far more, however, introducing a whole new dimension to what is already a dense simulation known to hook players for hours on end. With that said, just how well executed is Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord’s hotly-anticipated expansion, and how does it enhance the core game, if at all?</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll notice upon booting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/22/mount-blade-2-bannerlord-review/">Bannerlord</a> after installing the DLC is a new start-up screen allowing you to select either the base version of the game (complete with your existing save data) or War Sails. It makes sense to separate the two as War Sails features its own campaign, an updated map, and the removal of online multiplayer.</p>
<p>One of the biggest improvements between Mount &amp; Blade: Warband and Bannerlord was the inclusion of narrative elements that helped enrich Calradia and its factions by introducing a more traditional RPG-like quest system instead of relying on players to stitch together moments of emergent storytelling. Although some series purists will prefer dropping straight into sandbox mode, the War Sails campaign offers a more immersive way to learn about Bannerlord’s naval warfare and ship management systems.</p>

<p>It begins in a similar fashion to the base game, casting players as a lone venturer, separated from their family. However, instead of heading inland to discover the fate of their loved ones, War Sails folds this key plotline into its own swashbuckling saga that has you taken under the wing of Nord sea captain in his hunt for the menacing Sea Hounds.</p>
<p>While we can certainly appreciate the effort that goes into writing a new story – complete with fully voiced dialogue – the exposition in War Sails tends to drag on. Bannerlord may be a much better looking game than its forebears, but investing in characters who are barely animated during conversations is a big ask, even if they do have some interesting tidbits of lore to share. After a few story missions I found myself skipping through most of the dialogue so I could get to the meat of the expansion: learning how to use ships.</p>

<p>As it turns out, there’s not a great deal to get your head around. Traversing the campaign map by sea is pretty simple – with one click you can go from point A to B, though you’ll need to be aware of enemy factions, as well as opportunistic corsairs, who will attempt to engage you in combat. Doing so will transport you to a self-contained battlefield where ships go head-to-head in simulated naval battles. However, where Mount &amp; Blade has always set itself apart from other strategy games is giving players direct command of their armies while also fighting amongst the rank and file.</p>
<p>Naval battles should introduce an exciting new way to play Bannerlord but, in truth, they all tend to follow the same tedious pattern as crews slowly engage and exchange volleys of missile fire before preparing to board. Throwing hooks and reeling in their target vessel, troops will quickly assemble rope bridges, pathing the way for confusingly frantic flurries of melee combat that only end when one side has been wiped out entirely.</p>
<p>You’ll quickly learn how to pilot your own ship, the simple controls allowing you to easily position yourself while raising/lowering the sails to adjust your speed, as well as setting all, half, or none of your crew to man the oars. Having fewer rowers will greatly reduce your mobility though it will increase the number of troops pelting nearby enemies with missile fire. Inevitably – unless trying your absolute hardest to avoid boarding actions – naval battles end with ships being drawn together in an awkward cluster and a messy albeit decisive mass brawl. This frames Bannerlord’s combat in its least enjoyable form: swinging and thrust in tight spaces where it’s difficult to make friend from foe. Overall, naval warfare lacks any kind of pleasing tactical variety though ship upgrades such as ballistas and better rams will at least make those opening moments of each sea battle a little more exciting. Thankfully, there’s always the option to simulate these skirmishes without needing to see each one played out in real-time.</p>

<p>What else does War Sails offer? As touched on before, Bannerlord’s existing Calradia map has been modified to accommodate for the expansion’s naval focus. Rivers and coastlines have morphed to allow for more opportunities to travel via ship with many cities now outfitted with ports where players can lay anchor, trade goods, and manage their fleet. There’s also a new Nord-controlled island to the north that makes for an ideal starting point from which to launch an invasion upon the mainland. As for the Nords themselves, like any faction they have their own network of cities, towns, and settlements, daubed with a Viking-esque aesthetic.</p>
<p>War Sails also adds three new maritime skills to Bannerlord’s existing lineup. These include Mariner, Boatswain, and Shipmaster, which each influence aspects such as sea combat prowess, fleet management, logistics, navigation, and ship upgrades. The requirements for levelling up these skills can be ambiguous and time consuming, though they do reward players who want to pursue a sea-based playstyle as well as those looking to enhance their land armies with naval capabilities.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There are some interesting ideas in War Sails but there’s a good reason why naval warfare was never a core part of the Bannerlord package. Sea battles just aren’t that appealing, lacking any kind of rewarding strategic depth or enjoyability. However, for those wanting a fresh way of tackling the campaign map, War Sails introduces new tactical opportunities and a layer of ship management some Bannerlord players will find themselves engrossed in. In short, this isn’t a must-buy expansion and for new players we’d recommend sticking with the base game.	</p></div>

<p>ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 patch notes reveal that Stella Montis is going to get even more intense as lighting has been lowered in several areas. </p>



<p>Embark Studios has several announcements for ARC Raiders players today. We were informed earlier that the game has surpassed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-is-offering-a-free-gift-for-crossing-12-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">12 million copies sold</a>, and they are providing the community with a free gift to celebrate. Now, new patch notes reveal nerfs to certain items as well as other changes to their PvP-heavy map. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-update-1-11-0-stella-montis-lighting-change-kettle-and-trigger-nade-nerfs">What’s New in ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0? Stella Montis Lighting Change, Kettle and Trigger Nade Nerfs</h2>



<p>Starting with the biggest one, right at the very bottom of the ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 patch notes, players will see that a new change will be taking place in Stella Montis Night Raid. Stella Montis was already a PvP-heavy map with low lighting and angry Raiders thirsty for blood. Now, the lighting has been reduced in some areas, making the use of flashlights and listening even more essential. The change could lead to more sneaky tactics, such as camping in the dark and ambushing opponents. </p>



<p>Moreover, the Kettle’s fire rate has been reduced from 600 to 450, as the previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using Macros. The Trigger ‘Nade has been nerfed as well, as it was dominating PvP encounters and players were preferring it over the other grenades. The nerf will reduce its use as a “trigger-in-air” grenade while retaining its use as a sticky bomb, with the delay being increased from 0.7 seconds to 1.5 seconds. Lastly, a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them has been fixed.  </p>



<h2 id="h-complete-arc-raiders-update-1-11-0-patch-notes">Complete ARC Raiders Update 1.11.0 Patch Notes </h2>



<ul>
<li>Kettle
<ul>
<li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favours using 3rd party software.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Trigger ‘Nade
<ul>
<li>Dev note: Trigger ‘Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favour picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a “trigger-in-air” grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li>



<li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders update 1.11.0 patch notes were released on their <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-11-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a> today. </p>







<p>In other news, one million players have completed their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first Expedition Project and wiped their accounts</a>.

			<p>This morning, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2010895134653837413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that a new <strong>Resident Evil Showcase</strong> will air this <strong>Thursday, January 15</strong>, at 2 PM Pacific Time/5 PM Eastern Time/10 PM GMT/11 PM CET.</p>



<p>The stream will, of course, focus on <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, which is now just a month and a half away from its scheduled <strong>February 27</strong> launch date. However, there are hints that some other game may briefly appear, too. The official website says:</p>



<p><em>Don't miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem! Airing January 15, 2026!</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>The date and time of the event may change without prior notice.</em></li>



<li><em>Some of the games included in the show aren't suitable for children.</em></li>



<li><em>This content will be age restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Fans are hoping this means CAPCOM may take the opportunity and announce <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> ports of the <strong>Resident Evil 2 and/or 4 remake</strong>. Resident Evil 7, Resident Evil Village, and Requiem are already scheduled to hit the latest Nintendo console on February 27, 2026. Of course, this could also be standard phrasing that the publisher reuses for its showcase announcements without much consideration for whether the event will actually feature one or more games. </p>



<p>The 12-minute running time would definitely be pretty tight, with most of it undoubtedly reserved for Requiem. Even more unlikely is any announcement of the next rumored remakes, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-resident-evil-remakes-code-veronica-2027-zero-2028/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Code: Veronica (2027) and Resident Evil Zero (2028)</a></strong>, which will have to wait until after the new entry has launched.</p>



<p>Anyway, the publisher invited fans to stick around on the Capcom USA Twitch channel after the end of the Resident Evil showcase for a discussion with guests Bawkbasoup and JenIsOnline, followed by a giveaway of a Resident Evil 4 Collector's Edition. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired by Rockstar</a> last year on the charge of leaking information about the upcoming game have been denied interim relief, as they and their allies at the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain begin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">their legal case</a> against the company for alleged union-busting. </p>
<p>Interim relief is a legal mechanism whereby dismissed employees get short-term emergency financial help from their employer. The IWGB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-continue-to-claim-firings-were-about-preventing-gta-6-leaks-as-union-push-to-get-devs-interim-relief">requested</a> last week that a UK employment tribunal grant interim relief to 31 fired Rockstar employees. Had the request been granted, the ousted workers would have been put back on Rockstar’s payroll and had any cancelled work visas reinstated.</p>
<p>Naturally, Rockstar are interpreting the rejection as supporting their case that the workers were fired for sharing info about GTA 6 and other unannounced projects over Discord, rather than because they were trying to unionise. A spokesperson has told IGN that the judge’s decision “is consistent with Rockstar’s position throughout.”</p>
<p>The IWGB, meanwhile, argue that obtaining interim relief was always going to be “an incredibly high bar to meet”, and that the setback “does nothing to dampen our hopes of winning justice when the full hearing takes place”. They call attention to employment judge Frances Eccles’s ruling that “there was no evidence of the respondent having suffered any adverse consequences as a result of these postings” [on Discord].</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-says-we-stand-by-our-course-of-action-as-judge-rejects-fired-gta-6-developers-application-for-interim-relief">IGN</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge">Bloomberg</a>, the hearing includes a little more from either side about what exactly happened on the union organiser Discord channel in question, though this is just a preliminary procedure - the bulk of claims and evidence are to follow when the case goes to court.</p>
<p>According to the ruling from Eccles, over half of the roughly 350 members of the Discord were members of the IWGB, but some were no longer employed by Rockstar. One of the channel’s members is said to have written articles about video games, including one about Rockstar and GTA.</p>
<p>To give some background on that latter allegation, Rockstar <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">“indicated” to IGN</a> back in December that one member of the Discord was a game journalist, while another was an employee of a rival developer. Rockstar has claimed that moderators were not aware of the identities of every member of the channel, creating a security risk.</p>
<p>IWGB communications officer Jake Thomas has countered that all members of the Discord were either union staff or officials or Rockstar employees, with moderators removing members after learning that they had left the company. Thomas did, however, concede that one union official present in the channel had previously written "a couple of articles for a paper, but is a game worker and union rep and was in the group in that capacity."</p><p>Rockstar have yet to say much about the nature of the “confidential information” allegedly being shared, though IGN report that it’s a mixture of “specific game features, comments on the overall progress of GTA 6 development, timelines to launch, and company IT security protocols” – all details Rockstar believe could damage parent company Take-Two Interactive’s share price, if they were made public. Some of these claims have been corroborated by other sources. In November, an anonymous Rockstar insider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-fired-unionising-gta-6-devs-following-discord-chat-about-new-company-slack-policy-claims-report">claimed to People Make Games</a> that the firings followed a discussion of changes to the company’s internal Slack policy.</p>
<p>Judge Eccles also notes in her ruling about interim relief that, besides the 31 people let go in the UK, Rockstar dismissed three employees in Canada who were not members of the union. As such, she argues that their union membership could not have been a factor in their dismissal.</p>
<p>The fired developers are represented by Lord John Hendy KC – who, yes, is an actual Lord in the House of Lords. Among other things, he argued in the hearing that no information had actually been leaked to the press and public, and that it is not in itself “gross misconduct” (as Rockstar has previously stated) to share confidential information in a group containing external third parties.</p>
<p>The IWGB have released a statement in response to the tribunal ruling. It claims that the hearing has revealed “that many procedural guidelines were broken in the process of firing these employees, including there being no disciplinary meetings, no chance for appeal until six weeks later, and no evidence of an investigation. Comments relied on by Rockstar’s lawyers were obtained without the knowledge of employees using Discord, described by the claimants as 'covert monitoring.'”</p><p>The IWGB also argue that “[r]ather than focusing their case on evidence that Rockstar acted fairly and reasonably in their decision to fire 31 people on the spot, the argument resided largely on legal technicalities, with Rockstar's lawyers declaring that it doesn’t matter if the dismissals were unfair, or if the leadership that dismissed them acted with malice.”</p>
<p>The dismissal of the Rockstar workers has sparked protest action outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two Interactive’s offices in London</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North’s headquarters in Edinburgh</a>. It has also been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">raised in Parliament</a>, with prime minister Keir Starmer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-firings-are-a-deeply-concerning-case-thatll-be-looked-into-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">calling it “a deeply concerning case”</a>.</p>

            <p>Much has been written about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a>'s handling of its lead female character, the culture war surrounding it, and <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/stellar-blade-cuts-unintentional-reference-to-racial-slur-3750534">developer Shift Up's several eyebrow-raising missteps</a> as the game broke through into mainstream consciousness. Regardless, the PS5 title was a big success and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">a sequel is now in development</a>. Before we even get a first look at it, however, a new storm appears to be brewing.</p>
<p>AI, generative or not, is the talk of town, and by town I mean the entire games industry. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian tries to toy with gen-AI while not using the tech for final assets</a> and <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-it-s-cancerous-manor-lords-publisher-hooded-horse-wants-to-avoid-genai-like-the-plague">publishers like Hooded Horse unequivocally dunk on studios using it</a>, the debate refuses to go away. 2026 may be defined by the widespread adoption or rejection of AI tools, and hopefully, by people finally figuring out the difference between tools that have been around for a while and the controversial gen-AI. The well has already been poisoned, sadly.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> director Hyung-tae Kim is bullish on the whole package, it seems. During a national briefing on South Korea's 2026 Economic Growth Strategy, the developer claimed it's "an essential tool for going up against large competitors like China on a global level". <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">Automaton</a> reported on (and translated) the news first shared by <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">GameMeca</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who's been paying attention to the games industry for the last few years is well aware of China's increasingly large presence, with behemoths like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Black Myth: Wukong</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chinese-action-rpg-where-winds-meet-reaches-two-million-players-in-just-24-hours-of-global-release">Where Winds Meet</a> making waves and rising to compete against the Japanese and Western giants that have typically dominated the market. Meanwhile, South Korea has started to exit the MMO-oriented creative trends and begun to punch above its weight with triple-A projects. It comes as no surprise to see more and more developers in the country betting on AI (even if it's not of the <em>generative</em> kind) as its ambitions grow larger, too.</p><p>Kim "argues that widespread use of AI will not result in people losing their jobs, because competing with major industries like China and the US will require not only utilising all available manpower, but also making everyone proficient in AI". Press X to doubt, as immediately, he stated one person could "perform the work of 100 people" with the assistance of these tools.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the adoption of AI assistance into the general pipeline really will make games bigger, better, or more profitable for publishers, but either way, it seems like the conversation around this topic - and the consequences of its general usage - will not go away any time soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/</link>
            <guid>1404211</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, publisher <strong>Nexon</strong> and developer <strong>Embark Studios</strong> announced that the third-person extraction shooter game <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has now sold <strong>more than 12.4 million units</strong> to date since its launch on <strong>October 30, 2025</strong>. The announcement confirms Alinea Analytics' latest estimates, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which had already indicated last week</a> that the game had surpassed 12 million copies. Moreover, the game registered around 960,000 concurrent players this month, not far from the impressive threshold of one million concurrent users (presumably across all platforms).</p>



<p>It is yet another confirmation, if needed, that ARC Raiders is incredibly good at maintaining its momentum so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>despite the AI voices controversy</strong></a>. Of course, the game's live service run has just started. Anyway, as a thank-you gesture for all the support, Embark is giving away a <strong>Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</strong> to everyone who logged into the game at least once since launch till today at <strong>23:59 Central European Time</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release included the usual celebratory statements from Nexon and Embark. Junghun Lee, President and CEO of Nexon, stated:</p>



<p><em>We are incredibly pleased with the strong retention and enduring enthusiasm players in all major markets worldwide have shown for ARC Raiders. As pleased as we were with the October launch, reaching more than 12.4 million units and setting a record with 960,000 concurrent users in January demonstrates the potential for ARC Raiders to become another pillar in Nexon’s portfolio of blockbuster franchises. Embark Studios has delivered exactly what players worldwide have expected from the game, a fresh, highly differentiated experience in a massive global game genre. ARC Raiders’ success is a clear affirmation of Nexon Group’s goal of expanding our global footprint with horizontal growth from all-new games that capture and grow massive game communities in every major market and on multiple platforms.</em></p>



<p>Patrick Söderlund, Founder and CEO of Embark Studios, added:</p>



<p><em>Hitting 12.4 million units is a huge landmark—and it wouldn’t have happened without our players. The community of raiders has been part of this journey from the start, and their ideas and enthusiasm continue to guide where the game goes next.</em></p>



<p>ARC Raiders has earned the <strong>Best Multiplayer Game</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at The Game Awards 2025</a> and the <strong>Most Innovative Gameplay</strong> prize <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-2025-goty-award-goes-to-hollow-knight-silksong-beating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the Steam Awards 2025</a>. It's also well-positioned to win <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's Best Multiplayer Game award from the community</a></strong>, although voting hasn't closed yet.</p>

		<p>Capcom may have spoiled their own surprise in a safety message for the new Resident Evil Showcase, which will be happening on 15 January 2026 at 10:00 PM (UTC) – which is 10.00PM GMT in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>The official announcement over on <a href="https://www.residentevil.com/showcase/en-uk/">residentevil.com</a> advises that you “Don’t miss the 12-minute Resident Evil Showcase special, featuring all the latest info on Resident Evil Requiem!”. That is to be expected as it is the next game in the series launching on 27th February 2026.</p>


<p>However, in the usual warnings for minors, the website also states, “This content will be age-restricted. Age verification will be required to view this content. Some of the games included in the show aren’t suitable for children.”</p>
<p>Did you spot it? <em>Games</em>. Plural. So that’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and at least one other title.&nbsp; However, this may not be a new title, as it is heavily rumoured that Capcom will be releasing previous Resident Evil games on Switch 2 on the same day that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> launches.&nbsp; A few years ago, rumours circulated about a Resident Evil Zero remake for 2027 and a Resident Evil Code: Veronica remake for 2028, but no further information has been heard about those since.</p>

<p>In case you had forgotten, Resident Evil is also heading back to the big screen with the franchise getting a reboot this September. The movie will not feature any characters from the games and will be an original story set in the Resident Evil universe.</p>
<p>“It takes place in the world of the games,” Cregger explained to the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnKTQ2Xenbs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;Double Toasted podcast</a>. “But most importantly the journey you’ll have as a viewer of watching this movie is going to be similar to the journey you have as a player when you play these games. And what that means is it follows one protagonist from point A to point B as they just descend deeper and deeper and deeper into Hell.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders just keeps on growing, hitting a new milestone in 2026 of over 12 million copies sold, and the devs are offering a free gift to players to celebrate the occasion. </p>



<p>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders is definitely one of the most popular releases in 2025, and is still going strong into the new year. The player base also includes a dedicated bunch, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/one-million-arc-raiders-players-wiped-accounts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 million completing their first Expedition Project</a>. Now, you can grab a free gift for helping the game reach this milestone. </p>











<p>As revealed through the official ARC Raiders <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2010985172632797620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the developers have confirmed that they have seen “over 12 million Raiders ascend from Speranza to raid the Rust Belt.” The dev team had crafted a special gift to celebrate hitting 10 million players, and this free thank-you gift is a Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool. Any player who has logged in since launch until January 13, 23:59 CET, will receive this gift once the latest update is released. </p>



<p>Since its release, ARC Raiders has slowly and steadily cemented its position as one of the best extraction shooters ever released. <span>Last week, a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimate-hits-12-million/" target="_blank">sales estimate</a>&nbsp;for the</span> game was released, stating that the title had already surpassed 12 million units across Steam, PlayStation, and Xbox. This seemingly helped Embark Studios rake in a whopping $350 million and reach a daily active user count of 3.2 million. </p>







<p>In other news, ARC Raiders players are complaining about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bans-false-block-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">false account blocks and bans</a>. Additionally, we recently caught a glimpse of what ARC Raiders might have looked like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-first-person-works-well-new-clip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it were a first-person shooter</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fired Rockstar Devs Denied Pay While Legal Battle Goes On]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-devs-denied-pay-legal-battle/</link>
            <guid>1404184</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new report, it has been revealed that a UK judge has outright <strong>denied </strong>the 31 fired Rockstar employees interim pay while they tussle with the firm and Take-Two over what they claim was an unfair dismissal. Last year, 31 employees in the United Kingdom were fired from Rockstar Games in one sweep, with the gaming titan claiming that they were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Following the sweep, it emerged that Rockstar may have been fighting back against unionization, targeting employees who joined the IWGB union in the United Kingdom. Rockstar has categorically denied these claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-s-dismissed-devs-won-t-get-pay">Rockstar’s Dismissed Devs Won’t Get Pay</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-12/fired-rockstar-employees-denied-pay-by-uk-judge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a>, it was stated that the UK’s Judge Frances Eccles had <strong>denied </strong>a plea for interim pay for the 31 former Rockstar Games developers. This interim pay would have allowed these employees to jump back on the company’s payroll while the situation with the mass dismissal was being handled through legal channels.</p>



<p>It was stated by the judge that the fired employees could not demonstrate their case enough to have a ‘pretty good chance of success’ at proving they were dismissed in a union-busting effort.</p>



<p>The judge wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>In all the circumstances, the tribunal was unable to conclude that it appears likely that the tribunal will find that the principal reason for the claimants’ dismissal was their membership of the IWGB</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This means that it’s <strong>unlikely </strong>that the dismissed employees will have the court weigh in their favor over the union-busting allegations. It’s another angle of support for Rockstar’s suggestion that the employees were leaking confidential information.</p>



<p>Days ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-devs-fired-over-leaks-sent-to-influencers-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar claimed</a> that the employees were dismissed because they were leaking information about ‘upcoming and unannounced titles’ to influencers on social channels, including a Discord server.</p>



<p>That server has become the biggest point of contention. The company explained that <strong>25 non-Rockstar employees</strong>, including former workers, competing developers, and even <strong>a video game journalist, </strong>were in that server. This gave them unimpeded access to critical information about Grand Theft Auto 6 and other games.</p>



<p>The court’s ruling now locks these former employees out of any pay while they attempt to resolve the situation with Rockstar Games.</p>

                <p>Nintendo Switch 2 players can grab a surprisingly good alternative to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-joy-con-2-light-purple-light-green-preorder-roundup/1100-6537276/" data-ref-id="1100-6537276">Joy-Con 2 </a>for handheld mode for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gammeefy-Switch-Controller-Game-Boy-Color/dp/B0FSZ4P8DB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $42.49 (was $54) at Amazon</a>. This is the lowest price yet for the Gammeefy JC400, a Bluetooth controller with a cradle designed specifically to hold the Switch 2 console. The JC400 has Hall Effect sticks with RGB light rings, two remappable back buttons, rumble with five intensity levels, six-axis motion controls, and numerous other features that make it a bargain.</p><p>You're probably wondering about the brand, right? Gammeefy? Yeah, it's not a major brand. It's one of those accessory brands you find on Amazon that happens to sell the same exact product as other brands you also haven't heard of. The JC400, for instance, is also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FSZHR7YV,B0FVF4DBY4,B0FT3XW4DG&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold by several other brands on Amazon</a>. Additionally, the 2,700+ customer reviews (4.5/5-star average) is bolstered by an older model for the original Switch and Switch OLED on the same store page. It's worth noting the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gammeefy-Switch-Controller-Game-Boy-Color/dp/B0CXDDNL5W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch/Switch OLED version of the controller is only $28 (was $40)</a> for a limited time.</p><p>We rarely highlight off-brand accessories sold by multiple brands--a common occurrence on Amazon--but the JC400 is actually quite impressive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634279-gammeefy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634279-gammeefy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4634279"></a><figcaption>Gammeefy JC400 Nintendo Switch 2 Bluetooth Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634279-gammeefy.jpg"></figure><p>There aren't many third-party handheld controllers for Nintendo Switch 2.

Out of the box, the JC400 synced quickly to my Switch 2 console, and I haven't experienced any connection issues or increased input latency compared to other Bluetooth controllers.</p><p>As shown in the image above, the console slides into place. A sheet of soft felt covers the back of the console cradle to prevent scratches. It already feels secure on its own, but there are two locking switches that can be flipped on the back to prevent the console from moving during accidental drops. After locking the switches, the console doesn't budge at all--even if you flip it upside down and shake it toward the ground.</p><p>If you liked the Hori Split Pad Pro for the original Switch, the JC400 feels similar. The more traditional form factor will probably feel large at first, but it's certainly more comfortable than the Joy-Con 2 without a grip case.</p><p>The one notable downside to the JC400 is that the shell, face buttons, and D-pad feel too plasticky. On the other hand, the full-size Hall Effect sticks are smooth and precise, and the larger triggers and shoulder buttons are nice bonuses. The two built-in back buttons are conveniently located and offer solid feedback.</p><p>The back buttons and several other settings can be customized directly on the controller. Four menu buttons are located on the back: The M button remaps MR/ML (back buttons); the light button dims/brightens the joystick rings; SL deactivates the the back buttons; and SR can be used to program macros/input sequences of up to 21 button presses.</p><p>You can cycle through five rumble intensities by pressing the vibration button on the front. Also on the front is a Turbo function with support for three different speeds and a fully automatic setting.</p><p>The JC400 charges via USB-C and can run for up to 10 hours. The controller blocks the bottom USB-C port on the Switch 2, but the top port is accessible, so you can charge your console and play simultaneously. You can also store up to four Nintendo Switch 2 game cards in the dedicated slots running across the top.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634484-jc400.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634484" data-ratio="0.41" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634484-jc400.png" data-ref-id="1300-4634484"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 JC400 Bluetooth controller for Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4634484-jc400.png"></figure><p>Additional adjustments can be made by syncing the JC400 to a free iOS and Android app called KeyLinker. Since this is an app used by a bunch of different controllers from various brands, it doesn't offer as nice of an experience as proprietary customization suites. Nonetheless, it gets the job done, allowing you to tinker with stick sensitivity, create dead zones, remap all inputs, switch between the three RGB lightning modes, and adjust the six-axis motion controls.</p><hr><h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FGP8CBQ7,B0D8JJRCJN,B0FT34CLXF&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameSir Bluetooth Mobile Controllers Deals</a></h3><p>As mentioned, GameSir's Galileo G8 Plus and X5s controllers for iOS and Android also work for Nintendo Switch 2 as well as the original Switch.
