            <p>Microsoft has unveiled a rather fabulous custom Xbox console and controller, inspired by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p>It's honestly a really great looking piece of kit. The console itself features a "timeworn yet beautiful design" in a golden hue. The controller, meanwhile, has a leathery look to it and gemstone-like buttons. As a huge Indiana Jones fan, I wanted this kit in my house yesterday.</p>
<p>But, here's the catch. Microsoft has locked this console, quite literally, in a puzzle box, and only if you solve the puzzle will you then be entered into a sweepstake to actually win the console and controller. Oh, there will also be the chance to win one via some kind of social media engagement on Bethesda's channels. But, otherwise, this console and controller will not be for sale. Sad.</p>

<p>This is not the first time Xbox has kept one of its custom consoles behind a sweepstake of some description.</p>
<p>In November last year, Xbox announced a competition in collaboration with Warner Bros. Pictures to promote the Timothée Chalamet-fronted Wonka film. Winners got a range of chocolate goodies including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-is-giving-away-an-edible-chocolate-controller">Wonka-inspired Xbox Series X and an edible controller</a>.</p>
<p>Also last year, it hosted a giveaway which saw some Xbox fans presented with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-pizza-scented-controller-in-collaboration-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">pizza-scented Xbox wireless controller</a>, as part of a promotion for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> movie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/stampede-racing-royale-launches-for-free-with-a-dave-the-diver-collab/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Battle Royale karting game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stampede-racing-royale">Stampede Racing Royale</a> has burst into a full free-to-play launch on PC via Steam with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a> – should that be Dave the Driver? – collaboration to celebrate the release.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stampede: Racing Royale ???? PLAY FOR FREE ON STEAM!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0EJki9N-5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The pitch for Stampede Racing Royale is pretty simple: it’s Mario Kart, but a battle royale. 60 players will join the starting lobby and then race through three rounds, first to avoid the cut and then to race for the win in the final round.</p>
<p>The game on Steam is skipping past the Early Access branding, but it’s a counterpart to the Xbox Game Preview version available on consoles and the Microsoft Store on PC, which is keeping the Game Preview label. There will also be the biggest update yet for the Game Preview build, with new content, features and community-driven changes.</p>
<p>There’s six new tracks, six new karts (plus one Dave the Diver kart), and more than 250 new customisation items. They’ve added a new ‘Wrapid’ special event to unlock an exclusive kart wrap, and there’s a reward for logging in for 7 days straight.</p>

<p>For the moment-to-moment racing, a new boost system has been implemented to accumulate boost via drifting, airtime and just passively, with players able to deploy it themselves. A new Jelly Block power-up will drop gelatinous cubes on the track to slow and blur the vision of anyone that runs into it. Add some new round modifiers, like Hard Mode, where players can be instantly eliminated by running into hazards, and there’s plenty of scope for added variety.</p>
<p>In a curious move, the game is going far beyond just being free-to-play. Sumo Leamington want to built a bustling community first, and so have completely removed in-app purchases from the game. They’re also gifting all racers 3,000 Star Chips&nbsp;–&nbsp;the in-game currency – which is enough to unlock all of the cosmetic content.</p>
<p>It’s a bold move, but alongside the Dave the Diver collab, it should hopefully help gain the game a good bit of attention. Season 0 will extend through to early 2025, with Sumo looking to make more changes for the eventual arrival of Season 1.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-mod-unlocked-framerate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero mod was released online today promises to make the experience much smoother, at least in offline play.</p>
<p>The mod developed by Zetto, which can be downloaded for free from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonballsparkingzero/mods/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, removes the 60 FPS cap in the PC version of the game, allowing the game to run at an unlocked framerate without speeding up the game.&nbsp;For the mod to work properly, the <a href="https://ko-fi.com/post/Dragon-Ball-Sparking-Zero-UTOC-Signature-Bypass-P-D1D314G19U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sparking Zero UTOC Signature Bypass patch</a> is required.</p>
<p>Considering how <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-pc-system-requirements/">undemanding the Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO PC system requirements</a> are, many players should be able to take advantage of this mod to improve the experience. Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-interview-with-jun-furutani-discussing-the-series-return-game-modes-netcode/">August</a>, during Gamescom, I asked the game's producer Jun Furutani about high refresh rate modes and was told that the team wanted to offer the same type of experience on all platforms, so all versions of the game run at 60 frames per second. During the same interview, Furutani-san also commented on balancing, play modes, character roster, and more.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO launches tomorrow, October 11th, on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S worldwide. The game is already available for all those who purchase the game's Deluxe Edition. You can learn more about the game by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-hands-on-ps5-preview/">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-open-playtest-for-mysterious-new-switch-online-feature.1005858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-new-feature-playtest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a playtest for a brand new Nintendo Switch Online feature, and recruitment for said playtest begins today, although you'll need a little extra something if you want to take part.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-gb" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement on its website</a>, Nintendo says that the aptly-named Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program pertains to "a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service" that'll be available on the Switch.</p>
<p>You'll only be able to take part in said test if you have an Expansion Pack addon for your Switch Online subscription, and you'll also need to be at least 18 years of age starting from yesterday (October 9th).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-new-feature-playtest-games.jpg?itok=jGSY-RiJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-new-feature-playtest-games.jpg?itok=1GRdwF5w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo Switch Online is about to get some kind of new feature, although we're not sure what it might be yet.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also only be able to access the test if you're based in the UK, the US, Japan, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. Those applying from outside Japan will be picked "on a first-come-first-serve basis", Nintendo says, while those within Japan will be selected via raffle "if there are many Japanese applicants".</p>
<p>Recruitment starts today at 10am Eastern and runs until October 15th, and the playtest period itself begins on October 24th, ending on November 6th.</p>
<p>Of course, this being Nintendo, the Japanese gaming giant is cagey regarding exactly what the new feature it's testing might be. However, given that you need an Expansion Pack addon to access it, we can make a few educated guesses.</p>
<p>Since the Expansion Pack offers a number of retro games you can't access with a basic Nintendo Switch Online membership, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-and-game-boy-advance-titles-are-finally-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">Game Boy Advance games</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/european-n64-titles-will-be-slower">N64 titles</a>, it's possible Nintendo is trialing a brand new system for the Expansion Pack service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-playtest.jpg?itok=A3XkEYy7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-playtest.jpg?itok=NcUwLOuP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could GameCube games be on their way to Nintendo Switch Online?</figcaption></figure><p>The obvious first choice if this is the case would be the GameCube, since there are many games for that system, like&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros. Melee&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, that are unavailable on modern consoles.</p>
<p>Nintendo could also be trialing the release of DS games for Switch Online. We know that porting DS games to modern systems is possible thanks to the recent release of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/dominus_collection/eu/en-eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Castlevania: Dominus Collection</em></a>, after all.</p>
<p>In any case, you'll be able to apply for whatever this Nintendo playtest happens to be starting from 10am Eastern today. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24266327/metaphor-refantazio-persona-handheld-heritage<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus’ <em>Persona</em> franchise is largely a console series, but it has a strong handheld heritage. There were excellent portable versions of <em>Persona 3</em> and <em>Persona 4</em>, and <em>Persona 5</em> <em>Royal</em> on Nintendo Switch was great, too. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is a new fantasy JRPG from the team behind those beloved <em>Persona</em>s. And while the game takes place in a different universe, many of the core elements are present in <em>Metaphor</em> — which means that it’s just as great of a handheld experience.</p><p>I might be understating it to say <em>Metaphor</em> is <em>Persona</em>-like. The game’s UI is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/24026398">exceptionally flashy</a>. You’ll spend a lot of time talking with your allies and improving your bonds with them. Days tick by as you navigate sprawling dungeons and spend time with your companions before a looming deadline. The main characters even go through epic transformations where they brutally rip an organ out of their body as a mysterious voice talks in “thous” and “haths.” Once, while taking notes about the game, I called it <em>Persona</em> instead of <em>Metaphor</em>. It’s that similar.</p><p>But that means so much of what makes <em>Persona</em> games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/17/23403042/persona-5-royal-nier-automata-nintendo-switch-review">great portable titles</a> works for <em>Metaphor</em>, too. Battles tend to be quick, meaning if you have a few minutes, you can blast through several to clear a dungeon floor. Doing activities in one in-game day is enough to feel like progress. Some parts of the game feature long bouts of text, but when I’m playing just before I go to sleep, seeing what happens next can feel like an exciting chapter in a great book.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m playing <em>Metaphor</em> on the Steam Deck. The game is listed on Steam as Playable instead of Verified, and while it is indeed playable, performance is inconsistent, especially in town areas I’ve visited. (The towns are pretty busy places, with lots of characters and things going on.) I actually capped the game at 30fps in settings, even though it can run higher, just because I didn’t want to deal with varying frame rates.</p><p>But fortunately, <em>Metaphor</em> isn’t a game that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metaphor-refantazio-a-sublime-game-let-down-by-bizarre-technical-choices">demands perfect performance</a>. In dungeons, you can attack enemies in real time to try to get the jump on them, but I found that frame rate dips didn’t hinder my ability to pull off a successful barrage. All battles are turn-based, anyway, and some frame drops didn’t make much of a difference to me there.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m more than fine dealing with some issues; being able to take <em>Metaphor</em> anywhere I want is amazing. I play the game pretty much every night before I fall asleep, I play it on the couch on the weekends while my new baby naps, and I even took my Steam Deck on two recent business trips just so I could sneak in some sessions when I had spare time.</p><p>There’s one more way <em>Metaphor</em> is like the <em>Persona</em> series: <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/heres-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-beat-metaphor-refantazio#:~:text=How%20Long%20Does%20It%20Take,ll%20add%20even%20more%20playtime.&amp;text=Metaphor%3A%20Refantazio%20is%20a%20lengthy,looking%20to%20mainline%20the%20story.">it’s absolutely massive</a>. But a game that’s dozens of hours long is a lot more manageable when you can play whenever and wherever you want.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Paradox Interactive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">delayed</a> jail management simulator Prison Architect 2 indefinitely this August, commenting at the time that the game had notable performance issues, and that its system-led design was proving tricky to tinker with. This came a couple of months after the Crusader Kings publisher washed their hands of the sequel's original developers, Double Eleven.</p>
<p>Speaking to me at Paradox's Media Day last week, deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja offered a shade more insight on the decision, suggesting that hard-up players have "higher expectations" at present and are less trusting that developers will fix problems. Chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeus also offered thoughts on what Paradox have learned from the disastrous launch of Cities: Skylines 2 in late 2023. Specifically, he said they need to give actual players access to the game early on, not just testers.</p><!--more-->
<p>"We're pretty confident that the gameplay is good," Lilja said of Prison Architect 2. "But we had quality issues, which means to give the players the game they deserve, we decided to delay it. So it's not the same kind of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-ceo-admits-company-made-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-in-wake-of-life-by-yous-cancellation">bucket of challenges that we had with Life By You</a>, which led to cancellation. It's more that we haven't been able to keep the pace that we wanted. But when we do peer reviews of the game and user testing and whatnot, people give us feedback, we actually get pretty good feedback, except for certain issues that we need to fix. Some of them are harder to fix than we thought." </p>
<p>Which issues, specifically, are Prison Architect 2's new developers Kokku having trouble with, I asked? "It's mostly certain technical issues rather than design," Lilja went on. "It's more how can we make this technically high-quality enough for a stable release." But there's also a degree of wider calculation, he added, based on Paradox's sense of how tolerant players currently are of imperfections even in early access releases.</p><p>"It's also based on the fact that we, in all transparency, see that fans right now, with a squeezed budget for games, have higher expectations, and are less accepting that you will fix things over time," Lilja said. "That's our take. The gaming space has always been the winner-takes-all type of environment. A few games bring in most of the players, and most games are dropped quite quickly, and this is even more pronounced now, [during] maybe the last two years. That's at least what we read from our games, and also from from others in the market."</p>
<p>These are obviously quite hazy characterisations, but there are a couple of specific reference points. One is obviously Cities: Skylines 2, which launched with performance issues so severe the developers, Colossal Order, decided to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-wont-get-paid-dlc-until-its-problem-issues-are-sorted-devs-say">postpone release of the game's first paid DLC</a>. While the base performance problems <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">seem to have been largely addressed</a>, certain DLC packs have been criticised as rushed and insubstantial, prompting Paradox and Colossal Order to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">issue a joint apology and propose a fan feedback summit</a>. </p>

</figure>
<p>"Cities 2, the experience there - we knew we would have some issues, like in every release," Lilja acknowledged. "We had more of that than we hoped. Some of those were definitely things we should have caught. But also The Lamplighter's League, which reviewed quite well, but did not attract a following that made it sustainable." Paradox's sense that audiences are choosier and more sensitive also comes from "talking to others in the business, and seeing how their games perform," he went on.</p><p>I'm always interested in how perceptions of technical shoddiness differ between players - one person's frame-rate hiccup is another person's reason to refund. Are there any particular types of technical issue that people are currently more sensitive to, I asked? </p>
<p>"It's not new issues," Lilja said. "People should have high expectations. It's just that in order to be certain, we should make sure that we have checked and double-checked. Some of the issues, I would argue, that we had in Cities 2, were some issues that we had not really understood fully, and that's that's totally on us."</p>
<p>When I spoke to him separately, Fåhraeus admitted that Paradox knew that Cities: Skyline 2's performance needed improvement - they just miscalculated how much players would care. "We were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players - how serious the player perception would be," he said. "So I think one learning with Cities 2 is if we could have brought players in to try it on a larger scale, that would have helped. Going forward, we need to have this communication with players and openness to a larger degree, and quite early if possible."</p>
<p>Paradox could go about this in a variety of ways, Fåhraeus went on. "[Our community blog series] Tinto Talks is one way of communicating with players even before release. But there's also of course, closed beta tests and having dedicated enthusiasts in even earlier, under NDA, to help us identify issues. Not just identify issues, but also, what is your feeling when you're playing the game?</p>
<p>"We do use these tools and we've used them in the past, but maybe we've gotten a little worse at it lately, and we need to get back to that sort of openness with players," he conceded.</p>
<p>This sounds to me a bit like Paradox are trying to outsource some of their testing to players. Couldn't Paradox improve the technical robustness of their games by expanding their in-house testing and QA team, I asked? </p>
<p>"Depends on what we're trying to fix," Fåhraeus said. "QA is great at finding specific bugs. It doesn't work so well with the player experience of a feature - what are the pains with accomplishing your goals. We also have user research tests, we're bringing players in to try games, and see how they feel, see how they react. That's another great tool at our disposal. But at some point, you need to have a quantity of players, to really capture all the issues."</p><p>I'm interested to know whether you - yes, you! - think people in general have less patience for bugs at this stage. I'm not sure there's anything in it, myself, but I will say that it's never been easier for people to record, share and make a big stink out of a game's technical troubles. I'm also interested to know whether you think Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-still-want-to-make-a-sims-competitor-after-life-by-you-but-we-need-to-start-smaller">should make another Sims-style life sim</a>, after nuking Life By You, and whether you have any hope at present for vaporous action-RPG Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">are now gingerly describing as "a spiritual successor, not an actual same blueprint type of game".</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2019, Capcom released the remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a>, which took the classic PS1-era survival-horror title to new heights. Now, five years later, iPhone, iPad, and Mac users will finally get their chance to play Resident Evil 2 on their chosen devices.</p><p>Resident Evil 2's remake was largely faithful to the story of the original title, while modernizing other aspects of the gameplay including the over-the-shoulder third-person perspective of the player's character. There are two intersecting narratives following Claire Redfield--the sister of RE 1 hero Chris Redfield--and a rookie cop named Leon S. Kennedy as they try to survive a zombie outbreak in Raccoon City. One of the primary innovations of the remake was Mr. X, a nearly invulnerable genetic monster who relentlessly pursues the player's character throughout the game.</p><p>This isn't the first RE title to make it on to Apple's devices. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/" data-ref-id="1900-6417672">Resident Evil: Village</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/1900-6416603/" data-ref-id="1900-6416603">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">Resident Evil 4</a> remake have also been ported over. In fact, RE4's remake and Village are both more recent titles than RE2's remake.</p><p>The prologue for Resident Evil 2 can be downloaded for free on Apple's <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/resident-evil-2/id1640632432" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store</a>. But gamers who want to experience the full game on Apple's platforms are going to have to wait until later this year to dive into one of the best Resident Evil games.</p>

<p>FIFAe World Cup 2024 is almost upon its, and it seems that FIFA will feature Konami’s eFootball in the competition.</p>



<p>There will be two eFootball competitions at the FIFAe World Cup 2024: a 2v2 competition for consoles and a 1v1 competition for the mobile category. The competition will feature participants from 18 countries across the globe. Interested players can join the qualifiers, which begin today. Additional details are accessible on Konami’s <a href="https://e-football.konami.net/fifae_world_cup/2024/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>.</p>



<p>The FIFAe World Cup is the official esports competition hosted by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association). Until 2023, EA’s FIFA game series was the main attraction of the competition. However, both organizations ended their partnership <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-officially-unveils-ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>, leading to Konami’s eFootball taking EA’s place at the FIFAe World Cup in 2024.</p>

<p>Konami could potentially be replaced too at the FIFAe World Cup once FIFA creates its own football simulation game. FIFA’s President, Gianni Infantino, has already announced they are collaborating with new partners to develop <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fifa-president-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new ‘e-game’ under the FIFA brand</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-developers-arent-afraid-of-potential-fifa-2k-competition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two Interactive’s 2K Sports</a> could likely be the chosen partner.</p>

			<p>The Demon's Souls remake developed by Bluepoint is still today one of the best-looking games on PlayStation 5, and it reportedly looks substantially better on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently had the chance to check out the game running on Sony's soon-to-be-released mid-generation system. They revealed that it features a new Pro display mode that runs at what seems like 4K resolution and 60 FPS. The image looks very detailed but a little soft, but it's not clear if this is due to PSSR upscaling or anything else, as Digital Foundry could not confirm any details regarding the resolution.</p>
<p>What was confirmed, however, is that Demon's Souls on PlayStation 5 Pro features a new visual feature, a new contact shadow system. This system is similar to the screen space shadows system employed on base PlayStation 5, which is mostly noticeable in areas with rocks, but shows more fine shadow details that look quite good. Despite the lack of anything else, which is unsurprising considering the game will be four years old at the time the PS5 Pro launches, Digital Foundry has no doubt that Demon's Souls looks substantially better on the upcoming console.</p>

<p>Shattered Space launched last week to a lukewarm reception from fans and critics alike. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Eurogamer's Shattered Space review</a> described it as "one of Starfield's most enjoyable storylines to date" but that the experience "once again struggles to offer any real consequences".</p>
<p>Pagliarulo received ire from Starfield's community for his responses in a recent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/it-might-not-be-everyones-cup-of-tea-but-what-is-as-starfield-shattered-space-launches-bethesda-reflects-on-the-importance-of-players-speaking-their-mind/">Games Radar</a>  interview in which he described Starfield as "in a lot of ways, the best game we've ever made", despite its poor critical reception. Fans felt his words were disingenuous and out of touch with the community.</p>

<p>"It reads as if you and the team are patting yourselves on the head," a fan wrote in a lengthy thread on X directed at Pagliarulo.  "It's a pat on the head that based on reviews may not be warranted."</p>
<p>Pagliarulo responded with his own lengthy thread, saying he did not enjoy "leaving fans hanging".</p>
<p>"As the design director, sometimes I'm asked or instructed to do interviews. I was happy to do that, to represent the designers and the studio. Seeing how hard and passionately they worked on Shattered Space, they deserved nothing less," he said.</p>
<p>However, he acknowledged that his own "optimism is in no way meant to be mud in the eye of any dissatisfied fan".</p>
<p>He continued: "I'm also very proud of Shattered Space. We all are. Most of the quests and levels were done by designers who have worked on previous Bethesda games and DLCs, going all the way back to Morrowind. They're good at what they do, and it shows.</p><p>"Maybe it's a game of expectations. Fans want a lot, and we do all we can to accommodate them. Here's what I can tell you - nobody, and I mean nobody, at Bethesda is patting themselves on the back while ignoring our players."</p> <div>

<p>Pagliarulo also acknowledged, in addition to delivering Shattered Space, Bethesda has "spent a lot of time this year addressing community concerns and making fixes". He added: "We'll continue to do so, and will be listening to our fans every step of the way. We make these games for all of you."</p>
<p>He concluded: "I love games. I love Bethesda's games. I've been playing them since the Terminator days. All I or anyone here wants to do is make those games... and then make them better. No ego. No arrogance. Just a lot of hard work, and appreciation of our fans."</p>
<p>Regardless of thoughts on Shattered Space, it's a welcome exchange from Pagliarulo who noted "I think a bridge to the devs is important".</p>
<p>Previously he commented on timeline controversies from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> TV show, posting a "helpful little Fallout timeline" including both the TV show and all the games after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-developer-responds-as-fallout-fans-say-tv-show-contradicts-canon">fans complained the show contradicted canon</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An Italian-language only quirk with Bloober Team’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> almost spoiled the entire plot for fans playing in that language, but was fortunately caught in time for the day one patch to make changes. As spotted by<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/silent-hill-2-got-an-emergency-patch-after-a-huge-translation-mistake-spoiled-the-whole-game-for-italians/"> PC Gamer</a>, some garbled lines the player hears upon first picking up the game’s radio weren’t quite garbled enough in the Italian subtitles, accidentally dropping a massive plot spoiler in the first half hour. <strong>Stop reading now if you’re still playing</strong>, obviously. Here’s a video of a cat that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ARur1qpJZyc?feature=share">sounds like he’s saying “bongiorno”</a> you can watch instead.</p>

<p>Right, spoilers. When James “no time to check trunk, must find wife” Sunderland first finds the radio that pre-warns him of every jumpscare, rendering the whole game a dogshit attempt at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> (this is absolutely a joke, please do not send my nan death threats), he’ll receive a deliberately incomprehensible call from his wife Mary. The Italian subtitles spelled out Mary’s call in full, including one where she asks James why he killed her. As detailed in this<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fvw2op/update_version_1003000/"> Reddit thread</a>, the error was originally picked up by folk playing the game early, who reported it to Bloober.</p>
<p>“Ahah esatto siamo riusciti a far patchare un gioco perché spoilera tutto nei primi dieci minuti. Ci manca solo una bella montatura politica stile rule of rose,” wrote one Reddit user, which I believe is Italian for “please remake <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_Rose">Rule Of Rose</a> next.” I agree!</p><p>“A good-looking and unflinchingly loyal remake of the beloved 2001 horror game, yet one that plays everything safe,” wrote Brendy in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">his review</a>. “The longer I spent in James' personal hellscape, the more I could accept it as the video game equivalent of Alisdair Gray's Lanark, but I also don't have the patience to analyse every detail within its 16 to 20-hour story, as some will. And ultimately, I can't help but feel underwhelmed by how much its sacred history has chained this remake down.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But don't get too excited yet, it's just for esports.</p><p>Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer series had for years tussled with EA Sports’ all-conquering FIFA series before <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/efootball-2024"><u>finally pivoting to the free-to-play eFootball</u></a>. EA has largely cornered the market, locking up the rights to the Premier League, La Liga, and other popular leagues, with Konami left fighting for scraps.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-fifa-split-reasons"><u>EA dropped the FIFA license in 2022</u></a> amid reports that the organization, which serves as the governing body for the various national associations around the world, had asked for more than $1 billion per four-year World Cup cycle. EA rebranded the series as EA Sports FC in 2023 with relatively few changes. Since then there has been speculation that Take-Two, with its 2K Games label, might take on the FIFA license, but in August Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-2k-fifa-games-ea-sports-fc-25">any potential competitor to EA Sports FC would face numerous complications</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/10/fifa-konami-1728551107301.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Koji Kobayashi, Senior Executive Officer, Konami Digital Entertainment Co., Ltd, and Romy Gai, Chief Business Officer at FIFA.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Now, we have the Konami and FIFA collaboration, which will see eFootball used for this year's FIFAe World Cup on both console and mobile (EA Sports' FIFA games were used in previous years). It should be noted that this is not an agreement for Konami to take on the FIFA video game series, or rebrand eFootball to FIFA, but it’s a notable shift in the ever-evolving dynamic between video game makers and those who hold the keys to real world football.</p><p>Clearly, EA will be watching developments with great interest. In July, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fc-25-developers-say-they-welcome-a-true-competitor-with-a-new-fifa-waiting-in-the-wings">EA Sports welcomed the potential for genuine competition in the football video game space</a> amid rumors of a new FIFA game entering the market.</p><p>In May, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed a new FIFA game was in the works, saying: “We will develop a new e-game, because (the) football simulation game is called FIFA. For hundreds of millions of children around the world, when they play (a) football simulation game, they play FIFA. It cannot be named something else.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We are developing with new partners a new game which obviously, as everything we do, will be the best. So get ready for the new FIFA e-game.”</p><p>If 2K does take on FIFA, perhaps it will relaunch as FIFA 2K, similar to 2K’s already successful annualized sports games such as NBA 2K. If it goes with Konami, maybe eFIFA? Pro Evolution FIFA? Or, perhaps more likely, the simple return of FIFA with the year popped on the end.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-review.1005810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/until-dawn-2024-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> is a classic tale of a cast of young beautiful characters getting killed off in horrifically gory ways by something lurking in the woods. It’s a modern horror game classic, packed full of twists and red herrings, and if you have not played the game in it’s original incarnation then you are in for a treat. With the PS4 original still very playable on PS5, you might be wondering what this remake brings to the table after less than a decade.</p>
<p><iframe title="Until Dawn - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nApBGPy0ao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The characters are tropes of the genre with the jock, the nerd, the bitch and – thanks to the Hayden Panettiere’s casting –&nbsp; the cheerleader, all present. You get to play as all of the characters at various points throughout the game and make decisions that radiate out in a Butterfly Effect: What seems a simple decision may have a drastic impact later on, so much so that you might not even get to play large sections of the game if you manage to kill off a character early in the story.</p>


<p>Like all the ‘best’ horror movies the cast can be incredibly stupid and act in completely irrational ways. After screamed conversation about how no-one should go outside due to the murderous things roaming around, a character will then decide they must go, unarmed, into the heart of danger. Two minutes later the rest of cast, who were hysterical just moments ago, trot off happily to follow them. After a good half an hour of terror, a character in the second group chirps “I’ll take it from here the rest of you can go back” and off they trot. It makes no sense whatsoever and while the ‘stupid but beautiful people’ trope is clearly being played on, in 2024 it does just feel like bad writing. I also noticed that Hayden Panttiere’s character takes the longest bath ever. Girl, I know you got to look beautiful, but over two hours soaking in the tub while your friends are being diced in to bits is just not on!</p>


<p>The core gameplay will be very familiar to anyone who has played Supermassive’s original or any of the more recent entries in The Dark Pictures Anthology or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/the-quarry-review-ps5-xbox-ps4-pc/">The Quarry</a>. Fairly lengthy cutscenes are followed by a period of exploration in which you can find clues to the story, with moments of action or horror liberally sprinkled throughout the 6-8 hour play time. The action scenes take the form of quick time events whilst the horror and stealth sections require you to hold the DualSense controller completely still, mimicking your character’s on screen predicament – if you move, they die. Both of these elements work even better than they did on PS4 thanks to haptic feedback, the controller shaking to your heartbeat as you try and stay still.</p>
<p>It is fair to say that there is a lot of walking around, but we are now way past ‘walking simulators’ being a derogatory term. The genre has established itself fully and Until Dawn remains one of the best with plenty of dialogue which add to the story as you trudge through the snow, the game gradually ramping up the tension.</p>
<p>If you did not know that Supermassive created Until Dawn back in 2015 then you would be forgiven for thinking that Until Dawn is a brand new game. It’s not labelled as a remaster or a remake, it’s just ‘Until Dawn’ with Supermassive only acknowledged at the end of a very, very long credit sequence in which everyone and their dog is mentioned before the people who actually created the original title. With Sony treating this is a brand new title, and it being a full remake in Unreal Engine, there is also means there’s no upgrade path, dyou can’t pay a tenner like you can do with Horizon Zero Dawn and get the shiny new version.</p>

<p>That’s not to say Ballistic Moon haven’t done a lot of work to enhance PS4 version. Obviously the biggest improvement is with graphics with the game teetering on the edge of being photorealistic in some places thanks to it being ported to Unreal Engine 5. Facial animations have been improved and subtly tweaked, the lighting is now more realistic – outside of the game starting at dusk, when it’s 9PM in the middle of winter – and the fixed ‘Resident Evil’ style camera has been ditched for a new third person view which allows you to move more freely through the environments and hunt out the collectables more easily.</p>
<p>There’s also a brand new score, reworked sound effects and the original songs have been replaced with more modern pop tracks, a couple of which are complete bops. According to Sony “We’ve endeavoured to keep the fantastic narrative integratory of the original, but we have seized the opportunity to expand upon unexplored emotional parts of the story,” which may be the case, but given the branching narrative of the game it’s hard to spot what is new and what you just didn’t see first time around.</p>
<p>The prologue is the most obvious change. Its now longer and the prank that kicks off the whole story has been reworked so it has more heft and emotional impact. There are also two new scenes at the end of the game which, in true horror movie tradition, tease that the story may not be over.</p>
<p>The many improvements to the game do&nbsp; highlight areas that have not been brought up to date. My main gripe is that characters can still only walk in circles, you cannot sidestep, and this means you do feel like you are controlling a vehicle rather than person. The animation of the character faces have been improved, but nothing has been done to the hair, Ashley’s long locks are resolutely stuck to the sides of her jacket and stretch in comically distracting ways when she turns her head.</p>
<p>There are also a smattering of bugs and glitches, like FMV cinematics juddering in the game’s intro, which definitely needs a patch.</p>

			<p>After several positive Starfield updates that improved performance and introduced various features and bug fixes, Bethesda was hoping to further renew interest in the game with the release of the first expansion, Shattered Space. However, its reception was mixed. In our 6/10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield: Shattered Space expansion offers an engaging new story but adds little beyond that. Fans of the game's universe will appreciate spending more time in it and discovering a faction more complex than it appeared in the base game, but those who didn't enjoy Starfield or were primarily interested in its space exploration mechanics won't change their opinion with the expansion, as it doesn't address the vast majority of the issues that still plague the experience.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda Design Director Emil Pagliarulo has now <a href="https://x.com/Dezinuh/status/1843658963344339300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">engaged</a> in an X conversation to proclaim the team's faith in Shattered Space while also pointing out that the studio is not at all ignoring the players' feedback.</p>
<p><em>I’m also very proud of Shattered Space. We all are. Most of the quests and levels were done by designers who have worked on previous Bethesda games and DLCs, going all the way back to Morrowind. They’re good at what they do, and it shows. If folks haven’t played Shattered Space and they like Starfield, I think they’re missing out. If folks have played Shattered Space and still don’t like it, that makes me sad, honestly. Just know that we’ve also been hearing from plenty of people who love it.</em></p>
<p><em>Maybe it’s a game of expectations. Fans want a lot, and we do all we can to accommodate them. Here’s what I can tell you – nobody, and I mean nobody, at Bethesda is patting themselves on the back while ignoring our players. In addition to Shattered Space, we’ve also spent a lot of time this year addressing community concerns and making fixes. We’ll continue to do so, and will be listening to our fans every step of the way. We make these games for all of you.</em></p>
<p><em>Starfield is a massive game, and it takes time for us to address things. We move as fast as we can, as safely as we can. Game development is always tricky, but with a game as big as Starfield, every fix could potentially break something else.</em></p>
<p>Bethesda has committed to long-term support for Starfield, so we'll see whether they will take into account the mixed reception of Shattered Space to do something different with the next expansion for the sci-fi roleplaying game.</p>

            <p>Coffee Stain Publishing have fully revealed Goat Simulator Remastered, a spruced-up take on 2014’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a>, ragdolling livestock sandbox with all of the original’s DLC included. I played a bit of this at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom</a> in August, and while the trailer below is proof positive that the remaster does indeed look newer and shinier, in the moment I couldn’t shake the idea from my memory banks that this was just how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/goat-simulator">Goat Sim</a> <em>always</em> looked.</p>

<p>I wonder if there’s a word for this, where years of beaming ever-more lavish visuals into your eyes tricks you into perceiving long-unplayed games as looking more modern than they did. Alice0 (RPS in peace) enjoyed how the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-lifes-raytracing-mod-is-great-because-it-makes-the-game-look-old-in-a-new-way">Half-Life: Ray Traced mod</a> made the game still look old but in a newer way; kind of like that, except the changes only exist in your head, and can't be downloaded from GitHub.</p>
<p>In any case, Goat Simulator Remastered is a modest do-over in terms of tech, and it’s uncharacteristically restrained in concept as well. From what I saw, it plays the whole remake thing straight, with no wink-wink-nudge-nudging about itself or the industry’s current love of reheated games in the same way that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> poked fun at sequels. Which could be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you get on with Goat Sim’s sense of humour.</p><p>Of course, there are parodies aplenty in the bundled DLCs, which among others include the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dayz">DayZ</a>-inspired GoatZ, the Mass Effect sendup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goat-simulator-space-expansion">Waste of Space</a>, and that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-2-goat-simulator-crossover-dlc">Goat Sim x Payday 2 crossover</a>, which actually does pull on the nostalgia strings quite well by harkening back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/payday-3s-launch-is-another-great-advert-for-not-making-your-game-always-online">when Payday was good</a>. And the remaster does make one big change, providing access to the Mutators menu – the comedy variables list that lets you play as a Giraffe or strap into a jetpack – at any time, rather than just at the level select screen. This turns missions, if you can call them that, into even more of a free-for-all, with your goat able to swap forms and abilities at will.</p>
<p>Goat Simulator Remastered is out on November 7th, via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It’ll be on Game Pass, too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Alarmo, Nintendo's new interactive alarm clock, is available now in the UK if you're a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber.
</p>
<p>
The gadget is priced £89.99 on these shores. Upon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">its surprise announcement yesterday</a>, Nintendo also announced a $99 price point for the US.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, to give the device its full name, is an interactive alarm designed to sit by your bedside. It includes alarm sounds and animations based around several top Nintendo franchises - including Mario, Zelda, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pikmin">Pikmin</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> - to wake you up in the morning. 
</p>
<p>
The interactivity comes from Alarmo's snazzy movement sensor, which can detect when you're beginning to get out of bed. When it detects this, you can expect to hear additional noises - such as Mario coin sounds - as if to cheer on your rise from slumber. 
</p>
<p>
Alarmo is set to become more widely available beginning in "mid-January 2025", Nintendo announced yesterday. For now, you'll need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to order one from Nintendo's online store.

			<p>Yesterday, Rare <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylreFrrXbOo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> Season 14 of Sea of Thieves, due to launch on October 17 across all platforms. The update will add several new interesting tools and features to play more stealthily.</p>
<p><em>In Season 14 we are introducing new ways to play stealthily, and that begins with crouching. When crouched,&nbsp; your pirate will make less noise as you sneak around and your nameplate will be hidden from enemy crews. Use this to your advantage and you might be able to get the drop on some unsuspecting scoundrels. Crouching also makes you less visible to the various enemies that roam the Sea of&nbsp; Thieves, so if you'd rather not bring attention to yourself, a bit of subtle sneaking might be your best option. But if you find yourself on the verge of being discovered, and things are looking a bit desperate, pirates who are crouching aboard a ship will also be able to fling themselves over the side and grab hold of the outer hull.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>With the new Merfruit enchanted snack, would-be scoundrels will have a window to avoid being rescued by friendly mermaids and also make themselves less conspicuous to enemies. Moreover, the new Season adds Disguises, allowing players to pretend to be a barrel or a piece of treasure in regular Sea of Thieves humor.</p>
<p>Season 14 also introduces the Blowpipe weapon, which definitely lends itself to stealthy attacks. Players can use various types of darts, from the Poison Dart to the Lure Dart and the Black Powder Dart. Moreover, Sea of Thieves fans will find a new type of throwable, Traps, which can be loaded with other throwables. On the other hand, other players might disarm the Trap and pocket them for their own use. Last but not least, the new Grapple Gun pulls the user towards wherever you've attached it, making it handy for exploration as well as boarding enemy ships. As with any new Season, Sea of Thieves users will find many new commendations and rewards and 100 levels of Plunder Pass.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Sea of Thieves is now available on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylreFrrXbOo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. It is possible the new Nintendo console will eventually get it, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playside-studios-on-kill-knight<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With Kill Knight, PlaySide Studios has stepped into the console (and PC) space with a compelling and challenging high score-chasing, twin-stick shooter. We already gave you<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kill-knight-hands-on-the-ultimate-twin-stick-action-game"> <u>our thoughts after extensive hands-on time with the game</u></a>, but we also spent a day at one of PlaySide Studios’ Melbourne offices, chatting with the team about their goals for the game and getting the inside track on how it changed over the course of development.</p><p>Here are some of the most interesting insights that Ryan McMahon (General Manager of PlaySide’s PC and Console Games Division) and Sean Gabriel (Lead Game Designer on Kill Knight) told us during our visit.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Eldritch Layer Pitch</h2><p><strong>Ryan McMahon: </strong>Kill Knight is an ultra-responsive, arcade-inspired isometric action shooter and, funnily enough, that is the one line pitch that [Lead Game Designer] Sean came into this with when we first started development. So that isn't our tagline [that] we're saying now; it’s straight from the original pitch before we started development and we've maintained that… throughout the entire development. It’s been that one liner that the team’s always come back to when we're trying to determine the art style… or we're talking about the music, or we're talking about how the game should feel to play. That's what Sean and his team have always brought things back to. Is this that arcadey feel that we want, or is it responsive enough? What's the frame rate? Staying true to all those goals is essentially what that line says about the game, and it's something that they set out as the vision from the very beginning.</p><p><strong>Sean Gabriel: </strong>You've got the one half [of the game], [where] it's an obvious power fantasy, right? It's one of those games where we want you to feel awesome – you're a badass guy, you're fighting demons, [it’s] a straight-up power fantasy... But then the other thing is through the lens of this game and this genre, and top-down in general, it’s dominated [by] Diablo, ARPGs, inventories, builds, all that sort of crazy knowledge stuff. Whereas… we wanted this to bring back that arcade [sensibility] of – we’re actually going to bombard you with all this stuff, and if you love the aesthetic enough, and we can draw you into this world and get you immersed. We’re going to bring you along on this journey to make you so good at the game that the power fantasy that you see? We’re going to get you there and, once you’re there, you just have that blending of the power fantasy and your actual skill. You can't really beat that in terms of that sense of accomplishment. That sense of, ‘Okay, I'm actually The Kill Knight; I'm doing this.’ If we had made the mechanics simpler or made it a bit too accessible in terms of the things you need to learn to get up there, you just wouldn't have that full connection. </p><p><strong>Ryan McMahon:</strong> It’s not a game where if I play more and grind more I get more XP, or I get more equipment that’s going to make me better at the game. The experience that you gain is you as a player getting more mastery of the game, and it’s very much a game that rewards mastery.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s very much a game that rewards mastery…</p></div><h2>Difficulty and Unlocks</h2><p><strong>Ryan McMahon: </strong>This game is all about… making the player feel powerful… and the way you do that is you make it very push-forward focused. So your player never stands still; you're constantly trying to build that momentum and maintain it. And when you get things right and you have that momentum, it feels super satisfying, so we're constantly… rewarding aggression, rewarding precision. The game has four distinct difficulty settings, so when we're talking about the game being hard, it doesn't have to be super hard. You can start on the lowest difficulty and work your way up and we reward the player for working their way up those difficulties by multiplying their score. </p><p><strong>Sean Gabriel: </strong>All of the equipment is gated around learning all the mechanics. So, keeping your [kill] streak high, utilising specific pieces of equipment in an interesting way, etcetera. The whole game is teaching you while you’re playing through, just wanting to unlock all the cool stuff… you have to trust the game. We're going to get you there and we do it in all these different ways.</p><p><strong>Ryan McMahon: </strong>Unlocking those weapons changes things a little bit. So if you unlock new pistols it changes the active reload response to those pistols as well. If you unlock a new heavy weapon it also changes the wrath blast that you get when you use that heavy weapon. If you get a new sword it changes the active reload you get when you use your sword on the active reload… all the mechanics stay the same but the reaction to those mechanics from the weapon you've chosen changes with it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>When you get to the end of the game there is a boss you fight, the Last Angel, and that is the ‘final’ encounter in the game. Once you defeat the Last Angel you unlock two things – Sever mode, which is a special mode where layers 1 to 5 are condensed into one super level, combining all five layers… Every single level has also been revisited in this mode... It’s intense the whole way through.</p><p>The second thing you unlock is a new difficulty mode called Sufferance. So if you really like suffering, which you probably do if you've made it to the end where you've beaten the boss, [you can] go back through all the levels and play on the hardest difficulty and then get an even higher score because that's the hardest difficulty you get.</p><p><strong>Sean Gabriel: </strong>Yeah, it can get pretty tough, but I think there is a yearning for games that demand a little bit more from you, and get you to come to them a bit. There's a yearning for that from gamers, and that's what we leveraged.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think there is a yearning for games that demand a little bit more from you, and get you to come to them a bit.</p></div><p>The cool thing about our difficulty modes too, is a lot of games… [they] just bloat the health [on enemies], you know, just to make it harder. But we had to find some creative ways to make it challenging, while also viable for the leaderboards, while also not breaking our mechanics and the timings that you’ve inherently learned after smashing your head against one layer for ages. [Increasing the difficulty] doesn't increase the health [of enemies]. It does increase things like their speed, spawn times, distances, damage [taken]... We have a couple of pieces of equipment that you have to get on the higher difficulties, which is interesting.</p><h2>An Alien Arcade Machine</h2><p><strong>Ryan McMahon: </strong>Atmosphere was a very big thing for making Kill Knight... and a lot of that is done through not just the visuals, but also the music, the audio-scape of the game, all those things coming together create the tone which is Kill Knight, which is intense, surreal, suppressive, oppressive, demanding, everything’s very overwhelming… </p><p>[Sean] did a whole brief at one point about it being an alien arcade machine. Imagine if we went to Mars and found an arcade machine – what game would we play? That was a whole thing the team was talking about for a while. But that atmosphere piece, even in the UI, how the UI glitches in, has that CRT monitor effect and everything. All those things are super intentional in creating that tone from the moment you boot up the game, that glitchy alien arcade sound effect when you boot up, it's put in front of you from the very start, the music that plays when you first boot up, the spawn effect when you jump in, the music that kicks off, the noises of the enemies as they first spawn, all those things are very intentional in setting up that tone.</p><p><strong>Sean Gabriel:</strong> It was probably about halfway through the project, there was an epiphany moment… we were aiming for this dark, brutal – it's like top-down Dark Souls… oppressive, angry, and then just where the project was moving, where the art style was moving, we were introducing more colours, as the game mechanics were coming up, we're like, ‘Okay, we need purple here, red here, blue here.’ And we started thinking, ‘...this needs to be more vibrant. This needs to be more alien. This needs to be more something that you look at and it looks fun…’ And that's that half-half [aspect], where it's half… this grim, dark, fully atmospheric thing but also – we're playing an alien arcade game. Let's live in that a bit. Let's have fun with that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The art style came… very quickly… ‘deep fried pixels’, [the team] call it. I reckon that's so awesome. And that brutalist serious architecture, with the deep fried pixels, with the almost jester-like character Kill Knight. It all started clicking together. </p><h2>Kill Knight’s Gameplay Evolution</h2><p><strong>Sean Gabriel: </strong>We originally started with [the idea] it was going to be a mostly melee game, and then we quickly learned that we wanted the tempo faster… and we had it pretty fast [already]. It was pretty fun – but [we] realised very quickly, maybe in the first month or two, that – wait a minute, no, we need guns. This needs to aesthetically be knights with guns. Because that's just inherently cool, inherently ridiculous, and that's just Kill Knight as an aesthetic. Cool and also ridiculous and immersive, and the guns increases the tempo… you can swap between shotgun and this and that and we bring in the melee as a utility, and you've got to start using the sword more because that's how you get your heavy weapon ammo back and other things like that. And so that was kind of the kernel of it. I don't want to say top-down Doom Eternal because it came from a rich history of ideas… [but that descriptor] isn’t a bad one, either.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We came to the layer stuff probably about halfway through the project, because initially it was going to be an adventurous exploration, speedrunning from end to end kind of game… like a dungeon run. We had this idea that you're exploring as you're fighting. But we realised that what we were doing was just making an arena that you were contained in, [then a] corridor, [then an] arena that you’re contained in, corridor, arena. We're basically building eight arenas and we have this Escher art style. And we have this ‘everything is shifting’ abyss… what if we just sort of stacked it, and then it shifts and then shifts again and shifts again? Do we even need you to have any downtime? And that was another big thing – we didn't want any downtime. We just wanted you to go, go, go and we felt that these like traversal points [created downtime, so]… what if we didn't have any of that as a problem? And we just stacked it on top of each other, how'd that feel? And that was a big epiphany, ‘Oh, we can just maintain the momentum the entire time.’</p><p>A very important part of the game was having no fluff – it's a fluffless game. Everything's important, everything's meaningful, you have to use everything. To be good at the game, you can and should have to use everything. That naturally led to being inspired by all these different games like Doom Eternal, Hyper Demon, where you’ve got that rhythm, you’ve got that flow state. All the mechanics have to flow into one another…</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A very important part of the game was having no fluff – it's a fluffless game.</p></div><h2>Kill Knight’s Equipment</h2><p><strong>Sean Gabriel:</strong> The really important pillar we had for equipment was we wanted no fluff, no nonsense… being an arcade game, being a score chasing game, we wanted every bit of equipment to be viable. Viable in terms of getting high scores. </p><p>Also, in terms of the equipment, we wanted to support a few different play styles, obviously. Are you more defensive plus back? Are you more aggressive plus forward? Are you a bit more tactical? Do you have the mental ability to manage different things and you want to do that? So we wanted to have allowances for that. We wanted allowances for mindless pure damage – plough through. We wanted to support all those things, but the big challenge was making everything viable.</p><p>But being a top-down game, we also wanted to have a bit of an expression of games that have come before us. So you’ve got your [Assault] Android [Cactus], you’ve got your Ruiner, you’ve even got Cannon Spike, which is this way old Dreamcast game, [plus] all these punch ’em ups. We wanted to pay tribute a bit to a lot of different games, and have this big spread of equipment to use, so a few of the weapons are just straight up homages to some different things that people might go, ‘Oh wait, that's from <em>that!’</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Active Reload System</h2><p><strong>Sean Gabriel:</strong> We were exploring equipment, we were exploring our depth of combat. Some things were landing, others weren't fully. And we just kept pushing on giving the player more things to do in the micro, rather than just the macro. I'll put it like this: whenever you pause the game, this could go in a bunch of different directions in the next one to two seconds in terms of the microdecision making. Do you dash out of the way and get a better position? Do you sword reload? Do you pistol reload? It was a real push to create that freeze frame depth. When I freeze the game, I want to be able to have a snapshot and go, ‘Whoa, how many different things can I do?’ Because that's kind of like playing these games in a nutshell, right? That's what your brain is doing every second. It's these microdecision making points. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It was a real push to create that freeze frame depth.</p></div><p>And that was really important to increase that combat depth. That [idea that] your run is different from my run; no run’s the same. And there's so much potential for skill expression. So that's where the active reload came from. We want[ed] that little bit of skill… that rhythm skill, but [also]... how can we build player expression into the active reload? And so you've got the three different reloads, but then even all the equipment have different things that they do. Then you can see that you’re hitting more of that depth again, and that combat player expression. We want you to be dancing as the Kill Knight. And that's all ticking the overall goal, which is immersion.</p><p>That level of immersion was really important to us because we knew we had a hard game. We wanted you to really feel that. And so it was intentional to have that immersive quality so that when the game gets challenging and when it's getting frustrating, you’re feeling, ‘Okay, I want to get right back in there.’ </p><h2>Layers of Lore</h2><p><strong>Ryan McMahon: </strong>You play as the Kill Knight… [a] knight who's been condemned to eternal sufferance, deep within the voids of an Eldritch arena set below Hell itself.</p><p><strong>Sean Gabriel:</strong> What's deep in the lore is [that] each layer's kind of like a psychological phase that the Kill Knight as a character is going through. You've got the stages of grief and you’ve got things like Dante's Inferno. And so we're thinking – okay, what's this step-by-step process that you as a character would be going through when you’ve basically been given this mission to save the world that is practically impossible? And also possibly you're the bad guy. And there is no escape. Humanity has pushed you into this thing and it's completely unfair and you don't want to do it, and you're very reluctant, but you've been here for years and years and years doing this. What are the psychological stages you’d go through? </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I won't get into it too much but we start with Solitude as the first layer because you have this sense of abandonment. You're alone in this new space. And then Entanglement. Now you’re entangled with the world and you’re stuck down here. This is characterised by thorns and even in the gameplay a lot of the things start slowing you down and trapping you a lot more. Traps start being introduced. And then you’ve got Viscera, which is this red, bloody zone… he’s sort of mentally cutting the idea that he’s ever going to have any life other than this… and then you’ve got Echelon and Reflection. </p><p>I really felt strongly [that we needed] to bake it with some themes that people that do get immersed in it have something to grab onto. We have no narrative or exposition... so there needs to be that textural undertone that you can grab onto. It was really important for all our artists too, for all the artists to have something tangible [to anchor them].</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We have no narrative or exposition... so there needs to be that textural undertone that you can grab onto.</p></div><h2>The Last Angel</h2><p><strong>Sean Gabriel: </strong>You're in this ‘end of humanity’ sort of cycle. You've got these characters called Kill Knights, which are essentially sentinels that the last of humanity’s training and power has been imbued into. This… was a very angelic world, deep in humanity’s past. But something happened – which we can explore at some point – all the angels betrayed humanity… [and now there’s] this abyssal keep where all these horrible creatures are coming out and destroying the earth again because all the angels have left and… there's no protection.</p><p>Kill Knight is out now on PC, PlayStation, Switch and Xbox.</p><p><em>Cam Shea is the former editor-in-chief of IGN AU, and now spends most of his time immersed in Australia’s craft beer scene.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There are 18 participating countries in this FIFAe World Cup including Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, England, France, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Morocco, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Thailand and Turkey. The countries have been picked using player demographics to determine who should participate. The qualifiers are made up of three rounds and use the Dream Team game mode. Round 1 is against the eFootball AI while round 2 will be a challenge event, and round 3 will have players face off to determine final rankings. Those who qualify after the rankings will take part in national events, with those successful going on to represent their nation at the FIFAe World Cup. Konami has clarified you have to have the nationality of the country you are representing. The full tournament details are found at <a href="https://e-football.konami.net/fifae_world_cup/2024/en/">FIFAe World Cup 2024™</a>.</p>
<p><span><em>“</em><em>We have continued to take on the challenge of developing football and e-sports. We are delighted to be able to contribute to the promotion of football in a new dimension through this collaboration with FIFAe. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to everyone at FIFA for giving me this opportunity. We can’t wait for the start of the FIFA World Cup. We are looking forward to conveying the enthusiasm, excitement and joy of eFootball players around the world to as many fans as possible through the FIFAe World Cup”,</em> said Konami’s Senior Managing Executive Officer Koji Kobayashi.</span></p>
<p><span><em>“We are very pleased to announce our collaboration with Konami. The new FIFA e World Cup fits perfectly with our mission to promote football around the world and give players a chance to showcase their skills. We strongly believe that the FIFA World Cup, which is open to all football fans, will be a success,”</em> Chief Business Officer of FIFA, Romy Gai said.</span></p>

<p>It definitely feels like we’re in a topsy turvy world, considering at one point Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer was the main rival of the FIFA games, before EA and FIFA split a couple of years ago, bringing an end to the EA FIFA games. EA has moved on using the FC moniker for its football games the last two years</p>

            <p>It’s always vaguely reassuring to see your own card mentioned by name in the recommended specs for a new release - even if that new release is just a slightly pomaded-up version of 14-year-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> console game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>. I could write a laborious metaphor about someone coming looking for me in a saloon using whatever that literary technique that Irvine Welsh does is called where you spell out the accents, but I won’t bother. I simply do not have another tarnation in me. Perhaps a root. Don’t even talk to me about a toot. Here’s the specs, as per the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/"> Steam</a> page.</p>

<p>The game itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-finally-reveal-red-dead-redemption-pc-port-for-october-2024-release-together-with-undead-nightmare">arrives on Steam on the 29th</a> of October, clearly angling for that Halloween real estate with its excellent expansion Undead Nightmare, which comes as part of the bundle. I don’t have a fun compilation video of bugs to share with you like Edwin did, although I do have the second best thing: I learned on a website full of cowboy slang that “acknowledge the corn” means to “admit the truth, to confess a lie, or acknowledge an obvious personal shortcoming.” I’m not even going to verify this, because I want it to be true quite badly.</p>
<p>Not sure why I wrote 'verify' there like I've got loads of cowboy mates I can ask.</p>
<p>If you’re yet to play the original RDR, it’s a breezier, less self-serious take on the Old West than its (also very good) sequel. I’m personally quite interested to see how it holds up, but I’ve got some good memories with it - particularly Undead Nightmare, which uses an evolving territory control mechanic that felt quite novel at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hours ago, we reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-getting-14-new-games-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the full suite of games</a> making their way to PlayStation Plus in October. There are 14 fantastic titles headed to the service, but one game stands out above the rest.</p>



<p>In April 2023, Dambuster Studios finally released Dead Island 2 after more than a decade of troubled development. It had become one of the most highly anticipated open-world zombie survival games ever made, and when it hit the market, it didn’t disappoint.</p>



<p>In October, you’ll be able to get it for free on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kept-you-waiting">Kept You Waiting</h2>



<p>It has been a year and a half since Dead Island 2 hit the market, and in that time, Dambuster Studios has pumped plenty of content into the game, including two major expansions.</p>



<p>This stellar open-world zombie slasher ticked over seven million players in May 2024, and in just a few days, another monumental content drop will hit the platform. On October 22, players will get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-horde-mode-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the ‘Neighbourhood Watch’ update</a>, which includes a horde mode and new game plus. </p>



<p>This patch will be free to take advantage of, and it lands at the perfect time for the game to be added to PlayStation Plus.</p>



<p>Before the game launched in April 2023, I was able to get exclusive access to the title and piece together my earliest impressions. From the moment I played the preview product, I was smitten with Dead Island 2. It’s a hilarious, gory romp that takes players through an immersive story that unfolds across a range of small sandbox environments.</p>



<p>It features returning characters from the series, a range of incredible weapons, and the freedom to become the kind of player you want to be.</p>



<p>Will you be downloading Dead Island 2 when it arrives on PS Plus this month? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turkey-and-russia-have-blocked-discord-leaving-gamers-to-seek-an-alternative.1005747/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/turkey-and-russia-ban-discord/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Turkey and Russia have moved to block access to Discord, the popular instant messaging platform used by millions of gamers worldwide. The platform reported it was launching an investigation into the outages in these regions, which suggests that the company wasn’t involved in the shutdown.</p>



<p>Turkey at least has explained why it has blocked Discord, but the reason is damning.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-severe-allegations">Severe Allegations</h2>



<p>Turkey has moved to block Discord, citing that the platform accommodates ‘crimes of child sexual abuse and obscenity’. This was a term thrown out against Discord in an Ankara court by Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc, per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/turkey-blocks-instant-messaging-platform-discord-2024-10-09/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a report from Reuters</a>.</p>



<p>It was further referenced that Discord’s privacy policies make it almost impossible for security operatives to examine the content being shared on the platform.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Security personnel cannot go through the content. We can only intervene when users complain to us about content shared there. Since Discord refuses to share its own information, including IP addresses and content, with our security units, we were forced to block access.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Russia recently banned Discord across the country because of the platform reportedly ‘violating Russian law’. It was stressed <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-blocks-instant-messaging-platform-discord-tass-reports-2024-10-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a recent communication</a> that Russian regulators had reached out to Discord to delete a string of ‘illegal items’ but the platform failed to comply, forcing Russian governing bodies to block access to the application.</p>



<p>For years, certain countries have toyed with Discord access, and some maintain a restricted service that might block various aspects of the application, such as VOIP functionality. In the past, countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have blocked voice communications, but a blanket ban on Discord rarely takes place.</p>



<p>Discord’s representatives have advised that an investigation is underway, but it’s unclear how long the service will be offline in these countries.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ea-fc-madden-nba-2k-recycled-dogshit<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I found myself playing a ton of sports games last month--it's the time of year most of them come out--and it has absolutely done me in.</p><p>I played some <em>Madden 25</em>, <em>NBA 2K25</em>, <em>EA Sports FC 25</em> and <em>eFootball</em>. All of these have things in common, shared horrors that overlap, season passes and packets of cards and menu screens that implore you to spend real money on both, like some venn diagram for the damned. But the predatory economics of these games are well-known, and quite frankly, I'm tired of talking about them.</p><p>What really struck me this year, playing through all four games together and so close to each other, is that I have fond memories of all four. <em>Madden 2002</em>, for example, was <em>incredible</em>, and gave me one of the most profound sports game experiences I have ever had, when I created myself as a QB in career mode, dropped back in the pocket for my first pass and heard the commentator actually say "Plunkett". I knew logically that he was just pulling the name from the disc because Jim Plunkett was included in the game as a classic QB, but still. In the early 2000s this felt like <em>witchcraft</em>, and was a big reason I spent hundreds of hours playing the game.</p><p>The <em>NBA 2K </em>series definitely hit a peak in the late 2010s. Not only did it play like a truly modern basketball game, it had genuine singleplayer aspirations, including a lavish (if also regularly embarrassing) storyline,<a href="https://aftermath.site/aston-villa-fifa-pes-pro-evo-efootball-avfc-ecl-champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> which as a guy who predominantly played offline</a> was really appreciated. <em>FIFA</em> and <em>PES</em> (as <em>eFootball</em> was previously known), meanwhile, have been with me for decades. <em>PES </em>was THE game for anyone into football in the 2000s, and <em>FIFA</em> had it bookended in the 90s and 2010s with its commitment to accessibility, flash and bombast.</p><p>In 2024, those memories of old games aren't as distant as I would have hoped.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FIFA 18 (PC) - Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ygkU4TW5e_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Take a look at FIFA 18 here, first released in 2017....</figcaption></figure></div><p>Not much has changed across all four games, despite all the years gone by. All four games were stale. Like I was playing something that looked new on the surface, but which was based on a set of underlying systems and <em>feel </em>that are years, and in some cases <em>decades </em>old. Sure, the intervening years have added flashier crowd visuals and better TV-like presentation, extra frames of animation and some bouncier collisions, but <em>Madden's </em>on-field experience--the weight of the game, the way runners bounce off blockers, the interactions between a receiver, a defensive back and a flying ball--aren't that different from 2002.</p><p>It's the same with <em>NBA 2K25</em>. The publisher can claim a "next-gen" version has been available for a few years now, but while I appreciate that some rough edges have been sanded off and the lighting looks lovely, my 2024 hoops experience is alarmingly similar to my 2014 experience. <em>EA Sports FC 25's</em> big-shouldered player models, slippery movement and sluggish ball physics can be traced back to the 2010s. <em>eFootball</em>, on life support since Konami practically gave up competing with EA a few years back, plays like I'm opening a time capsule buried in 2018.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="EA FC 25 | 4K Max Graphics | RTX 4090" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XyZGOouLxAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Now look at EA Sports FC 25, released in 2024. It's nicer, sure, but is it <em>seven years</em> nicer?</figcaption></figure></div><p>For the longest time "gamers" who didn't play (or didn't understand the appeal of) sports games have mocked the genre, saying "you're just paying for the same game with new rosters". And for the longest time, that simply wasn't true! If you played <em>FIFA 98</em>, <em>FIFA 2004</em> then <em>FIFA 2009</em> you would have been playing three vastly different games. The jump between <em>Madden 96</em> and <em>Madden 03</em> was immense. As consoles leapt from the 32 to 64-bit era and beyond, every few years and every new generation would bring what at the time felt like a revolutionary new way to play your favourite sports games.</p><p>Now, though,<a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we live in the age of diminishing returns</a>, and advances have slowed to a crawl, to the point where players can see and feel similarities in games that aren't just years apart, but decades. Part of this is down to the increasing costs and complexity of development, sure, but things are not helped by exclusivity deals robbing most of these games of their primary competition. I's no coincidence that <em>FIFA </em>and <em>Madden </em>had to be at their best when <em>PES</em> and <em>NFL 2K </em>were nipping at their heels, competition that has been all but removed thanks to EA signing deals with bodies like the NFL and Premier League.</p><p>The state of things is such that I find myself, once a victim of those "it's the same game every year!" taunts, now in the weird position where I'm still getting people saying that to me while I'm also joining in. I look at all four of the games I've just played and sigh heavily, not just at their dated gameplay but the way each of them is now increasingly overrun with casino-like microtransactions.</p><p>It's all such a huge bummer. These are some of the richest games in the world, released by some of the biggest publishers, with more resources than most other studios could even dream of. There's surely the talent and the horsepower to make something truly modern, a reimagining of what it means to play a sports video game on a contemporary console or PC. Yet, in a microcosm of tech's wider malaise, all EA and 2K seem to be interested in is releasing the same thing every year and just loading it up with more and more bullshit.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-playtesting-mystery-new-switch-online-feature-this-month-with-up-to-10k-people<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
In a moment of enigmatic revery, Nintendo has announced it'll be playtesting a mysterious new Switch Online feature later this month, and it's inviting up to 10,000 people to get involved.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo, never one to prioritise form over function, is calling this newly announced venture the Nintendo Switch Online: Playtest Program, and the only clue it's currently willing to share is that it's explicitly "related to a new feature for the Nintendo Switch Online service."
</p>
<p>
To that end, participants must have an active Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, and the playtest will require them to download "exclusive software" to their Switch console in order to take part.

<p>
To get in involved, participants must be at least 18 years of age and have a Nintendo Account registered in either Japan, the USA, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, or Spain. Sign-ups are due to open via <a href="https://playtest-p.nintendo.com/en-us">Nintendo's application form</a> on 10th October at 6pm PDT and will close on 15th October. The playtest itself runs from 23rd October to 5th November.
</p><p>
So what could it be? Something related to that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-unveiled-an-alarm-clock-that-plays-mario-coin-noises-when-you-roll-over">clock thing</a>? The long overdue relaunch of Miiverse? An update that magically transforms your console into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>? Pre-emptive legal action for whatever Nintendo fancies going after this week? Answers on a postcard below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-ps5-games-on-sale-october-prime-day-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Spider-Man 2, and more on sale.</h2></div><div><section><p>Alongside <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-deals-october-2024">Prime Big Deal Days</a>, other retailers, like Best Buy, are offering <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-amazon-prime-day-alternative-sales-october-2024">competing discounts and sales</a>. Today only, you can save on select PlayStation 5 video games at Best Buy, with some of the biggest games of the past few years available at a discount. </p><p>This includes major 2024 titles like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and even major PlayStation Studios games like Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a>. Since this sale is not exclusive to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-amazon-prime-cost">paid members like Prime Day</a>, you do not need to be a My Best Buy member to score these deals. If you're looking for other Best Buy gaming deals, be sure to check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-prime-day-counter-sale-xbox-series-x-deal">discounted Xbox Series X</a>.</p><h2>Popular PlayStation 5 Games Are on Sale at Best Buy</h2><p>We've collected the best video game deals at Best Buy today above, which includes mostly first-party PlayStation Studios titles and a few third-party games. With these discounts, you can opt to either ship the item to your house or pick it up in store. It's likely that these discounts will end as the Best Buy sale wraps up tonight, so make sure to pick up these games before midnight. You can also check out our larger list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-ps5-deals-october-2024">best PlayStation deals</a> happening for October Prime Day.</p><h2>Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h2><p>While these are solid deals, we do recommend that you wait for Black Friday for better prices if you can. Generally, Black Friday and Cyber Monday offer much better deals for video games than Prime Day, so you can expect to see the best discounts for the year there. Titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> just recently hit $49.99, but we do expect to see games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">Spider-Man 2</a> and God of War Ragnarok potentially hit all-time lows during Black Friday.</p><p>Additionally, dozens of more games will be available on sale during the event, so you can purchase items in bulk. These Best Buy deals are solid discounts and well worth the price, but keep in mind that prices will likely drop come November if you can wait. Black Friday is still the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">best time to buy video games</a>.<br>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-favorite-nintendo-switch-battery-case-is-at-its-lowest-price-for-october-prime-day.1005636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-battery-case-deals-amazon-prime-day-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The perfect Switch accessory.</h2></div><div><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/nintendo-switch-review">Nintendo Switch</a> is perfect if you're traveling on the go, as you can play games outside of your home with no issues. However, if you are out in public or in a remote location, you likely do not have access to power, and you can quickly run out of battery when playing games in handheld mode. While the Nintendo Switch has a limited battery capacity, you can extend this with a battery case. This is where the Newdery External Battery Station comes in. </p><p>For a limited time during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-deals-october-2024">Prime Big Deal Days</a>, you can save 20% off the Newdery External Battery Station. This deal is exclusive to Prime members, but you can sign up for a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-amazon-prime-cost">free trial</a> if you do not currently have an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-does-amazon-prime-cost">Amazon Prime membership</a>. This deal is set to end at midnight tonight as the sale comes to an end.</p><h2>The Newdery External Battery Station Is On Sale for Prime Day</h2><div catalogid="cb2b8bd1-c80a-4e97-bb54-01114005a15f" id="208816"><div id="208816" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>NEWDERRY External Battery Station for Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div><p>The Newdery External Battery Station is currently IGN's pick for the overall <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-battery-case">best battery case for Nintendo Switch</a>. This case provides a 10,000mAh battery in addition to the Switch's built-in battery, allowing for up to eight hours of additional playtime in handheld mode. This extra battery can make a huge difference, as you can play some games for up to 14 hours. </p><p>Beyond battery life, the Newdery External Battery Station is comfortable to hold. The grip behind the Joy-Con is extended, allowing all players to be comfortable during long play sessions. While some might find the Nintendo Switch uncomfortable, the Newdery External Battery Station alleviates that.</p><p>Additionally, the case features a built-in kickstand, which reveals a compartment to store extra game cartridges on the go. If you're someone who buys most of your games physically, this can allow you to bring up to three physical titles with you on the go without the need for a storage case. This is a great alternative to purchasing a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-portable-charger">power bank</a> <em>and</em> a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-case">Switch carrying case</a>.</p><h2>Is this Case Worth Buying at This Price?</h2><p>Overall, we absolutely recommend picking up the Newdery External Battery Station while it is 20% off. This is the <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B07T7111QW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest we've ever seen</a> the accessory on Amazon, and we do not expect to see any further discounts for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> or Cyber Monday. While both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-vs-black-friday-deals">Prime Day and Black Friday offer similar sales</a>, the October Prime Day often serves as a tease of Black Friday's offerings. You should plan to see a similar 20% discount during the major sales event next month.</p><h3>More Nintendo Switch Deals Today</h3></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 9, 2024 10:01 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
