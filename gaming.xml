            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/can-you-play-assassins-creed-in-any-order/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed</strong> is one of the most legendary franchises in gaming history, with a series stretching back over fifteen years. It’s an iconic, open-world collection that boasts ambitious adventures, immersive stories, and memorable characters. But, given that there are dozens of games in the series, we’re asking (and answering) an all-important question: ‘Can you play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed/">Assassin’s Creed</a> in any order?’</p>



<p>Some die-hard fans might have their ideal chronology, but in this guide, we’re looking on a more general scale. If you’re wondering what order to play Assassin’s Creed in, look no further than this guide.</p>



<p>Perhaps you can use it to get an idea of the size of the franchise ahead of the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on February 14.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-many-assassin-s-creed-games-are-there">How Many Assassin’s Creed Games Are There?</h2>



<p>It’s a rich and storied franchise that can be traced back to 2007. It’s a little-known fact, but <em>Assassin’s Creed’s</em> origins rest with <em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/prince-of-persia/">Prince of Persia</a></em>. It was later revealed that 2007’s <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> title, which kicked off the franchise, was an experiment, with the project being twisted from the failed development of a<em> Prince of Persia</em> game. </p>



<p>In total, there are <strong>13</strong> major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and several more spin-off titles that were typically released on handheld consoles and mobile devices. It’s a franchise that has taken players from Ancient Greece to Victorian London, and with each new release, the lore gets richer, deeper, and more immersive.</p>



<p>With that in mind, can you play<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in any order?</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-games-planned/">Ubisoft Has 11 Assassin’s Creed Games Planned</a></strong></h6>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-assassin-s-creed-in-any-order">Can You Play Assassin’s Creed in Any Order?</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically, no restrictions are blocking you from playing<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>in whatever order you so desire, but some barricades might make the experience a little confusing.</p>



<p>For instance, if you wanted to soak up the entire timeline in order of release, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> (2007) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage </em>(2023). But, if you wanted to play the series in chronological order, you’d start with <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> (2018) and end with <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> (2015). </p>



<p>With the most recent releases, Ubisoft pivoted to an RPG-based model, with each game more or less being a standalone title with only a few concepts and aspects connecting them. For instance, Assassin’s Creed Origins (2017), Assassin’s Creed Odyssey (2018), and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (2020) can all be experienced as standalone games but there is an underlying story that connects them.</p>



<p>It’s not as jarring an experience as if you were to play the older games as standalone titles, though. For example,<em> Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood</em> (2010) was a direct sequel to <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em> (2009). The former game starts in the exact scenes where the latter game ends, so if you’ve not played<em> Assassin’s Creed II</em>, <em>Brotherhood </em>will be disorienting until you’ve managed to catch up on the story.</p>

<h2 id="h-does-that-answer-your-question">Does That Answer Your Question?</h2>



<p>If you’ve been wondering what order to play<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> in, we hope that’s cleared things up. There are a few ways to soak up the franchise, but ultimately, it’s up to you in which order you play the games. Realistically, if you were to play them in order of release, you’d be neck-deep in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games for several hundred hours.</p>



<p>Perhaps it’s best to start with the most recent titles and track backwards if you want to learn about the origins of the series and what it all means. You can also skip some games if you don’t feel like they’d interest you. It’s your journey, after all. There might not be any one ‘best Assassin’s Creed order’.</p>

<p>It was almost ten years between Dead Island 2 being revealed and it being released – and fans are hoping that history doesn’t repeat itself. During the closing scenes of Dead Island 2, there are suggestions made that point to a follow-up title being delivered, but we need to dig into that idea to see the truth in it.</p>



<p>Is Dead Island 3 coming out? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-long-until-dead-island-3-is-released">How Long Until Dead Island 3 Is Released?</h2>



<p>Dambuster Studios, the developer that finally created Dead Island 2 in all its zombie-slaying glory, is reportedly ‘prepared for Dead Island 3.’ In <a href="https://gamerant.com/dead-island-2-release-sequel-threequel-when-dambuster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an interview with Game Rant</a>, one developer at the studio revealed that the team has ‘set the stage’ for an eventual release of Dead Island 3, given how the second game closes out. </p>



<p>It’s very open-ended – but don’t worry, I won’t spoil it here.</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the ending – and how it was laid out – would facilitate an expansive sequel, but is Dambuster Studios truly committed to delivering it? Are we going to have history repeat itself, seeing Dead Island 3 announced and then put on a back burner for ten years?</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Dead Island 2 suffered so greatly because it kept changing hands. If it stays with Dambuster Studios – which it should – then there’s almost no doubt that Dead Island 3 will come out at some point in the next few years.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was an overwhelming success, with many post-apocalyptic gamers being all too eager to get their hands on a game that they’d waited a decade for. It secured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">over one million sales</a> in a relatively short time – just a few days. It went on to remain successful, with Dambuster releasing a string of expansions and content drops that kept the player base fully engaged for many months to follow.</p>



<p>But what about a sequel?</p>



<p>Ultimately, to answer the question, ‘Is Dead Island 3 coming out,’ we’ll have to say that we honestly don’t know – but we can wait and hope that something is revealed in a year or two, perhaps. </p>

			<p>Infinity Nikki is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/">latest gacha game</a> to take the world by storm and is the perfect game for those who are fans of dress-up games and enjoy the platforming from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, as those elements feature very heavily in this game. For those who want to get stuck, the game is <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely free to play</a> and is available on PC, iOS, Android, and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>For those just getting stuck in it or those who have sunk a fair amount of time into it, there are some codes that you can use to give you access to free rewards. Of course, like any game that has redeemable codes, they will expire after some time. These are the current active codes for January 2025 in Infinity Nikki.</p>
<h2>All Active Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li>PEARFECTGUIDES - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>NIKKIXWEBTOON - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>INGIFT1205 - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some additional international codes that you can use. To be able to use them, we recommend copying and pasting them on a PC or mobile.</p>
<ul>
<li>ニキプレゼント1205 - 50 Shiny Bubbles and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>おめでとう - 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
<li>リリース - 10 Shining Particles and 15,000 Bling</li>

<li>インフィニキDISCORD&nbsp;- 50 Threads of Purity and 15,000 Bling</li>
</ul>
<h2>How To Redeem Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<p>To redeem Infinity Nikki codes, you need to have access to your Pear-Pal. You get this once you have met Dada Florawish Stylist's Guild. This is very early on in the story, so you'll find this area quickly. Once you've done that, there will be a gear icon below the Pear-Pal.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the Gear, and it will open the Settings menu.</li>
<li>Select 'Other'</li>
<li>There will be a Redeem Code box</li>
<li>Click on it and enter your code</li>
<li>Press 'Apply'</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as your code has been entered correctly, you will get the rewards from the code. It will give you a notification about the items you've been given for using the code. There may be a message telling you that the code is incorrect or expired. As we said earlier, the codes are time-sensitive, and it's possible that the codes have now expired, and you will no longer be able to get rewards for them. Check out the expired codes below to see if the one you tried to enter is on the list.</p>
<h2>Expired Infinity Nikki Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>NIKKI20241022 -&nbsp;</strong>10,000 Bling, 20 Threads of Purity and 5 Crystals</li>

			<p>2024, what a year. It has seen the utter decimation of thousands of jobs, the failures of countless "Triple-A" games and a few <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/skull-and-bones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Quadruple-A" games</a>, and a general downturn in the games industry. My favourite genres - strategy and simulation - haven't had a great year, with few marquee titles. Even the stalwart of the simulation genre, Football Manager, <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was delayed</a> in a move that made 2024 the break from the annual saga that started in 2003 (for the best, in my opinion) - and a number on my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most anticipated</a> list did not see a release, with one cancellation.</p>
<p>We can't be talking about games that haven't even come out yet; we need to be talking about Strategy and Simulation games that have been released, so let's dive into Wccftech's Best Strategy and Simulation Games of 2024. As always, games that aren't released cannot be used on this list, so there are no early-access titles, nor can remasters.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports &amp; Racing</a>.</em></p>

<h2>Homeworld 3 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Strategy (Real-Time Strategy).&nbsp; <strong>Platform:</strong> PC.</p>
<p>It's most certainly the biggest name on this list. Homeworld 3 is one I first got hands-on with back in 2022. It had a delay, but it finally got a release in 2024, which was successful. While there were a few issues at launch, Homeworld 3 was and is a great game that returns you to the world and gameplay of the classic titles.</p>
<p>Here's what I said in the summary of my review of Homeworld 3:</p>
<p><em>Homeworld 3 marks a successful return to a long-revered series. Bringing back the successful space strategy series, but improving the combat by a large amount with a more tactical approach, Blackbird Interactive has successfully made their mark. With exceptional tactical combat, made all the more important by the fact that everything carries over, and one bad mistake could cripple you much further down the line. The additional War Games mode only enhances this, making for a very engaging title.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9/10</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation.&nbsp; <strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation, Xbox.</p>
<p>Frostpunk 2 is a game I was very much looking forward to, being on my most anticipated list. When I got hands-on with it in previews, I was even more interested before I finally got to review it upon release. My summary back then was:</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is an excellent looking, excellent sounding, and great playing organic growth and succession from the original. Spreading further along the wasteland, you have to balance more as you deal with politics, resources, factions, and ever more challenges, often including settling and building in new areas. Still a challenge, but more approachable, this is yet another city builder that will shine out amongst others.</em></p>
<p>I stick by this. Frostpunk 2 is an excellent game that firmly expanded on the original while keeping what made it great. The move from the single core to creating districts made perfect sense. Expanding the world map elements, creating outposts, and more added a whole new level to the game. This is one I recommend and one I would argue is the best game of the year on this list.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Satisfactory (<a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</h2>
<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Simulation. <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Satisfactory is a monster of a game. Launching first into Early Access back when I was still cuddled up in my safety blanket, nestled with a nice bottle of lukewarm milk, the thirty-year-old me never knew that it would take five and a half years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fully release</a>, but even before release, it would sell 5.5 million copies.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, and it's well deserved. In a genre that rarely reaches such wide reaches, Satisfactory turned building a factory - albeit one on an alien planet where you also have to survive - into something millions wanted to buy and play and an average daily player base that would make most "AAA" games envious.</p>
<p>There's not much I can say about this game that you don't already know because you play it or you've looked and decided you aren't interested. The level of detail, as complex as it is, is made so easy to get into. The creativity is excellent. The gameplay is enjoyable and addictive. Satisfactory has it all, and its success reflects that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ara-History-Untold-Review-01-Header-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Ara: History Untold (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5/10</a>)</h2>

<p><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based Strategy (4x). <strong>Platform:</strong> PC</p>
<p>Ashes of the Singularity developer Oxide Games has finally produced another game after their debut title. While their first game is mostly remembered for being an early DirectX 12/Asynchronous Compute <a href="https://wccftech.com/ashes-of-the-singularity-escalation-updated-benchmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a>, Ara: History Untold, which Xbox Game Studios published, is very much focused on the gameplay experience. It's also turn-based, whereas Ashes was a real-time strategy game. Here's what I had to say about Ara in the review:</p>
<p><em>I must admit, when not writing this review, my brain kept saying, "I like this, but", and I'd decided that I was leaning towards around a score of six and a half, but putting everything on paper and playing more, I was wrong. Ara: History Untold is a genuinely good 4X strategy game, but it has its issues. If you like the genre, you will like this. If you want a 4X with even more added depth, this will tickle your pleasure zones. I fully intend to play it more.</em></p>
<h2>Community Poll</h2>
<p>Now that the shortlist has been announced, you can vote to determine the community's winner for this category!</p>

<h2>Strategy and Simulation Games in 2024, and Honourable Mentions</h2>
<p>I think it's been a slow year for Strategy and Simulation games. There have only been a few marquee titles in Homeworld 3 and Frostpunk 2, but nothing that could let 2024 compete with what is still arguably the best year for the genres in recent memory: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-strategy-games-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm only human, as we all are, so there are some good-looking strategy and simulation games that we haven't played due to time or any other reason. Some such titles are <a href="https://www.songsofconquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songs of Conquest</a>, <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Coaster 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ug1775.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultimate General: American Revolution</a>, and <a href="https://www.f1manager.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 Manager 2024</a>, to name a few. Still, of the others we have played, here are some noteworthy titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workers &amp; Resources: Soviet Republic (<a href="https://www.sovietrepublic.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Empires of the Undergrowth (<a href="https://eotugame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Diplomacy is Not an Option (<a href="https://www.door407.com/projects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (<a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Site</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>While this has been a slow year, thanks to delays and cancellations, there are positives to look forward to. Games in early access will emerge from it, and new games will be released - likely stalwarts of genres such as Total War and, of course, Football Manager. Roll on the games of 2025!</p>

<p>As Tom reported a little while back, we've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.</p>

<p>Now we have brand-new images of what's reported to be the new generation of Joy-Con controllers with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.</p>
<p>Reportedly originating from China, the Joy-Con shows off its new magnetic attachment as well as revised colour palette which differs from existing Joy-Cons.</p> <div>

<p>If the images are authentic - and right now, there is no proof - it looks like we can also expect enlarged SL and SR buttons, too, and maybe even a mouse-like optical sensor. You can check the photos out yourself in the X post above or in the subreddit thread embedded below:</p>

</span></p><p>If the images are not fake and do indeed originate from a Chinese factory that's manufacturing the new machines (apparently, the Joy-Con has a system serial number that is allegedly validated by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hua4lu/the_leaked_photo_of_the_switch_2_joycon_has_a/">Nintendo's Check Warranty page</a>), it seems increasingly unlikely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo will exceed its self-imposed deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor.</p>

            <p>As Amazon's phenomenal TV adaptation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a> begins filming its second series, Fallout co-creator Tim Cain has opened up on why he thinks violence sells when it comes to AAA games, particularly RPGs.</p>
<p>Over the New Year, Cain posted a video to YouTube about "why so many AAA RPGs expect and often require the player to do combat" and discussed "whether or not games treat [violence] as the default".</p>

<p>Acknowledging he's had "pushback on similar answers in the past", Cain then summarised his thoughts with: "The TL;DR of it is, companies make games - and, in general, products - that people will buy. That's it".</p>
<p>"It means games that sell the most - and I'm not even talking about review the best, just sell the most - will dictate future games.</p>
<p>"This is <em>obvious</em>. If you have a company and it's trying to make money and there's one game type that sells millions of copies and another one that sells a hundred thousand, which one are you going to do if they both take <em>just</em> as much time and money to develop? This is why I tell people to vote with their dollars," he added.</p>
<p>And people who do choose to vote with their wallets won't just be a "drop in the bucket", Cain insisted. If enough people did the same, "those drops become a storm and companies will listen".</p>
<p>"Action genres tend to sell very well, and by that I mean, action RPGs kinda outsell classic RPGs, even though both of them are violent," he added. "It's also easier to market those sorts of games. When you watch a trailer and you see people actually doing things - jumping, climbing, shooting, punching - it looks like: 'Whoa! Look at all the things you can do in that game' [...] It's hard to show the other things.</p><p>"How do we show that this game has a really good story? How do we show that it has fantastic dialogue? How do you do that in a trailer that may only be 15 or 30 seconds long?" Cain said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-co-creator-tim-cain-says-violence-will-be-the-default-in-aaa-rpgs-as-long-as-we-keep-buying-it-companies-dont-make-them-because-they-feel-like-it-they-make-them-because-they-sell/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"You have to reduce this wonderful narrative, that's super creative and nuanced that has a huge arc, down to a soundbite. And guess what? It's because most people won't watch more than a few seconds of something!"</p>

<p>Runners up were Dungeons and Degenerate Gamblers - described as a "beautifully synergistic and strategic deckbuilder", LocalThunk said "people mistakenly wrote this off as a Balatro clone, but this was announced before my game ever was" - Arco, Nova Drift, Ballionaire, and Wrong Organ's exceptional Mouthwashing.</p><p>"I didn't even know this was a horror game when I started playing it at 11pm one fateful night," the developer <a href="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1875284685150142820">said</a>.

But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New alleged pictures of the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con controller surfaced online today, providing a new look at the new version of the controller launching together with the system.</p>
<p>The new pictures, which were shared on the Nintendo Switch 2 subreddit by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SwordfishAgile3472</a>, showcase the controller's side and back, providing a new look at the simple color scheme and at some of the changes from the current controller, such as bigger shoulder buttons and more. While there is no way to know if the pictures showcase the real controller, it looks legit with its attention to detail and the presence of a serial number, which could put the leaker in some serious trouble with Nintendo.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hu3rte/new_joycon_photos_from_chinese_sns/">New Joy-con Photos from Chinese SNS</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/SwordfishAgile3472/">u/SwordfishAgile3472</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>2025 has barely begun, but we still managed to learn plenty of new things regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, even without an official announcement. A few days ago, pictures showcasing the system's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">motherboard</a> surfaced online, which were <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/">heavily scrutinized</a> in the attempt to determine the process node used for the T239 chip that powers the console. A patent filed by Nintendo earlier this week also seems to confirm the system will indeed support NVIDIA DLSS upscaling, as has been rumored for a good while.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-game-director-thought-remedy-should-aim-to-be-europes-naughty-dog/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alan Wake 2 Game Director Kyle Rowley was recently featured in an hour-long video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw0RByccsO4&amp;list=PLZeoUzft8lM_EjUOKaU4GvZDRGoWzfjgI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the Behind The Voice YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During the lengthy conversation, the industry veteran (Rowley started as a Q&amp;A tester on Black and White 2 twenty years ago, then worked as a designer on The Outsider, Homefront: The Revolution, and RuneScape before joining Remedy) revealed that he thought the Finnish studio should aim to be the European version of Naughty Dog.</p>
<p><em>When I came to Quantum Break, I was just excited about working on something that had... you know, one of my favorite games at the time was Uncharted, and I knew that we were going to do something that... I remember having a discussion with our lead animator at the time, and I was like, I think that we should be aiming to kind of be like the European version of Naughty Dog. Like, that would be cool if we could kind of get that same level of feel, and that was the type of game that I like to play, and so I was excited about working on it.</em></p>
<p>It's not at all a farfetched comparison. Both studios make action/adventure games with a highly cinematic flair. Of course, while both studios are highly acclaimed, Naughty Dog's games tend to sell a lot more - though to be fair, they also cost a lot more. For comparison, Naughty Dog's most recent game (The Last of Us Part II, which will soon <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PC</a> in its remastered version) cost $220 million, while Alan Wake 2 cost €70 million, according to Finnish analysts. However, Remedy is also used to make even cheaper games. Control famously only cost €30 million, and the initial budget for the upcoming sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was set at €50 million</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Naughty Dog is stepping a bit into Remedy's comfort zone with its new sci-fi IP, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which was just&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at The Game Awards 2024. On the other hand, Remedy appears to be following in Naughty Dog's footsteps when it comes to adapting its game IPs to live-action film/TV. Naughty Dog successfully did it (thanks to Sony, of course) with Uncharted and The Last of Us, while Remedy <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnered with Annapurna</a> to adapt Alan Wake 2 and Control.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-35-to-31/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-35-to-31.1074264/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/05/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-35-to-31/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Today, we’re rounding off the first 20 games in our Most Wanted of 2025 series, counting down from 35 to 31. There is a good mix of games in the list below from psychological horrors and the fate of some giant robots, to a fresh take on a belove musou franchise. Let’s dig in, shall we?</p>
<h2>35 – The Alters</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Q1 2025</em></p>
<p>What would it be like to live with yourself? It is a question you may have pondered? Would your copy be exactly like you, or look like you but have a different view of things. Enter The Alters, 11 Bit Studios new psychological survival horror in which that question is answered, though in a very stressful environment that will push anyone to their limits.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters | Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLXizxVIu6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You are Jan and Jan and Jan and Jan and, well you get the idea. Jan is a space builder trapped on an alien planet. He wants to get home but to do that he has to survive and restore his ship. It is a job he cannot do alone, but he can create Alters of himself. They are clones but with their own personalities, wants, needs, and stress points. If you don’t manage each individual’s needs or meet their expectations things will get tense, and the Jans will turn on each other. Probably not wise to say something like “Sure, Jan” sarcastically.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/the-alters-demo-pc-xbox-ps5/">The Alters demo</a> is available now.</p>
<h2>34 – Sleight of Hand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC, Game Pass – TBC</em></p>
<p>Sleight of Hand has one of the best descriptions going for it, with developer RiffRaff Games calling it a third-person card-slinging occult noir stealth sim. What more could you want? You are Lady Luck, an occult detective and former witch, who is taking on one last job. A job that has her meeting her past head on as she is tasked with going to Steeple City and bringing down her former coven.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sleight of Hand Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBHg3xKnYTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The card slinging element comes from one of the core game mechanics, which are Lady Luck’s cards. She has cards imbued with magical abilities that can be used for all sorts, like creating a smokescreen, use smoke based attacks, and set traps. There will be different cards to use, allowing you to customise your deck which in turn determines your playstyle? Will you favour stealth cards or more attack based cards. Sleight of Hand is coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S, and will be on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<h2>33 – Slay The Spire 2</h2>
<p><em>&nbsp;PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 has a lot of expectation behind it after the original was received so well. This is a sequel removing itself from any narrative connection to the first game by being set 1000 years later, introducing a new cast of slayers that are equipped with their own cards, as well as new archetypes to master.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Slay the Spire 2 - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ttVtllHkb4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Slay The Spire 2 will change on every run, and you will have to deal with the foes and challenges that are thrown in front of you with the cards you have. You will need to build and rebuild your decks until you have a set that can master some of the tougher challenges ahead. Slay The Spire 2 is planned for Steam Early Access early this year.</p>
<h2>32 – Transformers: Reactivate</h2>
<p><em>PC, Consoles – TBC</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/09/transformers-reactivate-pc-ps5-xbox/">Transformers: Reactivate was announced for consoles and PC</a>, at the tail end of 2022 during The Game Awards. The game is a 1-4 player action game. It was revealed through a cinematic trailer showing no Transformers in action, but from the point of view of what we assume are fallen Autobots, who have met their match against an enemy called The Legion. This is not about protecting Earth from an invasion, because it has fallen to The Legion already. Instead, it seems this is about resistance.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="TRANSFORMERS: REACTIVATE Official Announce Trailer | The Game Awards" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edBK2ZpYY_0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since the announcement of Transfomers Reactivate there have been precisely zero major updates. First the closed beta for 2023 did not take place, and the game is now being developed in Unreal Engine 5. Maybe, we’ll hear more in 2025 and get a surprise release?</p>
<h2>31 – Dynasty Warriors: Origins</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 17th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is a major refresh for the Dynasty Warriors series, taking it right back to its roots. Players are a nameless warrior that has lost his memories, and is thrust right into China’s Three Kingdom’s period. It is a time of war and strife with the events of the Yellow Turban Rebellion and the Battle of Chibi taking place.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins is not just about taking out thousands of enemies in a matter of minutes using loads of different combos and skills. There is also an RPG side to it. As you complete missions and tasks you will earn XP, which in turn translates to your character rising up the military ranks and earning new skills. You will also build bonds with other characters. There are a lot of new things that even veteran fans of the series will discover, and Dom wrote about them after spending four hours with Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</p>
<p>We went hands on with the game recently, ahead of the demo release, saying that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/">Dynasty Warriors Origins takes the series back to its roots to find its future</a>.</p>
<p><em>Another batch done, we’ll see you tomorrow for five more!</em></p>

<p>The esports industry continues to expand at an alarming pace, getting bigger each year with more games being added to the competitive collection. For a game to be considered ‘an esports game’, it simply needs to foster a competitive multiplayer environment – which means <strong>many </strong>games fit the bill.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re looking at every esports game coming out in 2025. Which are you most excited about?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-esports-games-coming-out-in-2025">All Esports Games Coming Out in 2025</h2>



<p>This list represents every esports game either confirmed to be or <strong>expected </strong>to be launching in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-deadlock">Deadlock</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Valve’s Deadlock is one of the most anticipated esports games out there. It was kept on the DL by Valve for the longest time until it could be contained no more. In 2024, it stormed the charts on Steam, presenting users with a fresh and exciting hero shooter environment that’ll be set to rival Overwatch and Marvel Rivals if it’s one of the esports games coming out in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Gears of War once fostered a solid esports ecosystem, but times changed. There are high expectations that E-Day, an all-new adventure set in the Gears of War universe and a prequel of sorts, will bring back Gears esports once and for all. We don’t know what that’ll look like, but it’ll be good to see if it has a competitive environment if it’s released in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fortnite-ballistic">Fortnite: Ballistic</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fortnite Ballistic is a first-person competitive shooter built in the heart of the Fortnite platform. It’s everything you know and love from Fortnite intertwined with traditional multiplayer elements from the likes of Counter-Strike and VALORANT. It’s everything you’d expect from an esports game, and it’s expected to release in full, graduating from early access, later in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fragpunk">FragPunk</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>FragPunk is a brand-new IP from Bad Guitar Studio. It’s a gaudy, colourful five-vs-five hero-based FPS with plenty to offer, and it has impressed users in beta testing. It’s set to be released on March 6, 2025, making it one of the first new esport games releasing in 2025. It has a unique ‘powerup card’ mechanic that keeps gameplay as fresh as possible, which is well-needed in today’s world.</p>



<h3 id="h-virtua-fighter-6">Virtua Fighter 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>At The Game Awards 2024, Sega unveiled ‘New Virtua Fighter Project’, which many have dubbed Virtua Fighter 6. It’s the first new game in the series in almost twenty years, and it’ll be a nice addition to the stacked FGC roster. It <strong>could </strong>launch in 2025, but it’s not at all guaranteed. Instead, keep an eye open for Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, a remaster of sorts of the last game, released in 2006.</p>



<h3 id="h-splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Splitgate 2 is expected to be one of the fastest-paced shooters on the market when it drops in 2025. It’s a high-octane, energetic shooter that uses portals to empower players to traverse the map in genius ways, but under the hood, it’s a typical multiplayer title with oodles of esports potential. </p>

<p>Fallout’s first season was released on Prime Video in April 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception. It single-handedly brought about a resurgence of the post-apocalyptic franchise, bringing millions of players into the series and flying high on the charts for weeks. It went on to win a slew of awards, but just as soon as it arrived, fans were hungry for a second season.</p>



<p>Will there be a season 2 of Fallout, and when will it be released? Let’s find out.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fallout-season-two-release-date">Fallout Season Two Release Date</h2>



<p>Shortly after the first season’s debut, it was announced that Fallout season two was greenlit. That means that it’s almost guaranteed to arrive, and not long after that announcement, the cast and crew started teasing that the second season was in production.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to today, and Fallout season two is well and truly being pieced together. The most recent leaks have revealed some set pieces being stood up to reflect locations in Fallout: New Vegas, a setting teased at the end of the first season.</p>



<p>There isn’t an official release date for Fallout season two yet, but we know it’s ahead of schedule. Fans are expecting it to return in October 2025 – or October 2026 if things are substantially delayed for some reason. This is because October is an important month in the Fallout universe and it makes sense that Bethesda and Amazon would pay tribute and show some fan service.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-will-fallout-season-two-be-about">What Will Fallout Season Two Be About?</h2>



<p>Warning – spoilers ahead.</p>



<p>At the end of the first season of Fallout, our trio of hero characters were all alive and well, with their paths into the second season of the show being mapped out ahead of them.</p>



<p>Lucy (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) are sticking together going into the second season, but Maximus (Aaron Moten) has returned to the Brotherhood of Steel after being crowned a victor. It’s believed by the Brotherhood that he killed Lee Moldaver, one of the show’s antagonists. That’s not true, but the belief will work wonders for Maximus.</p>



<p>We also saw Lucy’s father, Hank MacLean (Kyle MacLachlan), jet off in a suit of power armour to New Vegas after being revealed as the ‘big baddie’ of the Fallout TV universe.</p>



<p>There are several smaller storylines yet to be wrapped up or explored, such as the goings-on inside Vault 31, 32, and 33, and the activities of some of the more well-known factions across the Fallout world. We may also have look-back episodes that offer more insights into the early lore of the games, much like we had in the first season.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov is the most popular extraction shooter in the world, pitting players against each other and a slew of AI-based enemies across a series of maps under gruelling conditions. It has been on the market for almost a decade, but that doesn’t mean it’s not susceptible to a few glitches here and there – including network stability issues.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering one key question: ‘Is Escape from Tarkov down?’ Use this guide to find out about the Tarkov server status and whether Tarkov is offline right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-tarkov-down-answered">Is Tarkov Down? Answered</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov is almost always online only, which means if the Tarkov servers are down, you’ll be presented with error messages and the inability to load into a game. It can be pretty irritating, as Escape from Tarkov is a game that requires time, effort, and dedication – none of which can be applied if the Tarkov server status is in the red.</p>



<p>That said, this guide will help you figure out the answer to your question: ‘Are Tarkov servers down?’</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-check-tarkov-servers-status">How to Check Tarkov Servers Status</h3>



<p>The best way to find out about the state of Tarkov’s server status is to use the official status page, <a href="https://status.escapefromtarkov.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which can be found here</a>.</p>

</ul>



<p>There are also third-party tools that you can use to check on Tarkov’s servers:</p>

<h2 id="h-are-tarkov-servers-offline-now">Are Tarkov Servers Offline Now?</h2>



<p>I’ll keep this article updated as much as possible to help you out – I’m also a keen Escape from Tarkov player, so I’ll be tuned in to the latest disruptions as much as you will.</p>



<p><strong>From January 4 to January 5, Escape from Tarkov experienced server issues that took the game offline for players worldwide. The issue prevented players from loading into raids either as a PMC or a Scav, but Escape from Tarkov Arena remained unimpacted.</strong></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Minecraft Spiritual Sequel Teased by Markus ‘Notch’ Persson]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-%E2%80%98notch%E2%80%99-persson.1074024/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-spiritual-sequel-teased-by-markus-notch-persson/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few hours ago, a spiritual sequel to the best-selling game ever, Minecraft, was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> by creator Markus 'Notch' Persson. As you might recall, Persson left Mojang after selling the studio he created to Microsoft for $2.5 billion in September 2014. The following year, he founded another game development studio called Rubberbrain, which, however, never released a game.</p>
<p>Persson relaunched it in 2024 under the new name Bitshift Entertainment. On January 1, the game designer <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> openly about Bitshift's current project (a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon crawler) but also polled his fans to see if they'd rather him make a Minecraft spiritual successor. Which they did (78% voted for this option). Two days later, Persson shared the mindset behind this announcement:</p>
<p><em>I basically announced Minecraft 2. </em><em>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</em></p>
<p><em>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</em></p>
<p><em>My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for. </em><em>I intend for the money to be spent for good, but my god have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed.</em></p>
<p><em>Oh, and I also very much value being a man of my word, so I also intend to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about. </em><em>And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me.</em></p>
<p>When a fellow X user asked him if he'd really make Minecraft 2, he replied:</p>
<p><em>No, I'd make a similar game based on what I think the audience that says they want that game might enjoy. Probably do early access to make sure we're on track. </em><em>But I mean I still sort of think I'm just a clown getting lucky in a sea of actual talents, so I have no idea if it actually will be good. But I'll try.</em></p>
<p>Based on his track record, it would be no exaggeration to call him a one-trick pony, as Minecraft is his only real claim to fame in the game industry. Even if he does end up releasing such a game, it would inevitably be compared to his previous creation, which Mojang continuously updates for the legions of fans who still play it regularly.</p>
<p>The last content patch, The Garden Awakens, dropped in early December and added a new biome and a new mob. There are also plenty of spin-off games for those looking for different experiences, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/minecraft-dungeons-the-shallowest-depths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Dungeons</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-legends-will-release-on-consoles-and-pc-on-april-18/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Legends</a>. And A Minecraft Movie airs in theaters on April 4, 2025.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> fans think they've spotted a clue that the series' signature morality system may be making a comeback in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p>
<p>Whilst developer BioWare has confirmed nothing either way - which means we can only take this with a healthy bucket of salt for now - fans like X user Kalaelizabeth believe they've spotted a sneaky nod to Mass Effect's Paragon/Renegade system hiding in plain sight.</p>

<p>Take the post embedded below, which includes an <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1722012172166025591">official promotional image</a> of the next Mass Effect game that, at first glance, may not be telling us very much at all.</p>
<p>Look a little closer, though, and you can see why fans are drawing the conclusions they are. Regardless of whether or not you believe the image is sneakily acknowledging the morality system is making a return, it's a curious image for BioWare to have shared, especially when super-imposed by the iconic Paragon symbol:</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The flames of speculation have been further fanned by the post Kalaelizabeth was quoting.  BioWare project director and executive producer Michael Gamble recently commented on the series' long-held morality mechanic, acknowledging that although more players opted to be a Paragon - that is, a "good" Shepard - in the original trilogy, how you play is "meaningless" unless the ability to be "bad" also exists.</p>
<p>"Regarding Renegade and Paragon - yes, it’s true that more people played Paragon. But, it would have been meaningless if Renegade had not existed. The ability to choose is stronger than the number of people playing any option, IMO," Gamble tweeted (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mass-effect-5-paragon-renegade-options-return-not-confirmed/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>Does all of this mean Paragon/Renegade is "absolutely returning" for Mass Effect 5? Absolutely not. But it's arguably one of the best interpretations we've had yet as to why BioWare teased such an interesting image...</p>
<p>As for the eagerly-anticipated Mass Effect TV show? An adaptation was first touted back in 2021, when former BioWare lead writer Mac Walters explained various factors had contributed to the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-explains-why-the-mass-effect-movie-fell-by-the-wayside">shifting its initial vision of a movie adaptation toward something for the smaller screen</a>. Later that same year, reports surfaced claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-nearing-a-deal-for-mass-effect-tv-series">Amazon was "nearing a deal" for a Mass Effect TV series</a>, as part of its ongoing push into sci-fi and fantasy storytelling.</p><p>And now those reports have been confirmed. Variety revealed on the most recent N7 day - 7th November 2024 - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">a Mass Effect TV series is now officially in development at Amazon</a>, with 10 Cloverfield Lane and Fast &amp; Furious 9 (AKA F9: The Fast Saga) scribe Daniel Casey on writing and executive producer duties.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
