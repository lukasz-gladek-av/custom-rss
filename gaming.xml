          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>With the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s newest episode, Heresy, comes a brand-new way to earn loot. This time, players will be headed back to the Dreadnaught orbiting Saturn to hunt for secrets and special rewards in the Nether. Here's how it works and how players can earn rewards, including secret loot stashes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Limited revives, ammo and health regen</h2><p dir="ltr">Nether delves are different from other activities in that player groups will have limited revives and health regeneration is disabled, meaning that players do not have passive healing after being out of combat for several seconds. Instead, enemies will drop white orbs that give back health, and all other healing effects, such as Support Frame auto rifles, Warlock Healing Rifts, and the Void Devour buff can still take effect. Special and Heavy ammo drops are also significantly reduced in this activity and can only be affected by weapon perks, armor mods, and shooting destructible pots to find more ammo.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to complete objectives in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439535"></a><figcaption>A Tormentor boss in Destiny 2 channels some unknown power.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439535-destiny2heresy-netherboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When players first spawn into the Nether activity, they will notice objectives like "Destroy Weapon Systems" on the HUD. It's not immediately obvious what these are, but upon pulling out the Ghost, the HUD will show a diamond on-screen where the next objective is. Usually, these objectives will be guarded by a yellow-bar enemy with a name and a quick objective to complete around it.</p><p dir="ltr">Objectives can range from collecting pickups to defeating a miniboss, depending on which objectives were drawn for the run. They can be any of the following, or a combination of these:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Defend an objective by standing on plates or marked areas and defeating waves of incoming enemies that culminate in a miniboss.</li><li dir="ltr">Depositing relics that come from floating objects scattered around the room into a receptacle like a statue. These are marked on the HUD.</li><li dir="ltr">Popping large orange spores that glow. Typically, these are on walls and corners and they glow bright orange and pulsate. Players can deal damage to these with any weapon.</li><li dir="ltr">Defeating a large Tormentor boss protected by a small objective like destroying Taken Blights or picking up Resonance nodes.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Simply perform the objective and then collect Boons and loot at the end of each minor objective. When all three sub-objectives are complete, the boss will be vulnerable. The boss will usually consist of invincibility phases where players need to collect or destroy an object in the arena to make the boss vulnerable again. The Nether run will end upon defeating the boss, and loot will come from the last chest at the end.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find secret loot in the Nether</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4439536"></a><figcaption>A node of Fleeting Metastasized Essentia in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4439536-destiny2heresy-essentiapickup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are tons of small secrets scattered around the Nether, including hidden loot and special collectibles. There are chests hidden around the entire location in corners and secret rooms that can reward materials for the Tome of Want, a seasonal armor piece, or a seasonal weapon. Here is everything that can be earned in a chest in Act 1:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Any piece of Apostate’s Blade armor; Arms, chest, legs, or class item.</li><li dir="ltr">Adamantite, a Strand Support Frame auto rifle.</li><li dir="ltr">Psychopomp, an Area Denial Frame grenade launcher.</li><li dir="ltr">Abyssal Edge, a Wave Frame heavy sword.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are also Metastasized Essentia nodes, large black and white spiked orbs that can be picked up for materials for the Shaping Mirror in Eris' apartment in the H.E.L.M. When picked up, they are first seen as Fleeting Metastasized Essentia.</p><p dir="ltr">These can be lost upon wiping in the Nether by running out of Revives or if players disconnect during a run.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-art-of-wild-bastards-a-very-good-looking-video-game.1101489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wild-bastards-blue-manchu-art<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm sorry,<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it's been way too long since we ran a Platform blog</a>! So let's make amends by looking at one of the prettiest games of 2024, <em>Wild Bastards</em>, and chatting with the folks responsible for said prettiness.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/luke-plunkett-aftermath-game-of-the-year-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wild Bastards</em> made my Games Of The Year list for several reasons</a>, but for Platform blog purposes it definitely helped that it was a continuation of developers Blue Manchu's commitment, across 2019's <em>Void Bastards</em> and now this, to an art style that's instantly recognisable for its sharp lines, memorable character designs and bold colours.</p><p>To learn more about how the game's visuals came together, I spoke with Blue Manchu's three artists: Ben Lee, Dean Walsh and Irma Walker.</p><p><strong>BEN LEE</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Ben served as Creative Director on the game, but indie dev being indie dev, he was also unofficially everything from art director to concept artist to a 2D illustrator.</p><p>Lee says that, as Creative Director, his chief influences came from about where you'd expect a game that looks like this to have come from. In video game terms, Lucasarts' classic <em>Outlaws</em>--a 90's first-person shooter that employed 2D sprites for its enemies in a 3D space, just like <em>Wild Bastards</em>--was of course a big inspiration, but Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns also played their part.</p><figure></figure><p>"<em>Void Bastards</em> was very focused around looking like a literal comic page come to life", Lee tells Aftermath. "<em>Wild Bastards</em> moved away from this completely and leant more in a film/animation direction. It's much more widescreen and hyper-saturated looking.</p><p>"Given that I design the visuals in our games, and in most cases hand draw them myself, this means that the way I draw kind of naturally ties the games together, even when I don't necessarily want it to."</p><p>While Lee both designed <em>and</em> animated the enemies in <em>Void Bastards</em>, this time around the game's increased roster of bad guys meant some of that work was handed off to animation studio Look Mom Productions (part of Blue Ant), a shift that he says gave <em>Wild Bastards</em> its own "unique look".</p><figure><figcaption>"My favorite piece is the illustration that we eventually used for the game's cover. It sums up everything I wanted to see in this game", Lee says.</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>DEAN WALSH</strong></p><figure></figure><p>Dean Walsh was 3D Art Lead and Technical Artist on <em>Wild Bastards</em>. "I designed and implemented the asset pipelines for building and importing all the art", he tells Aftermath. "With such a unique game that tends to be a bit more involved; at Blue Manchu we model the 'linework' as geometry rather than as 2D textures applied to the surface of a 3D mesh like you would see with most games. I ended up building most of the shaders too, which define how the light and colour mixes."</p><p>Pointing out that both <em>Void Bastards</em> and <em>Wild Bastards</em> have a superficially similar look, I asked if the team has a label or firm structure for it. Nope, turns out it's just...vibes. "I wish we had a term but so far we tend to be describing it more project by project, because, while similar games, they certainly have different approaches."</p><figure></figure><p>"<em>Wild Bastards</em> is built around a dynamic sun-based light which also works with our inverted line work, so the lines when shaded swap to colour to give the unique shadow look. <em>Void Bastards</em> was much tighter sight lines, more black and all top-down lit via a dynamic low res light map, I was hand cutting in detail in shadows for that."</p><p>I asked Walsh if there was a single piece of work he did for the game that he was most proud of. "The enemy shader uses a second texture that we generate; it does a few things like tell the shader where they glow but also uses a thing called a signed distance field. This is a gradient that can make those lines thicker or thinner based on how far away they are in the level."</p><figure><figcaption>This is the effect Dean is talking about, where the ink lines surrounding enemies and buildings maintain their clarity over different distances</figcaption></figure><p>"It's a small thing but it keeps enemies from getting softer or less defined, since all the lines in the world do the same thing, so they look as if they are all inked in a comic with the same pen. As a non programmer and very much an artist, being able to fumble the tech to make stuff look the way we want is always a nice surprise."</p><hr><p><strong>IRMA WALKER</strong></p><figure></figure><p><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>Walker was first brought onto the project to help out on some buildings. "Ultimately these would be deemed too bland to stay as they were", she says, "so as I continued working there my role expanded to creating models based on Ben's concepts and my own ideas, and running passes on the buildings to make them a bit more interesting."</p><p>From there, she worked on a bit of everything. "Our roles on the team were usually pretty flexible, we were such a small collection of people that we'd usually end up branching out to handle whatever needed doing; my title was 'Artist' but I would occasionally handle QA and was the go-to for a lot of the fiddly little tasks nobody really wanted to be doing (like checking sprites for tiny errors and hooking them up in-game).”</p><figure></figure><p>"The sawmill (pictured above, far right) is a really fantastic example of the dedication of our entire team to make the game as visually exciting as it could possibly be. As you can see, the first iteration of our big barn (far left) was not terribly exciting. It definitely did the job of being a big barn, but the details were very uniform, the space not terribly unique to run around in, and the model itself--by the nature of being built of a lot of individual pieces--was a bit haphazard and lacked cohesion."</p><figure></figure><p>"Over time we ended up basically re-working every single building and small model in the game. It took time, and added months to the game's production, but I feel like the extra effort was absolutely worth it. The big barn was also used as the base of the Sawmill, which ended up being one of my favourite models I worked on, and really contributed to the really handcrafted, cohesive and visually engaging style we shipped the game with. To me, it all demonstrates the value of iteration. Just because something 'works fine' doesn't mean you shouldn't play around with it; sometimes even small changes can make a drastic difference!"</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, Valve has a notice designed to warn Steam users when they visit an early access game’s store page if it’s been a minute since the last update.

<p>In December, MachineGames and Bethesda released Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a critically acclaimed epic featuring the titular adventurer front and centre. For this spin around the whip, Indiana Jones was played by Troy Baker, one of the most instantly recognisable names in gaming.</p>



<p>Harrison Ford has made it clear that he’s more than happy to pass the torch to Baker, and in the past, he has praised the actor for his replication of the character. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, the legendary actor once again showered Baker with adoration for his portrayal of Indiana Jones.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-nothing-but-good-things">Nothing But Good Things</h2>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle received positive reviews across the board when it was released on December 9. It looks great, plays better, and features the iconic tropes of the Indiana Jones series that are intensely familiar to fans of the franchise.</p>



<p>In an interview that took place before the game was released, Bethesda Game Studios’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-troy-baker-indiana-jones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard revealed</a> that he <strong>didn’t want Troy Baker </strong>to play Indiana Jones. He explained that the team cast a wide net when fielding auditions, but time and again, those vetting the ‘blind taste tests’ picked Troy Baker.</p>



<p>Recently, Harrison Ford sat down to speak to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/style/harrison-ford-shrinking-1923-captain-america-7b1f9b3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wall Street Journal</a> about his acting career – which is still going strong despite the performer being 82 years of age.</p>



<p>Amid a deep conversation about the Indy franchise and Ford’s most recent work, including the upcoming Captain America: Brave New World, the topic turned to Baker’s performance of Indiana Jones in the December release:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need artificial intelligence to steal my soul. You can already do it for nickels and dimes with good ideas and talent.</p>



<p>He did a brilliant job, and it didn’t take AI to do it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With the mention of AI, Harrison Ford was talking about using ‘synthetic versions of famous actors’ to apply them to roles after they’ve passed on. This is something that, quite understandably, actors are wary of pursuing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-now-warn-you-before-you-buy-an-%E2%80%98abandoned%E2%80%99-game.1101378/</guid>

<p>Valve has released a new update to the Steam interface that’ll offer users a prompt detailing how long it has been since an early-access game was last updated. This new feature is designed to prevent gamers from investing in a game that might be abandoned, or from buying one that might not be accurately represented by what’s detailed on the store page.</p>



<p>It’s not immediately obvious what the ‘cut-off point’ is for this label to appear, as not every early-access game has it. Most of them just have the typical breakdown that features an explanation from the developers as to why the game has been released in an early-access state.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-transparency-update">Transparency Update</h2>



<p>One of the most heartbreaking revelations you can have as a gamer is investing in an early-access game that has you excited, only to find that the developer hasn’t touched it in years. That’s the case with some early-access games on Steam that remain in that state for <strong>a very long time </strong>after hitting the digital storefront.</p>



<p>Valve’s latest update challenges that notion, letting users know if it has been several months (or more) since the last major update to the game. This change was noticed and publicised on social media <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1887107461879832746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>For instance, Heartbound, which was released in 2018 and remains in early access, was last updated ‘over 13 months ago’. The game was once taken positively by the PC gaming community, but the recent review rating has dropped to Mostly Negative because of the lack of updates.</p>



<p>Another example is a game called ATLAS, which sees players take on an ambitious pirating adventure across the high seas. It looks good enough at first blush, but it has mixed reviews overall – some 36,000 in total. It too was released in 2018 but hasn’t been updated in more than 20 months:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many early-access games ‘graduate’ from that state, becoming a full-release title that launches with a 1.0 version that’s often bursting with improvements and features. One great example is Sons of the Forest, which was released in early access in February 2023, graduating to a full release one year later and succeeding all over again.</p>



<p>This is a nice move by Valve – but what do you think? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

          <p>AMD announced its fourth-quarter earnings yesterday, and the numbers were <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1236/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial">mostly rosy</a>: $7.7 billion in revenue and a 51 percent profit margin, compared to $6.2 billion and 47 percent <a href="https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1180/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2023-financial">a year ago</a>. The biggest winner was the data center division, which made $3.9 billion thanks to Epyc server processors and Instinct AI accelerators, and Ryzen CPUs are also selling well, helping the company's client segment earn $2.3 billion.</p>
<p>But if you were looking for a dark spot, you'd find it in the company's gaming division, which earned a relatively small $563 million, down 59 percent from a year ago. AMD's Lisa Su blamed this on both dedicated graphics card sales and sales from the company's "semi-custom" chips (that is, the ones created specifically for game consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation).</p>
<p>Other data sources suggest that the response from GPU buyers to AMD's Radeon RX 7000 series, launched between late 2022 and early 2024, has been lackluster. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>, a noisy but broadly useful barometer for GPU market share, shows no RX 7000-series models in the top 50; only two of the GPUs (the 7900 XTX and 7700 XT) are used in enough gaming PCs to be mentioned on the list at all, with the others all getting lumped into the "other" category. Jon Peddie Research <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/discrete-gpu-sales-increase-as-intels-share-drops-to-0">recently estimated</a> that AMD was selling roughly one dedicated GPU for every seven or eight sold by Nvidia.</p>
<p>But hope springs eternal. Su confirmed on AMD's earnings call that the new Radeon RX 9000-series cards, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/new-radeon-rx-9000-gpus-promise-to-fix-two-of-amds-biggest-weaknesses/">announced at CES last month</a>, would be launching in early March. The Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT are both aimed toward the middle of the graphics card market, and Su said that both would bring "high-quality gaming to mainstream players."</p>
<h2>An opportunity, maybe</h2>
<p>"Mainstream" could mean a lot of things. AMD's CES slide deck positioned the 9070 series alongside Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti ($799) and 4070 Super ($599) and its own RTX 7900 XT, 7900 GRE, and 7800 XT (between $500 and $730 as of this writing), a pretty wide price spread that is still more expensive than an entire high-end console. The GPUs could still rely heavily on upscaling algorithms like AMD's Fidelity Super Resolution (FSR) to hit playable frame rates at those resolutions, rather than targeting native 4K.</p>

            <p>
Call of Duty veteran Michael Condrey has reportedly been fired as the head of 2K Games studio 31st Union after its debut project, free-to-play hero shooter Project Ethos, recieved a muted reponse on its reveal toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
Condrey, who co-founded Call of Duty developer Sledgehammer Games, was confirmed to be leading 2K's 31st Union in 2019. A year later, Condrey <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-rebrands-studio-headed-by-sledgehammer-co-founder-to-31st-union">teased</a> the studio was working on an "ambitious and inspired new IP" - but it wasn't until last October that the game, now known as Project Ethos, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-veteran-reveals-project-ethos-a-roguelike-hero-shooter-backed-by-2k">finally revealed</a>.
</p>
<p>
Project Ethos was officially described as a free-to-play "roguelike hero shooter", and featured a colourful art style reminiscent of Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>. Unfortunately, its unveiling came just months after consumer apathy led to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">rapid demise of PlayStation's Concord</a> - and it appears there wasn't much enthusiasm for Project Ethos either.

<p>
In a <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">new report by Kotaku</a>, sources claim Project Ethos - which is said to have faced a "challenging and rocky development cycle" under Condrey - was revealed to "little fanfare or apparent player interest". That seemingly sparked a chain of events leading to Condrey's reported firing as 31st Union's studio head earlier this week.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Kotaku, 2K confirmed Condrey's departure as 31st Union president, saying he would be "transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project Ethos". The publisher also insisted it remains "very committed to the forward path for Project Ethos and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio."
</p>
<p>
"We are grateful to Michael Condrey," it added, "for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union."
</p>
<p>
2K, of course, has packed slate of major releases over the next 12 months, with Civilization 7, Borderlands 4, Mafia: The Old Country, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine's Judas, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> behemoth <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> all on the way.

<p>2K has shaken things up at the top of one of its developers. A new report has surfaced claiming that 2K Games has fired 31st Union president Michael Condrey after the poor response to Project Ethos.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, 2K made the move after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-games-project-ethos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s reveal</a> left players and critics, alike, underwhelmed. One preview from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-ethos-first-hands-on-impressions-of-2ks-new-roguelike-hero-shooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> last year stated, “It seems to fall short of delivering anything that’s truly genre-defying in either the roguelike or extraction shooter departments.”</p>



<p>In a statement to Kotaku, 2K says that Condrey is “transitioning” from the project and that the company is still “committed” to the game.</p>



<p>“We are grateful to Michael Condrey for the dedication, passion and work ethic it took to build an incredible team and shape the vision of 31st Union,” a 2K spokesperson told the outlet. “Michael will be transitioning his role in the short term to focus on advising on the future of Project ETHOS. We remain very committed to the forward path for Project ETHOS and the people and culture of the 31st Union studio.”</p>

<p>Condrey joined 31st Union in 2019 after leaving Sledgehammer Games, a studio he helped found in 2009. He has yet to make any statement on the change, or what’s next for his career. </p>



<p>Take-Two Interactive is scheduled to report its Q3 FY2025 earnings on Thursday, February 6 at 430pm ET.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-duel-for-middle-earth-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Once upon a time there was a hugely popular card-drafting game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/7-wonders-board-game-review">7 Wonders</a>. But drafting, where you pick a card to keep and pass the rest on, is pretty boring with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two players</a>, seeing as you know exactly what you’re going to be given on each pass. So, eventually, the game got a spin-off for two players only called <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGGP8?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">7 Wonders Duel</a> which cleverly mimicked a draft by giving players a mixture of face-up and face-down cards to choose from. That was also hugely popular: indeed popular enough that it’s now received a shiny new Tolkien reskin in the form of Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGVvB?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DFF3V1Q7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>).</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What’s in the Box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr-duel-box-contents-1738777284021.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since this is essentially a card game, that’s the majority of the box contents. Fortunately they’re great cards, vibrant with evocative Middle-earth art. Some of the art actually joins together to make panoramas – although it’s unlikely you’ll manage to collect a set during play. Cards have a colored top bar to indicate what type they are, and most also have several symbols indicating both what that card can do for you, and the prerequisites for acquiring it.</p><div catalogid="466bb9b4-b3ca-4bef-ae41-7721c86b6fee" id="214615"><div id="214615" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Lord of The Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Players new to this version might be more interested in the other components, which are used for tracking the game state. There’s a mini-map of Middle-earth onto which you place delightfully tiny wooden army and castle pieces. Another lovely touch is the hunt for the ring track, over which you place a plastic slider with the hobbits at one end and a movable plastic ringwraith at the other. This ensures the hobbits can inch closer to their objective at Mount Doom, the wraith can inch closer to the hobbits, but the hobbits can never get further away from the wraith. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining pieces are punchable cardboard. There are several stacks of shields, one for each of the neutral factions of Middle-earth that the players hope to ally with, featuring icons on the reverse to indicate the reward for doing so, and lots of gold coins. Finally there’s a tile for each region on the board indicating what fortress you can build there, what it costs, and what you gain for doing so.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and How It Plays">Rules and How it Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr1-1738782689175.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">7 Wonders: Duel simulated drafting for two by having each of its three rounds set out a pattern of cards in which a row of face-up cards overlapped a row of face-down cards. That same layout is replicated here exactly, except rather than competing civilizations, one of you is the dark lord Sauron and the other represents the free people of Middle-earth. You can’t pick a card – or flip it, if it’s face-down – until the cards beneath it in the pyramid have been cleared. This makes your choice of which card to take each turn difficult and tense, because you want to try and minimize the options available to your opponent while also maximising your own further down the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This card pyramid isn’t the only thing that Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth retains from its predecessor. Indeed, pretty much the entire game flow will be familiar to veterans of that game. Most early cards are free, so you can pick them up and add them to your growing tableau. But as the game progresses, more powerful cards will either require you to have particular skill icons or prerequisite symbols from cards you already own in order to take them. If you can’t afford anything, you can use gold to make up the shortfall of matching symbols or discard a card for gold instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You are thus quickly caught into a dilemma as to whether to specialize in certain sets of skills, which will make it easier to get similar cards, or play as more of a generalist. There’s no right answer to this: it depends on what cards you get and in what order, and learning when to break one way or the other is a key tactical skill that comes with experience. Either way, this makes flipping face-down cards surprisingly exciting because there can be a lot riding on it if it’s the next key part in the specialist chain that you’re building. There’s nothing worse than suddenly finding you’ve handed the opportunity to pick-up a critical card to your opponent because grabbing something else you wanted revealed it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to cards that grow your tableau economy, there are also cards that move you forward on victory conditions. These are where Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-earth makes clear water between itself and its predecessor. Ring symbols let you advance on the quest for the ring track. If either side reaches the end of its track, it’s an instant win, with identical bonuses to be had along the way. Green cards represent an alliance with another faction such as Elves or Ents: six different such symbols and you win, while duplicates get you a bonus token from a stack specific to each faction. Finally, red cards let you place armies on the map of Middle-Earth, kicking out rivals on a one-to-one basis. If you conquer all seven regions you win, otherwise the player with the most regions when the card stack runs out takes the victory.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr4-1738785279052.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each victory condition is cleverly designed to close in on its apex during the third round of play. You are pretty much guaranteed to be within touching distance of one, if not two, by then and play becomes a matter not only of trying to inch yourself over the line but selecting cards that prevent your opponent from doing the same. This ensures that play builds towards a truly thrilling climax almost every time, lending the game an epic feel that belies its relative simplicity and snappy half-hour play time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, after a few plays it’s hard not to wonder how much of this comes down to skill, and how much of it is luck. As mentioned previously, revealing a card that either you, or your opponent, need, can be absolutely critical to which way the victory breaks and there’s very little you can do about it. The decisions you make along the way certainly matter, but the game is engineered to be close because whatever you don’t have the opportunity to get, your enemy will. You thus pay for that crescendo of excitement with the seeds of doubt about how much your efforts influenced the final outcome. In fairness, it is difficult to design really dramatic games that don’t involve a lot of random moments, and this one hides it fairly well.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Play builds towards a truly thrilling climax almost every time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One other secret weapon the game has in this regard is its other major new feature: fortresses. At any given time there are three fortress tiles available of the full seven, one for each space on the map. They all cost large amounts of skill symbols and gold, but come with benefits to match. Not only do these rewards tie in with the central game mechanics, such as free ring track spaces if you gain the tower of Minas Tirith in Gondor, but they allow you to place a fortress piece in the matching space, which acts as an undefeatable army there. Fortresses are thus huge pivots in winning over map spaces. At the same time, buying a tile is the only way you can delay taking a card and thus potentially force your opponent into taking one that flips those critical unrevealed cards instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the vibrant card art and name-checking of key places and people in Middle-earth, the game doesn't end up feeling like an evocation of Tolkien’s trilogy. Grabbing ring cards is no substitute for the long, desperate chase depicted in the books and there’s no real matchup between allying factions and the rewards they offer. Worse, the game often feels counter-thematic. There’s nothing to stop Sauron allying with his most implacable foes, the Elves, and the armies of the free peoples often end up conquering the shadow realm of Mordor and buying its fortress of Barad-Dur. These outcomes would have been unthinkable in the carefully constructed legendarium, but they’re so common here it makes light of Tolkein’s vast imaginative effort.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/05/lotr2-1738785230220.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGVvB?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Amazon</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX22kO?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Walmart</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QL55oR?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Asmodee</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/9yXXBm?object_uuid=20b5fb78-06c6-4320-b8b6-0b5647b4f9c6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Get it at Miniature Market</strong></a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>See More Lord of the Rings Board Games: </strong></h2></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Feb 5, 2025 8:57 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Concerns over the game’s theme and potential depth aside, Lord of the Rings: Duel for Middle-Earth deserves to be lauded for presenting such an exciting and varied game off the back of such an accessible setup. One caveat has to be offered to those familiar with 7 Wonders Duel, though: while the new mechanics make this a cut above that game, the two feel very similar and you can’t really justify owning both. If you’re new to this series, by the time you’re knee deep in rings and things, frantically wondering what the next card flip will be and whether you’ll be able to stop your foe one space from winning, you won’t care that much about the niceties of skill or story. You’ll be too busy having a good time.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Saber Interactive founder Matthew Karch has shared some pointed words about the state of the AAA video game market. Speaking to reporter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/saber-interactive-matt-karch-private-jet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo aboard a private jet that he paid $23 million for</a>, Karch said incredibly expensive AAA games may become a thing of the past and are contributing to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">string of job losses in the market today.</a></p><p>"I think that the age of the $200 million, $300 million, $400 million AAA game is on its way out. I don't think it's necessary. I don't think it's appropriate," Karch said.</p><p>The executive went on to say he believes the costs associated with making such big-budget games may help explain why the video game industry is seeing so many layoffs today.</p><p>"I don't know how best to put it….I think if anything has contributed more to the loss of jobs, it's the multi-hundred million dollar budget," he said.</p><p>In 2023, <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-ceases-all-operations-in-russia-through-the-divestment-of-selected-assets-from-the-operative-group-saber-interactive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Karch's Beacon Interactive</a> bought certain assets from Saber's parent company Embracer as part of a divestiture from Embracer's business operations in Russia. It was at this time that Karch and Embracer officially parted ways, with Beacon effectively buying Saber our of Embracer.</p><p>Before this, Karch lamented how "games are getting cut left and right" due to certain economic conditions within the video game business. "The consolidation that's been going on in the industry is gonna hurt that as well, and the costs and the turmoil that the industry has been going through… Teams will regroup but the capital at the moment, it just isn't there," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sabers-matthew-karch-the-aaa-model-is-going-to-change" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told GI.biz</a>. "And so the industry is actually contracting somewhat and the supply of content is going to be way short of the demand."</p><p>Karch has also questioned the $70 price point for games, saying he would prefer not too charge that much and believes it's "almost not fair" to do so. He cited Helldivers 2, which launched at $40, as being an example of a lower-priced game that went on to enjoy huge success. One of Saber's biggest recent releases was 2024's Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, which was priced at $70 despite what Karch thinks about that price point.</p><p>Saber's Tim Willits, commenting on the success of Space Marine 2, said it's a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-didnt-need-to-sell-4-million-units-to-be-a-success-but-it-did-anyway/1100-6527262/" data-ref-id="1100-6527262">sad truth</a> that many game studios declare a game a failure if it doesn't sell 5 million copies. "I mean, what business are we in where you fail if you sell less than 5 million?" he said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another day, another set of layoffs it seems. Iron Galaxy layoffs are the latest to strike the industry as the studio responsible for a lot of porting work, co-development, and the creation of the free-to-play game <em>Rumbleverse</em> and fighting game <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killer-instinct-anniversary-edition-coming-years-after-latest-update-with-patch-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Killer Instinct Anniversary Edition Released Years After Latest Update">Killer Instinct</a> </em>has let go of over 60 people.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.irongalaxystudios.com/blog-posts/an-update-on-our-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="AN UPDATE ON OUR STAFF">announcement on their site</a>, they mention the state of the industry which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Video Game Layoffs">seen many layoffs</a>, many studio closures, and a lot of games fail to perform, including <em>Rumbleverse</em>. This follows the layoffs yesterday at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Sumo Group Announces Layoffs Amid Refocus on Support and Work for Hire">Sumo Group</a> who were a similar type of studio that had focused on co-development and services, before expanding to do more their own work. Through the last two years they had managed to keep their team together, but they no longer have the room to continue without cutting some of their staff, after having taken many steps over the past few years.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, Iron Galaxy is parting ways with some of our developers and support staff. In total, we have reduced our employee base by 66 people. This was a means of last resort for us. It’s a measure we do not take lightly to enable our long-term survival.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Iron Galaxy has four studios, and the contraction comes after they had spent the years growing in the lead-up to <em>Rumbleverse</em> as they attempted to build doing original projects on top of their co-development, and porting work. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, they <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/inno/stories/news/2021/07/23/video-game-studio-iron-galaxy-hires-100-it-s-sti.html?ana=e_or_ae&amp;j=24538920&amp;senddate=2021-07-23" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Video-Game Studio Iron Galaxy Hires 100-Plus, It's Still Growing">hired 100 people</a>, which took them near 300 people in the studio, thus this represents likely somewhere between 20 and 25% of the headcount among employees.</p>

<p>Beyond their work on <em>Killer Instinct</em> and <em>Rumbleverse</em>, many ports for PC and Switch bear the marks of Iron Galaxy's work. Titles like <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> on PC were ported by them, and they helped Blizzard bring games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/overwatch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Overwatch"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-diablo-3-found-itself-journey-through-hell-and-madness" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-diablo-3-found-itself-journey-through-hell-and-madness"><em>Diablo </em><em>3</em> </a>to Nintendo Switch. Other titles that they have done some work on include <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/spyro-reignited-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Spyro Reignited Trilogy"><em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy"><em>Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, and <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-next-gen-difference" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection - The Next-Gen Difference">Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves</a></em>.</p>

<p>In the note, the studio concludes by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At this moment, our focus is on our teammates who have begun a journey toward their next role. We thank them for working with us. We’ll be doing everything we can to support them in the search for the next phase of their careers. Keep an eye out for them if you need good people. We are sorry to see them go.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We wish everyone impacted by layoffs over the past few years the best, and our hearts go out to all the people impacted by the Iron Galaxy layoffs. Here's hoping you find the perfect job for you just around the corner.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is confirmed as the largest game in the franchise’s history, at a whopping 123.2 GB in size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows game size was revealed through its listing on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/assassins-creed-shadows/id6497794841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mac App Store</a>. The title can be pre-ordered now for $69.99. Players will need macOS 14.0 or later and a Mac with an Apple M1 chip or later to play the game. The 123.2 GB file size is the largest in the franchise’s history, more than double that of recent instalments like Assassin’s Creed Valhalla or Odyssey, which needed around 50 GB and 45 GB only, respectively.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With such a massive file size for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, players will expect Ubisoft to go all out on the game. The visual fidelity and attention to detail should be second to no past Assassin’s Creed title if the game size exceeds the previous instalments by that much. If you are wondering about Assassin’s Creed Shadows PC system requirements, check out the details <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. Players should note that SSD storage with 123.2 GB of free space is mandatory for any preset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is an upcoming historical, open-world action-adventure by Ubisoft set in Feudal Japan. Players will experience this adventure through the eyes of 2 characters: Naoe, a shinobi Assassin and Yasuke, a legendary samurai. Both characters feature distinct playstyles. Naoe is more stealthy and agile, whereas Yasuke is the tank responsible for dealing the heavy blows. If you are interested in the game, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be released for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Mac on March 20, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ art book recently leaked online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-artwork/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on an 18+ website</a>, showcasing new art for the game. Also, the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shaodws-censored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graphic content will be censored in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows Game size?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>
