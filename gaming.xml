		<p>A big cinematic story trailer has been released for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a>, revealing some of the alien races that you’ll battle and a surprise Space Marine team-up in the fight for the future of the planet Kronus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV - Story Trailer | PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ja6IOle_Thg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The planet Kronus was the setting for the second DLC campaign for the original Dawn of War game, and this leads us back to battling some familiar foes. Co-written by Black Library author John French, the story sees Kronus beset by an Ork infestation, now with two rival Ork Warbosses vying for power, while the Necrons are emerging from their tombs beneath the surface, as well as with an invasion fleet appearing above.</p>
<p>That’s a lot for a Space Marine Chapter to deal with, as formidable as they all are, so it’s a good thing that they’ll be getting a hand. The Adeptus Mechanicus will feature in the game, and the Dark Angels are also turning to to ally themselves with the Blood Ravens. You’ll get to play as both chapters, with Company Master Astoran and Chaplain Ezrael leading the Dark Angels into the fray. They’ve also teased that Dark Angels Primarch Lion El’Jonson could be playable at some point in the campaign, which would be a landmark moment for 40K in general, not just video games!</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV has been entrusted to Iron Harvest developer King Art Games and publisher Deep Silver. It’s a new leaf for the franchise, which was created by Relic Entertainment way back in 2004 and defined a new style of real time strategy with less focus on resource gathering and base building, and more on controlling the map and battlefield. Dawn of War enjoyed a good few expansions before Dawn of War 2 explored a more tactical approach in 2009, and Dawn of War 3 sought to blend them all together.</p>

<p>The interest in having King Art work on Dawn of War IV was organised by Games Workshop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawn-of-war-4-devs-on-taking-over-from-relic-the-health-of-real-time-strategy-and-reviving-a-legend-of-the-genre">some time before Iron Harvest’s release in 2020.</a> It’s not known if GW initially wanted to stick with Relic, but that time frame would have been around the time that Relic was focussed on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/25/age-of-empires-4-review/">Age of Empires IV</a> and later <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/company-of-heroes-3">Company of Heroes 3</a>. Relic has since gone through the tumult of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/24/relic-entertainment-confirm-layoffs-affecting-121-employees/">layoffs while under Sega’s ownership in 2023</a>, and then <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/28/sega-cuts-another-240-uk-jobs-relic-entertainment-goes-independent/">independence with an investor buyout in 2024</a>. They had plenty of things going on, in other words, but King Art had proven themselves with their steampunk RTS and could be great new stewards for this series. We look forward to seeing more in the run up to its 2026 release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst the veritable sea of announcements (<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samson</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hello-sunshine-preview-you-the-desert-and-your-giant-robot-best-friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hello Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/intriguing-sci-fi-first-person-bullet-hell-game-luna-abyss-gets-2026-launch-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luna Abyss</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-shown-in-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dawn of War IV</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/survival-pirate-adventure-game-crosswind-gets-rebranded-to-windrose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crosswind/Windrose</a>, to name a few) from the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase, SOL Shogunate certainly stood out among the most impressive.</p>



<p>Small independent developer Chaos Manufacturing reimagines the sci-fi genre in samurai fashion. In this 'space opera action RPG', a powerful shogunate rules a colonized solar system. However, it's about to be challenged by protagonist Yuzuki, the broken heir of a once-powerful samurai family that was massacred by a rival clan. With no choice left but to become an outlaw ronin, Yuzuki seeks to carve a bloody path of vengeance with a traditional ronin arsenal reforged for the battlefields of the future. As the game unfolds, new abilities and skill combinations are unlocked, enabling evolving tactics against increasingly challenging foes.</p>



<p>Yuzuki will explore the so-called Lunar Glass cities of SOL Shogunate, where artificial gravity and simulated night-time provide an Earth-like experience for the Moon's inhabitants, who also enjoy infrastructural wonders such as space elevators and high-speed rails. But beneath the bright skylines and opulent districts of the wealthy lie sprawling industrial zones where workers toil unseen to sustain the shogunate's pervasive influence.</p>



<p>According to the people behind SOL Shogunate, each metropolis on the Moon draws inspiration from a different era of Japanese history. To navigate these vertical districts, players must use gravity-assist gear. They will also uncover hidden layers within each biome and discover clues that unlock the mysteries of the game's backstory.</p>



<p>The developers at Chaos Manufacturing have designed combat to be all about precision, timing, and adaptability. Yuzuki is meant to feel like the ultimate space samurai, albeit genetically modified for the future of combat. Players will get to choose between various weapon types and can channel different types of energy into attacks to expose weaknesses, stagger foes, and create new tactical opportunities. As Yuzuki's abilities grow and her enhancements, like bio-ceramic skin and enhanced vision, evolve, new techniques shift how battles flow and how players overcome increasingly dangerous enemies.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The pinnacle of combat encounters are, of course, the boss fights. The studio promises dynamic, cinematic, multi-phase boss encounters that challenge players to identify and exploit weaknesses. Meanwhile, the music changes as battles intensify, featuring dynamic tracks hand-crafted for the game by talented recording artists, including Japanese rock band AliA.</p>



<p>SOL Shogunate is still in early development, but we already know the game will be released on PC and consoles. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219360/SOL_Shogunate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> also lists the surprisingly low system requirements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Price, Explained—How Much Does It Cost On PlayStation 5?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-price/</link>
            <guid>1374076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re wondering whether a year-old Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 still has a high price, you might be in for some turbulence. This guide has details on the game’s full price and the different editions you can pick up.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-early-access-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5</a> isn’t a free in-flight meal, far from it. Originally an Xbox and PC title, MSFS 2024 arrives on PS5 with all the updates and content additions that have landed over the last 12-plus months. But don’t think Xbox Game Studios and Microsoft will go easy on you, PlayStation owners.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-cost">How Much Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Cost?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Standard Edition for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PS5 has a fairly routine $69.99 or £69.99 price.</strong></p>



<p>No discount, no price reduction, it’s a full-priced port on PlayStation. It is a premium property with a ton of content, though, so it’s worth the price of admission. When you also consider that this is the first entry in the series’ 40-year history to arrive on PlayStation, it’s quite a significant milestone.</p>



<p>Many will see $69.99 as a fair deal. This is only for the Standard Edition, so is the damage much worse for more expensive packages?</p>







<h2 id="h-all-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-editions-amp-prices">All Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<p><strong>There are four Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 editions for PS5: Standard, Deluxe, Premium Deluxe, and Aviator.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of each edition and what it costs. Warning: The later editions get sky-high with their pricing.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">MSFS 2024 Edition</th><th data-align="center">Price</th><th data-align="center">Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £69.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-70 Aircraft<br>-150 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £99.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-80 Aircraft<br>-155 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Premium Deluxe Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £129.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-95 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Aviator Edition</td><td data-align="center">$199.99 or £199.99</td><td data-align="center">-Base game<br>-Early Access<br>-125 Aircraft<br>-160 Airports</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s up to you if you can justify as much as $200 for the PS5 launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. What do you think of its pricing? Should it be more reasonable? Is $200 too much for simply adding more vehicles and airports?

<p>A new Monster Hunter Showcase is scheduled for December 8, 2025, featuring the title update 4 for MH Wilds and the latest information on MH Stories 3. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-still-2025s-best-selling-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top launches of 2025</a>, but some PC performance issues and content complaints have brought criticism from the community. The developers already confirmed they are working on those issues and have now announced a new showcase that will provide players with details on another free content update for Monster Hunter Wilds and the latest information on their upcoming title, MH Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. </p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-monster-hunter-showcase-on-december-8-2025">How to Watch Monster Hunter Showcase on December 8, 2025?</h2>



<p>Announced through the Monster Hunter <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1996867143057445119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), the Monster Hunter Showcase will begin on Monday, December 8, 2025, at 2:00 PM PST.

The developers have also explicitly stated that “For Monster Hunter Wilds, the event will focus solely on Free Title Update 4.” For Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, we might get to see new story details or maybe a gameplay deep dive. Players will have to wait to know for sure. </p>



<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection is set to arrive in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. The title is the latest instalment of the RPG series set in Monster Hunter World.

Priced at $50, it'll land early next year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 port also being considered.</p><p>Suda added that the release date could be delayed by up to two weeks if the master copy of the game is rejected up to three times, which would result in Romeo Is A Dead Man launching around the same time as "that title with a big nine" on its box art. Suda is likely referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-preorder-guide-ps5-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-pc/1100-6535813/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which launches on February 27 next year.

As for the proposed Switch 2 port, Suda51 said this could happen after the game's launch.</p><p>"We've got to make sure it works on PC and the other platforms that have already been decided on," Suda said to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>.

		<p>Lying deep in Metroid Prime 4’s volcano facility of the Flare Pool region is the huge boss Phenoros, yet another creature native to Viewros that has been corrupted by a Metroid and now serves as a major threat to Samus and her mission.</p>
<p>There’s a few stages to this battle, which can be quite a drawn out one if you don’t spot the key moments and what you need to do in order to succeed. Here’s a breakdown of the stages to the boss battle and how best to overcome them.</p>
<p>Obviously there are some <strong>progression spoilers</strong> within this guide, so at this point, <strong>stop reading if you aren’t currently struggling to beat Phenoros!</strong></p>


<p>OK, so… with that out of the way, let’s get on with the guide!</p>
<h3>Phenoros on the lava lake</h3>
<p>The first section of the Phenoros battle has Samus on the Vi-O-La IC, chasing after Phenoros as it swims around a huge lake of lava. It doesn’t really try to attack you during this phase, but can swim a little erratically, throwing up choppy lava flows that slow you down and balls of magma. Scanning Phenoros and look at it for visual clues reveals a string of weak spots on the underside of its snake-like body.</p>


<p>The goal during this section is to use the Vi-O-La disc attack to hit all of these weak spots, and the best way to do this is to try to drive alongside Phenoros and quickly target multiples as its body dips in and out of the lava. Once all of them have been hit, it’s on to the next stage!</p>
<h3>Phenoros showdown</h3>
<p>Now you’ve made Phenoros really angry! Samus is stuck on a small chunk of its body while its head towers over her. The aim here is to hit between one and four blue weakspots on Phenoros’ head and trigger a damage phase where you blast its tongue with as many heavy attacks as you possibly can! Ice Beam attacks can quickly take out chunks of its health during this.</p>

<p>Hitting the weak spots can be tricky. Phenoros’ head waves around a lot and the weakspots are on the side of its head. You need to either lock on and manually adjust your aim to hit them, or Switch 2 players might feel better using mouse mode.</p>
<p>During this section, Phenoros has a few key attacks to be aware of:</p>
<p><strong>Flame Breath</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros rears back and then unleashed a beam of flaming energy that it sweeps from one side of the semi-circle island to the other. You can jump over this, but I found it easiest to just morph ball and wait until it passes over.<br>
<strong>Bite</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros pulls back from the island before rushing forward to grab Samus. You need to time a dodge move to evade this, or be caught in Phenoros’ mouth and mash A to escape.<br>
<strong>Magma Balls</strong> –&nbsp;Phenoros spits out five slow-moving magma balls that home towards you. Shoot them in time and you’ll get some ammo and health top ups.</p>

<h3>Phenoros below half health</h3>
<p>Once you’ve got Phenoros below half health, it transforms and opens up two large head flaps, revealing four new weak spots. The goal is the same: blast those weak spots to put Phenoros into a dazed state and then blast its tongue with damage.</p>
<p>During this, Phenoros has all its previous attack, but a little bit faster and souped up –&nbsp;the flame breath is a double sweep. In addition there is one new attack:</p>
<p><strong>Ear Guns</strong> –&nbsp;From the remaining weak spots, Phenoros shoots blasts of energy at you. Keep strafing to avoid taking damage.</p>

<h3>Phenoros Finisher</h3>
<p>With Phenoros down to its last chunk of health, it will be incapacitated, floating on the surface, mouth wide open. This is the time to strike the final blow. You can’t head into its body yourself, but using a guided charged beam shot – charge up a standard beam shot while in the scanner view – you can home in on its core and take it down!</p>

<p>If you don’t do this in time, Phenoros will recover and return to the previous stage with a bit more health, needing to be downed once more.</p>
<p>Well done, you’ve defeated Phenoros! And now? Well, it’s time to grab a new ability and get the heck outta here!</p>

            <p>If you're a fan of gruff blokes punching goons and putting the pedal to the metal in muscle cars, Samson looks like it'll be up your alley. It's the debut game of Liquid Swords, the Swedish studio founded by former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> developer Christofer Sundberg, and mirrors the gritty open-world destructive mayhem both of those are known for.</p>

<p>Set in a fictional industrial metropolis called Tyndalston, which its leather-jacketed protagonist dubs the "asshole of the world", Samson is about a dude in debt. Each day, this dude wakes up with a daily quota to meet in terms of paying back what he owes to some bad people, a problem that grows worse by the hour unless he takes action.</p>
<p>That action is punching goons in the face or slapping them with improvised weapons as part of Mad Max-ish brawls in alleyways and mini-marts or getting behind the wheel of your all-black muscle car and using it to either race people, ram them off the road, or some combination of both. Police chases will kick off if your punching and driving gets a bit too rowdy, giving you a chance to unleash those skills on some boys in blue.</p><p>As you go, you'll work your way through the different factions of Tyndalston's districts, spending action points to choose which missions you dedicate Samson's limited time to. There's a tale about unearthing the dude's past in the city and saving his family to offer extra motivation to get out there and wreak havoc.</p>
<p>As much as playing a game about having constant money worries might hit a bit too close to home given what the real world's like for the non-rich at the moment, I'm keen to see if Liquid Swords have nailed the satisfying violent rollercoaster ride a game like this usually needs to shine. It looks more along the lines of Mad Max's desert marauding transplanted into an urban spawl than Just Cause's more exotic pinging around a map and blowing shit up, and I'm certainly partial to the former. Here's hoping the gritty city doesn't struggle to seem a bit dull compared to the backdrops Sundberg and co worked with at Avalanche Studios.</p>
<p>Samson's set to release in early 2026 and you can wishlist it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/">Steam</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/</link>
            <guid>1374046</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish developer founded in 2020 by ex Avalanche Studios founder Cristofer Sundberg, has unveiled their debut game, Samson: A Tyndalston Story, during the PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted 2025 showcase.</p>



<p>About a year ago, the studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> the photorealistic visuals of its Unreal Engine 5 open world game. Now, we have received a lot more details. According to the developer, it's going to be a gritty, brutal story.</p>



<p>The protagonist, Samson McCray, is forced to return to the unforgiving streets of the titular city of Tyndalston. He owes some very, very dangerous people a lot of money, and to make sure he returns to pay his debt, these criminals are threatening Samson's sister.</p>



<p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story is based on the simple, yet brutal truth that time is against the protagonist. With every passing day, the debt owed grows with interest. Each job picked by the main character uses up a limited supply of Action Points, and every decision affects how the city treats him, with no do-overs possible. Samson must keep moving forward because standing still makes everything worse.</p>



<p>While one of the features listed is indeed 'open world districts', this is not the type of near-endless open world game where you can stop to explore every nook and cranny without any repercussions. It's a focused story, likely not even too long given that the recommended price is $24.99. Over the course of the narrative, players will learn what broke Samson's family and what it takes to fix it before time runs out.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, Liquid Swords has prepared several systems that will cause Tyndalston to react to what Samson is doing. The police, for example, will push back if the protagonist sows too much chaos on the streets. Moreover, faces, factions, and streets shift in response to Samson's actions.</p>



<p>As you can see in the trailer, fights look very grounded. On-foot combat appears to be focused on brawling, with Samson using momentum, terrain, and improvised tools to take them down. But there's also car combat, with high-speed chases easily turning into collisions, traps, and close-quarters destruction.</p>



<p>The developers also confirmed that Samson: A Tyndalston Story includes a skill tree with over 25 upgrades to shape the main character into the type of fighter preferred by the player.</p>



<p>The game will launch on PC (no other platforms have been confirmed at this time) via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. It shouldn't be far off, either, with Liquid Swords promising an early 2026 release. </p>



<p>The Epic Games Store already lists the minimum and recommended requirements, although they are oddly missing the CPU:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OS</td><td>Windows 10</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2070-review-ft-asus-rog-strix-and-msi-armor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070</a></td><td><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4060-review-ft-msi-galax-pny-249-wouldve-made-this-gpu-perfect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060</a></td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>12 GB</td><td>16 GB</td></tr><tr><td>GPU VRAM</td><td>8 GB</td><td>16 GB</td></tr><tr><td>DirectX</td><td>DirectX 12</td><td>DirectX 12</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>15 GB</td><td>15 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s finally time for PS5 owners to book their ticket to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The title has so far been kept from the blue brand’s main console, but now MSFS 2024 has a PlayStation 5 release date, along with complete start times.</p>



<p>A one-way ticket to the sky beckons for PS5 players. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> took off just over one year ago, and boarded with plenty of Xbox and PC passengers on board. The flight-sim title is the latest in the franchise, and it’s going to be another instance of ‘Xbox Game Studios’ being bizarrely plastered all over a PS5 game.</p>



<p>Here are the official Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 release details for PS5.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-coming-out-on-ps5">When Is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Coming Out On PS5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>On plane. Credit to Xbox Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 launches worldwide for PlayStation 5 owners on December 8.</strong></p>







<p>It’s nearly a year to the day since MSFS 2024 debuted on Xbox and PC: November 19, 2024, to be exact. But now it’s time for MSFS to add its name alongside Forza Horizon 5, Gears of War: Reloaded, and the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved as Xbox hits to make the jump to the blue side of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-playstation-5-have-early-access">Does Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 On PlayStation 5 Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>The PS5 release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 comes with early access for those who pre-order the Deluxe, Aviator Edition, or Premium Editions.</strong></p>



<p>Consider this the gaming equivalent of securing priority boarding on a flight. Early access is out—meaning you don’t need to wait until December 8—and there are more details below on dates and times.</p>



<h2 id="h-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-start-times">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PS5 Start Times</h2>

            <p>A sudden update for Armored Core 6 on Steam has spurred hopes among fans of the third-person mecha action game that something big is coming to The Game Awards next week.</p>
<p>The update, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1888160/history/">which can be seen on the game's SteamDB page</a>, shows a change to the application <em>has</em> happened. However, we can't see what has changed. It could be absolutely nothing, <em>or</em> it could be preparation for something substantial… In this murky realm of possibility, a flicker of hope has been lit.</p>
<p>"Babe wake up. Armored Core got another SteamDB update 1 week before the Game Awards," <a href="https://x.com/Etheox/status/1996259179225620778">posts user Etheox on X</a>. It is worth noting of course that Armored Core 6 has received several Steam page updates over this year and no DLC announcements.</p>

<p>The game, while successful, has been left largely alone since its release in 2023. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-has-had-its-best-weapons-nerfed">It received an impactful nerf to some of its most powerful weapons</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-now-has-1v1-and-3v3-ranked-online-matchmaking">ranked matchmaking support for both 1v1 and 3v3</a>. Aside from that, it's been left well enough alone, which is a shame! More Armored Core would be a wonderful thing.</p><p>It is worth noting that previous Armored Core games have recieved DLC packs in the past. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/armored-core-5">Armored Core 5</a>, which was updated with the Modeler's Pack. This brought a vast number of new AC parts and weapons to the game. While big narrative updates aren't the norm with the series, FromSoftware has proven keen to create such content for its games in recent years. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-difficulty-harder-than-main-game-the-forsaken-hollows">Take Elden Ring: Nightreign's recent Forsaken Hollows DLC</a>, an injection of difficult content adding life to the multiplayer spinoff.
</p>
<p>Armored Core 6 was an outstanding game from FromSoftware. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">In Eurogamer's review</a>, Caelyn Ellis wrote: "FromSoftware delivers a superlative action game that builds on its Soulslike pedigree while staying lean and laser-focused."</p>

            <p>Portal shooter Splitgate 2 will be making its return from beta later this month, and to mark this return developer 1047 Games has rebranded it with a new name.</p>
<p>The free-to-play Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will arrive across PC (via Steam, Epic Games Store and Windows), Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 and PS4 on 17th December.</p>
<p>"After months of community feedback, testing and rebuilding the entire experience, this is Splitgate refocused on what made it special in the first place: classic arena combat without factions, abilities, or extra noise," the developer shared on Splitgate: Arena Reloaded's announcement, along with a new trailer you can see below.</p>

<p>1047 Games said Splitgate has "always been about the arena first", though the developer admitted it had somewhat missed the mark when it released Splitgate 2 earlier this year. As such, it has now taken elements from both the original Splitgate and its short-lived sequel, removed the bits that "didn't fit" and "refined" the ones that did.</p><p>"In the process, we not only rebuilt the game, we reconnected with the magic of the genre that built this studio in the first place. A Return to the Arena," the studio wrote, saying arena shooters are part of its DNA.</p>
<p>"Splitgate has always been a love letter to the classic shooters that sparked a lifelong passion for games for so many of us. They were fast, expressive, and skillful, and they brought people together around shared experiences.</p>
<p>"With Splitgate : Arena Reloaded, our goal is to bring that feeling forward for a new generation while keeping it fresh for the players who have been with us from the start."</p>
<p>You can check out the various changes coming to Splitgate: Arena Reloaded below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removed Splitgate 2's factions, abilities, and select equipment so the focus is back on classic arena combat without the extra noise.</li>
<li>Rebuilt progression from the ground up so your time in game feels rewarding, with weapon and character cosmetics you can earn simply by playing.</li>
<li>We've added a true Classic Arena mode with even starts and new map pickups, recapturing the feel of the original.</li>
<li>Fine tuned combat to better match expectations for a modern arena shooter, with more meaningful gunfights and fewer "what just happened" moments.</li>
<li>Completely overhauled the ranked system so your rank reflects your actual skill for players who love to climb and compete.</li>
<li>Added key systems you have been asking for: Mode Select, Player Stats, Ranked Leaderboards, and Account Levels.</li>
<li>Introduced five brand new maps and six fully reworked arenas, bringing the total map pool to 20.</li>
<li>Added three new LMG primary weapons and the iconic Power Weapon, the Railgun.</li>
</ul>

<p>Closing, 1047 Games acknowledged that relaunches such as this one can be "met with scepticism", and it appreciates that. However, the studio is proud of what it has built with Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, and will be sharing more in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"From everyone at 1047 Games, thank you for your feedback, your patience, and your passion over the last few months," it closed. "We hope to see you back in the arena on December 17."</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 was initially released earlier this year, but soon after the studio and its founder Ian Proulx admitted they had taken the game out of beta too soon. "We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew," a statement in July read. As such, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">the shooter returned to beta</a>, and layoffs were made at 1047 Games.</p>

            <p>The full release of action role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> - otherwise known as the 1.0 release - has slipped further away again. The game is currently in early access, remember.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">Grinding Gear Games had been targeting a potential March 2026 release for Path of Exile 2</a> - that's what game director Jonathan Rogers told me a few months ago. But in an interview conducted yesterday, Rogers told me he didn't think the studio would hit that date.</p>
<p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers said, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p>
<p>His comments follow those made during a Path of Exile 2 presentation Q&amp;A shortly before we spoke, in which he said: "I don't have a specific timeline but I certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027."</p>

<p>The obstacles to a Path of Exile 2 launch are threefold: the campaign, balance changes and endgame content. Path of Exile 2 currently has only four of six campaign-acts implemented, the most recent one - the fourth - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-path-of-exile-2-10-release-this-year-as-ddos-attacks-blamed-for-server-issues-and-huge-new-update-revealed">having been introduced in August</a>. These are big things, and even if we assume the two missing acts are ready to release in the game's next quarterly updates, presumably one after another, we're still potentially looking at one in spring 2026, and one in the summer, and they will both need testing time. Factoring that in, an autumn 2026 release at the earliest seems more reasonable.</p><p>That's assuming, of course, there are no balance changes or endgame changes that hold that up - both being areas Rogers wants "in a good place" before the game comes out. This is a constant pursuit for a game like Path of Exile 2, and balance changes have already interrupted the early access flow of content <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-fixes-incoming-following-criticism-of-dawn-of-the-hunt-updates-slow-pace">as Grinding Gear Games sought to address issues with the hunter class</a> it introduced back in April. This, then, is a potential risk any time the studio introduces a significant new element to the game, such as a player class, which it's just about to do again with the druid in the upcoming update, The Last of the Druids (0.5.0).</p>
<p>Alongside the new druid class, Grinding Gear Games will introduce a new world (league) for players to play in - something it does in every update. This upcoming league, The Fate of the Vaal, is themed around an ancient Vaal civilization and their lost, time-altering temple that's located somewhere underground. The cool thing is once you find it, you'll have to piece the dungeon together yourself, a bit like you do in the blueprint-adjusting puzzle game Blue Prince, although it's actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/loop-hero-review-round-and-round-the-garden">an indie game from 2021, Loop Hero</a>, the idea is inspired by, Rogers told me.</p>
<p>The autumn Path of Exile 2 update, which includes the new druid class, the new league, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-performance-boost">a significant performance boost for all platforms</a> but especially consoles, arrives 12th December.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 launched into early access in December 2024</a>, so it's been out for about a year now. What was already a very impressive package back then has only grown since. This is, in my mind, the action RPG to beat.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When it was released in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" data-ref-id="5000-471775">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> succeeded in the daunting task of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-review-the-good-blue-man-group/1900-6418162/" data-ref-id="1900-6418162">bringing its own kind of life to the world of James Cameron's Avatar movies</a>. Developer Massive Entertainment wisely chose not to retell the story of the films, instead weaving a tale on the other side of the moon of Pandora where the films take place.</p><p dir="ltr">But while Frontiers excelled at turning the dense, visually fascinating world of Pandora into a cogent, interactive space and exploring the culture of the Na'vi peoples who populate it, the game also felt somewhat disconnected from the movies. With the release of the third Avatar movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, Massive is taking the opportunity to adjust that situation a bit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora – From the Ashes Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Alongside the movie hitting theaters comes From the Ashes, an expansion for the game that tells a new story that incorporates major elements from the film, while also shaking up Frontiers' take on Pandora in some very big ways. Massive worked closely with Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment, to bring the stories of the movie and the game a little closer together.</p><p dir="ltr">"With From the Ashes, we were very closely aligned with Lightstorm on where they're taking the tone of the franchise--it's becoming very dark," Aoife O'Friel, From the Ashes' narrative director, told me in an interview. "And so we wanted to mirror that and link with that as much as possible. And so From the Ashes also has that darkness and a kind of vengeful edge to it."</p><p dir="ltr">Central to both Fire and Ash and From the Ashes are the Mongkwan, or Ash people, a warlike Na'vi clan that attacks and raids the others. In the movie, the Ash people side with the antagonistic human military forces of the RDA and Miles Quarritch, the series' primary villain. The story of the expansion takes place soon after the events of the movie, with the RDA making a new push across Pandora--but this time, they're doing it with a powerful and aggressive band of Na'vi among their ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">What that means in practice is that, when you leap into the new story told in From the Ashes, you'll face Na'vi enemies for the first time, in addition to the human soldiers, VTOLs, and mechs that make up the forces of the RDA. I played about three hours of From the Ashes at a recent preview event in Los Angeles, and saw how the addition of Na'vi enemies can introduce a pretty significant bump in challenge. For the first time in Frontiers of Pandora, you're facing foes who largely have the same capabilities that you do.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616353-avatarfromtheashes3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616353" data-ratio="0.56245686680469" data-width="1449" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616353-avatarfromtheashes3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616353"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616353-avatarfromtheashes3.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">A new protagonist</h3><p dir="ltr">From the start of Frontiers of Pandora, you've played as the Sarentu, a Na'vi who was abducted from their tribe as a child and raised among humans, but who takes the fight to the RDA throughout the story of the game. From the Ashes flips the script, putting you in control of So'lek, a side character with a dark past who players have worked with and grown close to throughout Frontiers' story.</p><p dir="ltr">The expansion begins with a fresh invasion by the RDA and Mongkwan forces, attacking the hometree where your closest allies live, and setting fire to the surrounding Kinglor Forest. The Sarentu and many of the other resistance members from Frontiers are scattered and left for dead, and as So'lek, it becomes your goal to reunite with and protect them.</p><p dir="ltr">So'lek's clan was wiped out by the RDA before the events of Frontiers, and he's been on a quest of revenge ever since. Throughout the course of the story and its previous DLC expansions, So'lek became part of the Sarentu's found family of survivors and resistance members. That makes this new attack deeply personal for him, dredging up a lot of personal pain and playing into the darker feel that From the Ashes brings to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"[So'lek] is older, he is battle-hardened. He's already grown up as a Na'vi, so he's not learning about the world, and so there isn't that kind of curiosity that maybe we focused on in the main game here," O'Friel explained. "So he's very driven and very focused on his goal and on protecting his family. And so it's much darker in that sense, that it's about the trauma that he's endured and that he never wants to go through again."</p><p dir="ltr">The devastation visited upon the game world only amplifies those feelings. After having spent tens of hours exploring the Kinglor Forest region, seeing it ravaged by flame highlights the brutality of the RDA and changes the game world significantly. The destroyed regions are bereft of the resources you need to craft ammunition or healing items, which can significantly change the dynamic of exploring or getting into battles with RDA patrols, forcing you to be more on-guard and cautious as you make your attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">The preview included two story missions from early in the expansion, totaling about an hour. The first sees So'lek invading a new RDA base set up in the Aranahe clan's hometree. You're free to enter the base however you want to, but I chose to sneak in, hoping to learn the whereabouts of the missing resistance members. In addition to the quieter Na'vi weapons like bows that players had in the base game to take down RDA forces without alerting the whole base, So'lek can also sneak up on many enemies and take them down with his knife, providing a quiet option for eliminating foes in your path.</p><p dir="ltr">This first mission mostly serves to introduce a few of the villains of From the Ashes, including one of three Na'vi warlords, who you'll hunt down and face throughout the course of the campaign. There's also Major Bukowski, who you'll hear over the loudspeaker as you make your way through the hometree base. Massive describes Bukowski as being akin to movie protagonist Jake Sully, if Sully had never left the RDA. Bukowski speaks Na'vi, understands their culture, and is even somewhat sympathetic to their plight, but he's still loyal to humanity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616356-avatarfromtheashes2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616356" data-ratio="0.56245686680469" data-width="1449" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616356-avatarfromtheashes2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616356"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4616356-avatarfromtheashes2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Battling the Mongkwan</h3><p dir="ltr">After gathering some intel, but unable to save any survivors, the mission culminates in So'lek emerging from the hometree and taking on a Mongkwan raider in close combat in an attempt to save another Na'vi member of the resistance. Na'vi enemies are much quicker and more resilient than even the toughest RDA mechs, making them feel more like mini-bosses (or full-on bosses) and more dangerous than any other enemy we've seen in Frontiers so far. The raider uses human weapons, like an assault rifle and grenades, so you need to keep moving and pick your moments to attack, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking down the raider kicks off a cinematic in which the Na'vi survivor is killed before So'lek emerges victorious. The loss unlocks one of the new abilities that makes So'lek stand apart from the Sarentu: Warrior Vision. It's basically an ultimate power that So'lek can charge up by dealing damage or taking hits from enemies. When you activate it, enemies are highlighted on your screen, and you deal additional damage while losing less health to enemy attacks, allowing you to storm through with overwhelming, rampaging force.</p><p dir="ltr">So'lek's rage soon has him fighting basically the entire RDA base at once, using Warrior Vision to identify and quickly clean up targets. The fight brings a few new enemies to bear against So'lek, including RDA mechs with new weapons like flamethrowers, and eventually, another Mongkwan raider. This all adds a new degree of chaos and challenge to Frontiers of Pandora's already fast, flowing combat, and it can be harrowing taking on a quick Na'vi fighter while the RDA are streaming in from the fringes of the battlefield. But between So'lek's Warrior Vision, agility, and weapons, the mission soon ends with all the RDA forces defeated.</p><p dir="ltr">Frontiers of Pandora adds a lot to the Avatar franchise by giving players a chance to meet and interact with different Na'vi and their clans. From the Ashes goes a step in a different direction, creating Na'vi enemies, which required a shift in mindset, O'Friel explained.</p><p dir="ltr">"With the Mongkwan, they are such different Na'vi--we've never seen any Na'vi like them before. We've always thought of Na'vi as being so peaceful and so attuned with nature, and these Na'vi are so destructive and so chaotic and so brutal. It was really kind of shocking to realize how far they will go," O'Friel said. "And then, of course, in From the Ashes, you will get to engage in combat against Na'vi for the first time, which we never had before, right? It was about really seeing what are the motivations of the Ash Clan, and what kind of motivations from the movie that we can carry through--like wanting to spread their fire, wanting to kind of subvert the will of Eywa."</p><p dir="ltr">The Mongkwan also offer a fascinating contrast to So'lek. For the Na'vi, using human technology goes against the will of Eywa, the deity or force that connects all life on Pandora. The Mongkwan are willing to use human technology because the clan has been cut off from Eywa and actively resents the deity. So'lek's use of those weapons is more pragmatic, but no less scorned by his fellow Na'vi.</p><p dir="ltr">"With So'lek, as well, we explore a little bit of his clan, the Trr'ong--he lost most of them in the Battle of the Hallelujah Mountains [which took place in the first Avatar movie]," O'Friel continued. "And we see him trying to hold on to remnants of who he was. But he also uses human weapons, which is also against the will of Eywa, but he does it for a different reason. He doesn't want to defy Eywa, but he believes that the best way to fight these kinds of people and the RDA is with their own weapons. So exploring those different views on Na'vi culture, and also that internal conflict that So'lek is having, like choosing to use weapons like this because he thinks is the best way forward, versus the Ash, who enjoy it because they know it's wrong--that was really fun to compare and contrast."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4616347-avatarfromtheashes1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616347" data-ratio="0.56245686680469" data-width="1449" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4616347-avatarfromtheashes1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616347"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4616347-avatarfromtheashes1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Saving the mastodon</h3><p dir="ltr">The second mission in the preview sets So'lek on the trail of the Beast, one of the three Mongkwan warlords now operating in the region. One of the best things about Frontiers of Pandora is that it generally eschews quest markers in favor of forcing you to explore areas, using your detective vision-like Na'vi Vision to search for clues and find your own way.</p><p dir="ltr">You first find evidence of the Beast when you discover a huge dirt path cut through the jungle, where the RDA moved heavy machinery. Following it, So'lek discovers evidence that the RDA have been capturing various animals--but it's unclear just what for.</p><p dir="ltr">The answers aren't far away, however. The path eventually leads you to a huge RDA facility, a Laser Ore Processor. Once again, you need to find your way in, and you have a couple of options. You can blast straight through the front door, taking on mechs and turrets, or you can go a sneakier route. I always prefer the careful planning required with stealth, as well as the chaos when it goes wrong, so I find an out-of-the-way side door, carefully dispatching a few mechs with stealthy takedowns to clear my path.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the Sarentu can hack different RDA devices in Frontiers of Pandora, So'lek has no such skill. Finding a hidden way into the base instead requires using the knife he previously took off a Mongkwan raider, which can short out machinery just like it can RDA mechs. But with water spraying from a broken pipe right over the door control mechanism, you first have to track down a nearby shutdown valve before you can break into the facility.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally sneaking in, it starts to become clear what's going on as you move past animal pens and scientific experiments: The RDA are trying to create weaponized and robotic versions of some of Pandora's dangerous animals, and the Mongkwan are helping them. As you head deeper into the facility, the RDA ambush you with a big group of Hell Hounds, doglike robots that are new to the expansion and love to attack you from behind with their electrically charged jaws.</p><p dir="ltr">Before much longer, you reach the major threat hidden within the Laser Ore Processor: a towering Fireback Mastodon the RDA has attached machinery to in order to drive it into a violent frenzy. Mechanical attachments on the mastodon's feet and back allow the RDA to remotely sting the creature, driving it to attack. Seeing the huge mastodon trampling toward you gives the sense of fighting a huge, fast, angry construction crane.</p><p dir="ltr">But the battle is also something of a keepaway game--So'lek's goal is to free the animal, not to harm it--which means you'll need to dodge its monstrous tusks and bait it into crashing through support pillars so you can stun it long enough to destroy the machinery attached to it. Every so often, RDA enemies stream in to stop you, but the mastodon can be as dangerous to them as it is to you, if you're quick enough to avoid its huge, sweeping tusks. As the fight continues, So'lek removes more and more of the mechanical pieces from the mastodon, before it bursts through a wall and you have to chase it into another room.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWHd5neGekk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mWHd5neGekk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The second half of the fight is a bit more of an environmental puzzle, since you need to get onto the mastodon's back to free it from the last few pieces of machinery. That means waiting for the creature to smash through walls and pipes that create a climbable path through the huge room you find yourself in, while you also fight RDA soldiers as they try to stop you with rockets and assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">The climb is a good highlight of the new third-person viewpoint mode, another major change coming to Frontiers with From the Ashes. Frontiers launched as a first-person game, but with the update that comes with the expansion, you can play it all in third-person if you so choose, which provides more awareness of your environment that can be useful in combat and in platforming. You also get a better sense of scale as you control So'lek, with the ability to see how he towers over humans and barely fits through RDA doorways, and the viewpoint makes a degree of narrative sense as you follow the story of So'lek, a fully formed character, at a bit more distance than you did with the Sarentu's.</p><p dir="ltr">In practice, though, third-person felt a little loose and floaty to me. The Na'vi are almost <em>too</em> agile; you can quickly cut sideways or back at a run as you're moving around the battlefield, and the animations supporting third-person mode end up looking unnatural as a result. Frontiers was originally designed as a first-person game, where that agility feels more natural and the ability to quickly change direction or scamper up a vertical wall to a new position elevates the game, giving you a lot of freedom. What you gain with third-person in situational awareness and easier, clearer platforming, you lose in feeling like a more natural part of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Principally, though, From the Ashes is just more Frontiers, and Frontiers is already a solidly fun open-world experience. I spent the rest of the preview wandering the open world, attacking different RDA facilities, some of which even had a Mongkwan mini-boss waiting in the wings to stop me as I sabotaged their machinery. The things that work about Frontiers, like its huge open world and the fun of playing as a fast, resilient, 10-foot-tall alien leaping over buildings made for six-foot humans, are still great in the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">From the Ashes builds on Frontiers of Pandora with a new story, a new protagonist, new abilities, new enemies, and a changed world, and all those things are welcome additions to an already strong foundation. Though I only got a short taste of the 25-hour addition, From the Ashes reminded me of what I liked about the game in the first place, while doing just enough to make the experience feel fresh all over again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Was The Most-Searched Game of 2025, Despite Dropping in October]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/</link>
            <guid>1373998</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Google Trends has just published its Year in Search report for 2025, and it uncovers a juicy tidbit about Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders, the all-new extraction adventure that has taken the gaming world by storm in the last few weeks. The game was released on October 30 to an overwhelmingly positive reception and has been on the upswing ever since.</p>



<p>Google’s new report revealed that, in 2025, ARC Raiders was the <strong>most-searched game</strong>, despite being released at the tail end of October. It beat all comers to hold the top spot, which is indicative of the sheer amount of interest around this game.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders has been scoring high in the review stakes, securing award nominations, and holding a consistent audience of hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. It’s arguably the most accessible extraction game ever made, and it has turned the tide for a genre otherwise thought of as being ‘too challenging’ for the average gamer.</p>



<p>That’s partly why ARC Raiders was the most-searched game in 2025 on Google, which was confirmed in a recent report published by the Google Trends team.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://trends.withgoogle.com/year-in-search/2025/">the full list</a>, and it might surprise you where certain games fall:</p>



<ol>
<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Strands</li>



<li>Split Fiction</li>



<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li>



<li>Path of Exile 2</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto 6</li>



<li>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</li>



<li>Minecraft</li>



<li>Roblox</li>
</ol>



<p>It might come as a shock to see GTA 6 so far down the line, but that’s mostly because it’s a case of gamers biding their time until news surfaces. There’s almost nothing to search for otherwise related to Grand Theft Auto 6. On the other hand, ARC Raiders has mission guides, item location tips, loadout walkthroughs, and more, all of which are being eagerly sought out by players far and wide.</p>







<p>It’s a well-deserved accolade for ARC Raiders, which has turned out to be a stunning game that has impressed players more than anyone truly expected. Embark Studios has promised to support the game for years to come, so only bright things are in store.</p>

<p>Activision hasn’t officially unveiled this season’s Call of Duty League skins, and until now, all we’ve seen is the default Call of Duty League Launch pack. That is, until one user on social media uploaded a video showcasing all the CDL 2026 skins in the Call of Duty store.</p>



<p>Thanks to the short video, we now know what every CDL 2026 skin looks like, and this year, they’re more customized per team than they have been in a minute, with a special focus on the skin’s face mask layout.</p>







<p>On social media, user RealityUK uploaded a two-minute video detailing every CDL 2026 Operator skin. This included a brief snapshot of every team competing in this season’s Call of Duty League:</p>



<ul>
<li>Boston Breach</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York</li>



<li>FaZe Vegas</li>



<li>G2 Minnesota</li>



<li>LA Thieves</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>OpTic Texas</li>



<li>Paris Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Riyadh Falcons</li>



<li>Toronto KOI</li>



<li>Vancouver Surge</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the full video, provided by Reality:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The feedback on the leaked CDL skins was mixed, with many coming to claim that their favorite teams were ‘done dirty’ by the skin designers. Many had issues with OpTic Texas’ skin in the video, one of which (the away skin) was almost a plain, stark white with no OpTic colorways.</p>



<p>One user wrote, <em>‘Why does OpTic look so barebones? They are getting more revenue this year the more people buy it’s not fixed anymore why did they go so basic I’m confused?’</em></p>



<p>What wasn’t revealed are the incoming weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and charms associated with each CDL team. It typically costs around $9.99 to purchase a CDL skin pack, and when doing so, you’ll unlock all the above, but all we’ve seen leaked thus far are the Operator skins themselves.</p>



<p>Is there a particular skin standing out to you? Let us know on the I<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">nsider Gaming Discord server</a> which you’d want to invest in.</p>

<p>To mark this occasion, Metacritic has now <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/pictures/every-metroid-game-ranked-worst-to-best/">rounded up <em>every</em> Metroid game</a> in its database to share a look at each title's metascore (based on the aggregate score of critic reviews). This includes not only the Prime games but also the spin-offs, Samus' 2D outings, and the re-releases.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are some omissions – including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> (NES, 1987), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid II: Return of Samus</a> (Game Boy, 1991), and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> (SNES, 1994), and that's simply because these games were released well before Metacritic even existed.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cemlwuov&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>One other thing to note is the metascore for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is based on the Switch 2 Edition of the game.

<p>Although these rankings are based on the aggregate of critic scores, if you're looking for a second opinion, we've got our own "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-metroid-games-of-all-time?page=2">best Metroid games of all time</a>" list here on Nintendo Life based on user ratings. The title at the top of our list is Super Metroid, with the original Prime entry in second place and Metroid Dread in third. We've not added Prime 4 to this list just yet.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Samus' latest adventure, be sure to check out both of our reviews. The Switch 2 version offers the best experience, but if you're not planning to get a Switch 2 anytime soon, the Switch version is still well worth picking up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>VALORANT Night Market, the special event that fans of the first-person arena shooter love, is set to return on December 11. This time around, the Night Market will remain open for almost a month, giving players a longer opportunity to secure their dream VALORANT skins.</p>



<p>As always, getting the skins you’re seeking in the Night Market isn’t a <strong>guaranteed thing</strong>, but if you do manage to swing the one you’re after, you’ll secure it at a hugely discounted price.</p>



<p>It’s a little bit of gacha, but it’s good fun for players, and it only comes around once every few months.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-valorant-night-market">When is the Next VALORANT Night Market?</h2>



<p>The next VALORANT Night Market has been revealed by Riot Games as coming on December 11. It’s set to run until January 6, giving you plenty of time to hopefully unlock the skins that you’re hunting in this gacha-style event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p><strong>How does the Night Market work?</strong></p>



<p>The VALORANT Night Market is a limited-time shop event that offers players six randomly selected weapon skins at discounted prices, ranging from 10% to 49%. The offers are unique per player, and only certain ‘collections’ are selected for the Night Market event.</p>



<p>You simply access the Night Market, click to reveal your discounted skins, and if you want them, you can buy them with a heavy discount. The only drawback is you’re never going to get bundle-exclusive skins or Ultra-tier skins.</p>



<h2 id="h-valorant-night-market-december-skins-act-6">VALORANT Night Market December Skins (Act 6)</h2>



<p>There are <strong>stacks </strong>of skins available in the Act 6 Night Market, which runs from December 11 to January 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem to Appear at The Game Awards]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-look-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>1373938</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new look at Resident Evil Requiem will be debuting at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-megabonk-nomination-withdrawal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>. The event is set to occur on December 11th, with Requiem one of the nominated titles.</p>



<p>Releasing on February 27th, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem marks the next chapter in the iconic horror franchise. Following Grace Ashcroft, you’ll return to Raccoon City and investigate a series of mysterious deaths. Fans have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveals-first-and-third-person-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seen a lot</a> of the title since its reveal last year, but with rampant rumors and leaks, it seems there’s a lot of mystery still left to discover. Luckily, it won’t be long before players can see more, as the Capcom title is set to show at one of the biggest gaming events of the year.</p>







<h2 id="h-new-look-at-resident-evil-requiem-debuting-at-the-game-awards">New Look at Resident Evil Requiem Debuting at The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1996731931103580519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> by The Game Awards’ official account, <strong>Resident Evil Requiem will be in attendance at the show</strong>. Specifically, <strong>a new look at the title will premiere</strong> at the award show, streaming on <strong>December 11th</strong>. It’s unknown the extent of the first look or content like gameplay or story. Either way, it’s more Resident Evil Requiem, and that’s not a bad thing whatsoever.</p>



<p>It’s a big night for the game, too, as it’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nominated for Most Anticipated Game</a>. Resident Evil Requiem is up against some heavy-hitters like Grand Theft Auto 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-wont-feature-at-the-game-awards-despite-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a>, 007 First Light, and Marvel’s Wolverine. Fortunately, given the series’ pedigree, with Village, 2 Remake, and 4 Remake getting GOTY nominations, its chances of taking some gold next year are quite good. In any case, there’s a lot more left to look forward to for Requiem as February 27th creeps up.</p>

<p>Many Switch games have been receiving compatibility updates for the Switch 2, and following an update to one of Square Enix's games earlier this week, it seems the indie developer Brace Yourself Games has now rolled out a fix for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a>.</p>

<p>We just released a patch to fix the issue that was causing the game to crash. Thank you for your patience, and happy gaming</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100cea007d08000">compatibility page</a> does not appear to reflect this fix at the time of writing, but if there are any other significant updates to this game, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Crypt of the NecroDancer originally made its debut on the Switch eShop in 2018. The developer's latest release is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> which is fully compatible on the Switch 2. The Zelda spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cadence_of_hyrule_crypt_of_the_necrodancer_featuring_the_legend_of_zelda">Cadence of Hyrule</a> is also compatible with Nintendo's new hardware.</p>
<p>This follows multiple compatibility updates last week after Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">released a new firmware update</a>.

<p>Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, known for his prolific career in film and TV, has passed away. His resume includes roles in The Man in the High Castle, Memories of a Geisha, and, for many, Shang Tsung in the Mortal Kombat film series. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/12/cary-hiroyuki-tagawa-dead-mortal-kombat-actor-1236636368/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, the Japanese actor died this morning, surrounded by family in California. His cause of death was due to complications of a stroke. The actor was only 75 years old.</p>

<p>Starting in 1986 with Big Trouble in Little China, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa had become a prevalent figure in many blockbusters in the 90s and 2000s. Films like License to Kill, Memories of a Geisha, Elektra, and Planet of the Apes brought the actor into the limelight. However, it was his portrayal of evil sorcerer Shang Tsung in the 1995 film adaptation of Mortal Kombat (and it’s 1997 sequel Mortal Kombat: Annihilation) that made him an icon. While the film was pure 90s, Cary’s devilish portrayal of Tsung was met with high praise, especially for the line “Your Soul is Mine!”.</p>



<p>In the 2010s, Tagawa found himself in roles in projects like The Man in the High Castle, 47 Ronin, and even an adaptation of Tekken as Heihachi Mishima. He even found himself reprising his role as Shang Tsung in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-500m-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 11</a>, available as DLC. Other video game credits of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa include Batman: Rise of Sin Tzu and Soldier Boyz.</p>



<p>Our thoughts go out to his family and friends during this difficult time.</p>

Using its transformation powers to pass itself off as a human, the Ditto works to restore the land and inspire other Pokemon to return.</p><p>Players won't just be limited to one island, as the Ditto can transform into a Lapras or Dragonite to reach new locations.

This means the physical cartridge will serve as an authentication device, and you'll still need to download the full game to your console. It is worth noting that Game Key Cards are not tied to your console, so you can resell them in the future if you choose to. The game will take up roughly 10GBs of space--so if you're planning to buy the game, you'll want to consider picking up a microSD Express card to increase your storage capacity.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-liquidates-tv-backlight-for-more-immersive-movies-now-selling-at-record-low-on-amazon-2000650582</link>
            <guid>1373914</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Govee had great deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but those sales are over now. However the company <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">just put this TV backlight (<em>3 Lite</em> model) on sale for a short time, bringing the price down to $58, down from $89</a>, which is the <strong>lowest price we’ve ever seen</strong>, matching the best Black Friday price. Amazon shows that 10% of stock has already moved, and these flash sales typically disappear fast once word gets out.</p>
<p>This lighting system fixes the problem of wanting immersive bias lighting that changes color with what’s on screen instead of just glowing a static color behind your TV. The camera-based sync technology<strong> reads what’s on your screen and projects those colors onto the wall behind your TV.</strong> This makes the room feel more inviting and makes movies and games more immersive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Fish-Eye Correction Makes Sync More Accurate</h2>
<p>The camera on top of your TV records what’s on the screen and analyzes it in real time to<strong> figure out what colors should be on each part of the LED strip</strong>. Traditional ambient lighting systems have trouble being accurate because cameras distort the images they take, especially at the edges where fish-eye warping makes it hard to tell what color it is.</p>
<p>This <strong>model has built-in fish-eye correction</strong> which means that the camera applies inverse distortion to the image it takes before it analyzes colors. This means that the lighting matches what is happening on screen instead of showing vague approximations: You can see this more clearly in scenes with clear color zones, like a sunset on one side of the screen and dark shadows on the other.</p>



<p>The<strong> RGBICW LED setup has red, green, blue, independent cool white, and warm white chips</strong> in each lamp bead. This lets you choose from four different colors for each segment along the strip. This multi-chip design makes the system better at making whites and pastels than RGB-only strips, which make white by mixing red, green, and blue at full brightness. The separate white chips also let you use these lights as functional bias lighting with the right white temperatures when you’re not watching something that needs color sync. The <strong>11.8-foot length is long enough to cover 55-65 inch TVs</strong> with enough strip to run along three sides of the display which makes the wrap-around effect without the need for complicated multi-strip installations.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up: You just have to clean the back of your TV, stick the LED strip along the edges, put the camera on top of the display, and plug everything into the adapter that comes with it. To accurately detect colors, the camera needs to be able to see your whole screen clearly. So, you should place it in the middle and make sure that soundbars or other equipment don’t block it.</p>



<p>You can also<strong> control the lights through the Govee Home app if you have Wi-Fi</strong>: The app lets you choose from different scene modes, colors, and sync sensitivity settings that change how quickly the lights respond to changes on the screen. You can turn down the reactivity during fast-paced action scenes that would otherwise cause distracting strobing effects, or turn up the sensitivity for subtler content where you want even small color changes to show up in the ambient lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to screen sync, <strong>the system has several preset modes</strong>: These include music sync, which changes colors to the beat of the music, static colors for ambient lighting, and scene modes that are meant for certain moods or activities. In music mode, your phone’s microphone picks up beats and rhythms and makes lights that react to the sound in the room. These other modes make the strip useful for more than just watching movies.</p>
<p>This $31 discount is 34% off which means that premium TV bias lighting is now in the impulse-buy range, where you can try it without making a big financial commitment. For less than the cost of basic RGB strips that don’t have any sync features, you get camera-based screen sync with fish-eye correction, RGBICW color capabilities, and smart home integration.</p>

<p>From the developers of Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of retro-style first-person shooters and want to eradicate swarms of alien bugs, you might want to check out this new game when it arrives in early 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/starship-troopers-ultimate-bug-war">Starship Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!</a> is developed by Auroch Digital (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warhammer_40000_boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>) and published by Dotemu (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>), and will be coming to the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>Here's some additional information, and you can listen to General Johnny Rico's recruitment message in the video above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set 25 years after the events of the original <em>Starship</em> Troopers film, this heroic campaign follows war veteran Samantha Dietz as she recounts her hunt for the dreadful Assassin Bug during the First Bug War. Relive her experiences as you annihilate the Arachnids on their familiar home world of Klendathu and journey to all new worlds like Planet P and beyond in this streamlined solo campaign, with access to a devastating arsenal of 14 weapons (including the iconic Morita rifle), 11 Tactical Supports and a Mech vehicle in a gloriously gory 3D pixelated combat simulation.</p>
<p>Citizens looking to prepare themselves to the fullest extent can utilize <em>Starship</em> Troopers: Ultimate Bug War!’s anti-bug combat training, where you can play from the perspective of the Bugs, and prepare for the skills they need to erase the insectoid threat.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-ps5-slim-playstation-5-pro-at-new-record-low-if-you-want-to-play-at-pro-level-2000650592</link>
            <guid>1373902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony extended Cyber Monday deals by a few extra days with <strong>discounts still active on the PS5 Pro</strong>, DualSense controllers, and PS VR headsets. If you want the <strong>ultimate PlayStation experience with Sony’s most powerful console</strong>, this is it, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">currently sitting at $648 instead of the usual $749 in a record low deal</a>.</p>
<p>This pricing matters because the performance gap between the Pro and the standard PS5 Slim becomes impossible to ignore once you see games running at their maximum potential. The enhanced GPU, advanced ray tracing, and AI upscaling technology solve the compromises that force regular PS5 owners to choose between fidelity and performance modes in demanding titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How the Pro Changes the Way You Play Games</h2>
<p>The <strong>PS5 Pro has a GPU with 67% more compute units</strong> than the standard PS5 Slim, and it means that you get higher frame rates and more detailed graphics without having to change the quality settings. The PS5 Slim can only run games at 30 frames per second in fidelity mode, but the <strong>Pro can run them at 60 frames per second</strong> while keeping the same visual quality which means you don’t have to choose between smooth gameplay and beautiful graphics. You can see this right away in games like Spider-Man 2 or Horizon Forbidden West, where the Pro can handle densely populated cityscapes and complicated environments without the performance drops that sometimes happen on the base console during intense action scenes.</p>



<p>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution uses machine learning to make lower-resolution images look almost like 4K: This is similar to how NVIDIA’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR work on PC graphics cards. The AI algorithm looks at each frame and adds detail that wasn’t there in the original render and makes the images sharper while keeping the frame rate high. This <strong>technology lets games render at 1440p or 1800p inside and output at 4K with clarity that rivals native 4K rendering</strong>. It also keeps the performance headroom needed for 60fps or higher refresh rates.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim already has great capabilities but advanced ray tracing hardware makes reflections, shadows, and lighting calculations twice as fast. Instead of flat or wrong screen-space approximations, realistic reflections in puddles, windows, and metal surfaces show up with the right depth and clarity. Ray-traced implementations that take into account complex geometry and light sources make shadows that act like real-world physics instead of the harsh, simplified shadows that traditional rasterization makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>console still has great DualSense controller support, fast SSD loading times, and 3D audio processing</strong> which were all things that made the original PS5 so impressive when it came out. Games still load in seconds instead of minutes, and the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers still give players a physical experience that sets PlayStation exclusives apart from games on other platforms.</p>
<p>The base models of the Slim have 1TB or 825GB of storage, <strong>while the base models of the Slim have 2TB</strong>. This is important because modern games often take up more than 100GB of space so here you can keep twice as many games without having to deal with external drives or constantly deleting old games to make room for new ones.</p>
<p>This $101 discount brings the price of premium PlayStation games closer to the price of the base console, but the performance is still worth the difference. You’re getting a machine that doesn’t make you choose between fidelity and performance, doubles your storage space, and makes sure your setup will work with future games that will push hardware harder.</p>

At the same time, he looks for clues concerning his missing girlfriend Juliet, and quickly comes to find both her disappearance and the destruction of space may be more linked than he thought.

The first two are based on the twin Rathalos that the main characters ride on their adventure, and the third is a figure of the party's Palico companion, Rudy. While Nintendo has shown off all three figures, we don't yet know when they're launching or how much each will cost, and none are available for preorder yet. We'll update this section once more information is announced.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection follows an all-new story and cast of characters, making it a great jumping-on point if you haven't played the first two games in the series. However, since we're still a few months out from the game's launch, now is a great time to check out the earlier entries if you're curious. The best way to grab them is with the Monster Hunter Stories Collection, which includes Monster Hunter Stories Remastered and Monster Hunter Stories II: Wings of Ruin in one package.

The Switch version of the game is playable on the Switch 2. Monster Hunter Stories Collection is also available digitally on PS4 and Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Stories 3 is a new RPG set in the world of Monster Hunter. Unlike the mainline series that's focused on repeatedly hunting the franchise's massive fauna, the Stories spinoffs are narrative-focused adventures that follow Monster Riders, a culture that lives in cooperation with the Monsters, rather than hunting them. Players capture and raise a roster of monsters, then team up with them in turn-based combat and use their special abilities to aid in exploring the vast overworld and dungeon-like monster dens. Monster Hunter Stories 3 changes up the formula with a new art style and a dual-protagonist focus, with the player's unnamed hero joining forces with Eleanor, the princess of a rival kingdom, to investigate an omen that could signal an oncoming calamity that threatens both characters' homelands. We got a chance to go hands-on with the game back in September, so be sure to check that out for more information on how the RPG is shaping up so far.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1710319653"
