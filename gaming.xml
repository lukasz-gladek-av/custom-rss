            <p>Thousands of creators today found their Itch.io projects missing from the online storefront - effectively delisted to anyone searching or browsing the site. Others still are reporting<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luolkqglj22c"> actual takedowns "with no notice"</a>, halted payouts, and those who have previously purchased their games <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luolkqglj22c">being unable to download them</a>.</p>
<p>Going by one image posted on the Itch Discord and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/daff.space/post/3luounfexf22c">shared on Bluesky</a> by game developer Daffodil, filtering by the site's 'NSFW' category previously showed 28,114 results. It now shows 7,008.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>After creators were left in limbo for several hours, Itch.io posted <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">a statement</a> clarifying that they'd "deindexed" all NSFW work content from their browse and search pages, following "a campaign" against them and Steam by the Collective Shout organisation, that targeted payment providers "due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April".</p>
<p>Collective Shout describe themselves as a "grassroots campaigns movement against the objectification of women and the sexualisation of girls", but are associated with outspokenly homophobic and anti-abortion Christian conservative groups, according to a <a href="https://archive.ph/x5cGQ#selection-1137.55-1137.118">now-deleted Vice article</a>. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">claimed credit for the campaign</a> that saw payment providers pressuring the online storefronts to remove content the group deemed unacceptable.</p>
<p>"Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform," reads Itch's statement. "To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance."</p>
<p>"This is a time critical moment for itch.io," the statement continues. "The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change."</p>
<p>It's not hard to empathise with the folks behind Itch for being placed in an impossible position, but their lack of forewarning has left creators blindsided and in some cases, seemingly without income. "I wish we had gotten some warning from Steam and Itch," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiatoryang.bsky.social/post/3luokzr44d22p">wrote game developer Robert Yang</a> on Bluesky, "but we already know it's Collective Shout + payment processors waging culture war against LGBTQ people and sexual expression. I guess there's nothing else for Steam and Itch to say".</p>
<p>Itch say they're currently "conducting a comprehensive audit" to meet their payment processor's requirements, and that affected pages will remain "deindexed" in the meantime. New compliance measures will follow. "For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account".</p>
<p>"Part of this will see some pages being permanently removed from itch.io," the statement concludes. We can get an idea of the parameters here from Itch's own notices sent to some creators. These include "sexualised images or videos of real-life humans", "AI generated imagery that is designed to resemble photographic content of real people", "content glorifying sexual violence", and that depicting "minors, minor-presenting, or suggested minors". Which, taken in good faith, are all in line with what you'd expect and hope for.</p>
<p>Personally speaking, I'd be willing to extend that good faith to Itch.io themselves, but they aren't the one holding the gun to their own heads here. That'd be financial companies, pressured by Collective Shout, who themselves have ties to an organisation whose CEO once described gay marriage as an "unspeakable offence to God". It's not difficult to imagine what kind of expression these groups might decide to deem as unacceptable next.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects]]></content:encoded>

Following the brief hosting of a game called <em>No Mercy</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725?_gl=1*khhomg*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMxODIyODckbzE3JGcxJHQxNzUzMzQ0ODYxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725?_gl=1*khhomg*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMxODIyODckbzE3JGcxJHQxNzUzMzQ0ODYxJGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">both Steam and Itch became the target of a great deal of media attention</a></span>, with the game eventually pulled from sale by both its hosts and its creators.</p><p>At the time, Valve were removing only extreme porn titles, almost all related to rape and incest, leading many to find the move difficult to oppose. Others pointed out that such moves, when carried out as haphazardly and unclearly as this—with responsibility for content guidelines handed to external financial corporations—inevitably lead to overreach, and LGBTQ+ games and those that explore controversial topics will always be the first to be unfairly affected. As we wrote last week,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> One of the real positives of Valve’s incredibly liberal approach to what it will sell is that it allows incredibly complex and difficult topics to be explored by brave developers. People regularly interrogate their own traumas through visual novels and interactive fiction, while others explore their sexual kinks via similar mediums. Victims of incest might want to create incredibly challenging games that process such experiences in healthy and productive ways—what happens here if it’s to turn out that “certain kinds” of adult themes includes such topics?</p></blockquote><p>On July 23, far more extreme moves were made by Itch.io, the colossal indie game store <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085">best known for its massive fundraising drives for various causes</a></span>. It “shadow banned” every single game marked “NSFW” (“not safe for work”) on the store, meaning they would not appear on the store’s main pages, nor in indexed search results. Without a direct link, any such game is now impossible to find. In this process, swathes of LGBTQ+ games have vanished from the online store, including titles from high profile LGBTQ+ developers like Robert Yang. (You can still find all of Yang’s games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://radiatoryang.itch.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://radiatoryang.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via his direct link</a></span> if you’re logged in.)</p><p>Even more extraordinarily, this year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://igf.com/entry/2025/consume-me&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://igf.com/entry/2025/consume-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seumas McNally Grand Prize award winner at the prestigious IGF Awards</a></span>, <em>Consume Me</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is no longer appearing on Itch. (You <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2359120/Consume_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can still find it on Steam</a></span>.) The game, a piece about disordered eating during teenage years, is a semi-autobiographical work that bravely explores a complex and difficult topic. Its developer, Jenny Jiao Hsia, responsibly marked the game as “adult” on Itch due to the sensitive topic and occasional semi-nudity, and as such her game is now delisted.</p><p>Collective Shout is an anti-porn Australian pressure group that has learned by applying pressure to payment providers, it can indirectly control the content of sites that depend on online payments. In response to their recent actions, carried out in the name of “challenging the objectification of women and sexualization of girls in media, advertising and popular culture,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.collectiveshout.org/gamers-threats-and-abuse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/gamers-threats-and-abuse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they have been inundated with wretched online misogyny</a></span>. Obviously many will be very receptive to their stated goals of protecting children from porn and objecting to games that simulate rape. Others will point out that the blunt tools of censorship used do little to educate audiences, and inevitably lead to vast amounts of collateral damage.</p><p>It seems reasonably likely that <em>Consume Me</em> will return to Itch after the site’s “comprehensive audit of content,” given how egregious it is that it should be removed in any situation. But what about the games exploring topics related to gay sex by Yang? Or the thousands and thousands of other sex- and kink-based games that are now missing? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch’s statement</a></span> says it plans to “introduce new compliance measures,” where NSFW games will be required to “confirm their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account.”</p><p>“This is a time critical moment for itch.io,” the statement reads. “The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change.”</p><p>Again, what is “allowable” according to payment processors is the most extraordinary deferment of responsibility, and of course an ever-shifting goalpost that developers can never be in a position to discern. Mastercard and Visa’s moral objections seem like the most bewildering standard to adhere to, and are already being wielded without any notion of nuance. What is the difference in the eyes of a behemothic financial corporation between a porn game about incestuous rape, and an introspective game in which a developer interrogates their own childhood experiences of incestuous rape?</p><p>“We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period,” says Itch of its sudden and sweeping move. “I’m sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves.”</p><p>We’ve reached out to Itch to ask when the store will resume sales of games that clearly aren’t in violation of any standards issues, and to see if we can get any clarity regarding how developers are supposed to know what it “allowable” in the eyes of payment processors.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to Epic, the CMA has "deprioritized store competition entirely, to be considered sometime in 2026." It references the EU's Digital Markets Act as a benchmark for allowing alternative app stores on mobile devices, citing a number of alternative stores that have sprung up in Europe including AltStore, Aptoide, and its own Epic Games Store.</p><p>"The CMA also made a vague announcement about allowing developers to steer customers to payment service outside of apps, without referencing the kinds of restrictions, obstructions and junk fees that Apple introduced in Europe to make a mockery of the Digital Markets Act," Epic's statement continues. "Unless Apple and Google are completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment, we can expect years of malicious compliance ahead."</p><p>Epic again references one of its previous legal battles here, saying that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-asks-court-to-force-apple-to-return-fortnite-to-us-app-store/1100-6531659/" data-ref-id="1100-6531659">recent US court order against Apple</a> has set the standard by outlawing all fees and obstructions on apps that choose to direct customers to external payment services.</p><p>"Today's bleak news from the United Kingdom contrasts to the stronger pro-competition actions of other regions," Epic concludes, though the company will no doubt continue to put pressure on the CMA to introduce stronger antitrust laws targeting Apple and Google. Outside of its victories in Europe and the US, Epic says that the Epic Games Store will also be launched in Brazil and Japan later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p><span>Image of Xbox controller via Microsoft </span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The video game industry is notoriously volatile. Companies hire up in the midst of development, when there's lots to do—character dialogue to write, bodies to animate, and systems to code. Then come the cuts: Once a video game is released, people are laid off. Not everyone, of course; enough workers are kept on to update and maintain the game, and, eventually, start on a new project. Development happens in cycles, and those cycles have consistently left developers on edge. Layoffs were a constant hum long before the pandemic, but over the past several years, that hum has become a deafening roar.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2022, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">a crowd-sourced layoff tracker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from developer Farhan Noor recorded 8,500 layoffs. That number jumped to an unsettling 10,500 in 2023, and 14,600 in 2024. Now, in 2025, Noor's layoff tracker lists this year's layoffs at 4,000. While 2024 was almost certainly the peak of the grim years-long trend, layoffs are still an issue. Seven months into 2025, the 4,000 people estimated to have been laid off is likely a conservative number. (The tracker hasn't been updated since July 9, and several totals are unlisted, as those numbers haven't been released or published.) But to compare the years, by June 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/24177290/video-game-industry-layoffs-studio-closures-record">more than 10,000 people had been laid off</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/mobile-dev-sandsoft-is-laying-off-around-65-employees-and-closing-two-studios" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mobile dev Sandsoft is laying off around 65 employees and closing two studios</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, it still feels like layoffs are as constant and looming as ever. Hundreds of people were laid off in July across more than a dozen studios, led by massive cuts at Microsoft, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-begins-latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-with-cuts-at-king-and-zenimax">which laid off 9,000 tech workers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including at least hundreds at its video game companies. Game Developer wrote about layoffs at four different studios on Tuesday alone. Support studio Virtuos, Wardogs developer Bulkhead, Myst maker Cyan Worlds, MindsEye creator Build a Rocket Boy, and many others are among the studios recently making cuts, while Riot Games recently canceled its long-gestating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hytale</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> project from Hypixel Studios. Even if the numbers show slowing layoff rates, it certainly doesn't feel like it when multiple studios are cutting staff in a single day. The industry and its people will still be feeling the impacts of it for years to come.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What goes up must come down—but thousands of workers are still being laid off">What goes up must come down—but thousands of workers are still being laid off</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Amir Satvat, a Tencent business developer who runs an online community that helps laid off&nbsp;game workers find jobs, wrote in February that hiring has started to match the rate at which people are getting laid off.

People spent a lot of money on video games when they were stuck at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Games were both a thing to do and a place for socialization. Investors saw that number going up—way up—and injected the industry with more cash. Companies hired more people to keep up with the growth. But the massive growth was never sustainable, and when that line plateaued, companies realized they'd overinvested and overextended. Companies started to make cuts—lots of them. The video game industry has returned to growth in 2025 following a plateau in 2024, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/into-the-data-pc-console-gaming-report-2025">according to a Newzoo report from June</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

People are feeling the impact of inflation; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/23/trump-tariffs-inflation-back-to-school-shopping.html">everything is more expensive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It means consumers don't have as much money to spend on video games—especially young people, who are spending 25 percent less on video games, according to data analysis from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/young-american-consumer-spending-cut-f2b482e5">the Wall Street Journal</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's something that is sure to impact revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One big change that sets 2025 apart from the past several years, though, is that hiring is beginning to match the rate at which people are being laid off. Headcounts are up across several studios (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose">as Game File reported earlier this year</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) despite several of those companies making layoffs. Hiring isn't typically publicized in the same way as layoffs, so it often happens in the background. Similarly, companies like Electronic Arts, when they make layoffs, might attempt to place laid off employees elsewhere in the business, which could account for at least some of the headcount differentials. North American workers appear to be impacted the most, perhaps because it’s one of the more expensive labor markets. Some of that growth in headcount could be a result of expansion in lower-cost areas.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game companies are hiring, but the job market is saturated and knowledge is scattered">Game companies are hiring, but the job market is saturated and knowledge is scattered</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though hiring has increased—and now remains stable—it would be foolish to believe it's easy for a laid off worker to find a job. It's not. The sheer number of people looking for work in the video game industry means there is now a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ton</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of competition. Nearly 40,000 people have been laid off, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025">according to community trackers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That's a lot of people attempting to navigate the job market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's also vital to acknowledge the impact layoffs have on developers and the projects they're working on. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/709144/microsoft-layoffs-2025-ai-notepad">As The Verge reported in July</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the layoffs at Microsoft are creating a culture of fear at the company.

Video games are complicated, expensive endeavours. A successful studio is one that pulls the collective knowledge and experience of its team </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>through</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development cycles. If you lose that, you might lose the key to success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This carcass of workers that remains is somehow supposed to keep shipping award-winning games," ZeniMax Media senior QA tester and ZWU-CWA member Autumn Mitchell told Game Developer, explaining the difficult reality facing those developers left behind at The Elder Scrolls maker after Microsoft kicked some employees with decades of knowledge to the curb. "I don't really know [how that works]. It looks like a lot of people moving between projects to fill in the position of someone who was laid off—and it probably took them a good six months to figure out [how to do that role effectively]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One company that’s often cited as an example of what happens when you keep teams together and resist sweeping layoffs is Nintendo. Indeed, newly-published data reflects Nintendo's ability to keep employees on board. Just yesterday, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-employee-data-indicates-the-company-excels-at-retaining-workers">Game Developer printed numbers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from a newly-updated investor relations page that showed Nintendo Japan employees stay at the company for an average of 14.4 years. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theverge.com/24191650/nintendo-sega-from-software-japan-video-game-layoffs">Japan has more labor protections for employees</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which certainly plays a part in why employees stick around, too. The turnover rate is a stunning 1.9 percent in Japan and 5.1 percent at Nintendo of America. You can see the way Nintendo builds upon its past in its games; </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a perfect example of how institutional knowledge leads to massive success. That game could not have been made without the learnings of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and, before that, what developers had learned from their time working together on systems.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's nothing about a culture of fear of being laid off that’s going to be good for people making games and the games they're making.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has received one last patch in its early access journey ahead of a full release, though there's still no release date.</p>
<p>This new patch, the eleventh, includes "further improvements, balance adjustments, and fixes based on your feedback and what we've observed" developer Supergiant Games stated in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512964244473382774">Steam blog post on the patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>There's a long list of minor tweaks, adjusting the balance of multiple weapons and boons, as well as changes to enemy encounter rates, adjusted visuals and music, and of course some bug fixes.</p>

<p>The developer also noted: "In preparation for our v1.0 launch and forthcoming story sequences surrounding the True Ending, please note that any Zodiac Sand or Void Lens resources you have when you load your save progress at that time will automatically be converted to Prestige."</p>
<p>Still, what we're all after is a full release date, and there's no sign of that yet.</p>
<p>Hades 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-fresh-early-access-update-as-development-finally-approaches-full-release">received a sizable update back in June</a>. "We're heading into the final phase of Hades 2 development, which involves adding the story's true ending and other finishing touches," said Supergiant at the time. "Please note we do not yet have a v1.0 launch date, though we'll share more as soon as we can."</p>
<p>For now, Hades 2 is available in early access on Steam, but its full launch will include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-is-coming-to-switch-1-2-as-a-timed-console-exclusive">release on both Switch and Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive</a> - just like the first game (after its own PC early access period).</p>
<p>The original Hades later arrived on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and then iOS.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-gets-one-final-early-access-patch-before-full-10-release]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes, our technology is designed purely to perform a function, but most companies also try to make things look good at the same time, like the Edifier QR65 Active Monitor. This is a speaker set with multiple connection options and powerful audio, but it’s the RGB lighting that make this a showstopping feature for any computer or living room setup.</p>
<p><iframe title="Edifier QR65 - Desktop Active Monitor with GaN Charger" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pO4l_RsIvJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Edifier QR65 immediately feels like a high-quality premium product thanks to the classy white packaging they arrive in. Pulling them from the box reveals two chunky speaker units, with our review unit coming in black, soft-touch leatherette, the two drivers set within a glass panel at the front, the Edifier logo sitting beneath. The QR65 also come with additional silver stands to angle them upwards, each embossed with ‘A Passion For Sound’. There’s plenty of weight to each of the speakers, and first impressions are very strong. This is good considering the £329.99/$369.99 price tag.</p>


<p>The QR65 comes with an impressive list of features, starting with the 70W power output, Hi-Res Audio classification, digital and analogue wired inputs, through to Bluetooth 5.3 with the ability to accept the Hi-Res LDAC codec and three GaN 65W charging ports for your other devices. If you’re looking for a set that’s going to sit of the centre of the multimedia experience, it’s a great start.</p>
<p>The RGB lighting is the key selling point, though. The Edifier QR65 are stunning, with a mirrored infinity view-styled design seeing the coloured bands of light disappearing into the speaker unit themselves. There’s an array of different lighting effects available as well, capable of cycling through different colourways, and effects including breathing, cascade and solid. My favourite are the reactive effects though, with the lighting moving and shifting in time with the music or audio you’re playing.</p>


<p>They also serve as a visual representation of the volume control, the banding rolling around the speaker front as you turn the dial or increase your Bluetooth volume. Visually, these are amongst the best speakers out there, providing far more of a focal point than most of the unassuming speakers out there.</p>
<p>Control is via a sleek metal panel on the right-hand speaker unit. This houses a power button which takes double duty, cycling through the different input settings of Bluetooth, USB and line in. The top dial is your multimedia control, controlling volume, while one quick press serves as Play/Pause. The second dial controls the light effects, rotating through a series of different options, while the button control lets you switch into changing the brightness of the lighting. It’s about as refined as you’ll likely to get, though for the setup on my desk, it did mean the controls were tucked away in a corner.</p>
<p>You likely won’t be needing to use the controls all that much though, with all of the multimedia devices you’re likely to be linking able to control the volume that’s being input to them. There’s also the Edifier Connex app – available for Android and iOS – which lets you make changes to the speaker setup and its lighting in a clearer, and more bespoke way.</p>
<p>Here you can choose specific colourways, helping to make sure everything in your setup matches, and there’s a simple setup here, with presets to choose from, or a whole three colour gradient option to choose the exact colour you want. You can also dig further into the speaker’s setup here, activating the Bluetooth LDAC codec, checking out charging rates and more.</p>

<p>Connecting the QR65 is as straightforward as you’d hope, with the multiple ports at the back of the right-hand speaker unit doing exactly what they should. Connecting to PC was easy, with the speakers appearing as a output device the moment it was plugged in. It’s worth noting that the most frustrating piece of design of the whole unit is the coloured RGB that’s supposed to indicate what connection type it’s connected to. It’s a single light, and if you’ve forgotten what it was most recently set to, you can end up pressing it more times than entirely necessary. A switch selector would have been much clearer.</p>
<p>The audio output sounds as good as you’d expect for a speaker set that costs north of £300. This is a beautifully detailed speaker set, with plenty of heft and bottom end provided by the bass ports on the rear of each speaker unit. I’ve been playing the new Sleep Token album almost exclusively for weeks, and you’re able to pick out the elements of each instrument, whether it’s the plaintive piano notes and delicate vocal moments or the heavy-hitting guitars and screams.</p>
<p>The QR65 are very directional though. Sat in front of them at my computer, they sound absolutely stunning, particularly with Hi-Res music sources pumping through them. However, stepping away from the desk does make you realise that there isn’t quite the same bass response or room-filling audio that you find with speakers from Sonos, or smart-speakers from Apple or Amazon. You can, however, connect an external sub, and I feel that this completely rectifies the issue, but it’s a shame to need an additional accessory.</p>

<p>I think it’ll depend as well on the type of music you normally listen to. The QR65’s response sits much more in monitor category, and I feel that they’d be perfect for jazz, lo-fi beats and classical as well as being an excellent pick for music and audio editing. If you want room-filling rock, metal or drum and bass, you’ll likely want an external sub, or to look elsewhere.</p>
<p>That also stays true for gaming. These have proven to be excellent speakers for playing FPS titles, and the enhanced detail and precision of the audio made locating enemies easier. It also does a great job with more classically composed soundtracks like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, but without an external sub you definitely lose out on the heft and drama of more bombastic titles like Doom: The Dark Ages. If aesthetics are your number one consideration, then there are few options that come close to the QR65, but in terms of gaming audio, they may not quite fit the bill depending on your preferred genre.</p>

            <p>Right, here we go, this is gonna have to be be quicker than the tempo of your average Motorhead thrashathon. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brutal-legend">Brütal Legend</a>, the heavy metal action-adventure Double Fine put out on console back in 2009 (before coming to their senses and doing a PC port in 2013), is free to grab as I write this, but won't be for much longer.</p>
<p>Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/jul/22/ozzy-osbourne-black-sabbath-frontman-and-icon-of-british-heavy-metal-dies-aged-76">the death</a> of Black Sabbath frontman and general face of the metal Ozzy Osbourne earlier this week, the studio have decided to give out the game in which he talks to a roadie voiced by Jack Black for zilch. However, it's a deal that kicked off in the dead of the night UK time, and isn't set to run for much longer.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Brütal Legend became <a href="https://doublefine.itch.io/brutal-legend">free to claim </a>via PC storefront Itch.io right as July 23rd flipped over into July 24rd (UK time-wise) this morning, with the deal running for a very apt 666 minutes. That equates to 11 hours or so, meaning that as I write this, you've got just under an hour and a half left to claim the game without paying a penny.</p>
<p>Well, unless you decide you want to make a tip/donation to the devs, as Itch allows you to do on checkout. If you do take up the deal, you get versions of the game for Windows and Ubuntu, plus both 64 and 32 bit Mac editions.</p>

<p>Our Alec wrote the following about it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brutal-legend-review-pc">when it debuted on PC</a>:</p>
<blockquote>Brütal Legend looks wonderful, and it feels wonderful, but it isn't quite wonderful, not really. It's ideas without an anchor and, I am quite sure, were any developer other than Double Fine attempting to stitch these floating fancies together this game would frequently be intolerable. Fortunately it is Double Fine, and the game's wit, charm and huge personality, both in writing and in visual style, do turn out to be capable bindings for the loose collective of brainstorming within.</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-july-2025-everything-revealed">Ghost of Yotei’s very own State of Play showcase</a>, we sat down for a chat with creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell to talk about what we saw of Sucker Punch’s upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive — and what we were left wondering about. Read on for answers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The backdrop of Ghost of Tsushima was a real-life invasion by Mongol forces on the island of Tsushima. With Ghost of Yotei, what's the historical setting of what's going on in Japan at this time and how will that play into Atsu’s journey?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> The game takes place in the year 1603. Peace has just broken out in Japan after decades and decades of civil war and there are a lot of sellswords that suddenly are out of work. So they travel north to the edge of the Japanese empire, an island called Ezo, modern day Hokkaido. And this place becomes a powder keg. It's very, very dangerous with all these sellswords walking around trying to make a buck. This moment in history combined with the beauty of Ezo, these lush mountainscapes and forests and rivers, creates a dynamite combination for an open world game, and it's where we wanted to set Atsu’s quest for vengeance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: During your presentation at the State of Play, you mentioned that Ghost of Yotei focuses on more freedom than any game Sucker Punch has ever made. That's a large claim considering the amount of freedom that was already offered in Ghost of Tsushima, I can definitely attest to that. Can you elaborate on some of the ways in which you've enhanced the feeling of freedom compared to what the player could already do in Ghost of Tsushima?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> When we started to think about what the next game would be for us at Sucker Punch, we really had to take stock of what we loved and what our fans really loved, and how we saw people play Ghost of Tsushima. And one of the aspects of Tsushima that we wanted to carry forward was the sense of exploration. We saw people play very wide in their experience. We saw some people drop 80, 90 hours and just exploring and using modes like photo mode just to soak in the nature and the beauty of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That really resonated with us. We're big wide players as well, so when we set out to make Yotei, especially once we decided that it was going to take place in Hokkaido — back then it was called Ezo, this vast, vast landscape that just frankly had a nice overlap with us having a desire to have a more open game design because it's such a vast place — led us to a whole host of features, ranging from simple utility features like spyglass, being able to pull your spyglass up really quickly and look around the environment really is the way that I think Nate and I both really love to play, just see something on the horizon and go to it, to traversal features. We have flower streams that are just woven into the environment and help you get across vast landscapes. If you follow those flowers you'll get a little bit of a speed boost because they're joyful for Atsu to ride in, but they also might lead you to something. Or developing features like our clue system, or camping features, which just really celebrate the wilds of Ezo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: One of the coolest moments at the State of Play was the seamless switch from present day to Atsu’s past when she was looking around the remnants of her childhood home, and then you actually saw her reliving those memories in the past with just the press of a button. I wondered where this idea came from, and is it the kind of thing where it'll be tied to specific spots throughout the game world, so there'll be an area where it's clearly time to switch back to the past? Or is it up to the player to discover those for themselves?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> In Ghost of Yotei there are a number of places in the world that Atsu visits in which she has a lot of memories from her youth. And at the touch of a button, you can go back into the past and you control Atsu as a child, you get to play as her interacting with her brother and her parents and other people in Ezo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted you to be able to really control her as a kid so that you would feel like you knew what her life was like, you could experience that, and of course because this shows you what she lost. It’s a feature we really love because the player is in command, they can hit the button to go back and see what it used to be like and then hit it again and see what it's like now, comparing and contrasting for instance, what her own homestead looked like in her youth to what it looks like now after it's been run down by weather and lack of use, it's become a ruin. So you get to see the before and after of her experience in the landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So was it from day-one work on the sequel? Did you know that you were starting fresh with a brand new character, or were there ever some initial ideas for maybe continuing Jin’s story on after the events of Ghost of Tsushima?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> For us at Sucker Punch, one of the things that, especially if you look back on our catalog of games, we have a deep love for making origin stories. It's something we have a lot of passion for. We like coming up with those stories, those arcs, the characterizations, how they might come through in the game experience, what type of features it might sort of spark as we create this new character. And so really from the beginning we knew that we were going to be charting on new territory here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then once we pretty quickly started looking at Hokkaido and this region and this time period and just how vast and stunning and big and filled with wilderness, and you combine that with this idea of doing a tale of vengeance where Atsu is hunting someone inside of that landscape, it was just such a great match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not hunting for somebody in a safe environment. This is a massive landscape that she'll be going under quite an undertaking hunting them here. We felt like that was an exciting connection. I'll say also the story of the folk legend of the onryō, this Japanese folk legend of tale of vengeance, often women who've been wronged in life and now they've come back to seek vengeance, we got really excited about that folk legend and decided that we were going to inject that pretty heavily into our version of a Ghost story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei Popcorn Bucket Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: One of the other new features involving campfires you mentioned was a system that allowed members of your wolf pack to visit you at night. You sort of hinted that you don't have to leave where you're exploring, the game comes to you. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> First and foremost any feature that makes it into the game has to be tonally celebrating the land of Ezo. And as I mentioned earlier, this vast landscape, there's nothing better than celebrating the camping aspects of it. That is something we felt was really important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now secondly, I must say we're always looking for ways to make the game feel approachable. And I mentioned it a little bit in the State of Play, is that, open world in big games, managing resources is kind of challenging. In our game you can fast travel. In our last game, you could fast travel anywhere. If you want to go upgrade your bow, you could fast travel over here and upgrade your bow, that's fine and you can do that again in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But after you meet people and your wolf pack grows, we show this screen briefly, you can go into those wolf pack screens and see what people have to offer for you. Say you like that bow here, if they have an upgrade available to you, you might be able to pull them into your campsite. So if you're exploring a region of the game, it sometimes can be really discordant to just like stop there, go warp to another area, upgrade, and then come back to where you're exploring. This is what we mean. You can actually just stay here, set up camp, briefly engage with this person, this bow, your person comes over, you get your upgrade and then you go back on your way all while celebrating the wilds of Ezo. And that's where camping has been an iteration and evolution of the Ghost game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Ghost of Tsushima Legends was objectively awesome. How happy were you with that mode as a team and is there a possibility to see something like it again for Ghost of Yotei, either at launch or maybe in the far off distant future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> We were extremely happy with Ghost of Tsushima Legends and allowing players to connect with friends and use their skills fighting with the katana against a variety of enemies. We loved it. Right now we are very focused on completing Ghost of Yotei to the highest quality possible and putting it in players' hands very soon on October 2. That is our absolute focus right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Masterfully answered! What has it been like developing combat based around a whole arsenal of weapons this time as opposed to just a katana and the variety of different stances?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> In Tsushima, we really loved our stance system where the player could choose one of four ways to hold the weapon to combat a particular type of enemy. In Ghost of Yotei we took that system and we expanded it. Instead of four stances, there are now five. Instead of stances with one weapon, we took that same system and we said, okay, instead of stances it's new melee weapons. Functionally it's the same as stances but it's more. For instance, if you use a spear, you can use that weapon to knock enemies backwards in space. So if you're standing near a cliff fighting them, you can knock them off the cliff into the abyss. Works just like stances, but there are extra abilities attached to each of these weapons to give the player more options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So should the player be expecting to juggle weapons and learn which is going to work against which type of enemy, perhaps what weapon they're using? Or is it more a case of unlocking the right skills for the right weapons?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> The game definitely would like players best to learn how to switch weapons when it is appropriate. It is the most efficient way to play. Let's face it, people sometimes want to play in the way that makes them feel the coolest and the game will not hurt you if you do that. If you want to play with just two swords in each hand because it looks cool, you can play through the whole game that way. It's A-okay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you mention any of your favorite skills that you're able to unlock or moves you're able to do with any of the weapons?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> I love the kusarigama because while it's really good for taking down people with shields, it also allows you to do an area of effect attack by spinning that chain above your head. If you're surrounded by enemies, you can hit them all. This is something we never had in Tsushima, but in Yotei it's absolutely there for you. It is a moment where you're kind of improvising, and these weapons allow you to do a broader selection of abilities that give you more choice and more freedom in how you deal tactically with the enemies around you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Jason, do you have one as well?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> I think my favorite when it comes to combat is the dual wielding. It really rewards the feeling of being really fast, and when she hits with those two swords you can kind of get into a flurry and get into a groove where it just keeps going. You're like, this is going to stop, but it just keeps going. There's speed there, it feels really lethal. It doesn't feel like you're swinging a lot and doing little damage. It feels like you're actually really hurting them. I like dual wielding... that’s my fantasy melee weapon set up for me. That might be different for other people, but that's why there's five of 'em. Everybody's going to try something new and different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So Jason, in a New York Times interview, you mentioned that you were left in awe by the sight of Mount Yotei reflected across Lake Tōya during a research trip. Was that the site that inspired the setting of Ghost of Yotei, or were there ever any other locations or historical settings that could have perhaps been the home for Atsu?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> By the time we had gone on the research trip, we definitely knew that we were making a game up there. We had seen enough images. We had embraced the idea that this is where our game was going to take place, and it was about just getting immersed in the culture up there because it's quite different than Honshu mainland Japan. A number of us, it was our first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So really opening the door to all of the unknowns that we could take home and be inspired by and develop new relationships for new advisors. That's the real reason to go. But that Lake Tōya moment where — and I bet Nate had a very similar experience — certainly was some of the birthplaces of thinking about what the actual name of the game would be, because it was just such a majestic moment where the mountain is sort of towering over you. It was a nice middle point of the trip for us, and really symbolized a lot of what we learned and felt while we were there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there were a bunch of natural decisions and some implicit decisions that were made over the course of the game that suddenly, our home is at the foot of Mount Yōtei, this massive mountain that’s casting this shadow over and we were naming things based off of it. It really felt like it was the geographical heart of the experience, and the story was spiraling out from there. It felt like just a great moment for us as we were getting towards the early parts of making the game, and it ended up transforming into the actual name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And I know this is going to be hard, but Nate, starting with you, I'd love to know one thing you're super excited for players to be able to see and play with when the game comes out in October?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> Oh, I'm very excited for players to get out into the wilds, the dangerous lawless wilds of Ezo and hopefully they're really entranced by Atu’s quest. The wind's blowing them towards a mission start, but what's that over there? They see something on the horizon that stokes their curiosity and they say, you know what? I'm going to go check it out. And they ride to that thing and they're going to find something worth discovering, whether it's a story or some piece of valuable treasure, you name it. We wanted to make sure in this game that we honored players' curiosity, that we would reward exploration. And to me that's the magic of Yotei. It's those spaces in between missions when players just find themselves propelled by the smallest little puff of curiosity and it takes them on an adventure they hadn't anticipated doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What I'm hearing from that is I'm going to be having a lot of late nights, way later than intended. Jason?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> I actually want to say something we haven't talked about much, which is Atsu’s shamisen, which is the instrument that she carries, which is her mother’s shamisen. Just like in Ghost of Tsushima, we had features in that game, I think it was called the Traveler's Attire in the last game… it would help you find content nearby, you could use it almost like a completion tool or a navigation tool in order to get through the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love that the shamisen exists and there's actually songs that you can learn inside of the open world, and those songs can then guide you to certain types of things. So you want to collect some of these songs because they'll guide you. The Song of Vanity might guide you to cosmetics, and we know how people love dressing up in the game and putting on cool outfits. So I'm really excited about showing more of that and for players to get an opportunity to use that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Interview conducted by Rachel Weber.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Itch.io has announced that is delisted and “deindexed” all adult NSFW titles from its store front, following similar steps taken by Valve’s Steam, due to pressure from payment processors, such as Visa and Mastercard, regarding NSFW content. The pressure has also come from the pressure group <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/">Collective Shout</a>, an Australian charity whose stated mission is <em>“challenging the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture. We target corporations, advertisers, marketers and media which exploit the bodies of women and girls to sell products and services and campaign to change their behaviour.”</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">blog post</a> about the removal of NSFW content, itch.io said, “<em>We have “deindexed” all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change.</em></p>


<p><em>Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io. Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms. Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform. To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change. We are currently conducting a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors. Pages will remain deindexed as we complete our review. Once this review is complete, we will introduce new compliance measures. For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account.</em></p>
<p><em>Part of this review will see some pages being permanently removed from itch.io. Affected accounts will be notified via their account’s email address from our support address. You can reply to that email if you have any follow up questions. We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period. I’m sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves. We will post a follow up on our blog if the situation changes. Thank you.”</em></p>

<p>Last week, Steam introduced a rule regarding NSFW content in response to pressure from payment processors. This rule says, <em>“Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</em></p>
<p>Collective Shout claimed this as a win, following an<a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors"> open letter</a> it sent to the CEOs of various payment processors including Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Paysafe Limited, Discover, and Japan Credit Bureau. <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed">Collective Shout has stated that 1047 people</a> sent emails to these companies about payments on Steam and Itch.io going to games depicting rape and incest, and credits this action as the reason for the bans on the platforms. However, the payment processors could also be using this as cover so they can show compliance with the US FOSTA (Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act) and SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) laws that passed in 2018, which could, in theory, make payment processors and platform holders liable for payments that could be seen to be going to products or content that breach those laws. Additionally, the UK’s Online Safety Law, which goes into effect on 25th July, will also require platform holders that host anything adult to have people prove their identity using ID and credit cards to access them.</p>

			<p>This morning, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announ</a>ced in a press release that it has entered a strategic partnership with fellow Japanese entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco. Sony agreed to acquire 16 million Bandai Namco shares for roughly 68 billion yen (around $465 million), gaining control of 2.5% of the company's total shares.</p>



<p>Nobuhiko Momoi, Executive Vice President at Bandai Namco Holdings Inc., said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The Bandai Namco Group promotes an "IP axis strategy" that aims to maximize IP value by leveraging the appeal and worldview of IP, providing the optimal products and services at the optimal timing in the optimal regions. We are filled with excitement about the potential to create new entertainment by combining Sony Group's strengths and technological capabilities across various entertainment fields with Bandai Namco's IP axis strategy. Through this collaboration, we aim to connect with IP fans worldwide, co-create the future together, and realize our Purpose, "Fun for All into the Future," and Mid- to Long-term Vision, "Connect with Fans."</em></p>



<p>Toshimoto Mitomo, Chief Strategy Officer and Representative Corporate Executive Officer at Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>



<p><em>Through this partnership, we aim to co-create an array of content and experiences that exceed expectations and deliver Kando （emotion） to even more fans, alongside Bandai Namco Group, with its outstanding capacity for multidirectional expansion of diverse IP and deep connections with fans at real touchpoints, both domestically and internationally. By combining the strengths of both companies in the field of entertainment and unlocking the potential of compelling IP, we will further accelerate our efforts to maximize IP value and realize Sony's long-term vision, "Creative Entertainment Vision".</em></p>



<p>The press release mainly emphasizes that Sony will produce and distribute anime and 'other video content' based on Bandai Namco's intellectual properties. That said, the collaboration could extend to other areas like games and music. Even so, it is highly unlikely that Bandai Namco's games will become exclusive to PlayStation consoles, especially given the minuscule share percentage.</p>



<p>In late 2024, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became</a> the largest shareholder of Kadokawa Corporation (the parent company of FromSoftware) with 10% shares. However, a few months ago Tencent also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased its own shares</a> up to nearly 8%, almost as much as Sony.</p>

                <p>Retro gaming fans might have to make a difficult choice soon, as ModRetro has revealed that its modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console will cost $200. First teased last year, this could make it a viable alternative to the Analogue 3D, which costs $250.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palmerluckey/status/1948186521737302455" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>ModRetro's newest product is M64.

Inflation isn't nostalgic. <a href="https://t.co/LYDyiBBx2O" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LYDyiBBx2O</a></p></div>  — Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1948186521737302455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-3d-delayed-to-late-august-due-to-tariffs/1100-6533190/" data-ref-id="1100-6533190">Like the Analogue 3D</a>, the M64 is also an FPGA console that aims to replicate the experience of using an N64 at a hardware level. This is the same direction that ModRetro took for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/" data-ref-id="1100-6528473">ModRetro Chromatic</a>, a well-designed Game Boy successor that combines several modern conveniences with an authentic handheld gaming experience that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges. The handheld also feels great to use, thanks to all of the premium materials incorporated into its design.</p><p>Beyond that, ModRetro hasn't revealed any other details regarding the M64. The teaser trailer posted by company founder Palmer Luckey does have a very blurry tease of the device--and a "do not open until Christmas" message--and it looks like it'll sport a grey color scheme. The video also suggests that you'll be able to use your original N64 cartridges, and it'll be interesting to see if it has any of the other modern features built into the Chromatic, like native video streaming and multiplayer support.</p><p>FPGA consoles like this are generally seen as the best option for enthusiasts, due to them being able to play these games in HD via HDMI on a modern television. The Analogue 3D can do this in 4K, and it offers a variety of filters to make the experience look like you're playing on a CRT TV, so it'll be interesting to see if the M64 can offer a similar experience.</p><p>If you're a bigger fan of Nintendo's handheld gaming age, you can order the ModRetro Chromatic right now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/" data-ref-id="1100-6533058">as new stock has arrived</a> and it's also available in several new colors.</p>

<figure><a title="Hyrule Warriors" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9013bbde981f0/hyrule-warriors.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Koei Tecmo unveiled its new Musou game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> earlier this year for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how development is tracking, the latest update is the Switch 2 title has just been rated by the classification board in Brazil.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-now-been-rated-in-brazil/">Universo Nintendo (via My Nintendo News)</a>, with the outlet suggesting an update about this game could be coming very soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game here was rated "over 12 years old", despite Nintendo's request that it be classified as "over 10"."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> was rated 'T' for 'Teen' and contained fantasy violence along with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, this follow-up is scheduled to arrive "this winter" although some official online pages currently list 'TBD'.</p>
<p>As previously revealed, this game will take place <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and is set to feature the classic 'Warriors' gameplay. Here's a bit extra about it from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></strong> is the newest title in the Hyrule Warriors series and is developed by Koei-Tecmo Games with support from Nintendo. The game features epic battles against hordes of enemies as it tells the untold story from Hyrule's distant past of the Imprisoning War that ultimately led to the events of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em><em>. Fans of the Legend of Zelda series and players of both</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda:</em> <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> can experience the thrill of battle and this canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda, King Rauru, and other familiar characters. Fight for Hyrule’s future when <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> comes to Nintendo Switch 2 this winter."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184958 @ 1753349798 -->
<p>What did other outlets have to say then? Starting the party with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">IGN</a>, this outlet awarded the Switch 2 package <strong>7/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still fantastic, but the mixed new content of the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV re-release adds frustrating limitations and strange design decisions to what was otherwise a polished, customizable experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/">VGC</a> gave it <strong>4/5</strong> stars, noting how this upgrade elevates what's already one of the best series entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By itself, then, Jamboree TV is a bit of an uneven expansion. However, Switch 2 does power some genuinely great new mini-games and, when it works (and if you own one), camera support does elevate the general experience, making this almost by default the definitive version of one of the best Mario Party games. Whether that’s worth the $20 / £17 upgrade, however, is very much dependent on your personal affection for the series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition">Polygon</a> labelled it the Switch 2's best tech demo yet, even though it labelled the upgrade as "falling on the inessential side":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> now stands as a robust party game that makes up for its shortcomings in sheer variety."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Vooks</a> scored it <strong>3/5</strong> stars, describing it as one for "superfans":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Party superfans will enjoy the new modes for the main board games, but the Jamboree TV additions—aside from the mouse games—are a bit average. <em>Jamboree</em> was a solid and complete package, and this just splits it all up and breaks the flow."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-is-perfectly-fine/">Siliconera</a> said this update was "perfectly fine", awarding it <strong>8/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super</em> <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> remains a solid game... <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em> is a natural pick-up for families. If someone is in a home with multiple players who own both Switch or Switch 2 systems, it could be great for game nights. However, if you’re going to go with one Switch or Switch 2 system for a group session or plan to play only online... you might be fine sticking with the original game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches this week on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>

After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">revealing this January</a> that it would take up the challenge, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgame-boy-72046" rel="sponsored">it has revealed</a> a most impressive take on the 1989 classic that’ll cost a relatively reasonable $60 in the US. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Game-Boy/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">It’s already up for preorder today</a> for an October 1st ship date. At 3.5 inches (14cm) wide and 5.5 inches (9cm) tall, it looks like it’ll have almost the same dimensions as the original.</p></div><p>As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">rely on miniature hats</a> for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well!</p><p>And unless I’m very much mistaken, it comes with <em>printed</em> tiles rather than sticker labels to help replicate the Game Boy’s many, many iconic labels for its buttons, volume dial, on-off switch, “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound” highlight, as well as larger features like the Game Boy’s mono speaker grille, battery compartment latch, and serial number around back that have proven difficult to emulate in bricks. (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.)</p><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / video by Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </em>or <em>Super Mario Land</em>, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2QPBkDkFc">the Game Boy’s da-DING beep</a>). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in <em>Awakening</em>’s most bittersweet scene:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073412/i-built-that-lego-game-boy-and-now-its-even-better">I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself</a>, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. If those buttons move when you push them, I doubt I’ll resist! Do wish it came with <em>Tetris</em>, too, though.</p><div><p>Lego and Nintendo have also recreated part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3eYc6dMOhw">the original US Game Boy commercial</a> using the set.
