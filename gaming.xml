		<p>It’s the trickier of the two clock changing weekends, with time falling back by an hour overnight and in theory giving everyone an extra hour in bed. What’s actually going to happen is that a lot of kids will still wake up at the same time, and pets are going to demand feeding an hour “early” for at least the next fortnight, which is going to see an awful lot of things knocked off shelves and tables by mardy cats.</p>
<p>Great for childless and pet-less gamers, though, who’ve got an extra hour to spend with Black Ops 6, or whatever else tickles their fancy tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Xbox remains committed to "bringing great games to more people on more devices", and plans to "extend" its strategy to bring its most notable franchises to other platforms like PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-annual-letter-relevance-reinvention-satya-nadella-v91xc/">LinkedIn</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said it was "a consequential time for our company, our industry, and the world", and that "ultimately, [Microsoft's] mission requires that [it] translate technology into empowerment for everyone".</p>

<p>"We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem," Nadella said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the CEO also confirmed the company held publishing rights to 20 game franchises that "have generated over $1bn in lifetime revenue", and listed six of them. Whilst the recently acquired Call of Duty series is clearly one of them, it was curiously absent from Nadella's list.</p><p>"We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue - from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/candy-crush">Candy Crush</a>, Diablo, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo">Halo</a>, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love - where, when, and how they want.</p>
<p>"Finally, we brought four of our fan-favourite titles to Nintendo Switch and Sony PlayStation for the first time, as we continue to extend our content to new platforms."</p>
<p>Yesterday we reported that Microsoft boss Nadella will earn a wallet-busting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-ceos-pay-rises-63-to-73m-despite-devastating-year-for-layoffs">$79.1m (£60.9m) this financial year, up 63 percent on his compensation for 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The huge boost to Nadella's pay in both cash and stock, announced by Microsoft earlier this week, comes after a positive year overall for the company's financial revenues - but a turbulent 12 months for its employees. 2024 has seen two mass layoffs at Microsoft, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 staff laid off in January</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">a further 650 Xbox employees were shown the door</a> in September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the recent launch of a new edition of the <em>Kill Team</em> rules, it's the prefect time to start playing, but what's the best way to get started? The <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set? In this article, we'll take a look at what's inside the box, and see if it's the best way for new <em>Kill Team</em> players to start playing, along with seeing what it has for veteran <em>Kill Team</em> players.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the launch box for the current edition, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review">Operation Hivestorm here</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=kD2uYoFd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-5.jpg?itok=wlUYiUUp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Does The Kill Team Starter Set Contain?</h2>

<p>The <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Starter Set contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Starter Handbook</li>
	<li>Angels of Death kill team (7x Space Marines)</li>
	<li>Plague Marine kill team (7x Death Guard)</li>
	<li>2x Operative Reference Sheets (1 for each kill team)</li>
	<li>Game board and MDF&nbsp;terrain</li>
	<li>Tokens, dice and card-measuring tools</li>
</ul><p>All of the miniatures included in the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set are from the collectible Warhammer Heroes sets. The included Space Maries are those from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-heroes-strike-force-justian-review">Strike Force Justain set we covered</a> for the last edition of <em>Kill Team. </em>All of the miniatures push out from the sprue (no need to cut them) and are push-fit, so they also don't require glue, which makes them perfect for those starting out in the wargaming hobby, as no hobby tools are needed.</p>

<p>The scenery is also beginner friendly, and is push-fit, pre-painted mdf that slots together (and can be reconstructed for easy transport). This, combined with the push-fit miniatures mean that from opening the box to playing can be extremely quick.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=5SK5uyc1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=FnsQHujS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Do I Need To Use The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>The<i>&nbsp;Kill Team </i>Starter Set is the complete package for your introduction to <em>Kill Team</em> and it contains everything you need to start playing. It is very much aimed at the beginner wargamer though and doesn't contain the full rules for <em>Kill Team</em> (we discuss what you need to get next to continue your <em>Kill Team</em> journey below). This means that players of the last edition of <em>Kill Team</em> won't need to pick this up, as the rulebook is a tutorial handbook and the 2 included kill teams can be picked up separately by getting the Warhammer Heroes sets they belong to. But for those new to wargaming or <em>Kill Team</em>, this is the perfect set to get you playing as it contains everything in a single box.</p>

<h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>The<i> Kill Team</i> Starter Set contains 2 kill teams, both with miniatures from the Warhammer Heroes lines.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=DJ9o9Tt4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-4.jpg?itok=MeZ5WUMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Angels of Death</h4>

<p>The included Angels of Death kill team is the repackaged Strike Force Justain from the previous edition of <em>Kill Team</em>. The rules for them on the included reference sheet are slightly different from those in the full <em>Kill Team</em> rules, and the profiles we discuss below are from the Starter Set (we discuss how to take the Angels of Death kill team beyond the Starter Set in the section below).</p>

<p>The Angels of Death kill team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Space Marine Captain - A close combat specialist armed with a plasma pistol and power fist, which can only be blocked with critical success, making it hard for your opponent to avoid damage.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Sergeant - The kill team's second in command armed with a bolt rifle that reduces your opponent's save dice on a critical hit.</li>
	<li>Assault Intersessor Warrior - A close combat specialist armed with a heavy bolt pistol and chainsword.</li>
	<li>Eliminator Sniper - A ranged specialist with 3 fire modes, the accurate executioner, hyperfrag with blast for multiple targets, and the armor-penetrating and high critical hit damage mortis.</li>
	<li>Heavy Intercessor Gunner - Another ranged specialist armed with a high rate of fire heavy bolter.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Warrior with auto bolt rifle - The auto bolt rifle has the torrent special rule, which can be used to make additional attacks against all visible enemies within 1 inch of your original target.</li>
	<li>Intercessor Warrior with bolt rifle - The standard bolt rifle gets piercing on a critical hit, which makes it harder to enemies to save against.</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=PihfGyt1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-3.jpg?itok=AKAPrE7P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Plague Marines</h4>

<p>The Plague Marine kill team is a new faction, having not had a dedicated kill team release in the last edition (only in the <em>Kill Team</em> compendium released at the start of the last edition). They currently only have the starter set rules, and not full rules on the Kill Team app (which may change after the release of the Starter Set). As such, the profiles we discuss below are from the Starter Set.</p>

<p>The Plague Marines kill team contains:</p>

<ul><li>Plague Marine Champion - A close combat specialist armed with a plasma pistol and plague sword, which lets you gain a critical success from a standard success if you didn't roll any critical hits.</li>
	<li>Malignant Plaguecaster - A psychic user with 2 spell options, the short-range entropy with extremely high crit damage, and severe which helps you gain a critical hit, and plague wind, which can roll an attack against every visible enemy within 2 inches of the original target.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Bombardier - A grenade-armed Plague Marine, carrying a blight grenade with a 2-inch blast radius, so even enemies that aren't visible or behind cover aren't safe.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Fighter - The fighter only carries a&nbsp;flail of corruption, a close combat weapon, which can only be blocked with critical hits. It has the shock special rule, which makes your opponent discard a success when struck with one of your successes.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Heavy Gunner - Armed with the short-range plague spewer, it can target all visible enemies within 2 inches of the original target.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Icon Bearer - Only armed with a short-range bolt pistol and plague knife, the icon they carry means it's easier for them to capture objectives as their APL is considered higher than their stat card.</li>
	<li>Plague Marine Warrior - The standard Plague Marine operative comes with a bolter, which has the same stats as the Angels of Death bolt rifle, but without the piercing crit special rule.</li>
</ul><h2>Where Do I Go After The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>Once you've played through the <em>Kill Team</em> tutorials in the Starter Handbook from the Starter Set, you'll be ready to play full games of <em>Kill Team</em>. You will be able to initially upgrade to the <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules for free, via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xfV8vUOg/download-the-kill-team-app-and-faction-rules-today/">Kill Team app</a>&nbsp;and you can also download the <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules and the full rules for the Angles of Death kill team via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Kill Team downloads page</a>. The next stage is to purchase the <em>Kill Team</em> Core Rules and you'll be able to play full games of <em>Kill Team</em>.</p>

<p>If you are looking to use the included kill teams using the full rules, you should note the Angels of Death kill team isn't a legal kill team using the full rules. You can't take both the Space Marine Captain and the Intercessor Sergeant, but you can use the Sergeant as another Intercessor Warrior. You also can't take both the Intercessor Heavy Gunner and Eliminator Sniper in the same kill team, so you will need to add another Assault Intercessor, Intercessor Gunner, or Intercessor Warrior. If you pick up a pack of Intercessors, you will have more than enough to build the options for the different armament options for the Intercessor Warriors and Intercessor Gunners, and a pack of Assault Intercessors (or the cheaper Assault Intercessors and Paint Set) will give you all the options for a full roster.</p>

<p>The Plague Marines currently don't have full <em>Kill Team</em> rules, but I'm hopeful they release them online to coincide with the Starter Set release.</p>

<p>Or if you fancy a different kill team, you can check out the rules for free via the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/downloads/kill-team/">Kill Team downloads</a> page and see which of the currently released 33 kill teams that take your fancy, and then pick up the box for them. Some kill teams require 2 boxes to be able to build all the options.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=BcMbBNIk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=hw-xh-Ik 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>I really like what Games Workshop have done with the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set. It's not an essential purchase for veteran <em>Kill Team</em> players unless they don't have the 2 included kill teams from their release as Warhammer Heroes, but it does help onboard new <em>Kill Team</em> players very well. The starter handbook does a good job of taking players through their first few games with 2 very easy-to-pilot kill teams, and it makes it very easy to move into full games. We'll have to see what happens with the Plague Marine rules, but it would have been nice to have an additional Space Marine miniature so that it's a legal kill team out of the box, or at least have made the Angels of Death rules work with this kill team as it is.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Kill Team Starter Set?</h2>

<p>If you're brand new to wargaming, or <em>Kill Team</em>, then this is the perfect place to start. The miniatures are easy to put together, and the handbook does a great job of introducing the rules and setting you up to move into <em>Kill Team</em> lite, and then the full rules. If you're a veteran player, there's nothing extra here other than the miniatures and the new mdf scenery, so if you have them already, you won't need the <em>Kill Team</em> Starter Set, but if you don't have either kill team, then this may be a cost-effective way to get them.</p>

<p>Operators in the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/call-of-duty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a> are the characters you can play as, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> offers multiple of them. You have the freedom to choose from any of them in the multiplayer mode, however, Zombies has four dedicated to determining a crew and providing story dialogue and context.</p>



<p>Not all of them come unlocked right from the start. Some require you to get the Black Ops 6 Vault Edition while others require you to reach a particular player level. With that said, here are all the Operators in the game and the ways to get them.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-all-operators-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock all Operators in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are a total of <strong>21 Operators</strong> present in Black Ops 6 divided between two Factions – Rogue Black Ops and Crimson One. Here’s how you can unlock them:</p>



<h3 id="h-rogue-black-ops">Rogue Black Ops</h3>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Operator</th><th>How to unlock</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Russell Adler (Umbra skin)</td><td>Buy Black Ops 6 Vault Editon</td></tr><tr><td>Helen A.

<p>The AS VAL is one of the meta rifles you can use in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> right now. However, to get the best out of the AR, you must use the right attachments, Perks, and Equipment to make it a force to be reckoned with.</p>



<ul>

<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-equipment-for-as-val">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-is-the-as-val-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AS VAL any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-as-val-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-as-val-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AS VAL loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Assault Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li>
</ul>



<p>Starting off with the <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong>, this attachment will reduce the horizontal recoil of the weapon, making it easier to control. The base AS VAL comes with only 20 bullets so attaching the <strong>Extended Mag II</strong> is crucial to increase its magazine size. Although it will reduce your Sprint to Fire speed a little, The <strong>Assault Grip</strong> will compensate for it well.</p>



<p>Attach the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it enhances Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds. Lastly, use <strong>Recoil Springs</strong> for an additional improvement in recoil control.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-equipment-for-as-val">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AS VAL</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Tracker</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Cold-Blooded</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Tactical Insertion</li>
</ul>



<p>The Perks suggested above allow you to be a stealthy but fatal rifler in-game. <strong>Ghost</strong> perk will leave you undetected by Scout Pulse or UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or using Scorestreaks. <strong>Tracker</strong> will let you see enemy footsteps, which is useful for locating and hunting them down.</p>



<p><strong>Cold-Blooded</strong> also leaves you undetected under thermal optics. Using these perks will activate the Recon specialty which lets you see enemies through walls for a short duration.</p>



<p>By the time you unlock the AS VAL, you will also unlock the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> Wildcard at level 54. Use that to equip <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> in the fourth Perk slot to improve your normal and Tactical Sprinting speeds while reloading or using Equipment.</p>



<p>Keep the <strong>Semtex</strong> for guaranteed kills while playing Hardpoint or Search and Destroy and the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> will always come in handy for quick health top-ups. For the Field Upgrade, you can use the <strong>Tactical Insertion</strong> for custom spawn points in the map.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-as-val">Best Secondary for AS VAL</h2>



<p>The Stryder .22 and GS45 would be the ideal secondary weapon options for the AS VAL.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-as-val-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AS VAL in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The AS VAL unlocks once you <strong>reach player level 55</strong>. This is not the fastest unlock in the game and will take some time, but it’s worth the effort and time you put in.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-as-val-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AS VAL any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, the AS VAL is one of the meta Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6 that’s great for combat at all ranges. Although it comes with a higher recoil than most of the other guns in this class, its fast TTK and high mobility easily set it apart from the rest.</p>



<p>Use the attachments suggested above to reduce the recoil significantly and you’ll be good to dominate multiplayer lobbies.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-as-val-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the AS VAL in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">AMES 85</a> are two of the best alternatives to the AS VAL in BO6. While the XM4 is considered a meta weapon along with the AS VAL right now, the AMES 85 also packs a punch with low recoil and high bullet velocity.</p>

Bungie has announced that players no longer need to collect the item to complete chapters of the Book of the Forgotten. You only need Manifested Pages.</p><p>Alongside chests in Haunted Sectors, Manifested Pages will drop from "many different sources while you're wearing a mask," said Bungie. We'll have to wait until the event kicks off to confirm what the developer is referring to, although it's safe to assume it might be related to other activities aside from Haunted Sectors, which will come in handy.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</h2><p>It seems the celebrations around the release of Destiny 2 The Final Shape are still ongoing, as this year's Festival of the Lost is debuting seven new masks.

Bungie doesn't want to share too many details, except for a few perk combinations as a tease:</p><ul><li><strong>Mechabre (Aggressive Arc Sniper Rifle):</strong> Lone Wolf in column 3, Closing Time in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Jurassic Green (Rapid-Fire Solar Pulse)</strong>: Loose Change in column 3, Incandescent in column 4, Search Party, Field Tested as origin traits.</li><li><strong>Braytech Werewolf (Precision Kinetic Auto Rifle)</strong>: Rewind Rounds in column 3, Onslaught in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Acosmic (Rapid-Fire Void Grenade Launcher)</strong>: Withering Gaze in column 3, Bait and Switch in column 4, and Search Party, Nadie as the origin traits.</li></ul><p>Also, you're now able to buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva, basically avoiding the need to complete the Dual Destiny quest in Destiny 2. For this, you'll need to own The Final Shape expansion, but know that you won't be able to attune the class items you buy from Eva. Unless you complete Dual Destiny, you'll only get random rolls. But hey, luck might be on your side.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</h2><p>Your candy-gathering efforts won't be for naught, as there'll be quite a few rewards to earn during Destiny 2's Halloween event.</p><p>Below are all of the Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards:</p><ul><li>Wizard Armor Ornaments for a scary vibe.</li><li>The return of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack shader</a>.</li><li>Arcane Embrace as a new weapon: The shotgun has Arc element and a Heavy Burst subtype, so it fires a hard-hitting, two-round burst while slightly reducing flinching from incoming fire while aiming. As teased by Bungie, a potential combo for the weapon is Fourth Times the Charm in column 3, Precision Instrument in column 4, and Search Party in origin trait.</li><li>Lost Memento is also returning as a reward, and you'll be able to hold up to three at a time. You can earn it from completing the Twilight Triumph or as a random drop from focusing any items.</li><li>You can also earn the new Spectral Carapace emblem for completing the Twilight Triumph.</li></ul><p>Have fun in this year's Festival of the Lost!</p>

Will Speck and Josh Gordon are reportedly attached to direct, with Kenny and Keith Lucas penning the screenplay alongside Max Reisman. The story, as you might expect, will be about a 19th-century covered wagon train traveling to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/the-oregon-trail-apple-ii-playthrough-13-24-screenshot-1729896196789.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Oregon Trail retains a special place in the hearts of generations of gamers.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The musical aspect offers a glimpse of what to expect, suggesting that it will be a fairly irreverent take on the historical adventure.

                <p dir="ltr">PS5 owners who haven't added the masterful Resident Evil 4 remake to their collection can grab a physical copy for cheap right now. Amazon has discounted <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0BJTKYLCB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 4 to only $20 for PS5</a></strong>. This is the lowest price ever for the PlayStation 5 physical edition. Resident Evil 4 carries a $40 retail price, though it's often available for $30-$35 at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-Xbox-X-PlayStation/dp/B0BJTSN9ZC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a> players can snag a physical copy for $22.</p><p dir="ltr">Resident Evil 4 continued Capcom's streak of successful Resident Evil remakes, recreating the 2005 original's story and setting with modernized visuals and gameplay that iterates on the design of the Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. However, unlike the massive overhauls seen in those other remakes, this new version of Resident Evil 4 is a much more faithful adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">GameSpot's Resident Evil 4 review</a>, Kurt Indovina awarded the game a 10/10, saying that the remake "stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the first of Capcom's Resident Evil remakes to receive a physical release for PS5, but soon it will have company.

The particular configuration sports Intel's new Core Ultra 7-155H CPU along with a GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD, and crisp OLED screen, and you can pick it up for just $1,200 (down from $1,700) during Best Buy's sale.</p><p dir="ltr">While the laptop's specs can handle the latest AAA and indie games alike, the HP Omen Transcend's real draw is its 14-inch OLED screen. OLED screens offer better contrast ratios and more accurate black levels than LED panels. OLED laptop screen are uncommon--especially an OLED laptop for just $1,200.</p><p dir="ltr">The display also offers a 2.8K (2880x1800p) resolution and a high 120Hz refresh rate with VRR, which will make games look crisp and keep gameplay smooth--though, given the laptop's specs, you may have to fiddle with the in-game option to find the best settings. Along with the solid gaming performance, the screen sports flicker-free backlighting and low blue light output for less eye strain.</p><p dir="ltr">The rig's CPU is also of note. The Intel Core Ultra 7-155H is part of the brand's new line of premium mobile CPUs that launched earlier this year. This particular model is one of the higher-end chips in the line and offers strong performance and power efficiency, which means better-than-average battery life. In this case, the 14-inch HP Omen Transcend's battery lasts up to roughly 11 hours on a single charge and supports USB-C fast charging, which can restore up to 50% battery life in 30 minutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390888" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390888"></a><figcaption>14-Inch HP Omen Transcend Gaming Laptop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a bonus, the laptop also comes with three free months of PC Game Pass, which gives you access to tons of games, including almost every Microsoft-published title that's released in the last few years. That even includes day-one access to upcoming first-party games launching on PC, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preorder-guide/1100-6524003/" data-ref-id="1100-6524003">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/">Avowed</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preorder-guide/1100-6526575/" data-ref-id="1100-6526575">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">This HP Omen Transcend laptop is an excellent choice for those who prefer portable gaming rigs, especially at this lower price.

But if you're specifically interested in picking up a Call of Duty-themed controller, the most notable new release is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY5KCYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG's new Call of Duty Field Op Edition</a></strong> for PlayStation and PC.

If you're interested in the Pro BFG after reading this article, it's worth noting the standard colors of the Pro BFG, white and black, are available for even less right now. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original black edition is only $145</a>, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CRZ7KFKZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white is $155</a>.

With the included tool, you can quickly remove the faceplates covering the controls and shift the layout around. This allows you to have aligned analog sticks (PlayStation style) or offset (Xbox style). It also comes with four thumbstick caps, four stick grates, and three D-pad styles, including the solid square design shown above as well as more traditional eight- and four-way styles.</p><p>The right analog stick and face buttons can be swapped out for a six-button microswitch fight pad. Naturally, this won't be helpful for Call of Duty, but if you like fighting games, it's a great inclusion. It's worth noting Victrix also released a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D7WYPB3V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tekken 8 Edition of the Pro BFG</a> in July.</p><p>The Pro BFG also has four built-in back triggers that can be remapped on the fly and trigger locks for R2 and L2 with five different stopping points. You can save up to three custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly.</p><p>You can also remap inputs using the Victrix Control Hub on PC. You have more control over your experience with the app, but unfortunately it's only available for PC. That said, adjustments save to the controller, so as long as you have a PC, you can still take advantage of features such as tweaking stick and trigger sensitivity, setting up analog stick dead zones, and adjusting the sound profile. The Pro BFG has built-in audio that gives you in-depth control over your headset audio experience. Keep in mind you'll need to connect your headset to the 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887" data-ratio="1" data-width="710" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887"></a><figcaption>Victrix Pro BFG comes with hot-swappable components</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg"></figure><p>The caveat to opting for a third-party PlayStation 5 controller is that you lose PlayStation's adaptive trigger and haptics tech as well as motion controls. If you're not okay with those losses, the only pro-style controller for you is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's DualSense Edge ($200)</a>. Some PS5 games make the DualSense's unique features a core component of the experience, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astro-Bot-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D5SM3K4Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot</a>--you definitely want to play the PS5's wonderful platformer with a DualSense controller.</p><p>The Pro BFG offers <em>substantially </em>better battery life than DualSense controllers, though. You can get close to 20 hours on a full charge in our experience. And if you want a PlayStation controller with the ergonomics of an Xbox controller, the Pro BFG is the best option.</p><p>It syncs wireless to your PS5, PS4, and PC with a 2.4GHz USB dongle. Alternatively, you use the lengthy, braided USB to USB-C cable for a hardwired connection. All of the Pro BFG's accessories have dedicated slots inside the included hardshell carrying case.</p><p>The Pro BFG is also available in white and black models for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC for $180</a>.

			<p>PlayStation 5 Pro patches for the two games released so far on the base model by Insomniac introduce graphical toggles that allow users to customize their experience further in the vein of PC gaming.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro patches for Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart and Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which both went live today, introduce new Performance Pro and Fidelity Pro modes, which provide, respectively, 60 FPS gameplay with the same image quality of the standard fidelity mode through PSSR and all ray tracing features, and 30 FPS gameplay and new ray tracing features, which can be tuned individually to reach higher intermediate frame rates when using VRR and 120 Hz Display mode.</p>
<p>The new ray tracing options introduced by the PlayStation 5 Pro Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart patch are RT Reflections and RT Ambient Occlusion, while Marvel's Spider-Man gets RT Key Light Shadows, which uses ray tracing to calculate sun shadows at mid- to distance, replacing cascaded shadow maps, RT Reflections and Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. More details on the patches and the new options they introduce can be found <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344384505101-Version-1-005-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Rift Apart and <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/31344021452941-Version-1-004-000-Release-Notes">here</a> for Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>The two Insomniac-developed games aren't the only ones that received PlayStation 5 Pro patches ahead of the system's release on November 7th. Other games that were already patched include <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-ps5-pro-patch/">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing/">Alan Wake 2.</a></p>

Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 patch 1.004 is almost entirely focused granting owners of the soon-to-release console additional visual options to ensure they are either swinging through New York City with improved graphics or a higher framerate.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/09/09/screenshot-43-1631220042144.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Insomniac deploys PS5 Pro updates for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac says that the default will be set to Performance Pro mode, which targets 60fps “while retaining the image quality of the standard Fidelity mode through use of PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR).” This is the setting that the team recommends, as it also toggles on all ray-tracing (RT) features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side is the 30fps Fidelity Pro mode. Insomniac says this is the visual option for those looking to “experiment” with some of the new ray-tracing features offered by the PS5 Pro, which can be tuned to each player’s preference. With Fidelity Pro, you may also notice that pedestrian and traffic density may be increased in a few locations in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, with hair detail also getting a bump.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.004 also comes with a trio of new graphical toggles: RT Key Light Shadows, RT Reflections &amp; Interiors, and RT Ambient Occlusion. All three tools are for those who like to tailor their gaming experiences right down to the finest details, though Insomniac warns that you’ll notice changes in certain portions of New York more than others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect many of the same PS5 Pro enhancements if you check out Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart update 1.005, too, including a default Performance Pro mode and Fidelity Pro mode. This patch also fixes “missing fur wetness” in some of the cinematics that take place on Corson V.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 5 Pro won’t be out for another few weeks, but it’s still caused quite the stir among fans of Sony’s gaming endeavors since the company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>pulled back the curtain last month</u></a>. The device was revealed to cost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/poll-is-the-playstation-5-pro-too-expensive"><u>a steep $700</u></a>, drawing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock"><u>criticism from those who believe the upgrade isn’t worth the price</u></a>. We’ll know more about just how substantial the improvements are come launch next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for the PS5 Pro to launch on November 7, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-the-first-hands-on-preview"><u>our hands-on preview</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review"><em>single-player campaign review</em></a><em> or our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u><em>multiplayer review in progress</em></u></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You ever wonder how we got here? Not in an existential, “where did we come from?” kind of way, but more specifically “how did a one-off, co-op survival mode in a video game that used to put quotes about the horrors of war on screen when you died turn into <em>this</em>?” 16 years on, it’s hard to reconcile what the original Nazi Zombies mode from 2008’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2008/11/12/call-of-duty-world-at-war-review"><u>World at War</u></a> used to be with the outrageous, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/01/resident-evil-6-review"><u>Resident Evil 6</u></a>-inspired campfest I spent several red-eyed hours playing late last night. I’m not saying any of this in a bad way, mind you; Black Ops 6’s take on the mode is thrilling and unique thanks to all new movement mechanics and good map design. Zombies hasn’t been the thing it was in World at War for a while, and I still have a lot more of this year’s version to play before I am ready for my final review, but that one thought has still hit me pretty hard so far: How did we get here, man?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s carve out the bloody guts of this thing, shall we? Black Ops 6’s Zombies mode features two all-new maps: Terminus, a prison complex-turned-bio-research-station, and Liberty Falls, a small town in West Virginia whose slice of quaint Americana is about to test itself against The Worst Day Ever (spoiler: it doesn’t seem to be going well for the Americana). The story itself is a direct sequel to the Zombies campaign in 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-zombies-review"><u>Black Ops Cold War</u></a>, and if you, like me, have largely forgotten what happened in the intervening four years, there doesn’t seem to be much attempt to catch you up. That means you’re going to hear a lot of proper-noun-filled dialogue that <em>could </em>be important or fun references, but instead had me going “I vaguely remember that person,” a little too often. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mostly, I wanted the voices in my ear (and the characters I was playing) to shut up. They have what I’m going to call The Modern Video Game Character Problem™, which is to say they all talk too much – especially since half the time they’re just broadcasting their thoughts out loud. I’m not saying each and every one of them is a deeply annoying, terminally unfunny, outrageously unlikeable person, but I’m not <em>not</em> saying that, either. Their mid-combat banter is like something compiled from a Schwarzenegger film penned by ChatGPT – I’m not expecting poetry here, but at least give me Gears of War-level banter, you know? I can only hear lines like the one where someone is complaining about how the zombies make them so mad they “boil their piss” or how we need a mop to clean up all the brains we’re splattering everywhere so many times before I want to turn my gun towards my allies instead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the story is a mixed bag so far, but you know what isn’t? The gameplay. The biggest change here is Omnimovement (Zombiemovement?), Black Ops 6’s complete overhaul of Call of Duty’s basic movement mechanics. You can sprint, slide, and dive in every direction, even chaining these moves together. You’ve also got a full 360 degrees of motion, which means you can do sick stuff like sprint backwards, pull off a retreating dive, mow down the zombies approaching you from every angle, and then get up and keep moving before they even get close. We haven’t seen zombie-killing moves like this since Resident Evil 6, minus a few suplexes here and there. (Dear Treyarch, please add suplexes. Love, Will.) Even if Treyarch misses what might be the easiest post-launch, patch-introduced layup with that, though, the point I’m making is that this <em>feels good</em>, and I like it. I like it a lot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story may be a mixed bag so far, but the gameplay feels <em>good</em>.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I also like the maps themselves. I think I prefer Liberty Falls over Terminus so far because I dig its height, with extremely entertaining ziplines that let you zoom from roof to roof. I also enjoy its more traditional structure of “pay Essence to open doors and access new places” over Terminus’s “restore power to the generators and defend them from zombies so you can earn the ability to open doors” twist, but that’s not to say Terminus doesn’t do anything cool. At one point, I found a little outboard-powered raft that allowed me to venture to the smaller islands around the main area. I died pretty promptly, because when I landed on a beach a horde of zombies popped out of the ground like a bunch of really angry, undead cabbages, but c’est la vie, right? C’est la undead? I don’t speak French.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a bit more mixed on the way the maps handle progression through the story. Based on what I’ve played so far, you don’t really do much “defending” in Black Ops 6’s version of zombies. Instead, you’re constantly moving, unlocking new areas and trying to complete that map’s Main Quest during rounds. You can pretty much do this however you want. In my experience, that means a lot of running for your life and trying to earn enough Essence (which you get from offing zombies) to open the way to the next area, buy a new weapon, or upgrade a gun you like at a Pack-a-Punch Machine, which does exactly what it sounds like. Treyarch plans on providing an optional, more guided, story-focused version of the mode later on to preserve the sanctity of the Easter Egg hunt (whatever that means) – that will disable Easter Eggs and Side Quests, but I kind of wish it was here now so I could see the difference it makes. These maps are really big, and as someone with an absolutely terrible sense of direction, I’d just like to get a feel for where I’m <em>supposed </em>to go and how to get there before I focus on optional stuff.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I really don’t like, at least so far, is the meta-progression. You don’t unlock the ability to make your own loadouts until you hit level four, and even then, you probably haven’t unlocked anything fun to customize on any of the guns you have yet. What’s more, progression feels painfully slow; I hit level four after an hour and a half of game time, which feels too long to wait for that basic functionality. I’ve only played by myself as of now, which I’m sure has slowed me down, but the delay still doesn’t feel great. What’s more, the lack of customization in the early going made my runs (two on Liberty Falls, one on Terminus) feel samey in a way I didn’t like. Hopefully, playing with friends will solve this problem, but it’s something I’m wary of as I continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot I haven’t touched on yet, like in-map progression and upgrades (my early impression is actually “there might be too many mechanics here”), so I want to spend more time with this year’s Zombies mode before I finalize this review and put a score on it sometime next week. For right now, I’m excited to play more, and still kind of in awe at how we got here. Undeath sure is strange, huh soldier?</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As Cities: Skyline 2 continues its attempts to recover from last year's disastrous launch, Paradox Interactive has announced and released a fresh batch of paid DLC for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a>, some 18 months after delivering what was supposed to be its final major update.
</p>
<p>
Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-reveals-details-of-final-cities-skylines-dlc">concluded Cities: Skylines 1's release roadmap</a> in May last year with the launch of its final mini-expansion, Hotels &amp; Retreats. At the time, it said developer Colossal Order would continue general support through to the end of 2023 as it shifted its focus to Cities: Skylines 2.
</p>

But Cities: Skylines 2's launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">went poorly</a>, resulting in multiple delays to Paradox's post-launch DLC plans while Colossal Order continued to improve the base game. An early attempt to foist DLC on the Cities: Skylines 2 player base was so badly received, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">vowed to postpone</a> all future paid DLC "indefinitely". Then, in September, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">announced further DLC delays</a> so Colossal Order could complete work on a "crucial" assets editor.

<p>
And now, amid a string of other major misfires for Paradox, the publisher has decided to return to a well most assumed had finally run dry. 18 months after wrapping up support for Cities: Skylines 1, it's launched three new paid DLC packs for the game, all themed around mountain peaks and alpine terrain. There's the Mountain Village Pack and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEzJ2wmUPYQ">Map Pack 3</a>, both part of Cities: Skylines' Content Creator range, plus the Radio Station Alpine Tunes music pack.
</p><p>
"This content has been in the works for some time as we know many of you still love building and expanding your cities in the original Cities: Skylines," Paradox wrote in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/255710/view/4505380959139397651?l=english">DLC announcement</a>. "No resources were diverted from Cities: Skylines 2 for this," it continued, noting the new DLC has been created in partnership with developer Tantalus. "Our friends at Colossal Order remain fully focused on developing and improving Cities: Skylines 2."
</p>
<p>
All three new Cities: Skylines 1 DLC releases are available now on PC, and arrive ahead of <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">eight free community created region packs</a> inspired by the architecture of iconic cities around the world that'll launch for Cities: Skylines 2 starting next week.
</p>
<p>
All this comes at a challenging time for Paradox, which has faced a string of high-profile set-backs over the last few years. Alongside Cities: Skylines 2's disastrous launch, Prison Architect 2 has now been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-indefinitely-delayed-by-paradox">delayed indefinitely</a> after Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">split with developer Double Eleven</a> earlier this year, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> (which was almost cancelled before The Chinese Room <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">took over its troubled development</a>) recently saw its release pushed back from "late 2024" into 2025. That's on top of Paradox's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">decision to cancel promising life sim Life By You</a> in June, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of last year's The Lamplighters' League, which resulted in Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-and-harebrained-schemes-parting-ways-following-the-lamplighters-league-flop">parting ways with developer Harebrained Schemes</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer about the company's troubles earlier this year, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">admitted</a>, "It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cattle-country-preview-a-tootin-time.1019856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/cattle-country-preview-tootin-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Farming (or in this case, ranching) simulators are a dime a dozen now, and <em>Cattle Country</em> doesn’t quite do enough to stand out in the nearly oversaturated genre despite doing a few things pretty well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cattle-country-character-creator.jpg?itok=_aQyarBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cattle-country-character-creator.jpg?itok=OYCtY4qe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The character creator in&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>isn't complex, but the outfits and customization options were cute.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome to Cattle Country</h2>

<p>In <em>Cattle Country</em>, players are moving to a small, Western settlement to start up a ranch. I got my hands on the preview, which features the first week of play. The playable week highlights the Welcoming Committee, a group of townspeople who will introduce you to areas around town. At the end of the week, there’s a festival to close the chapter.</p>

<p>That’s where the beta ends (although, I was able to restart the festival over and over again as it was quite buggy and would restart instead of ending).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the most part, <em>Cattle Country</em> plays like what you’d expect. A day consists of taking care of your plants and livestock, talking to the village people, exploring, and mining.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cattle-country-morning-on-the-ranch.jpg?itok=5R3ORnQu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cattle-country-morning-on-the-ranch.jpg?itok=WrHc8Zb_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The aesthetics of&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>are so adorable.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Good Side of the Western Front</h2>

<p>The aesthetics of <em>Cattle Country</em> are cute, especially on the actual farm. Decorating and designing were some of the highlights of the game for me, though the <em>Cattle Country</em> beta gives players quite a bit of indoor and outdoor items to decorate and build with right from the start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another aspect of gameplay that stands out is the mining. It’s very unique for the genre, with a vertical, blocky design that’s more reminiscent of <em>Terraria </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/minecraft-dungeons-review"><em>Minecraft</em></a>&nbsp;than any popular farming sim. This wasn’t a bad thing, and it’s a big bonus for the other vanilla parts of <em>Cattle Country</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cattle Country</em> is also very solid about its theme. The Western font is impossible to ignore, and every player has a heavy accent and lingo to match. While this could be a bit overdone, I liked the fact that it stayed true to what it aims to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mining-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=16EoLZMk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mining-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=DFbHKGTi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surprisingly,&nbsp;<em>​​​​​</em>the mining in&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>was one of the best parts.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cattle Country’s People Were Interesting, But Sparse</h2>

<p>The biggest problem with <em>Cattle Country</em> was easily the village. Indie farming sims are largely beloved because of the people within them. The most successful titles understand and utilize this, and <em>Cattle Country</em> doesn’t hit the mark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nearly every NPC in the beta is a romanceable NPC. It feels like a spot for the hot singles to migrate to, and there are very few people outside of them. This makes the town feel really shallow and like it’s built around the player instead of a place the player is moving to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn’t help that the NPCs don’t really go anywhere. They mostly stood around and didn’t feel like they had any purpose in the game except to exist for the player to talk to. It doesn’t feel like you’re part of a community at all, and it really hampers how immersed you can get.</p>

<p>However, the Welcoming Committee of characters who players can spend time with throughout the week was very well-written. It’s unfortunate that the town feels so shallow when the writing of the characters feels so deep.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/opening-scene-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=np0uQXDi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/opening-scene-in-cattle-country.jpg?itok=XN8acYuO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The start of&nbsp;<em>Cattle Country&nbsp;</em>with Jeb was really cute, and it reminded me of several well-loved games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Overall, Cattle Country Has Some Major Beta Woes</h2>

<p><em>Cattle Country</em> is still in beta, so there’s a good chance that the issues can be worked out. Considering the high parts of gameplay, it would be really great if <em>Cattle Country</em> felt more immersive by launch – cozy farming sims might be around every corner, but those of us who love them will keep playing them.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/can-an-online-library-of-classic-video-games-ever-be-legal/">reported</a> on the video game archivists asking for a legal DMCA exemption to share Internet-accessible emulated versions of their physical game collections with researchers. Today, the US Copyright Office announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">once again</a> that it was denying that request, forcing researchers to travel to far-flung collections for access to the often-rare physical copies of the games they're seeking.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2024/2024_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">announcing its decision</a>, the <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/newsnet/2020/857.html">Register of Copyrights for the Library of Congress</a> sided with the Entertainment Software Association and others who argued that the proposed remote access could serve as a legal loophole for a free-to-access "online arcade" that could harm the market for classic gaming re-releases. This argument resonated with the Copyright Office despite <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/87-of-classic-games-are-out-of-print-thats-a-problem-for-gaming-history/">a VGHF study that found 87 percent of those older game titles are currently out of print</a>.</p>
<p>"While proponents are correct that some older games will not have a reissue market, they concede there is a 'healthy' market for other reissued games and that the industry has been making 'greater concerted efforts' to reissue games," the Register writes in her decision. "Further, while the Register appreciates that proponents have suggested broad safeguards that could deter recreational uses of video games in some cases, she believes that such requirements are not specific enough to conclude that they would prevent market harms."</p>

<p>A DMCA exemption for remote sharing already exists for non-video-game computer software that is merely "functional," as the Register notes. But the same fair use arguments that allow for that sharing don't apply to video games because they are "often highly expressive in nature," the Register writes.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In an odd footnote, the Register also notes that emulation of classic game consoles, while not infringing in its own right, has been "historically associated with piracy," thus "rais[ing] a potential concern" for any emulated remote access to library game catalogs. That footnote paradoxically cites Video Game History Foundation (VGHF) founder and director Frank Cifaldi's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/how-the-demonization-of-emulation-devalues-gamings-heritage/">2016 Game Developers Conference talk</a> on the demonization of emulation and its importance to video game preservation.</p>
<p>"The moment I became the Joker is when someone in charge of copyright law watched my GDC talk about how it's wrong to associate emulation with piracy and their takeaway was 'emulation is associated with piracy,'" Cifaldi <a href="https://x.com/frankcifaldi/status/1849870320339124340">quipped in a social media post</a>.</p>
<h2>The fight continues</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://gamehistory.org/dmca-2024-statement/">a statement</a> issued in response to the decision, the VGHF called out "lobbying efforts by rightsholder groups" that "continue to hold back progress" for researchers. The status quo limiting remote access "forces researchers to explore extra-legal methods to access the vast majority of out-of-print video games that are otherwise unavailable," the VGHF writes.</p>
<p>"Frankly my colleagues in literary studies or film history have pretty routine and regular access to digitized versions of the things they study," <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/laine-nooney">NYU professor Laine Nooney</a> argued to the Copyright Office earlier this year. "These [travel] impediments [to access physical games] are real and significant and they do impede research in ways that are not equitable compared to our colleagues in other disciplines."</p>

<p>Speaking to Ars Technica, VGHF Library Director Phil Salvador said that the group was "disappointed" in the Copyright Office decision but "proud of the work we've done and the impact this process has had. The research we produced during this process has already helped justify everything from game re-releases to grants for researching video game history. Our fight this cycle has raised the level of discourse around game preservation, and we're going to keep that conversation moving within the game industry."</p>

<p><a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/kalbert">Lawyer Kendra Albert</a>, who argued vociferously in favor of the proposed exemption earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kendraserra.bsky.social/post/3l7e2nsbukw2s">wrote on social media</a> that they were "gutted by the result... Speaking on behalf of only myself, and not any of my clients, I do believe we made the best case we could that scholarly access to video games <em>that are not commercially available</em> does not harm the market. I do not believe that this evidence was seriously engaged with by the Copyright Office."</p>
<p>Albert argued that the Register of Copyrights seems to have disregarded on-the-record comments from publishers of video game re-releases, who argued that remote scholarly access to library holdings would not harm their business. "It is not fair to video game scholars and preservationists to pretend that this is about creating sufficiently stringent exemption rules when the Copyright Office seems to have ignored the evidence that contradicts their prior beliefs," they wrote.</p>
<p>Today marks the fourth time the Copyright Office has rejected arguments for remote access to library game collections <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/gaming-trade-org-for-dmca-theres-no-such-thing-as-an-obsolete-game/">since 2015</a>. The office will consider arguments for and against the exemption again in 2027 as part of its triennial rulemaking process.</p>

<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowman-bomb.jpg?itok=ra5AfyF8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowman-bomb.jpg?itok=9wVfIqmy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As the name implies, the miniature depicts a gobbo in a red coat, a smaller gobbo in an elf outfit, and a happy looking snowman wearing the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ork-goff-rocker-brings-moozik-to-warhammer-40k" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Goff Rocker's</a> top hat.</p>

<p>That snowman contains a surprise. You can pop the snowman's head off, revealing the snowman's body is built around a gigantic bomb. This destructive mischief is compounded with a pile of snowballs next to the gobbos. Snowballs that are barely concealing what appear to be live grenades.</p>

<p>Da Red Gobbo 2024 is a great continuation of the Ork's farcical nature in the world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>. The grimdark sci-fi setting is mostly characterized by the bleak and grotesque. Interdimensional demons, torturous death cults, fascistic authoritarian states enforced by religious zealots.</p>

<p>By contrast, the Orks are inherently absurd creatures. Battle-obsessed meathead warriors whose simplistic reductive perspective, referred to by the fans as "Ork logic," can subtly break physical reality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowball-grenades.jpg?itok=eqiDtNZW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/da-red-gobbo-2024-snowball-grenades.jpg?itok=HlZbD186 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Battle vehicles can drive through a warzone despite having no engine or fuel. Guns that fire hundreds of rounds despite being just twisted pieces of metal. A giant hunk of space junk becomes space-worthy because Orks drew red spikes on them. The list goes on.</p>

<p>In that context, a gretchin unit showing up with snowball grenades and an explosive snowman is absurd, but does remain in line with the lore of the setting and its maximalist design sensibilities.</p>

The film is being directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who also directed 2022’s <em>Prey</em>, a fantastic Hulu-exclusive <em>Predator </em>sequel. So we know Trachtenberg is doing <em>Badlands,</em> but apparently before that releases, he has a surprise, different <em>Predator </em>film that might be an animated anthology. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an October 24 interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> Asbell answered a host of questions about upcoming 20th Century projects, like <em>Avatar</em>, <em>Alien</em>, and even <em>Speed 3</em>. But the most interesting bit of news was the confirmation that a secret, previously unknown <em>Predator </em>movie is going to arrive sometime next year before <em>Badlands</em>. </p><p>“After <em>Prey </em>became a success, Dan [Trachtenberg] came back and said he didn’t want to do <em>Prey 2,” </em>said Asbell,<em> “</em>And we’re like, ‘What do you want to do?’ And he rattled off a bunch of ideas that were really crazy but really cool.”</p><p>“We’ve actually done two of them. Two are coming out next year. One I can’t talk about yet, but the other one is the live-action <em>Predator </em>film with Elle Fanning that just wrapped in New Zealand. That’ll be out theatrically sometime next year. It’s titled <em>Badlands </em>and it is an absolutely bonkers idea. It is a sci-fi thing, but it’s not what everybody thinks it is. And I mean, it’s awesome. It is so nuts. But in Dan, we trust.”</p><p>Asbell didn’t say much about the other <em>Predator </em>movie, but did suggest it won’t be released in theaters and confirmed Tractenberg also directed it. </p><h2 id="h208701"><a id=""></a>An animated <em>Predator </em>movie and more <em>AVP</em></h2><p>On Friday<em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/secret-predator-movie-dan-trachtenberg-badlands-prey-2000516609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/secret-predator-movie-dan-trachtenberg-badlands-prey-2000516609"><em>IO9 </em>further reported</a></span> that they had heard from sources that the surprise <em>Predator </em>movie is an animated anthology featuring three different stories involving different warriors throughout history fighting Predators. One is possibly about pirates, one is reportedly about samurai, and no details were shared about the third story. Disney didn’t provide a comment to the outlet before publication. </p><p>Still, an animated <em>Predator </em>anthology about various warriors from the past taking on the intergalactic bounty hunter sounds similar to <em>Prey </em>and would likely be something released only on Hulu and not in theaters, which lines up with what Asbell told <em>THR</em>. </p><p>Meanwhile, in that same interview with <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>, the 20th Century Studios boss also said it was likely we would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/#:~:text=Fine.%20Will%20we,But%20we%20haven%E2%80%99t&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/predator-movie-an-alien-sequel-speed-3-1236042464/#:~:text=Fine.%20Will%20we,But%20we%20haven%E2%80%99t" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually get another <em>Alien Vs Predator </em>movie</a></span>, but “it wouldn’t be in the way you think.” </p><p>“That’s the thing. Not in the way that it will just be called <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> or anything like the original movies,” explained Asbell. “If we do this, they’ll be organically created out of these two franchises that we’ve continued with characters that we fall in love with and those characters will combine…perhaps. But we haven’t gotten to that point. And we’re not just going to bang it out.”<br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> brings the return of Treyarch's traditional, round-based Zombies. There are two maps to choose from, with Liberty Falls being a more casual map and Terminus being a larger and more hardcore Zombies experience. No matter which map you choose, you'll want to make sure you're well-equipped. Here we explain everything you need to know when building a custom loadout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How custom loadouts work in BO6 Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Custom Zombies loadouts return. Just like in Black Ops Cold War, you'll load into matches with a weapon and equipment of your choosing. However, the loadout customization is a bit different than recent years.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll get one primary weapon slot. You can custom-build this gun with up to five attachments, assuming you have already leveled up the gun a bit and unlocked them.</p><p dir="ltr">Your loadout also comes with a dedicated melee slot. There are only two melee weapons in the game at launch. So, you can choose between a knife and a baseball bat.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can choose one piece of tactical equipment, lethal equipment, a Zombies field upgrade, and a pack of Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">The actual guns you bring into the game won't be very powerful after the early rounds, and it costs a lot of points and salvage to level up that weapon's rarity and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-how-to-unlock-and-use-pack-a-punch-on-liberty-falls/1100-6527380/">Pack-a-Punch</a>. This is mostly a starter weapon, and thus the specific gun builds don't have to matter too much here.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be better off investing in Wall Buys with higher rarities, Mystery Box guns, or even Wonder Weapons like the Ray Gun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Augments</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839"></a><figcaption>Zombies Augment Research</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Originally introduced in Black Ops Cold War, Augments are ways to make your field upgrades more powerful for your loadout, and they do the same for perks and ammo mods you purchase in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies matches get increasingly more difficult after round 25. The waves are more intense, and there are plenty of armored zombies that start to feel like bullet sponges. This is where Augments will become most beneficial. They'll give you added benefits such as extra health, increased movement speed, and immunity from fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll need to unlock Augments by completing Augment Research, which is a menu you won't have access to until you reach level 11. You'll want to <strong>make sure you start researching Augments as soon as you unlock the feature</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 108 total Augments in the game, with multiple major and minor Augments available for every perk, ammo mod, and field upgrade in the game. You can only research one Augment at a time, and unlocking them is painfully slow.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Stamin-Up perk is a good starting point</strong>, as most of the powerful Augments are locked until you've researched a set amount of Augments. This includes the helpful Juggernog Augments that require you to research eight Augments before unlocking access to this research. Juggernog Augment research will be something you'll want to prioritize once you've unlocked it.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list and in-depth breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-all-perks-ammo-mods-field-upgrades-plus-how-to-use-augments/2900-5875/#18">all the Augments in the game can be found here</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Field Upgrade recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840"></a><figcaption>All Zombies field upgrades</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At launch, Black Ops 6 includes the following field upgrades:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aether Shroud: Phase into the Dark Aether, becoming hidden from enemy detection</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzied Guard: Repair armor and force all enemies in the area to target you. During this time, kills repair a portion of your armor</li><li dir="ltr">Healing Aura: Summons beams of energy down on yourself and allies to instantly revive and heal to full health</li><li dir="ltr">Energy Mine: Create a mine of pure energy that detonates in rapid succession, dealing lethal electric damage</li><li dir="ltr">Dark Flare: You generate a massive energy beam that deals lethal shadow damage. The beam penetrates everything in its path</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few really solid options here, depending on your playstyle and if you're playing with friends. It's usually good to have a mix of field upgrades for a full team.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: A medic role is important, so you probably want to have at least one player with <strong>Healing Aura</strong>, and <strong>Frenzied Guard</strong> is for the teammate who likes to be aggro and pull all the zombies towards them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aether Shroud</strong> is also a good choice for team play or solo matches, as going invisible for a short time can let you escape a sticky situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Flare</strong> isn't the most team-friendly perk, but it is a lot of fun to use and deal out a ton of damage. <strong>Energy Mine</strong> is the least helpful and enjoyable option, so this is a bottom-tier pick that I wouldn't invest much in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gobblegum recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841"></a><figcaption>All Black Ops 6 Gobblegums</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums return in Zombies, and these are powerful but temporary effects you can use. These are extremely optional. Some players prefer not to even use Gobblegums or things like Augments to make the game feel like a more classic Zombies experience.</p><p dir="ltr">However, here are some tips for making the most of your Gobblegums. Your loadout lets you customize a pack of five gums of various rarities, and you can earn more unique gums just by playing and completing rounds. You'll see an in-game popup every time you earn a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd recommend grinding out some Zombies matches and saving up any powerful ones you earn for later matches, such as going for high-rounds or attempting an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">These will be gums such as:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Perkaholic: Gives you all the perks on the map</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Up: Revives all downed teammates and lets them keep their perks</li><li dir="ltr">Wall Power: The next weapon you buy off the wall comes Pack-a-Punched</li><li dir="ltr">On The House: Spawns a random perk power-up that benefits you and your teammates</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, make sure to check out our Liberty Falls guides.
