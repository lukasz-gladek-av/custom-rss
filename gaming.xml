<p>Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is another bout of beautiful violence. Eviscerating Zeds and leaving them for dead is the name of the game—well, Killing Floor 3 is. If it’s your first time or you’re a returning fan, here’s the Xbox Game Pass status for the FPS title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is already testing the waters well ahead of time. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a> lets players see what’s new, what works, and what needs fine-tuning. The second installment was fun but had a penchant for repetition, and the third mainline release is looking to be the best yet.</p>



<p>Eventually, Killing Floor 3 will launch, and if it’s on Xbox Game Pass, this is a victory before we even play the game.</p>

<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass is not adding Killing Floor 3 to its collection of easily accessible games.</strong></p>



<p>You get access to hundreds of games if you’re a Microsoft Xbox Game Pass subscriber. Many of these arrive as day-one debuts on the Game Pass scheme. However, <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> is not a day-one addition as Tripwire Interactive and Microsoft don’t have an agreement for it to happen.</p>



<p>There’s no mention of Killing Floor 3 coming to Game Pass on its official store page. Nor has the opportunity been mentioned in any trailers, prerelease material, or press releases.</p>



<p>Titles associated with Xbox Game Studios are pretty much day-one Game Pass releases. Any other third-party titles are not guaranteed and it’s up to the two companies to come to an understanding. If not, the game launches of its own accord and it’s up to the publisher to drive sales. In this case, Tripwire Interactive is handling both development and publishing duties, so it’s up to them to generate interest and revenue for KF3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-killing-floor-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Killing Floor 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s uncertain if Killing Floor 3 is coming to Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>The closest KF has come to Xbox’s Game Pass subscription service was in 2024 when Killing Floor 2 was offered as a “Free Play Days” promotion. Game Pass users were allowed to sample Killing Floor 2 for a few days. After this, the title went back to being another purchasable option on the Xbox store.</p>



<p>We’ll update this guide if Killing Floor 3 does come to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<hr>



<p>Killing Floor 3 looks to be as brutal and painful as its predecessors. Can you envisage yourself losing hundreds of hours lopping off limbs and severing skulls? Or is Killing Floor 3 not your stop?</p>

Ubisoft has detailed the list of achievements for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the game won't require you to play twice or pick a particular character at certain points in order to unlock every award.
</p>
<p>
The full list of achievements lies below - and they're the same across Steam, Xbox and for Trophies on PlayStation. There are no spoilers.
</p>
<p>
Not requiring multiple playthroughs is probably for the best - Shadows looks like another Assassin's Creed epic, following previous games like Odyssey and Valhalla where I clocked up playtime in the 100s of hours.

</figure>
<p>
Having to finish the game once to then unlock a harder difficulty and grind for another achievement after completing that? No thank you.
</p>
<p>
"Available on day one, these Steam achievements (which are the same as the Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies) can all be earned in a single playthrough, meaning no achievement can be missed regardless of what story choices you make," Ubisoft wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535468672209128051?l=english">blog post on Steam</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"And don't worry - your Leap of Fail will look just as spectacular whether you're playing on story mode or on expert level, as all achievements are unlockable regardless of difficulty level."
</p>
<p>
(At a guess, I'd say Leap of Fail will likely pop when you try to perform the iconic Assassin's Creed dive as samurai Yasuke - who is not trained for the purpose.)
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows' two protagonists offer two different gameplay styles (quiet assassin, or all-out samurai) and can be swapped between frequently - or not, if you so choose.
</p>
<p>
The game also features dialogue choices, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Ubisoft has also confirmed Assassin's Creed Shadows' canon story mode option</a> for those who want a strictly linear narrative.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/monster-hunter-wilds-do-i-need-to-play-monster-hunter-world-first/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is the latest instalment in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/capcom">Capcom</a>’s power-selling action RPG series which is out now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Despite the rampant popularity of its predecessor, 2018’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a>, there’s a good chance this fresh entry will attract a new generation of fans, with a considerable number of gamers sat on the fence. One of the questions they may be asking themselves is if they need to play Monster Hunter World (or indeed any other games in the franchise) before they can play Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The answer is a simple, albeit emphatic, no. For those new to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>, each game is its own entity with no overarching narrative or core cast of characters to keep track of. Sure, beneath the surface there’s a surprisingly dense web of lore though this is all extra-curricular fluff that has little bearing on main, monster-hunting experience.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter World ushered in a new era for Capcom’s long-running series and one that focused on streamlining certain time-consuming elements thereby making it more accessible. For our money, it’s one of the greatest modern RPGs ever made, but if you’re looking to get into the series, we’d advise skipping right ahead and venturing into Wilds.</p>


<p>Yet again, Capcom has reduced the amount of busy work players need to perform between hunts, making everything – from gathering resources to crafting new gear – available at your fingertips almost instantaneously. On the flipside, there are a great deal of new mechanics for veteran hunters to sink their teeth into: each weapon type has an expanded moveset with a plethora of new advanced tools and equipment on-hand.</p>
<p>Multiplayer has always been the most enjoyable part of Monster Hunter, and this is where Wilds has World beat. There’s a good chance that most fans will emigrate from older MH titles to Wilds at launch – not only that, the inclusion of cross-play will make it easier to find online lobbies than ever before.</p>
<p>Still, if you’re looking to get a good understanding of how these games work, there’s no harm in trying Monster Hunter World first. It’s dirt cheap and if you really don’t gel with it (we won’t judge) at least you haven’t paid top whack for Monster Hunter Wilds at launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-won%E2%80%99t-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-to-include-dlc.1120221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems like Hogwarts Legacy 2 won't be a live service game after all. At least, that's what Jason Schreier said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the latest Kinda Funny Gamescast episode</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have talked about how in recent years people like Zaslav and JB Perrette are talking all about games as a service, but the games as a service mandate started long before that. This is more executives just saying what shareholders want to hear, because if you look at their current slate of games, they're not games as a service. Hogwarts Legacy 2 is not going to be a game as a service, the new Batman from Rocksteady is not going to be a game as a service, and even Wonder Woman wasn't going to be a game as a service. This is not a company that is going all in on games as a service. They're going all in on those big franchises.</em></p>
<p><em>I think they still believe that there's room for success. I've talked to executives there who envision a world where you would be playing in Hogwarts with your friends and you go hang out with your buddies, you're all wizards together and taking classes together. They have these kind of fantasies in their heads about games as a service that might work. It's just that these particular projects that are currently in development - I'm sure they have a game of service at some point somewhere, but those are not them.</em></p>
<p>That is quite surprising, considering that less than a year ago, JB Perrette (CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games at Warner Bros. Discovery) <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>Rather than just launching a one-and-done console game, how do develop a game around, for example, Hogwarts Legacy that is a live service where people can live and build and play in that world on an ongoing basis?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it is simply the case that this executive vision didn't quite align with what Avalanche Software felt they could deliver with Hogwarts Legacy 2, effectively postponing the publisher's dream of a live service game in Harry Potter's universe.</p>
<p>Anyway, Schreier also doubled down on the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition in the works between Rocksteady and Avalanche Software featuring new 'DLC'. It is unclear whether this DLC will be exclusive to the new edition or separately purchasable for owners of the existing game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want more Hogwarts Legacy content, there's the new official modding tools and mod support <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in late January for PC</a>.</p>

            <p>Late last week, former Striking Distance concept art director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">Jesse Lee took to LinkedIn</a> to reminisce on their time at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio. "Thinking back to the very beginning of Striking Distance Studios, to today - nearly six years later. Most of the devs were laid off, and it is hard to sum it all up right now," wrote Lee.</p>
<p>The layoffs were confirmed this week in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement from parent company Krafton to PC Gamer</a>, which you can find below. Apologies for spoiling anyone's game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">official statement bingo</a> but, yes, it contains the word "agile".</p>

<p>"Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile, which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development," a Krafton representative told PC Gamer. "The studio remains operational, and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time."</p>
<p>Several other former employees spoke about losing their jobs alongside Lee. "It was a tough morning at Striking Distance," said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a/">animation director Zach Volker</a>, "lots of layoffs, including myself. It was a great ride and I'm so grateful for the opportunities I had to lead the charge on multiple projects and for the new relationships I've built." Cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">was also impacted</a>.</p>
<p>It feels telling of LinkedIn's culture (and the nature of finding more work in a precarious landscape) that many layoff posts are often accompanied by similar expressions of gratitude and eagerness. It's terrible enough to lose your job through no fault of your own, let alone for a culture (or some cowardly NDA) to discourage or deny you the catharsis of expressing anger and grief for fear of being seen as difficult or not adequatedly cosplaying nebulous notions of 'professionalism' - not that I can know how the affected developers genuinely feel.</p>
<p>This isn't the first round of layoffs at Striking Distance, either, following 32 employees <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-hit-by-lay-offs-for-32-employees">let go in August of 2023</a>. "Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success," said Krafton at the time. Back in January of that year, more than 20 staff alleged they had been omitted from the game's credits.

            <p>Details on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach are scarce at the moment, but as new details slowly emerge it sounds a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> - though there's plenty still to come.</p>
<p>Ahead of creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s SXSW livestream at which the release date is expected, Sony has updated the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">PlayStation website listing</a> for the sequel with fresh details hinting towards how it will play.</p>
<p>"Expect the unexpected," it reads, which is just par for the course with Kojima games.</p>

<p>"Sam - with companions by his side - sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles and a haunting question: Should we have connected?"</p>
<p>Until now, we've only seen an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr2yB93pIGw">initial teaser trailer of Death Stranding 2</a> at The Game Awards in 2022 and an announcement trailer at last year's PlayStation State of Play (above).</p>
<p>The website update essentially hints to what has already been inferred from these trailers.</p>
<p>"The large open-world environments of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are full of secrets to be found," it reads, describing the "unique and explorable world". "They are also incredibly varied and pose unique challenges to navigate."</p>
<p>That tracks with the announcement trailer, in which we see Sam Bridges exploring a desert, a cityscape, and more beyond the first game's Icelandic-inspired highlands.</p>
<p>The game also promises "exciting and adaptable combat" where players can be aggressive, stealthy, or avoid combat, much like the first game.</p>
<p>It also confirms, as expected, the "social strand gameplay" will return, as "your actions can affect how other players interact with the game's world, and vice-versa".</p>
<p>More specifically: "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach supports asynchronous multiplayer in the same way as the original game. Actions of other players, such as the creation of roads or structures and the routes they have travelled, will become visible and usable to the player once they have successfully connected areas of the map." PS Plus is not required to access these elements.</p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty more to Death Stranding 2, even just by the trailers. How is Higgs back? Why does he battle with an electric guitar? And what the hell is with the talking puppet?</p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monolith Productions' official closure</a>, renowned journalist Jason Schreier shared more details about what the studio had been working on since the 2017 launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, Schreier revealed that Monolith did not want to make another game in the 'Middle-earth: Shadow of' universe. That is understandable, as by Shadow of War, the formula had become rather stale. The developer attempted to create an original IP codenamed Legacy next, but Warner Bros. Games decided to cancel the project in April 2021. This proved to be a fatal blow for Monolith because most of the leadership team resigned and went on to found <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cliffhanger Games</a>, an Electronic Arts-owned developer that is developing <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Black Panther game</a>. Interestingly, this new game will feature 'new storytelling tech' that will be used across several EA games, sounding a lot like the Nemesis system developed at Monolith. That one is trademarked by Warner Bros. Games, but some of the former developers could have developed a similar concept without incurring legal problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, Monolith tried to make the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman game</a> powered by the Nemesis system. However, the studio had to rebuild its leadership team from scratch in the middle of this new project, and they were also unsure whether to use Unreal Engine or their own LithTech Firebird engine. The latter ultimately won out, but several of the engineers who were experienced with it had left the company by then, causing development problems.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Wonder Woman was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-game-was-rebooted-last-year-rocksteady-is-going-back-to-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> between late 2023 and early 2024. The new version was supposed to be more like God of War and no longer have the Nemesis system. Clearly, though, a lot of work was left to do before the game could ship, and Warner Bros. Games decided to cut their losses and shut down Monolith for good. As is often the case in these situations, the developers only learned about the dire news on the same day as the public.</p>
<p>Regarding the rest of Warner Bros. Games, some executives reportedly wanted to transform WB Games Montreal into a support studio after the release of Gotham Knights, and some of the team was put on helping Monolith with Wonder Woman until recently. However, the developer of Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights is still trying to pitch a Game of Thrones title, and the IP based on George R.R. Martin's world was named among the publisher's priorities going forward. According to Schreier, TT Games is also in the final steps of making a new LEGO game that could launch as early as next year.</p>

            <p>Colourful story-driven adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">To a T</a> is a new game from the studio of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi. You play as an eternally T-posing teenager who must learn how to get by performing the simple tasks of life despite the challenge of having their arms permanently outstretched. We first learned about the game back in 2023, when it was announced with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">very sing-alongable trailer</a>. Now, it has a release date, along with another cracking musical number. Come watch.</p>

<p>Ah, that's good. The game will come out May 28th, we're told. Besides having some friendly tunes, the trailer also shows off other features of the game, including some we haven't seen until now. You can customise your Teen's appearance, for example, and pick out shirts and shoes to wear. There's a dance sequence, teeth-brushing, dog petting, and some casual unicycling. </p>
<p>Outside the episodic story and minigames, you'll also be exploring the teen's hometown, visiting the shops, and chatting to other inhabitants eg. a giant talking pigeon wearing headphones. The teen also discovers the power to spin round incredibly fast and soar into the sky like a helicopter. We have seen that one previously, but yes, it seems useful. </p>
<p>The game is being developed by Uvula, the studio led by Keita Takahashi, designer of kid-friendly games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenya-wanya-teens">Tenya Wanya Teens</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wattam">Wattam</a>, and Noby Noby Boy (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_TVzFVZbl4">chaotic spaghetti 'em up</a> that sadly never came to PC). They're generally colourful, playful, and approachable games about movement and silliness. This game's theme of going through everyday life as a kid with a disability means that the studio also consulted with charity AbleGamers about the subject, and want to make sure actually playing the thing is accessible.</p>
<p>Fun fact about Keita Takahashi: he was once <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/games/japanese-games-designer-recruited-to-design-nottingham-playground-1810807.html">hired by Nottingham city council to design a playground</a>. In the end, the park was cancelled because of budget concerns, so we never got to see his wild garden of trampolines and catapults. But sometimes I still think about what <a href="https://x.com/zerofiftyone_/status/1431042842378608642?lang=en">his happy doodles</a> might have looked like in real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He continued: "Everybody has a different kind of personal fantasy and then, at least in my experience, when you are given the environment that you sort of fantasised about you're like 'OK' and you just want to take the headset off, because it's this hot, heavy thing. It's weird and disappointing."</p>
<p>Blackley said one of the key issues with VR "from a narrative standpoint" is that it offers "too much freedom", and that illusion of freedom is undermined by the need for developers to provide narrative control.</p>
<p>"When you lower the structure so much for the player that they are in the headset and they look around everywhere, in principle as an elevator pitch that sounds great," he said. "In practice, when we want to be entertained, we want a storyteller to control the narrative and to entertain us.</p>
<p>"To some extent you need [developers] to be able to control what you're looking at," he continued. "You need them to constrain you to the narrative which is not the thing you're going to do. And there's a small minority of guys who are going to scream and yell at them and want full control and that's great, super cool, fine, guys but they enjoy having that control because they're getting off on breaking that narrative control and they wouldn't be getting off on it if it wasn't there already, so it's paradoxical."</p>
<p>There have certainly been some great technical showcases for VR: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-a-visually-spectacular-introduction-to-the-psvr2">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> launched with Sony's PSVR2 to show off its capabilities, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Valve's Half-Life Alyx</a> has been celebrated by the few who have played it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse</a> is another great VR game that "epitomises everything great about virtual reality", as reads our review, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beat-saber-out-now-on-psvr2">Beat Saber</a> - available on almost every headset - is arguably VR's "killer app".</p>
<p>Yet Sony in particular is failing to support its PS VR2 headset - its recent PlayStation State of Play had no mention of the platform whatsoever. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> creative director Nicolas Doucet said last year there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-chance-of-astro-bot-coming-to-ps-vr2-says-creative-director">"no chance" of the game coming to PS VR2</a>, and as Eurogamer's Ian Higton wrote "it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2</a> if even Astro Bot won't wear one", after starring in PS VR1 game Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The release dates for an upcoming expansion pack for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> have seemingly leaked via the Nintendo Store. The first part of the Crossroads Of The World collection, slated for "early March" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">in the official roadmap</a>, is indeed listed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iz5ehp/the_release_dates_for_both_upcoming_expansions/">the leaked image</a> as due on March 4th, 2025, with the second part due on March 25th - lining up with the roadmap's "late March".</p>
<p>Specifically, March 4th brings three separate items: the Ada Lovelace, Carthage, and Great Britain packs. On the 25th of the month, they'll be joined by Simon Bolivar, Bulgaria, and Nepal.</p>
<p>The are some discrepancies on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Sid-Meier-s-Civilization-VII-2637632.html#dlcItems">the UK Nintendo store</a>, however, with the release dates for each of the packs from the first set also listed as 25/03/2025. </p>

<p>These are all part of a single <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3004660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII_Crossroads_of_the_World_Collection/">Steam store item</a>, released in two parts over the course of the month. The Crossroads Of The World expansion also includes the 'wonder pack', which includes the Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca natural wonders. Based on the current Steam reviews, I gather it was part of some sort of super shiny edition or other, but looking at edition versions makes my back and soul ache these days.</p>
<p>"A mostly successful effort to address major criticisms of previous Civilization games," reckoned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Greg Costikyan in his review for RPS</a>.

<p>On Thursday, February 27, The Pokemon Company held its Pokemon Presents event for February 2025. The event coincides with Pokemon Day, a day to honor the original Japanese release of Pokemon Red and Green on February 27, 1996. </p>



<p>While nothing was confirmed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for the event</a>, it should be expected that players will get a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Pokemon Go, Pokemon TCG Pocket, and, possibly, a look at Pokemon gameplay running on Nintendo Switch 2. There is also speculation of a remake of Pokemon Black and White in the works along with the next games in the “Let’s Go” series.</p>



<p>Follow along as everything is announced. Because this is a running article throughout the show, make sure you refresh starting at 9am ET/2pm GMT for everything announced.</p>



<p>And be sure to let us know your thoughts on the showcase in the comments or join the discussion further in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. It’s worth noting that everything is in the order it was shown.</p>

            <p>
Eternal Strands, the well-received action-RPG from Dragon Age boss Mike Laidlaw's Yellow Brick Games studio, has shared its latest roadmap, promising - among other things - free DLC created in collaboration with Final Fantasy concept artist Yusuki Mogi and, separately, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a> studio Grasshopper Manufacture.
</p>
<p>
Eternal Strands, if you're in need of a refresher, launched last month, inviting players to follow the adventures of Brynn - a member of a dwindling group of magic users known as the Weavers - who sets out across a fantasy kingdom ravaged by a cataclysmic magical event to uncover its mysteries and recover her people's cultural home.
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, it borrows bits from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, with a bit of Monster Hunter thrown in - a mix Christian Donlan reckoned made for a "combustible and hilarious sandbox" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eternal-strands-review">four star Eurogamer review</a>.

<p>
And now, with Eternal Strands' first month of release almost behind it, Yellow Brick Games is ready to start discussing its post-launch plans. And that begins with a "Day 30 Patch" coming in March and promising a range of enhancements. There's talk of improved character movement to reduce its "slippery" sensation, for instance, as well as improved combat responsiveness, reduced Umbral Darter presence in certain areas, bug fixes, and more.
</p>
<p>
Then it's onto the fun stuff. Sometime this "spring", Eternal Strands will receive its first free DLC. This'll see Yellow Brick teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a> and XVI concept artist Yusuke Mogi to design and introduce a new in-game epic, a new armour set, and new weapon skins. Eternal Strands' spring update also promises a new map and magic power, a weapon and armour dying system, Oria's tips and tricks, plus further bug fixes.
</p>

 </a>

<p>
That'll eventually lead into summer, when Eternal Strands' second free DLC update arrives. This is a collaboration with No More Heroes studio Grasshopper Manufacture, and is set to deliver currently unspecified "new content", among other things.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of March's first major patch release, Yellow Brick has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1491410/announcements/detail/506195909797741133">shared developer notes</a> outlining its key changes in more detail. Additionally, the studio is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EternalStrands/comments/1iuunkp/ama_with_the_devs_feb_27_11am_et/">set to hold an Eternal Strands Ask Me Anything on Reddit</a> this Thursday, 27th February at 4pm GMT, where it'll be nattering about everything from the game's lore to the future features and content it has planned.

          <p>Game studio Monolith, part of Warner Bros. Games until <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure">yesterday's multi-studio shutdown</a>, had a notable track record across more than 30 years, having made <em>Blood, </em><em>No One Lives Forever</em>, <em>Shogo: Mobile Armor Division</em>, <em>F.E.A.R., </em>and, most recently, the Lord of the Rings series, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/09/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-a-shadow-of-its-own-ambition/"><em>Shadow of Mordor</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/shadow-of-war-hands-on-latest-lotr-game-will-be-hard-but-will-it-be-fun/"><em>Shadow of War</em></a>.</p>
<p>Those games, derived from J.R.R. Tolkien's fiction, had a "Nemesis System," in which the enemies that beat the player or survive a battle with them can advance in level, develop distinct strengths and weaknesses, and become an interesting subplot and motivation in the game. Monolith's next game, the now-canceled <em>Wonder Woman,</em>&nbsp;was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyA8lnp9Tzg">teased more than three years ago</a>, and said to be "powered by the Nemesis System."</p>
<p>Not only will <em>Wonder Woman</em> not be powered by the Nemesis System, but likely no other games will be, either, at least until August 2036. That's when "Nemesis characters, nemesis forts, social vendettas and followers in computer games," patent <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160279522A1/en">US2016279522A1</a>, is due to expire. Until then, any game that wants to implement gameplay involving showdowns, factions, and bitter NPC feelings toward a player must either differentiate it enough to avoid infringement, license it from Warner Brothers, or gamble on WB Games' legal attention.</p>
<p>It's bad enough that talented developers were let go. That one of their most notable innovations ends up locked up in a corporate vault, for more than a decade after they ceased to exist, is quite the sad footnote.</p>

</a>That WB Games was granted this patent is eye-opening, but not necessarily shocking. For 20 years, Namco held <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/12/loading-screen-boredom-may-behind-us-thanks-to-expiring-patent/">a patent on loading screen mini-games</a>. That patent was issued despite plenty of "loading screen games" existing before 1995, including&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_loader#Cassette_tapes"><em>Invade-a-load</em></a>.
