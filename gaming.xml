            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-remasters-could-be-announced-on-the-franchises-20th-anniversary/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We first <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-rumored-to-be-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> rumors about the God of War Greek saga remaster plan in October 2024. That rumor suggested Sony Santa Monica would be working with Nixxes Software to enhance the beloved original trilogy for modern hardware.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reckoned</a> the announcement would come at the February State of Play, but that turned out to be incorrect. Now, insider Jeff Grubb has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bdacp2cmuuyawx553cv2spdy/post/3liqdacmdnc23?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the news could be officially confirmed in time for the franchise's 20th anniversary. This would land on March 22, which marked the original game's debut in North America (Europe, as was customary back then, had to wait until July 7).</p>
<p>We don't have any details on what would be included. However, we can guess there would be significant graphical improvements over the previous remasters (the first two games were remastered for PlayStation 3, and the last one for PlayStation 4), as well as possibly some quality-of-life enhancements. It is highly unlikely that it would be anything more than that, as that'd make it more of a remake than a remaster, and the scope of a full-fledged remake of the God of War trilogy would be massive.</p>
<p>It's interesting that Sony would be willing to bring those games back to the market once again. While they do serve as a backstory for Kratos as we've seen him in the Norse mythology continuation, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-officially-coming-from-amazon-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TV series adaptation in the making at Amazon Prime Video</a> will be based on the latter, not on the Greek saga. As a reminder, the adaptation was originally meant to be led by Rafe Judkins, but the showrunner left the project and was replaced in late 2024 by Ronald D. Moore, who is known for his work on acclaimed TV shows like Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Outlander, and For All Mankind.</p>

            <p>
Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza has found its sea legs on Steam, where it launched to the series' second-biggest concurrent player haul to date.
</p>
<p>
A peak of 22,327 PC players played Pirate Yakuza over the weekend, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3061810/charts/#1w">Steam's own stats</a> - avast total higher than every other game in the franchise to date, save Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time, Steam itself broke its all-time concurrent user record once more - this time to hit 39.92 million online users. Prior to this, the record stood at 39.3 million, from back in December 2024.

</figure>
<p>
While a better start than most of the (many) other Yakuza/Like A Dragon games, including 2023's Like A Dragon: Ishin! and The Man Who Erased His Name, RGG Studio's nautical spin-off still saw around half of the players at launch as last year's Infinite Wealth, which peaked at 46,161 concurrent players total.
</p>
<p>
On the one hand, Pirate Yakuza is most definitely a spin-off from the main series. On the other - pirates!
</p>
<p>
"A raucous, absurd spin-off that manages to still feel like a first-rate Yakuza game despite the leftfield setting and delightfully unhinged plot," Matt Elliot wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Eurogamer's Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza review</a>. "All of this somehow coalesces into something that works in defiance of itself."

            <p>Actor Yuri Lowenthal, the voice behind Peter Parker in Insomanic's games, has confirmed the original Spider-Man won't be sidelined in the series' third chapter.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive">The Direct</a>, Lowenthal stated there were "very few things" he could say about Insomniac's yet to actually be announced next Spider-Man game right now, but assured fans that "Peter is not gone" by any means.</p>
<p>"He will be a part of the next game and he won't be relegated to the couch, I promise," Lowenthal said. <strong>Beware some Marvel's Spider-Man 2 spoilers below.</strong></p>

<p>Those who have completed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> will know that the game ends with Peter Parker essentially handing the webby torch over to Miles Morales. While Miles as Spider-Man will take care of New York, Peter was going to focus more on his personal life with Mary Jane, and also build the Emily-May Foundation after it got fairly ripped to shreds during the fight with Venom.</p>
<p>The game then rounds out with two mid-credits scenes, clearly pathing the way for that third entry. The first of these scenes sees Norman Osborn - devastated by his son Harry's comatose state, and who blames the Spider-Men for ruining Harry's recovery - popping over to The Raft to visit Dr Octavius. He seems on course to become the Green Goblin, one of the Spider-Man series' main antagonists.</p>
<p>A second scene focusing on Miles' family introduces us very briefly to his mother's new boyfriend Albert Moon, and Albert's daughter, Cindy. Cindy Moon, for those unaware, is another person in the Marvel universe who gets bitten and given powers by a radioactive spider. She becomes the superhero Silk.</p>
<p>Guides writer Marie and I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-marvels-spider-man-2">chatted at length about where the next game could go following Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and we theorised Miles may take Cindy under his wing and show her the Spidey ropes much like Peter did with him. At first we assumed this would mean Peter would have more of a 'cameo-like' role in the next game, but given what Lowenthal has said, it seems he may have a bigger role than first thought.</p>
<p>What are your hopes for Peter and co in the next Marvel's Spider-Man game?</p>

<p>While Lowenthal's comments have sparked plenty of chatter, Marvel's Spider-Man 3 is perhaps still a way off. After all, the studio still has its Wolverine release in the works.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game">Wolverine was first teased back in 2021</a>, during a PlayStation Showcase. At this time, the studio stated the game was still "very early in development". Last month, Insomniac's newly appointed studio head Chad Dezern acknowledged the "pent up excitement" around the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-developer-wont-say-if-wolverine-launches-in-2025-but-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement-for-release-date">refrained from confirming or denying a 2025 release window for Wolverine</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/pillars-tactics-is-a-game-that-many-at-obsidian-would-love-to-make-says-josh-sawyer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-sales-make-obsidian-happy-so-far-game-director-would-love-to-do-more-in-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful launch of Avowed</a>, Pillars of Eternity creator Josh Sawyer did an LA Wild Fire Relief Stream yesterday <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2388422071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Obsidian's Twitch channel</a>. During the lengthy stream, he played the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released game</a> and talked about various topics.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Sawyer revealed that there's quite a lot of interest within the team to make a 'Pillars Tactics' game, although there is uncertainty about its commercial success.</p>
<p><em>Pillars Tactics is a thing that a lot of people at the studio would like to work on, and there are a lot of people who like tactics games. Figuring out a scope for it is tricky. A scope of development where it feels like it could actually make money, because tactics games have a very enthusiastic fan base, but the fan base is not humongous. It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are going to buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people.</em></p>
<p>Over a year ago, following the incredible success of Baldur's Gate 3, Sawyer <a href="https://wccftech.com/pillars-of-eternity-3-with-baldurs-gate-3-budget-is-something-josh-sawyer-would-do-with-turn-based-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> he'd love to do a more tactical, turn-based Pillars of Eternity 3 if Microsoft would only provide the triple-A budget for it.</p>
<p><em>I think that would be a lot of fun to do, to do like a high production value party based fantasy RPG. I’m pretty happy with Pillars and Deadfire, but I do think that if it were not crowdfunded, I would probably make it turn based. I’m not saying to not have a real time with pause system, but I do think that the Deadfire turn based system which I can’t take credit for, that Nick Carver and Brian MacIntosh did, was really cool. But, the game wasn’t designed for it, so actually designing the game for turn based, fewer encounters, smaller encounters, but much more tactical, I think that would be a lot of fun, and having awesome cinematics and all that stuff.</em></p>
<p>Still, as things stand, it seems more likely that Obsidian will continue making first-person action RPGs like Avowed and the upcoming The Outer Worlds 2, which is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated to launch sometime this year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/shotgun-cop-man-is-no-frills-no-fat-all-shotgun-jumping-fun/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>At first glance, Shotgun Cop Man might not seem like the bigger-and-better follow-up to indie hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/20/my-friend-pedro-review/">My Friend Pedro</a> that many would’ve expected. It’s got a stripped back aesthetic, and the gameplay has shifted from slow-motion chaos to more minimalist micro-movement platforming. It’s a surprising shift in scope and style, but after getting my hands on the debut demo for the game, I see the vision.</p>
<p>It’s not that this game is a smaller and simpler project. Instead, it skews so deftly into an efficient, minimalist approach to art-style and gameplay that it’s more like I’m playing the long-awaited sequel to N++. A sequel with shotguns and Satan in it.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARREST SATAN in SHOTGUN COP MAN | From the Creator of My Friend Pedro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a narrative hook to Shotgun Cop Man,&nbsp;but it’s been written on a napkin and dangled from broken fishing-line and, honestly, that’s totally fine. You are Shotgun Cop Man, and your job is to go to Hell and arrest Satan. It’s so obnoxiously and hilariously barebones that it immediately accomplished two things for me. Firstly, it made me laugh a lot. Secondly,, it made it clear that the focus is all on the gameplay, and just the act of playing in itself.</p>
<p>It’s an act which is fun as Hell, by the way. This is a side-scrolling platformer where you have no jump button. Instead, you use your right-trigger to fire a pistol that shot propels you a little bit so you can hover in the air, or you use your left-trigger to fire a massive shotgun blast that propels you much further in your direction of choice. These weapons are also meant to be used as literal weapons, though, with demons scattered throughout each level trying to shoot you before you can make it to the exit.</p>


<p>So, the loop immediately reveals itself and it hooked me in an instant. Every bullet you fire isn’t just a potential hit on an enemy, but also a sudden force of momentum that flings you in the opposite direction. Thinking about gunfire and platforming not as parallel actions, but as a yin and yang that flow into each other is really fascinating. As I progressed through the demo, I got a hang of things and learned how a shotgun blast could kill an enemy while also propelling me closer to the next one, or how a pistol shot could cancel my momentum from a shotgun blast just before I hit a deadly obstacle. The flow is simple, but so satisfying.</p>
<p>What I also appreciate about Shotgun Cop Man is that it’s incredibly forgiving despite the twitch-precision platformer DNA that runs through it all. When you get hit by a bullet or obstacle, you lose your heart, but can keep playing and even grab your floating heart to return to normal. Getting hit with no heart triggers an immediate and hilarious death-screen, but when you continue from there, you’re placed at a very forgiving checkpoint right near where you died. Freaks who want the thrill of a no-death run can fully restart and chase that high, but being able to zone out a bit and comfortably clear a level with that much assistance is a nice change of pace from the usual difficulty present in these games.</p>

<p>There’s a clear, consistent, and super fun design goal behind Shotgun Cop Man, and I’m all for it. This demo is a short and sweet slice of a game that I can’t wait to continue playing.</p>
<p><em>Try Shotgun Cop Man for yourself now, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966870/Shotgun_Cop_Man_Demo/">a PC demo available with Steam Next Fest</a>. Shotgun Cop Man is coming to PC and Switch in 2025.</em></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98peter-is-not-gone%E2%80%99-in-spider-man-3-lowenthal-reveals.1116834/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/yuri-lowenthal-spider-man-3-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>At a recent benefit held to fundraise for those impacted by the LA wildfires, Yuri Lowenthal caught up with one publication about Spider-Man 3. The benefit – MultiCon – was held on February 22 and featured guests such as Rob Liefeld, Kevin Smith, and Seth Green, and Lowenthal, who has played Peter Parker since 2018’s Spider-Man, was also in attendance.</p>



<p>He couldn’t say much, but what he confirmed was that Peter Parker is not gone in Spider-Man 3 and will still play a pivotal part in the campaign, despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 might suggest.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-og-remains">The OG Remains</h2>



<p>In a report published by <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, it was confirmed by Yuri Lowenthal himself that Peter Parker is not ‘relegated to the couch’ in Spider-Man 3, which will be developed by Insomniac Games:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are very few things that I can say about this game, but you have somehow landed on the one thing that I can answer, and that’s that, yes, Peter is not gone. He will be a part of the next game and he won’t be relegated to the couch, I promise.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The running theory is that Spider-Man 3 will have <strong>three </strong>protagonists, much like 2013’s Grand Theft Auto 5. It’s envisioned that players will be able to utilise the live switching mechanic introduced in Spider-Man 2 to flick between these heroes at the press of a button and that the third playable character will be Cindy Moon, otherwise known as Silk.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2’s fluidity between protagonists allowed players to soak up a dual perspective, with each protagonist – Peter Parker and Miles Morales – boasting unique abilities and aesthetics.</p>



<p>One protagonist is the norm, two is rarer but not unheard of, and three protagonists is downright nuts for some gamers to comprehend, but in an expansive open-world hero title like Spider-Man, it just might work. The third game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spider-man-2-creative-director-teases-a-third-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">been teased since 2023</a>, so it could be revealed soon. Could three be the magic number?</p>



<p>Do you want to see Silk become a playable character in Spider-Man 3? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-plummets-map-win/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Call of Duty League’s second Minor tournament is approaching, but it seems not every team is prepared for it. It has been a month since OpTic Texas won a single map in competitive play, scoring 1 – 3 in a loss against the Carolina Royal Ravens at Major I in Madrid.</p>



<p>This poor losing streak, which now sits at zero maps won to nine lost, comes after Pred rejoined the roster, which many fans are now starting to judge as an erroneous action. Up next, OpTic Texas will face the Vegas Falcons at Major II, and that has the Green Wall <strong>concerned</strong>.</p>



<p>Will the Vegas Falcons’ first win come over OpTic Texas, the reigning Call of Duty League Championship winner?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-mighty-have-fallen">The Mighty Have Fallen</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas went into Major I as the favourite to win, but the team got passed from pillar to post, being pushed into the lower bracket by the Heretics and then being ejected entirely by the Carolina Royal Ravens. It was Atlanta FaZe that ultimately lifted the trophy in Madrid.</p>



<p>Nobody could have predicted what would happen thereafter.</p>



<p>OpTic Texas has failed to win a map in three fixtures, a fact that is having a visible impact on the squad. Following a loss against Atlanta FaZe on February 15, OpTic’s Dashy seized his camera and tried snapping it. In terms of map records, OpTic Texas isn’t alone at the bottom of the table.</p>



<p>The Vegas Falcons are yet to win a single match, and so far this stage, the team has secured a map record of 2 – 12. Similarly, LAG M8 has produced a map record of just 3 – 9 with zero game wins.</p>



<p>In a dire spot, the Vegas Falcons have found themselves the laughingstock of the Call of Duty League. They’ve never won more than a single map in any series, and they haven’t come close to producing a single CDL point in the pro standings.</p>



<p>This past week of competitive play was a boon for some teams, though. The LA Thieves produced a 3 – 0 record, beating Carolina, Vegas, and Ultra without too many issues. In stark contrast to OpTic Texas, LAT secured that win record while dropping just <strong>one map</strong>.</p>



<p>Surge has also won every fixture so far in the run-up to the Major II tournament in Texas. It was just a couple of weeks back that Surge announced the signing of Neptune, an appropriately-named player who stepped up to replace Hicksy. He has proven to be a star player already, with the team walking all over Cloud9, LAG M8, and even Atlanta FaZe, the Minor I and Major I champions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/verdansk-will-return-to-warzone-as-%E2%80%98pretty-much-the-og-march-2020-version%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1116828/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-to-warzone-og-march-2020-version/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been claimed on social media by a prominent Call of Duty leaker that Verdansk will return to Warzone with Season 03 of Black Ops 6. It was also mentioned that it’ll be ‘pretty much the OG March 2020 version’, which is insane news for Warzone fans the world over.</p>



<p>It has been more than four years since we lost that version of Verdansk, with an alternate rendition taking over the game for Black Ops Cold War before it was replaced entirely by Caldera in December 2021.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-verdansk-details">New Verdansk Details</h2>



<p>On X, ‘TheGhostofHope’ <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted a series of details</a> that gel with what we already know about the return of Verdansk.</p>



<p>It was claimed:</p>



<ul>
<li>Will launch with Season 3 of BO6</li>



<li>It is pretty much the OG March 2020 version</li>



<li>Train Station interior will be closed</li>



<li>Interior of Stadium will be open BUT roof will be closed</li>



<li>The Train returns</li>



<li>No fast travel subway system</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s back to basics with Verdansk, but that’s what fans have been asking for since the map disappeared in 2021. No other map – aside from the smaller maps like Rebirth Island and Fortune’s Keep – has come close to Verdansk over the last few years.</p>



<p>Warzone <strong>started </strong>with this map in March 2020, when Call of Duty: Warzone was released at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It became an overnight sensation, pulling in tens of millions of users with the utmost ease.</p>



<p>We published a report in January outlining the return of Verdansk in Season 03 of Black Ops 6, and TheGhostofHope’s claim puts us one step closer. In August 2024, Activision took to the stage at COD NEXT to announce the impending return of Verdansk, but few details were shared.</p>



<p>Are you excited for the imminent return of Verdansk in Warzone? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The character's attacks look a bit like those belonging to Baraka and Kabal. At one point we see the T-1000 turn into a liquid metal blob before rising from the ground in an uppercut reminiscent of attacks by Killer Instinct’s Glacius.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1's T-1000 features the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick, who famously played the character in the 1991 film. This teaser reveals Patrick’s voice work for the first time in a clash with Johnny Cage. It ends with a longer look at one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which recreates the iconic chase scene in Terminator 2 where the T-1000 drives a truck in pursuit of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator and Edward Furlong’s John Connor. In the Fatality, the T-1000 blobs out of the driver’s seat to pump the hapless Cage full of lead.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, NetherRealm made the surprise announcement that Madam Bo is set to hit Mortal Kombat 1 as a DLC Kameo fighter at the same time as the T-1000. Madam Bo is a fan-favorite character from the base Mortal Kombat 1 story, an elderly restaurant owner who fends off Smoke and his goons before Raiden and Kung Lao get stuck in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We see Madam Bo gameplay briefly in the teaser, first in a glimpse and you'll miss it frame as the T-1000 and Johnny Clash pre-game, then when the T-1000 calls in Madam Bo for an assist.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The T-1000 is available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting March 18 as part of the early access period for Khaos Reigns<em><strong> </strong></em>owners, followed by wide availability for purchase on March 25. Madam Bo is available on March 18 as a free content update for Khaos Reigns<em><strong> </strong></em>owners or as a standalone purchase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 is the final DLC character set to be added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/23/screenshot-2025-02-23-222435-1740349491604.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Madam Bo is coming to Mortal Kombat 1 as a Kameo fighter.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, Mortal Kombat development chief Ed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>The Mecha BREAK Open Beta launched earlier today and has already seen over 300,000 concurrent players try the game.</p>



<p>Mecha BREAK see’s players take control of giant mechs in a third-personal multiplayer shooter. The game features three unique game modes filled with high-octane ground and aerial combat.</p>



<p>Announced on February 21, the game will have its first major invitational in China in March, where teams will battle it out for a grand prize.</p>

<iframe title="Mecha BREAK - Global Storm Open Beta Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTxywr8j504?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">play the open beta on steam for free here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming’s Scott Robertson recently got hands-on with the game at a behind-the-scenes event, where he sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO, Kris Kwok, so keep your eyes peeled on the website for that interview later this week.</p>



<p>“In the aftermath of the Catastrophe, a mysterious carbon-silicon mineral known as Corite has breathed new life into Earth’s depleted energy industry. But its gift came with a curse — its pathogenic nature and uncontrollable spread are slowly devouring the last habitable spaces on the planet. Within 30 years, the heavily polluted Marcens Zones threaten to engulf the entire globe, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction,” the game description reads.</p>



<p>It continues, “Amid the chaos of this catastrophic event, you find yourself thrust into the role of an unlikely hero — a pilot of the third-generation BREAK Striker. Now, you must navigate an uncertain path, one fraught with peril and discovery. But you are not alone. A secretive organization known as S.H.A.D.O.W. has extended an offer, one that could change the fate of both you and the world.”</p>



<p>“Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support… Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter.”</p>

            <p>Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has hit out at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, saying he "should've never been banned in the first place" despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitting to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June 2024.</p>
<p>Responding to news Twitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-reckons-cheating-while-livestreaming-is-a-low-severity-violation">has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating guidelines will now be subjected to varying limited-time bans</a>, Beahm issued a comment from his personal account X/Twitter, saying Twitch "should've never allowed a low-level employee to override the entire ban system".</p>

<p>"Although things have been 'settled', Twitch should do the right thing and correct their mistake of permanently banning the Doc by reinstating the channel," he wrote. "We should've never been banned in the first place.</p>
<p>"Twitch should've never allowed a low level employee to override the entire ban system, which had already determined we didn't do anything wrong, because of biased opinions of the Doc character.</p>
<p>"They could've reached out and had a quick five-minute call and realise these mutual jokes and bantering never had serious intentions. Pathetic."</p>
<p>Beahm <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">admitted to conduct</a> that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate" with a minor back in June, after Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, claimed an unnamed person had been banned from the streaming platform "because [he] got caught sexting a minor". Those allegations were later directly linked to Beahm.</p>
<p>After a period away from the spotlight, an agitated Beahm returned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkaSTVagsgo">combative YouTube stream</a> in September in which he repeatedly accused Conners and "so-called journalists" of a "planned and coordinated attack". All this, Beahm admitted, came ahead of a 25th September "opportunity" to reapply for partnership on YouTube and re-monetise his channel, which was eventually approved.</p>
<p>Since that admission, Robert Bowling - who co-founded developer Midnight Society with Beahm - <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1805671144412049732">distanced himself</a> from the streamer, and many long-running partners <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dr-disrespects-sponsors-and-partners-are-responding-to-twitch-ban-allegations-updated">terminated their agreements</a>. By the end of January, four months after making "significant" layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-studio-midnight-society-announces-closure-four-months-after-significant-layoffs">Midnight Society announced it was permanently shutting its doors</a>.</p>
<p>Beahm has yet to publicly share the "mutual jokes and bantering" messages he sent to the minor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Brace yourself, Assassin's Creed fans - it looks like early copies of the upcoming instalment, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, have broken the street date.</p>
<p>Unsubstantiated reports are beginning to circulate that not only have some fans been able to download the full game early from the PlayStation Store, physical copies have been prematurely sold, too.</p>
<p><strong>There may be light spoilers after this point</strong>, so only proceed if you're happy to be spoiled!</p>

</div><figcaption>Assassin's Creed Shadows - is it good?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPR9oEqn3lQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps most notably, Assassin's Creed YouTuber The Hidden One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cm-56xcxUo">recently revealed</a> that he knows someone playing the full game on PS5 "because the PlayStation Store made a mistake".</p>
<p>Admitting that he could neither prove it or compel anyone to believe him, The Hidden One then revealed that in the leaked footage, he saw that Animus anomalies are back - something not previously confirmed for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>"In the video [the friend with early access] showed me, the player encounters something Animus in the world," he said.</p>
<p>"A pop up appeared that read: 'Animus systems breached. Stabilise anomalies and gain data fragments to advance your active strand'."</p>
<p>The player was then prompted to "press touchpad to open the Animus menu".</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iwea6y/assassins_creed_shadows_physical_copies_being/">Assassin's Creed Shadows physical copies being sold before launch</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Ajxtt/">u/Ajxtt</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Over on the Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit it goes even further, with reports that <a href="https://ibb.co/PvQX2f2g">physical copies have similarly been sold early</a>.</p>
<p>While, as yet, there doesn't seem to be early footage popping up on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> or YouTube, now may be a good time to mute key words on your favourite social media apps, just in case...</p>
<p>Last week, Ubisoft signalled its expectations for Assassin's Creed Shadows in its latest quarterly financial results, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">in which it describes pre-orders for the game as "solid"</a>.</p>
<p>While the company did not divulge exact pre-order numbers, it said they were "in line with those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, the second most succesful entry of the franchise".</p>
<p>Our Katharine said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">Assassin's Creed Shadows was "the biggest shake-up of the series in years"</a> during our recent hands-on time with the game, and praised its dual protagonist gameplay. "If Ubisoft can stick the landing on this one, it will be worth the extended wait," she wrote.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/acezone-a-spire-wireless-for-the-most-demanding/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

						<h5>AceZone A-Spire Wireless</h5><p><span>May 3rd, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p>AceZone may not be among the most popular gaming headset brands, but it has been making a name for itself for some time by producing headsets for eSports tournaments, focusing on features tailored for this specific use case. In the past few years, however, the company entered the domestic headset market with some headsets, including the A-Spire and the A-Rise headsets, which brought some of these features, such as excellent noise canceling with Active Noise Control built for gaming, fast in-game response and more. The A-Spire model was later updated with some additional features, becoming the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which is among the best headsets for eSports aficionados who want to step up their performance while also providing enough to to be enticing for those looking for a versatile headset that delivers great audio quality for single-player games and music playback.</p>
<p>At a glance, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless, which comes with a hard carry case, looks almost like a non-gaming headset, featuring a rather simple color scheme, black with some metallic grey highlights, with no other standout element. On the back of the left earpad are the power button and the Active Noise Cancelation button, while on the right are the volume control and pause/play buttons. On the side of the left earpad is also the microphone, which, sadly, cannot be removed from the headset (but this was to be expected for a headset tailored for eSports and competitive play). Disabling the microphone, however, is extremely simple, as it only has to be brought to a vertical position where it can easily held in place and secured.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/04_cleanup.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless design may be unremarkable, the headset shows its qualities right from the very first use. The excellent build quality, and its light weight, which makes the headset very comfortable to use even after 3+ hours in conjunction with the high-quality earpad foam, are only the beginning. Noise cancelling, as mentioned above, has always been one of the main focuses of AceZone for its headsets, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless definitely delivers on this front. The Advanced Hybrid ANC built for gaming does an excellent job providing complete immersion, and during the vast majority of my gaming sessions with the headsets, I wasn't able to hear anything outside of the game's audio, as every loud noise was effectively canceled. To test how far the headset's noise canceling could go, I tested it out in a definitely not intended use case while playing acoustic drums, and the AceZone A-Spire Wireless still did an excellent job, as I could clearly hear the click and backing tracks clearly while playing some heavy music.</p>
<p>Pressing the dedicated ANC button on the left earpad also enables Transparency Mode, which amplifies ambient sound, allowing it to pass through the headset and let the user hear the outside world clearly without removing the headset.&nbsp; The AceZone A-Spire Wireless microphone noise canceling is possibly even more impressive, as the microphone works great and effectively only picks up the user's voice while filtering out even some pretty loud noises, although it has to be positioned slightly closer to the mouth than the vast majority of other headsets on the market to work properly, which may take some time to get used to.</p>
<p>The biggest update the AceZone A-Spire Wireless offers over the base model, not is its proper wireless capabilities. Included in the box is a USB dongle that is effectively plug-and-play, as the user does not have to do anything other than keep a button pressed on the dongle to pair the headset with it. Latency with the dongle is pretty much non-existent, although the 2.4 GHz connection could suffer from interference, which I didn't experience as all the devices I use with my PC are wired. The AceZone A-Spire Wireless can also be connected via a regular headphone jack, such as the one included with the headset, and via a regular Bluetooth connection, which works well, but not as well as with the dongle. Pairing and using the headset with a PlayStation 5 and an Android mobile phone was just as painless, and the Bluetooth connection worked great in both instances with no latency, although your experience may vary depending on interference from other devices.</p>
<p>All this wouldn't matter much if the AceZone A-Spire Wireless delivered poor audio quality, but that is most definitely not the case here. The contrary, actually, as the headset delivers great audio quality in the vast majority of scenarios, and some of the best audio quality in eSports games, where the headset, unsurprisingly, truly shines. The game's sound design really has to accommodate its unique features. In a game like Counter-Strike 2, for example, it is possible to clearly hear sounds like footsteps from further away than with other headsets and place them very accurately. In other competitive-focused games, however, the AceZone A-Spire Wireless may not help players level up their game a lot, as loud music or sound unrelated to the gameplay end up drowning sounds that could help the player understand where the opponents are and so on.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/02_cleanup.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While the AceZone A-Spire Wireless has been designed mostly for eSports, I have found the headset to be quite versatile, making it a worthwhile purchase even for those who aren't into competitive play. In games I have played for hundreds of hours and know extremely well, like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Tales of Graces f, I was able to hear sounds I never noticed, such as environmental sounds that usually get lost in lower-quality headsets and audio systems, which, in conjunction with the excellent noise canceling, increased immersion considerably. In a game designed to be as immersive as possible, like Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, the headset fared even better, allowing me to listen to all sorts of environmental sounds so clearly that I really felt like I was Henry from Skalitz, traveling in medieval Bohemia. Something similar happened when listening to music, as, for example, I was able to hear clearly drummers keeping time with the hi-hat pedal, which is usually a very soft sound that doesn't emerge in most mixes, especially in heavy music like Progressive and Extreme Metal.</p>
<p>The AceZone A-Spire Wireless tries to do something different even in regards to changing settings. All of the company's headsets are compatible with a free smart device app that allows the user to set up different equalization presets for both the headphones and the microphone, tweak Transparency, enable Outside Mode, which lowers wind noise when the headset is used outdoors, and Glasses Mode, which optimizes ANC damping performance when wearing them. The best thing about the app is that it saves settings straight into the headset so that even console players can tweak them with ease.</p>
<p>All the advanced features of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless are extremely good to have, but the real question for most will be if the headset is worth its somewhat high price. That strictly depends on the user. For eSport titles with the proper sound design, the headset truly shines, giving players the same tools the best players in the world use in tournaments, giving them the chance to improve their performance. For regular use with single-player gaming and for music playback, on the other hand, the value of the AceZone A-Spire Wireless' unique features is somewhat diminished, and a more affordable headset may be more enticing. Still, if one is not afraid to spend a little more than usual, they will find a great headset that may give them a greater appreciation of the sound design of their favorite games, regardless of the genre.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> has updated its enforcement rules so that streamers caught violating its guidelines will be subjected to varying limited-time bans, with even indefinitely suspendees able to reapply for their accounts to be reinstatement after six months.</p>
<p>This means even streamers with multiple infringements merely have to wait for the violations to "drop off [their] account". Providing you don't reoffend in a set period, your account will be reset to "good standing", as though the original violation never happened.</p>

<p>Higher-severity violations - such as ones for hateful conduct - could remain on an account longer, such as a couple of years. But players caught cheating in games whilst streaming via Twitch are now deem "low severity" will only face a 24-hour suspension from the service.</p>
<p>"Starting today, most violations will expire and drop off of your account after a set amount of time," Twitch <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US">explained</a>. "You will be able to track when they expire in the Appeals Portal, and this information will also be in the enforcement emails that you receive.</p>
<p>"Most violations committed tend to be low severity (such as cheating in online games) and will expire in 90 days. However, higher-severity violations (such as hateful conduct) will remain on an account longer, and will expire in 1 or 2 years.</p>
<p>"The most severe harms will still result in immediate indefinite suspensions. If you are indefinitely suspended due to accumulating multiple violations within a short time period, you are able to apply for reinstatement after 6 months."</p>
<p>Twitch believes "escalating consequences" will "hold users accountable for repeated harmful behaviour", defining harm as "including actions that lead to physical, emotional, social, or financial damage to a community member, to Twitch, or to society".</p>
<p>If your account was previously indefinitely suspended it will remain so despite these changes, Twitch stressed, although in those instances, users can apply for reinstatement (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p>
<p>In November, just ahead of the US elections, Twitch tightened its rules around broadcasts that include debates about "political" and "sensitive social issues". However, after a vocal backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streams-about-political-and-sensitive-issues-including-reproductive-and-lgbtq-rights-now-require-a-label">Twitch clarified that labels would not apply if a streamer is discussing their "lived experience"</a>, or if discussion of these topics isn't the "focus" of the stream.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/617730/hades-2-getting-better-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Hades II</em> just received its second major update as part of its early access development, which was a great excuse for me to jump back in. Since its initial release, I’ve logged more than 30 hours and actually held myself back from playing much more – I don’t want to get tired of the game before it hits 1.0 – but with the new update, I wanted to see what’s new and try to beat the new final boss on my very first run.</p><p>Sadly, I haven’t even been able to see what the boss is yet. I <em>did</em> make it to the update’s new region, but I got destroyed by a dangerous miniboss. Still, I’ve still been really impressed with what Supergiant Games has added since May to make what’s already a very good game even better.</p><p>The big additions are impressive. <em>Hades II</em> initially launched with six regions — four for an Underworld route and two for a “surface” route — and with each major update, Supergiant has added a new region with new enemies, characters, and music to round out that surface route.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271897/hades-ii-2-major-update-olympic">first major update</a>, which came out in October, added the game’s first new region, Mount Olympus, and it feels as epic as Mount Olympus should. It has grand architecture, fearsome enemies, and a fiery boss fight against Prometheus, all backed by an incredible orchestral soundtrack. (I’ve spent more time than I’d like to admit listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjiYUgx74rU">this song on loop</a>.)</p><p>That update also added the game’s sixth and final weapon – a witch-y, <em>Hades</em>-style interpretation of a mech suit. Seriously: your primary attack is punching baddies with giant fists while your special attack shoots projectiles that home in on nearby targets. You also have cool wings.</p><p>In the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/615857/hades-ii-2-warsong-update">second major update</a>, there’s a new region and boss, too, but I’ve also noticed a lot of smaller details that feel just as impactful. For example, the Altar of Ashes, a place where you pick from various passive effects in the form of arcana cards that can help your runs, got a visual redesign to add intricately-illustrated custom cards. (One of them features Theseus and the Minotaur, who you may remember as bosses from the first <em>Hades</em>, in thongs, lol.) I also spotted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HadesTheGame/comments/1itjeu2/this_new_mel_portrait_is_so_adorable/">charming new portrait for Melinoë</a>, the game’s protagonist, that added some levity to a character that’s usually pretty serious.</p><p>And throughout the major updates and many smaller patches, Supergiant has rebalanced and changed all sorts of mechanics and details in ways that I can honestly barely begin to keep track of. The studio isn’t afraid to take the hatchet to things that need to go, too; with this most recent patch, Supergiant scrapped an entire mechanic tied to gathering.</p><p>Overall, the changes have made the game feel better to play over time – and browsing patch notes, Supergiant uses an emoji to indicate which changes are inspired by community feedback, which I think is a good way to acknowledge how players are contributing to the game, which is one of the main benefits of this type of early access release. (I should also acknowledge that <em>Hades II</em> has the advantage of building from the already-great foundation of the first <em>Hades.</em>)</p><p><em>Hades II</em> might not launch in 1.0 for a long time. Supergiant hasn’t committed to a timeframe for that, and it’s still working on a third major update that’s set to release “some months from now.” Because of the success of Supergiant’s other games, like <em>Bastion</em> and <em>Transistor</em>, the studio probably doesn’t need to rush.</p><p>But given how it’s treated <em>Hades II’s</em> early access so far, I’m fine if Supergiant takes its time. Even though <em>Hades II</em> isn’t finished, I have no qualms about recommending the game to anyone that’s interested. And jumping in now lets you experience just how much an already-great game can improve over time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The pace of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> US sales has "fallen behind" that of the PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That's according to games industry analyst Mat Piscatella, who used Circana data to conclude that whilst the PS5 Pro enjoyed a solid start, January 2025's hardware spend in the US was 45 percent lower when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>In fact, Piscatella posits that there was "double-digit percentage declines" across all major console platforms compared to a year ago, with PS5 hardware spend dipping by 38 percent year-on-year, Xbox Series declining by 50 percent, and Switch 53 percent.</p>
<p>The latter, however, may be as a result of players holding off for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, as part of its financial report to investors, Sony confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-now-sold-75m-ps5-consoles-and-has-record-monthly-users">sales of its PS5 console have reached 75m units</a>, which is just shy of PS4 sales after an equivalent period.</p>

<p>However, Sony deviated from the norm and chose not to separate console sales in this report, so we're no longer able to disaggregate PS5 Pro sales from the base console. This makes it difficult to ascertain if the PS5 Pro's eye-watering cost of admission has put off players who would typically update their hardware mid-generation.</p>
<p>That said, PlayStation 5 was once again the best-selling hardware platform of the month in terms of both units sold and dollars generated. Xbox Series was second in hardware spending, although the Nintendo Switch edged out Xbox Series in terms of units sold.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no comparative sales data for PS5 in the UK or Europe.</p>
<p>Back in November, Sony said that despite the "different comments" on the PS5 Pro's chunky price point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-pro-price-has-not-had-a-negative-impact-on-sales-says-sony-boss">the "pricing [...] has not had a negative impact" on PS5 Pro sales</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
