		<p>King of Meat is getting a closed alpha test in December, Glowmade and Amazon’s chaotic four player gameshow dungeon ’em up opening the castle gates to invited played on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> for a limited period of time – <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/news/articles/king-of-meat-lights-camera-alpha">you can sign up here</a> for a chance to take part.</p>
<p>But what is King of Meat? Well, here’s where a handy new series of videos comes in, explaining the over-the-top medieval world, the co-op hack ‘n’ slash action, and how user generated content comes into the mix as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="What is King of Meat Episode 1: Co-Op Mayhem" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbFIZ1jlMB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Taking place in the world of Loregok, King of Meat tasks players with completing quick dungeon courses filled with dungeons, trolls, skeletons and traps. But this isn’t actually back in the heyday of fantasy, because there’s all of the glitz and glamour of gameshow stardom, the hyper-capitalism of the modern world smashed into the fantasy setting.</p>
<p>You’ll have to work together with your team to overcome each room of enemies and traps, but at the same time, you’ll want to be the first among equals. On the other hand, you might want to instead be the best level creator out there, earning plaudits for your devilish creations as teams take them on.</p>

<p>You can really see Glowmade’s heritage shining through here, with the studio based in Guildford and featuring developers who previously worked on LittleBigPlanet at Media Molecule and Fable at Lionhead.</p>
<p>For the time being, Glowmade is keeping King of Meat testing private. This is a closed alpha test that is invite-only and will require you to agree to an NDA. Invites will be sent out on 3rd December, before the test gets underway on 4th December for a limited time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This afternoon, CD Projekt RED VP and Game Director Sebastian Kalemba <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571?t=qKSrHnijalfbeBpYM8C1lw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> via Twitter (X) that The Witcher 4 is officially in full scale production after recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-pre-production-is-almost-over-says-cd-projekt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending</a> the pre-production phase. He also shared his confidence that the new saga could be a remarkable experience for fans.</p>
<p><em>I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase! With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin!⚔️</em></p>
<p>Kalemba shared a picture with the tweet. This could be our very first look at The Witcher 4.</p>

<p>We first heard of the new game over two and a half years ago when CD Projekt RED also <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>they were abandoning their own REDEngine in favor of Epic's Unreal Engine 5 technology. At the time, they called it a true partnership where they would also contribute back to the game-making tool. CTO Paweł Zawodny said:</p>
<p><em>From the outset, we did not consider a typical licensing arrangement; both we and Epic see this as a long-term, fulfilling tech partnership. It is vital for CD Projekt Red to have the technical direction of our next game decided from the earliest possible phase as; in the past, we spent a lot of resources and energy to evolve and adapt REDengine with every subsequent game release. This cooperation is so exciting, because it will elevate development predictability and efficiency, while simultaneously granting us access to cutting-edge game development tools. I can’t wait for the great games we’re going to create using Unreal Engine 5!</em></p>
<p>The switch could speed up the development of future games, but that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-unreal-engine-5-not-speeding-development-cdpr-hopes-helps-in-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won't apply</a> to The Witcher 4, since the team is still familiarizing itself with the new tool. When he <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-aims-to-go-beyond-current-rpgs-says-cdpr-itll-be-a-good-entry-point-for-new-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spoke</a> about the new installment last year, Sebastian Kalemba teased that the studio aims to surpass current RPGs with new <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-wont-just-retread-the-last-game-adding-new-features-and-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">features and mechanics</a> that break boundaries. Moreover, the new The Witcher game will be a great entry point for newcomers.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-polaris-first-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> the first actor who will work on the game. That info also revealed how voice-over and motion capture will begin in 2025. It's hard to say exactly when The Witcher 4 could launch, but it will be at least a couple more years if not more. Until then, you can beautify The Witcher 3 NextGen Edition with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-hd-reworked-project-nextgen-edition-is-finally-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HalkHogan's definitive texture mod</a>.</p>

The closure was announced i<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">n a post on the company’s LinkedIn page</a>. “Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations,” the post read.</p><p>Humanoid Origin was founded by Hudson in 2021 when it was then known as Humanoid Studios. Hudson started the studio after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151192/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-leaving-dragon-age-mass-effect">leaving a 20-year career at BioWare</a> where he worked as a producer and director on several of the studio’s seminal titles including <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em>. Hudson left BioWare in 2014 for a brief stint at Microsoft Studios before returning to BioWare in 2017. Then in 2020, he left BioWare for good saying it was time to, “make way for the next generation of studio leaders.”</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Key Art from Humanoid Origin’s unreleased game</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Humanoid Origin</cite></p></div></div><p>In 2022, Humanoid Studios <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/3/22/22991023/mass-effect-casey-hudson-humanoid-new-sci-fi-game">announced its first project</a>, “a multi-platform AAA title focused on character-driven narrative in an&nbsp;all-new science fiction universe.” Beyond concept art on the studio’s website, little was known about the game.

With a unique premise, including possession and body horror, along with a vibrant city full of glowing neon lights illuminating the ever-present darkness, the third-person action-oriented horror game stood a great chance at making waves. Despite the studio’s reputation and history, they remained an indie outfit, which likely explains the game’s somewhat soft, understated reception. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Slitterhead</em> achieved some respectable numbers on launch and garnered “Very Positive” reviews on Steam. Like any new game release, there were plenty of negative reviews from users who found the overall experience bland, low-budget, or outright janky due to its controls and combat mechanics. From firsthand experience, combat was somewhat awkward initially, but it’s rather easy to pick up the core components, making it an overall breeze to defeat the creatures known as Slitterheads.</p><p>On the positive review side of things, most players love the unique combat mechanics and world design, along with the creatures themselves. They point toward the engaging gameplay, a distinct experience breaking from the norm, and a nostalgia trip back to the days of PlayStation 2-era gaming. Many of these reviews seem overzealous in their search for nostalgic gaming experiences, but if <em>Slitterhead </em>speaks to them in such a way, there’s nothing wrong with letting others enjoy the game to such great heights!</p><p>But on the negative review side, many players found the gameplay dated and dull, calling it a remaster of old titles. Others wanted a pure survival horror game, and the reliance on combat really pushed them out of the experience.</p><p><em>Slitterhead </em>is undoubtedly a unique experience that, years down the line, many might come to consider a hidden gem, thanks in no small part to a cult following. It’s that type of game. But if you’re on the fence now and are looking for some unique perspectives, here’s <em>Slitterhead</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="5b4e4a413bbcda2ce885b509ff206d7d"

<p>CD Project Red has confirmed that that The Witcher 4, currently known as Project Polaris, has officially entered full production.</p>



<p>The announcement came as part of the studio’s <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q3 2024 earnings report</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>“I’m pleased to announce that several weeks ago it moved on to full-scale production,” Piotr Nielubowicz, CD Projekt Red chief financial officer, said during the earnings call.</p>



<p>“Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we’re starting the most intensive phase of development. I wish to thank the team and I’m keeping my fingers crossed for further progress.”</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba added, “With new challenges just around the corner, it’s the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what’s on the other side of the coin.”</p>



<p>As of October 31, 2024, the studio has 400 people working exclusively on The Witcher 4. It’s slightly down from the 410 reported in July as the studio moved those employees to other projects within the company. Still, the number represents just over 61% of the company working on the next game of the franchise.</p>



<p>First announced in October 2022, a release date for The Witcher 4 has not yet been announced. Polaris is being called the beginning of a new Witcher saga that will span another new Trilogy for the series. For fans of the first trilogy, the new game will still see a continuation of&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-4-geralts-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geralt of Rivia’s story</a> in some form.</p>

                <p>Project Polaris, the codename for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">next Witcher game</a>, has crossed a major milestone: It's now officially in full production. CD Projekt made the announcement today, November 26, as part of the company's wider earnings briefing.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba said the game--unofficially know as The Witcher 4--has "entered the full-scale production phase," following a period of pre-production. "With new challenges just around the corner, it's the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!," he said.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm thrilled to announce that Project Polaris has entered the full-scale production phase!

This is actually down from 410 people as of July 31, 2024, before the game entered full production.</p><p>CD Projekt has a number of other games in the works, too, including Orion (the next Cyberpunk game), which has 64 people working on it now. Then there's Sirius (a Witcher spin-off) that has 32 people working on it. A total of 15 people are working on Hadar (a new IP), while other staff are contributing to "shared services" and other projects. You can see a headcount breakdown in the graphic below.</p><p>Not much is known about The Witcher 4, or whatever the game might be called. Management previously indicated, back in 2022, that The Witcher 4 would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/" data-ref-id="1100-6508062">released in 2025 at the very soonest</a>, but this plan could have changed since then.</p><p>As for the story, we know Geralt will be in the game, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">he won't be the focus of the narrative.</a> Joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski previously said The Witcher 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">not going to be "The Witcher 3 in new clothing."</a> It aims to break new ground and stand apart from the games that came before it.</p><p>Also during the earnings report, CD Projekt announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now sold 30 million copies, with its Phantom Liberty expansion shifting 8 million copies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-2077-sales-witcher-production<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CD Projekt has revealed that open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has hit another major sales milestone, and there's some good news if you're waiting on tenterhooks for the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game as well.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1861447302260363516" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a</a><a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&nbsp;new financial presentation</a>, CD Projekt reveals that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 30 million as of today, with that number including both sales of the base game and the Ultimate Edition bundle.</p>

<p>What's more,&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty</em>, the DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>that launched last year, has managed to sell eight million copies, which is around the same number as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-remake-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">lifetime sales of the&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>remake</a>. That's pretty impressive considering&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>isn't a full game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=-ila7YeQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-sales-phantom-liberty.jpg?itok=kn5dC9H3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion has done pretty well for itself sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>In that same presentation, CD Projekt revealed that&nbsp;<em>Project Polaris</em>, which is the codename for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-witcher-game-in-development-cdpr-says" rel="nofollow">next major game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, has entered full production.</p>

<p>Essentially, this means that the next&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game has left its planning stages and that staff are now working on creating the game in earnest, bringing it one step closer to completion. Of course, we're still a long, long way away from that point.</p>

<p>It's worth noting, too, that&nbsp;<em>Polaris&nbsp;</em>is an entirely new game in the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series, and as such, it's distinct from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-remake-announced-by-cd-projekt-red" rel="nofollow"><em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>remake that was announced by CD Projekt Red</a> back in 2022.</p>

<p>According to the financial presentation, as of October 31st, 400 staff members were working on&nbsp;<em>Polaris</em>, with 64 devoted to&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">sequel&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-orion-new-hires" rel="nofollow">Orion</a>&nbsp;</em>and 42 working on&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Sirius</em>.</p>

Revenue is significantly down, as is gross profit, but the company still hasn't posted a loss despite releasing no major projects this year.</p>

<p>When it comes to year-to-date financials, CD Projekt's sales are slightly down over the same period last year, although sales of the&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>series remain steady, and the company's net profitability has actually slightly increased.</p>

            <p>If you're playing a "PS1-style" game these days, odds are it's a horror game. Sometimes, I worry that the association of PS1 with moody, Silent Hillian dankness has gotten to the point that younger players no longer perceive the original PS1 as a video game console at all. Going by Itch.io's Halloween output, the PS1 was just a rusty bucket of rot and gore in which the faithful might periodically hallucinate the face of Spyro the Dragon.</p>
<p>Here to remind us that the PS1 was capable of colours beside "existential grey" is <a href="https://hatimb00.itch.io/blue-exploration">Water Level/b.l.u.e. EXPLORATION</a>, from New York City-based game designer <a href="https://hatimbenhsain.github.io/">Hatim Benhsain</a>. It's a free downloadable experiment inspired by b.l.u.e.: Legend of Water, a Japan-only PS1 adventure in which you are a girl swimming through alien ruins with her dolphin.</p><!--more-->
<p>In Benhsain's rework, b.l.u.e. has become a game about games swimming through each other. Levels from the original Legend Of Water appear within it via emulator, but they're molten and deferred and spliced with other media to the point that you can't really call this emulation (let alone piracy). The older PS1 game occupies a screen within the screen that zooms and blurs, tilts and dissolves and reappears as you no-clip through a larger, enclosing world of azure and stone, awash with "borrowed" chunks from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Super Mario 64 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>. The soundtrack, meanwhile, slops together waterlogged excerpts from American Idol performances and Madonna, as GameFAQ text unfolds across the top of the screen. </p>
<p>The controls are straightforwardly adapted from Legend Of Water - ah, how strange and joyful to play a 3D controller-based game from the pre-Dualshock era - but what they actually do seems to shift in accordance with the game's steady remixing and refocussing of its source materials. It reminds me a little of synthesising the geography in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mu-cartographer">Mu Cartographer</a>.</p><p>The creator's term for all this is a "plunderludic", or "game made of other games". I hadn't come across this concept before, and am curious to understand what distinguishes a plunderludic from, say, an interactive 3D collage. Benhsain includes a link to a <a href="https://plunderludics.github.io/">resource page</a> with some tools and examples of plunderludic games. It makes curious connections with the 19th century playwright Bertolt Brecht and George Maciunas, a member of the mid-20th century Fluxus art movement. I'm looking forward to giving it a proper read at some point.</p>
<p>In the short term, I'll only say that it's a delight to play something that takes such delight in swimming, as both a physical practice and an artistic methodology. It's been a while since I enjoyed swimming in a video game - today's aquatic physics and lighting may seem miraculous by PS1 standards, but I wonder if somewhere along the road from Legend Of Water to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, video games have lost the art of making underwater exploration feel magical. If you have any favourite water levels to share, old or new, sing out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It appears as though future content for Mortal Kombat 1 is ending after Kombat Pack 2 wraps up. According to new claims, developer NetherRealm Studios has cancelled DLC plans for a Kombat Pack 3 and second story expansion for Mortal Kombat 1.</p>



<p>Known Mortal Kombat 1 leaker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mortalkombatleaks/comments/1h0c1lo/comment/lz2xyr9/?share_id=xUcvJ-sw8qJXVkTAM75be&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FateUnknown posted</a> on Reddit that the cancellations happened recently after the Khaos Reigns expansion sold poorly.</p>



<p>It’s not all bad for Mortal Kombat 1 fans as there are still characters from Kombat Pack 2 to join the roster such as Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2. FateUnknown also said that its possible a “kameo or two” make it to the game due to work that had already been done on them but he “didn’t know yet”.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetherRealm Studios for comment on the claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated.</p>



<p>Recently, Warner Bros. showed commitment to the Mortal Kombat series  when CEO David Zaslav said that future game development efforts was going to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focused on its core franchises</a> with Mortal Kombat being listed among them. Series head Ed Boon has already said, as well, that NetherRealm had been working on its next game even before Mortal Kombat 1 was released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>NetEase Games should be celebrating Marvel Rivals’ impending launch, instead, the Chinese company has been left reeling following the dramatic arrest of several key officials in the company due to a money laundering controversy.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals could be the shooter to break the online multiplayer dominance of other shooters: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, Fortnite, Overwatch, and Apex Legends (amongst others.) Other newcomers—such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-was-the-top-game-on-steam-in-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadlock</a>—are doing their best to make an impact, but Marvel Rivals’ superhero star power has the potential to supersede all.</p>



<p>Money laundering, arrests, and an intense investigation and scrutiny were likely not on the Marvel Rivals bingo card though. If you’re confused, it’s understandable—so let’s explain all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-money-laundering-controversy-explained">Marvel Rivals Money Laundering Controversy—Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An explosive situation. Credit to NetEase Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Marvel Rivals money laundering Controversy potentially involves <strong>several high-ranking NetEase officials who have been arrested due to allegations of money laundering amounting to potentially $300 million</strong>.</p>



<p>I appreciate this is a lot to take in, so let’s start from the top. The original story was broken by Chinese outlet <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Leifeng</a>, and on Nov. 7, 2024, the <a href="https://www.leiphone.com/category/industrynews/D1r2qIXu83HaLD5q.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">translated exclusive</a> said this, “Multiple sources said that Xiang Lang, the GM (general manager) of NetEase Games in charge of marketing, was taken away by NetEase’s internal integrity department for investigation, and it is said that the police have intervened, and the specific case is under investigation.”</p>



<p>The story continues and reports the potentially laundered amount equates to <strong>Two Billion Yuan</strong>—or <strong>$275,800,000</strong>, as of writing. It does go on to say the full amount is actually closer to <strong>800 Million to 1 Billion Yuan</strong>—making the final amount in the region of <strong>$111.4 million to $139.3 million</strong>.</p>



<p>Leifeng also says Xiang Lang—the general manager of NetEase—was taken away by NetEase’s internal integrity department for investigation, and it is said the <strong>police have intervened, and the specific case is under investigation</strong>.” The money laundered reportedly affects up to <strong>28 companies</strong>, and the investigation is set to continue.</p>



<p>If you’re worried this affects Marvel Rivals, you can put those doubts to rest. Despite the ongoing controversy, Marvel Rivals is still gearing up for its Dec. 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, and production on the shooter seems to be unaffected. Whatever is going on behind the scenes at NetEase, we can put these alleged business indiscretions to one side, and look forward to a fully fledged superhero title in the Marvel universe.</p>

Niantic is hoping to monetize this data, but even at this early stage, the company realizes that this could be put to use in unintended ways, including during war time.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-data-adding-amplitude-to-war-is-obviously-an-issue-niantic-exec-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic Senior Vice President of Engineering Brian McClendon was asked about a military application of the company's Large Geospatial Model during the Bellingcat’s Bellingfest event.</p><p>"I could definitely see it," said McClendon. "I think the question is would there be anything that they would do with it that would be outside of what a consumer or a Bellingcat want to do with it. If the use case is identical, then that seems completely fine. If the use case is specific in military and adding amplitude to war then that's obviously an issue."</p><p>Take, for example, the ongoing war in Ukraine. If Russia had access to complete 3D models of Ukraine's cities and countryside, it would give the invading country a tactical advantage that it doesn't currently have. For now, Niantic hasn't ruled out selling its LGM data to governments in the future.</p><p>"The LGM is an early stage project and is months or even years away from any kind of product," noted a Niantic spokesperson when asked about the possibility of selling the data. "Just like any kind of AI, there will be important questions that arise and we'll tackle those responsibly and thoughtfully."</p><p>For now, we don't have to worry about Pikachu and the other Pokemon being used to map out current combat zones in the near future. Niantic's early map of the LGM model appears to be largely composed of locations in North America and Europe, while the rest of the world is a long way from being completed.</p><p>One of the franchise's other mobile games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, recently attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-pushes-past-30-million-downloads-tops-app-store-chart/1100-6527660/" data-ref-id="1100-6527660">30 million downloads</a> in its first week alone.

                <p>Activision has responded to concerns about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Ranked playlist, and specifically the efforts being undertaken to try to thwart cheaters. The company says it's banned thousands of players and is banning more people every hour, but some popular streamers have spoken out to voice their ongoing concerns.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1861241515798098184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Activision said the AI-powered systems in Call of Duty's anti-cheat technology, Ricochet, "continue to ramp up with code optimizations" that aim to "accelerate enforcements" against bad actors. Since Ranked play launched last week, Activision has banned more than 19,000 people, and Ricochet is doing "hourly sweeps" to kick more cheaters out.</p><p>Activision has always said the fight against cheaters is an ongoing battle, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">one that may never be solved completely</a>. Popular streamer Nadeshot <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/1861245061368787123" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the statement</a>, saying it's "complete propaganda" from his vantage point.</p><p>"Ten names minimum in the first three pages we're legitimately spin-botting LIVE on our streams. How could there possibly be 19K accounts banned when the most egregious abusers are giving us the middle finger on the leaderboard? Are we crazy? What is going on," he said.</p><p>Another popular streamer, Westie, <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1861345175219425620" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said </a>Activision's Ricochet updates are ineffective and that they "result in absolutely zero change to the gameplay experience." He also said cheating remains a problem in Warzone. "It feels like the anti-cheat has been turned off," he said.</p><p>Another issue that Call of Duty fans have surfaced is that the Ranked mode on console forces players to use cross-play, which puts them into matches with PC players. A mouse-and-keyboard setup is understood to be the most precise way to play a FPS like Call of Duty, and many have voiced concerns about a "level playing field" when people on console, using a controller, are forced to play against people using mouse and keyboard. Then there is the issue of cheating, as it's generally easier to install cheat software on PC compared to console.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-patch-notes-reveal-movement-change-and-warzone-player-count-adjustments/1100-6528043/" data-ref-id="1100-6528043">reduced the player cap for Warzone's new map, Area 99.</a> Activision also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-had-biggest-launch-period-player-total-in-series-history/1100-6528034/" data-ref-id="1100-6528034">Black Ops 6 had the biggest launch in franchise history, thanks in part to Game Pass.</a></p>

If everything is pretty clear with most of the folders (but one way or another, we will analyze everything in the corresponding chapters), then the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scripts</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder is worth a special mention. The root of this folder contains all the scripts that are inherited from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MonoBehaviour</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> class, and which, accordingly, can be added to game objects as components.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Services</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder contains classes for working with localization, metrics, sound and advertising.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Settings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder contains everything you need to successfully save and load game data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Utility</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder contains several constant classes, as well as a number of static utility classes with auxiliary methods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this chapter, we will focus on two main classes of the Scripts folder, namely </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SingletonServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's start with the first and most frequently used. SingletonServices, as the name suggests, works on the principle of the singleton template, accordingly, when initializing project objects, only one such object of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SingletonServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> class will be created. This class provides access to all available auxiliary services of the game that may be needed on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>any</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> scene. I emphasize the word "any", because if, for example, we compare this class with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which use cases are limited to game scenes only, excluding the initialization scene. But we will discuss it a little bit later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SingletonServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> class stores links to services for working with localization, music, advertising and metrics. Here you can also find methods for loading and saving game settings, as well as a method for getting sprites by their name. For example, saving game settings using this class will look like this:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>_singletonServices.SaveSettings();</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">where the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>_singletonServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> variable was previously initialized as follows:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SingletonServices _singletonServices = SingletonServices.Instance;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In order to work appropriately </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SingletonServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> must be added to the game object on the initialization scene (InitScene).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second most important class – </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also a singleton and is used to combine classes and methods for working with game objects. For example, hide the game menu and show the game itself, and vice versa, as well as change the language and others. With a significant expansion of the project, I still recommend separating, for example, work with the game UI to a separate script and using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only as an intermediate class for access to the UI controller. There is not much need for this in our template project. In order to work appropriately </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameServices</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> must be added to the game object on the scene immediately following the initialization one (in our case, this is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>MainScene</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). In addition, since GameServices uses SingletonServices methods inside itself, it must be initialized after the latter. To do this, go to the project settings and set the order of script execution as follows:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Saving game data">Saving game data</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As I mentioned earlier, all scripts for saving game data are located in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scripts/Settings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameSettings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the main object for game data. I have added several fields for saving in it, for example, the selected language and the number of button clicks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The file that is directly involved in loading and saving </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameSettings</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>FileSettingsAdapter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It implements the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ISettingsAdapter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> interface, which contains only two methods: loading and saving.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saving data is probably quite obvious, but it is worth saying a few words about the signature of the loading method. Now it looks like this:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>void LoadSettings(Action&lt;GameSettings&gt; callAfterLoad);</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The method does not return anything, but only accepts a delegate as a parameter, a reference to the method that should be called after the data loading is complete. In the general case (for example, for PC and Android builds), such a design is not necessary. This is done in order to support the web version, which we will talk about separately in one of the upcoming articles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The entire process of loading game settings can be viewed in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SingletonServices.Start </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">method, the saving process can be viewed, for example, in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GameServices.IncreaseCounter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Importing textures, working with sprites and Sprite Atlas">Importing textures, working with sprites and Sprite Atlas</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's now discuss the components of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sprites</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder and start with a small, optional </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TextureImporter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> file. For some unknown reason, Unity decided to change the default behavior of the sprite importer and began to set the Sprite Mode to Multiple by default (previously it was Single), which means that the added image contains more than one sprite, for example, it can be a sprite sheet with character animation. So, if your project has much fewer sprite sheets than regular single sprites, then you can create a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TextureImporter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and set sprite settings for it, which will be applied to all imported textures by default. To do this, in the importer settings, you need to click on the preset selection button and create a new one with the desired import parameters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We change all the necessary parameters of the created preset (in the case of this particular template project, the Sprite Mode was changed to Single and compression was turned off) and add the preset to the default ones.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now when adding new sprites, their settings will match the settings of the created </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TextureImporter</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now let's look at the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SpriteAtlas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> file, which not only allows you to reduce the number of draw calls, but also provides a convenient way to get sprites by their name in the code. You can create a sprite atlas in the following way:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now about the atlas settings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You need to be extremely careful with the Allow Rotation and Tight Packing parameters. They are enabled by default, but this sometimes leads to various distortions, flips and artifacts if you change component sprites on the fly from the code.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And of course, don't forget to add folders that will be nested in the created sprite atlas. In our case, this is one folder named </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Atlas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sprites</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> directory, there is also a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NonAtlas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> folder, which, as you can judge by the name, we do not add to the sprite atlas. For example, you can store icons, a cursor, etc here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An example of getting sprites from a sprite atlas by name can be found in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SoundsButtonController.Start</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> method.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Transitions between scenes">Transitions between scenes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An example of transition from the initialization scene to the main one can be seen in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>InitSceneLoader</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> class.

Playing the video, of course, is not necessary here, and serves only as an example.

But I would not recommend rushing and setting the highest version either, or at least have the opportunity to test your application on more than one device. Otherwise you could catch something like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/android-targetapi-34-crash-on-launch">this</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, not long ago, if you set the Target API Level to 34, the game crashed when it launched on devices with API level 34 (it worked successfully on the rest).

			<p>Section 9 Interactive has entered a publishing partnership with Epic Games for an unannounced title. Section 9 comprises industry veterans, with some of them working on Little Nightmares and LittleBigPlanet PS Vita. On the Section 9 Interactive website, it says that they are "hard at work" on a new sci-fi action-adventure title that will be released for PC and the current generation of consoles. This studio is located in Malmo, Sweden, and the company is also currently hiring for an Environment Artist, 3D Artist, and Level Designer.</p>
<p>The new title will be made with Unreal Engine 5, and there are some glimpses of the game on their website. Of course, it comes with the notice that the footage is pre-alpha footage and is in no way representative of the final quality of the title. Section 9 Interactive also posted their news on social media, saying the following:</p>
<p>"We've entered a publishing partnership with EpicPublishing! Our team is very excited, as they've been tremendous partners in helping bring our creative vision to life. We appreciate everyone's support along the way and can't wait to share more soon!" <a href="https://x.com/section9int" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The X page</a> for Section 9 Interactive is sparse, but it shows that the company was a recipient of the Epic MegaGrants program in 2021. The social media page also shows off some short clips and gifs of the game they are currently working on, which has strong similarities to that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Little Nightmares</a>.</p>
<p>"Working with the Epic Games Publishing team has been an amazing experience for us," says Gustaf Heinerwall, Co-Founder of Section 9 Interactive. "Ever since our first meeting with the team at EGP we felt that this partnership was a perfect fit for our studio. They've given us incredible support and the freedom to fully explore our creative vision, which is all we can ask for in a publisher. We are thankful for this opportunity, and excited for what comes next."</p>
<p>By joining the <a href="https://wccftech.com/aquiris-studio-gets-investment-and-publishing-deal-from-epic-games/">publishing partnership</a> with Epic Games, the developers will still own their game's intellectual property rights while receiving funding for development costs, as well as support for when the game is ready to go to the market. During the development process, they will retain complete creative control of the project. Once the initial launch and costs of the game have been recouped, the developers will earn at least 50% revenue share.</p>
<p>Section 9 Interactive hopes to share more news about their upcoming project soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-roadmap-looks-ahead-to-dlcs-console-launch-and-more.1045692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has revealed the first&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, detailing what's coming to the post-apocalyptic city-builder in the near future, and there's plenty on the way to keep you occupied.</p>

<p>Released in September,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">quickly crossed the profitability line</a>, selling 350,000 copies just a few days out from launch (which isn't bad considering the game is also available on Game Pass as a day one release).</p>

<p>Now, developer and publisher 11 bit is looking to the future, and following on from October's Patch 1.1, the next major drop you can expect for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is the appropriately-named Patch 1.2, which will arrive sometime before the year is out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=0_8kY5SF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=kg11pbox 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's plenty coming to&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>in the near future.</figcaption></figure><p>After Patch 1.2, you can expect a "free major content update" in 2025. 11 bit hasn't specified what will be included in this update, but the studio does say these updates are "inspired by [players'] feedback" and that they will "significantly impact your overall experience with the game".</p>

<p>A console launch is also on the cards for 2025, as are two major DLC packs, currently codenamed Spectrum and Aurora. The devs promise these DLCs will "add something completely new to the harsh world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>", although they're remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>

<p>A third DLC launch is planned for 2026, but that's quite a ways off, as evidenced by the fact that this DLC doesn't even have a codename yet. Still, it shows that you shouldn't set your copy of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>down for too long.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's 11 bit studios' followup to the 2018 survival city-builder&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. It's largely a similar experience to its predecessor, but it adds new mechanics like factions, new resource types, and city districts, plus lots more thorny moral decision-making.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. A release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S is also planned for the future. Our very own Andrew Stretch's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn" rel="nofollow">review of the game is right here</a> if you want to learn more about how it ticks.</p>

There are 180-plus fighters to choose from and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">nearly half need to be unlocked</a></span>. Although it’s easy to assume that such a large roster would have minimal differences, there is more depth than stated. Every fighter is categorized into specific character types that determine their best traits and how to play them.</p><p>The problem is that there isn’t any real mention of these classifications in the game. We only know they’re a thing from marketing materials and a couple of brief overviews deep within the Battle Training mode. Fans are still trying to figure out which fighters belong to which character classes, which feels damn near impossible since a lot of the roster has elements from multiple types. While we might hope for a hypothetical update that will properly categorize all the fighters, we’re not entirely in the dark! Here are the notable differences we’ve found for every character type.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ad8a4b6ba53a803088009777d9ee6cae" data-recommend-id="image://ad8a4b6ba53a803088009777d9ee6cae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vegeta launches a flurry of explosive energy blasts.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We’ll start with the type that most players will use, whether they know it or not. <strong>Ki-Blast characters are the ones most known for their projectiles.</strong> They can comfortably attack from a distance with long-range beams or smother their opponents with rapid energy blasts. Most versions of Goku and Vegeta would be considered a Ki-Blast type.</p><p><strong>The best way to tell that a character is a part of this category is that their energy blasts cost less Ki compared to others</strong>. They can use projectiles a bit more often in combat without having to worry about running out of energy. Going hand-in-hand is the ability to just keep throwing out blasts. Most characters have a string of up to four or five blasts they can shoot before taking a short break. With some Ki-blast characters, such as Vegeta, you can keep mashing out projectile attacks until your energy is depleted.</p><p>Out of all the different types we talk about, these are the closest you have to all-rounders. They’re adequate at a little of everything and have more flexibility in how you play them. Others will meanwhile excel at specific qualities that can sometimes give them the edge in a fight.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-recommend-id="image://ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legendary Super Saiyan Broly grits his teeth as he prepares a green energy orb in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Legendary Super Saiyan Broly grits his teeth as he prepares a green energy orb in his hand." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-recommend-id="image://ef9ccf98bf0c28d117aaf360af9c099e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Legendary Super Saiyan Broly grits his teeth as he prepares a green energy orb in his hand." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When it comes to characters in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise, you’re either going to think of those who use giant energy beams or the hulking brutes who overpower their opponents. The latter is the basis for the Strength character type. <strong>The fighters of the Strength type move and attack a bit slower, but make up for it with powerful hits.</strong></p><p>Pinpointing a Strength type can be difficult.. Defining them purely on their attack damage is also less helpful when the whole roster adheres to the Destruction Point (DP) system. I’ve found that the larger and more muscular characters usually fall into the Strength category. Think of characters like Jiren and either version of Broly.</p><p>Some of these characters are unfazed by Ki-Blasts and weaker melee strings. They’ll still take damage, but they won’t be staggered and can still move and attack while being hit themselves. It’s a trait that’s typically exclusive to a Strength character’s highest form from my time testing. Both versions of Broly gain this special attribute with their respective third forms, although their second forms will also temporarily obtain it while entering Sparking! mode.</p><p>Most characters can cause a stagger against these particular foes with the fourth or so hit from their rush combo. This isn’t tied to landing a certain number of hits first. Instead, it appears that the latter halves of a Rush string commonly have more heavy hits. Further proving this is that both a fellow Strength character and a Giant character only need a single punch to cause a stagger. A Strength type’s primary weakness will be its slower nature. They should watch out for long-range attacks and opponents who like to dodge and attack from behind.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-recommend-id="image://f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Burter smiles as he kicks Imperfect Cell high in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Burter smiles as he kicks Imperfect Cell high in the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-recommend-id="image://f145fb88bb31a5a37cc339e9fcbd38b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Burter smiles as he kicks Imperfect Cell high in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next up is the perfect inverse to Strength: Speed. Featuring fighters such as Burter, Kakunsa, and Dyspo, <strong>Speed-types are all about quick movements and even faster attacks</strong>. Their melee rush combos will typically consist of individually weaker hits, but they can dish out many more instead.</p><p>This means it will be much harder to land a counter or Sonic Sway against a Speed type. Still, the best way to play these characters is to dodge around the opponent and attack from the sides or behind. That’s an ideal strategy for any character, but it feels a lot more oppressive with faster ones like these. The last thing a quick fighter like this needs is to be cornered.</p><p>Read More: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-super-movement-how-1851700605&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-super-movement-how-1851700605">Super Movement Is A Vague <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> Mechanic You Need To Know About</a></span></p><p>I’ve also found that they’re more likely to have certain techniques. Each one I practiced with had access to moves like Super Movement or Violent Rush during Sparking! Mode. They also all had a Rush Chain that could end with a Delta Heavy Finish, which functions like the Tri-Attack from older entries in the series. Becoming familiar with these techniques is necessary to keep your opponents on their toes.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-recommend-id="image://c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Android 17 stands in the middle of a fight against Super Buu in a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Android 17 stands in the middle of a fight against Super Buu in a city." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-recommend-id="image://c958bc294255c7066a1ecf3ef255eb85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Android 17 stands in the middle of a fight against Super Buu in a city." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Out of all the character types, the Androids have some of the more distinct gameplay properties. <strong>Androids cannot raise their Ki with the manual Ki charging button</strong>, which all other characters make use of. They can use it to transition into Sparking! mode, but it might as well not exist before that gauge is filled.</p><p>The methods of raising their Ki depend on what type of Android they are. Just like they were in the story, an Android is either an energy absorption model or a perpetual energy model. Energy absorption models like Dr. Gero and Android 19 charge Ki with melee attacks or by absorbing blasts from their opponents. All the rest are perpetual energy androids who simply recover Ki over time.</p><p>Either way, Androids need to keep a close watch on their Ki gauge. Flying around and throwing energy blasts is a lot more costly for them. These characters should stay on the offensive with melee attacks and rush combos as often as possible. Since they don’t need to worry about regular breaks in the fight to charge up, they shouldn’t allow their opponent that time either. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-recommend-id="image://dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The large bug-like Hirudegarn grabs Super Buu on the Islands stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The large bug-like Hirudegarn grabs Super Buu on the Islands stage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-recommend-id="image://dd5d26c0c442cc894be41c0bf48a72f5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The large bug-like Hirudegarn grabs Super Buu on the Islands stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Although Androids have some pretty special gameplay qualities to them, there is one group that stands out even more.<strong> Giant characters are, true to their name, huge, lumbering fighters who tower over the rest of the roster.</strong> Some great examples include Great Ape Vegeta and Hirudegarn.</p><p>This difference in size gives them many advantages. Any attempts to throw a Giant charac ter will be unsuccessful in nearly all cases. They’re also impervious to most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-impact-action-qte-guide-1851678426&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-impact-action-qte-guide-1851678426">Impact Actions</a></span>, with smaller characters only able to trigger Blast Impacts against them.

Their attacks, whether that’s close-range or projectile, will take out some big chunks of HP and send opponents flying. Giant characters also won’t stagger easily, remaining undisturbed from Ki blasts and weaker melee attacks.</p><p>However, they also amplify many of the setbacks from Strength characters. Such slow attacks are easy to dodge for opponents that are constantly moving around. It’s common for them to lose track and miss attacks depending on their positioning. Fighters from the same category can also be an effective counter. Another Giant can cause a stagger with one hit and they are the only ones who can trigger a unique Power Impact. The latter likely won’t happen often as it requires both to use a throw at the same time, even though their normal throws won’t work on each other. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7b1e89dfba4e298dc54df44b7d346d0d" data-recommend-id="image://7b1e89dfba4e298dc54df44b7d346d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Future Trunks slices Super Buu with his sword on the Hyperbolic Time Chamber map.

<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is the latest Game Boy title <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861215895873298613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now playable</a> through the Nintendo Switch Online membership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Land 2 is a platformer released for Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. It is a sequel to Donkey Kong Land, sometimes called Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy Kong’s Quest. This game features Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong as the playable characters, both with different gameplay mechanics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The game’s main characters have different movement systems, and players can control only one at a time. With Diddy Kong, players will be able to ride train tracks, cartwheel their enemies and swing on grappling hooks. On the other hand, Dixie Kong can float in the air using her Helicopter Spin and throw barrels at enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end goal of Donkey Kong Land 2 is saving Donkey Kong from K. Rool, and players must go through 40 levels filled with traps, collectables, Kremlings, barrels, and bananas to do that.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The list of games and applications that feature RTX technologies continues to grow, with games having access to NVIDIA DLSS, NVIDIA Reflex, and advanced ray-tracing integration. This makes those who have GeForce RTX cards have a prettier and more immersive experience. With more than <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600 games and applications</a> utilizing these technologies, there is no sign of the list slowing down any time soon. This week, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-2-void-crew-towers-of-aghasba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three more games</a> joined the ever-expanding list, with more to come in the future. This week sees Void Crew, War Thunder and Towers of Aghasba join the list of games featuring<a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-extensive-preview-of-nvidia-rtx-effects-and-performance/"> RTX technologies</a>. Below is a breakdown of how you can expect to utilize them in the game.</p>
<p>Void Crew has just been released from early access and is a fun co-op roguelite title from Hutlihut Games and Focus Entertainment where you get to play as a METEM-chosen clone warrior, where you and your friends have to embark on a Pilgrimage. As you explore and get deeper into the unknown, you come across the HOLLOW, an alien force like no other. It's up to you and your friends to face off against them to try and bring peace back to the people. Void Crew will be utilizing DLSS Super Resolution, allowing GeForce RTX gamers to accelerate the performance of the game with the advanced technology.</p>
<p>Next up on the list is War Thunder. This game is far from new, as it was first released in 2013. However, since its release, it's received a new coat of paint and looks better than ever. There are hundreds of tanks, ground military vehicles, planes, and warships that will look even better by using DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA Reflex. War Thunder just received a new update, which also added support for hardware-accelerated ray-tracing effects to make the game even more immersive and stunning. These options include ray-traced ambient occlusion, ray-traced water, and ray-traced shadows, for example.</p>
<p>Finally, Towers of Aghasba is the latest game to join the roster of games with RTX technology integration. This game is hot off the press and is currently in Early Access. In this game, you get to explore an open-world with fascinating flora and fauna. You will meet some interesting characters along the way, and you can help breathe life into the world, as well as create your very own island civilization. If you are playing this title, you will be able to use DLSS Super Resolution for a faster and smoother experience in Towers of Aghasba.</p>

The move comes amid the Chinese government's implementation of a rule limiting children to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/gaming-business-children-00db669defcc8e0ca1fc2dc54120a0b8" rel="nofollow">one hour of online game time per day.</a></p><p dir="ltr">However, Nintendo did not cite any specific reason for the upcoming shutdown of the eShop and all network services for the Switch in China (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-eshop-closing-2026-in-china" rel="nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever the case, the eShop will close in China on April 1, 2026. This means Nintendo will no longer sell games or offer demos. Starting May 15, 2026, Nintendo will block the redemption of online codes, which will prevent users from redeeming DLC or other items they have a code for. May 15 is also the day that Nintendo will shut down all network services for the Switch in China.</p><p dir="ltr">People in China who use WeChat can claim up to four free Nintendo games as part of the impending shutdown. These games include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</li><li dir="ltr">Super Mario Odyssey</li><li dir="ltr">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</li><li dir="ltr">Super Mario Party</li><li dir="ltr">Mario Tennis Aces</li><li dir="ltr">Yoshi's Crafted World</li><li dir="ltr">Flexible Brain School</li><li dir="ltr">Dr. Kawashima's Brain Exercises</li><li dir="ltr">Kirby Star Allies</li><li dir="ltr">New Pokemon Snap</li><li dir="ltr">Pokemon Go!
