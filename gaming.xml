            <p>
By now, you've probably heard of massive Fallout 4 mod <a href="https://fallout4london.com/">Fallout: London</a>, given the struggles it's faced in the run-up to release. There's one last hurdle for players to overcome, however, with developer Team Folon having now confirmed it'll be necessary to downgrade Fallout 4's next-gen version to play it - a process thankfully being handled by its accompanying installer.
</p>
<p>
Fallout 4's long-promised next-gen update <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-free-next-gen-update-finally-arrives-this-month">finally launched in April</a>, but its arrival caused some major headaches for the Fallout: London team. The mod was originally due to launch on 23rd April, but it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">delayed</a> after Bethesda announced Fallout 4's next-gen update would arrive two days later - Team Folon admitting it was concerned about potential "complications". And with good reason, it turns out; Team Folon has now confirmed a downgrade from the next-gen version of Fallout 4 will be absolutely necessary to run Fallout: London.
</p>
<p>A downgrader was briefly mentioned in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-says-the-end-is-in-sight-as-testing-gets-underway">statement the developer shared over the weekend</a>, but its inclusion wasn't really detailed at the time. However, in a follow-up message on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/1234891241184038973/1259924540088123393">Fallout: London's Discord</a> (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/fallout-london-devs-will-downgrade-fallout-4-to-save-their-massive-mod/">Ars Technica</a>), project lead Dean Carter explained, "At the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - thus the need for a downgrader."

<p>
Carter added that Bethesda's continuing updates to Fallout 4's next-gen release hasn't helped the London mod's progress at all. "It's been an utter frustration and every setback requires the testing process to restart," he explained. "Which is why we've decided to go with the downgrader route and when the 'next-gen' is sorted, update it for that."
</p>
<p>
Fallout: London will release via GOG (its massive size meant it was too large to host on Nexus Mods), and it's currently going through the company's quality-assurance checks ahead of its arrival. There's no release date for the mod just yet, but a post over the weekend claimed "the end is in sight", with the team seemingly just waiting for GOG to finish its work at this point. "Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout: London and its installer work on all supported machines," it wrote, "we should be good to go."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-is-teasing-an-unsettling-new-horror-game-with-a-creepy-smiling-man<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Nintendo really woke up this morning and chose chaos by dropping a deeply upsetting short teaser for what seems to be a new horror game. We're not sure of the title just yet, but it might be called Emio, or possibly Smiling Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What the heck was that? Nintendo fans are baffled. There are almost no details as to what this "Emio" thing is. Apart from the trailer, the only other info we have is that Nintendo tweeted about it across its U.S., Europe, and Japanese accounts this morning with the hashtag #WhoIsEmio?. There's an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official Nintendo website</a>, too, which just features the creepy dude standing there and occasionally, briefly, changing his expression. And we've confirmed that the kanji in the background of all these teases reads "laughing man" or "smiling man."</p><p>So why is everyone so worked up about this? It's not necessarily that there's anything abnormal about teasing a work of horror like this. Plenty of films and games have played up horror elements by being deliberately vague and sudden in their reveals. But Nintendo is, uh, not exactly known for that kind of thing! It's just out of character for them to surprise drop a trailer for what seems to be an M-rated horror game on a random Wednesday morning with no other context.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We don't even know who's making Emio. People are speculating that based on the fact that it has an official Nintendo website, this may be a first-party game, which would be even more out of character for Nintendo. That said, a number of individuals have pointed out on social media that noted horror developer Bloober Team <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced just two days ago</a> it was working on something called "Project M," which is apparently coming to Nintendo platforms and is expected to be announced this year. Could this be Project M? Or something else entirely?</p><p>Whatever the case, we'll have to wait to find out, but the prospect of a new horror game made by Nintendo, of all companies, is an exciting one to imagine. Until then, we'll have to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review">make do with Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a>.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

<p>Apple recently announced new games coming to Apple Arcade, its gaming subscription service for iPhones, iPads, Macs, Apple TVs, and Vision Pro headsets. The headlining title is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, an indie hit that combined the gameplay of bullet hell shooters and the addictive quality of clickers to become a mega sensation two years ago. Also coming is <em>Temple Run: Legends</em>, an updated take on the popular game from 2011.</p>
<p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> was already available on the App Store, but it was ad-supported, with the option to spend money in-app to get additional content. The Apple Arcade version, dubbed <em>Vampire Survivors+</em>, is more akin to the PC or Xbox versions that don't have ads. Both paid expansions will be included at no additional charge.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Temple Run: Legends</em> is a completely new game (not just a remake of the original <em>Temple Run</em>) that bucks the "endless runner" genre label by breaking its gameplay into individual levels—though there will be some kind of optional endless mode, too.</p>
<p>If you haven't played <em>Vampire Survivors</em> before, it's worth a try. Both titles will launch on August 1.</p>
<h2>Arcade could use some fresher and riskier picks</h2>
<p>These new additions are the most recent in a long line of Apple Arcade titles curated with a risk-averse, only-if-it-is-proven mentality that more or less ensures the subscription service won't get the sorts of surprise breakout hits that draw people to it.</p>
<p>When Apple Arcade launched, its initial lineup was a fascinating mix of casual and indie titles, some of which went on to be popular on other platforms once Arcade's exclusivity ended. However, there were reports early on that Arcade wasn't gaining the traction Apple hoped for, so the company quickly switched gears. It turned to continued, ongoing engagement as the primary metric by which to judge success, which led to a preference for games-as-a-service as opposed to standalone or narrative experiences. And it began primarily releasing games based on established intellectual properties like Hello Kitty or Star Wars, as well as re-releases of games that had already proven their success elsewhere in the App Store.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Many of those re-releases were more than a decade old, hearkening back to the early days of the App Store when premium titles reigned and free-to-play, games-as-a-service hadn't taken the wheel.</p>
<p>This week, Apple released a new game-as-a-service in a mobile IP from 2011 and a viral indie hit many months after its virality died down. I'm not saying no one is interested in or playing <em>Vampire Survivors</em> now, but imagine how much more it would have driven iPhone owners to Arcade if it had been there when it was first making headlines.</p>
<p>It took only a short time for Apple to shift gears away from its initial strategy of approaching creative new developers that were presenting interesting work at events like IndieCade to leaning only on games that had proven they could be successful, IPs that had proven popular already, or experienced developers who had already made waves on the App Store. Perhaps Apple didn't give that strategy enough of a chance.</p>
<p>What we have now is a safe subscription service that essentially curates the best of what other people have already discovered and (thankfully) strips out ads and microtransactions. That's a nice enough value proposition, especially for the price. But we're unlikely to see breakout hits on Arcade making waves among players, influencers, or the press because, for the most part, Apple is following the headlines with this service, not leading them.</p>
<p>That limits Arcade's place in the landscape a bit, and limits its potential for growth. That doesn't mean it's not a good value for the right kind of player, but it means that those looking to play the next best thing are likely to be looking elsewhere, and by the time something makes it to Arcade, they've moved on to the next trend. Your mileage may vary whether that works for you, but with more competition from other mobile games subscription services, Apple might need to accommodate more kinds of players. A greater balance between proven hits and more experimental or ambitious titles day-and-date with other platforms could help capture both buckets.</p>

            <p>
Riot Games was reportedly developing a Smash Bros. style fighter set in the League of Legends universe, but pulled the plug on the project earlier this year after perceiving Warner Bros' Smash-inspired MultiVersus to have been a commercial failure.
</p>
<p>
That's according to former Washington Post video games and esports editor Mikhail Klimentov, who - writing in his <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee">ReaderGrev newsletter</a> - claims 70-80 Riot employees were working on the Smash-style platform fighter, codenamed Pool Party.
</p>

Citing current and former Riot employees familiar with the  project, Klimnetov says Pool Party was initially envisaged as a hardcore fighting game but grew to incorporate party game elements and casual-friendly mechanics as development continued.

<p>
Riot executives reportedly saw an opportunity to build and support the game's esports scene, but started getting cold feet after the release of Warner Bros' Smash-style free-to-play fighter MultiVersus. That game's launch is said to have been perceived as a failure by Riot decision makers, prompting the studio to reassess the consumer appetite for a Smash competitor. As a result, it cancelled the development of Pool Party in May this year.
</p>
<p>
Klimnetov says approximately half the 70-80 Riot employees working on the project have received offers to be assigned elsewhere in the company, while others are seeking new positions through the company's internal job board.
</p>
<p>
In a statement provided to Klimentov as part of his report, senior comms director Joe Hixson said, "We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year".
</p>
<p>
Pool Party is not to be confused with Riot's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-free-to-play-fighter-officially-named-2xko">other League of Legends' fighter</a>, 2XKO. Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/project-l-will-be-free-to-play-new-champion-detailed">back in August 2022</a> under the name Project L, 2XKO will launch as free-to-play title for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.

But for the PlayStation 5 (and PC) owners who still want a customizable, competitive-focused controller, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BQ1PDR4R?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has a wildly good early Prime Day deal on the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</a>, one of the few officially licensed PS5 controllers. Normally $250, you can get the Wolverine V2 Pro for only $165 ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day</a>. This is by far the lowest price yet--in fact, we wouldn't be surprised if this is a pricing error that disappears soon.</p><p>Only the black model is eligible for this price, as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-PlayStation-Console/dp/B0BWSLLWF2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the white version is discounted to $200</a>--which had been the lowest price yet for the Wolverine V2 Pro until today. We started writing this story with the $200 price in mind for both colors, but then the $165 price showed up. Admittedly, the $250 list price is on the high end, but regardless, deals on this controller aren't very common.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4217398" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4217398"></a><figcaption>Razer Wolverine V2 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4217398-razer-v2.jpg"></figure><p>The Wolverine V2 Pro features Razer's mecha-tactile face and shoulder buttons that have shorter actuation distance, an eight-way microswitch D-pad for more accurate gaming, and trigger locks.</p><p>There are also six remappable buttons, interchangeable thumbsticks, and Razer's trademark flair via chroma RGB lighting that snakes its way across the device. With the Razer controller app, which is available on mobile and PC, you can remap inputs and set up custom profiles.</p><p>It's worth noting you don't get the adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, or a built-in speaker--so these omissions should be weighed before going the third-party route.</p><p>Overall, this is a solid controller to consider for competitive gaming in fighting game and first-person shooter genres.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-bloomburrow-value-boosters-introduced-providing-alternative-cheaper<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed a new type of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> booster. As part of their latest set, the tabletop company has introduced <em>Bloomburrow</em> value boosters. These are designed to be cheaper alternatives to collecting <em>Magic</em> cards, and it is a decision that has lead to some friction.</p>
<h2>The <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters Announcement</h2>
<p>In an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast explains the creation of <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters. According to the post, value boosters are smaller, lighter boosters. They are designed to be budget-friendly compared to the Play Boosters and Collector Boosters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloomburrow-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=LM8-n2vB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloomburrow-promotional-artwork.jpg?itok=q2f72NSi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A single Value Booster will contain three commons, two uncommons, one wildcard of any variety, and one card that may be a land, traditional foil, or a Special Guests card. Aside from these values, the post is light on further details, including MSRP or the business decisions that informed the booster's development.</p>
<p>Thankfully, head designer Mark Rosewater held an informal AMA on his personal Tumblr.</p>
<p>One of the questions <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/755556573155295232/hey-mark-just-wanted-to-say-that-the-news-about">voiced concern</a> that the <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters were malicious on WOTC's part, given their decision to remove Draft Boosters and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-introduces-magic-gathering-play-boosters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">introduce Play Boosters</a>. Rosewater responded that Value Boosters is an experiment in providing cheaper booster options for pharmacies, grocery stores, and toy aisles.</p>
<p>This shift in price informs other parts of the Value Boosters. Because it is a low-cost alternative, Value Boosters do not guarantee rare cards. Since Value Boosters are meant for general stores and not dedicated game shops, they cannot be <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/755562714280099840/why-not-support-a-draft-format-using-value">used for Draft</a>.</p>
<p>Lastly, Rosewater confirmed that Draft Boosters were dropped because there wasn't a large enough market buying them. And if the <em>Bloomburrow</em> Value Boosters end up the same way, they will be dropped as well.</p>
<p><em>Bloomburrow's</em> Prerelease begins July 26. Those attending this year's GenCon can also experience Bloomburrow events from August 1-4.</p>

			<p>Titan Quest II is the latest game by THQ Nordic that is eagerly awaited by many, with the first game from 2016 receiving Very Positive reviews on Steam. <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-as-an-open-world-game-powered-by-ue5/">The sequel to Titan Quest</a> was announced in August 2023 and is still in development with an unconfirmed release date.</p>
<p>THQ Nordic has released a brand new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dev diary </a>that discusses character styles, looting, and the quest system available in-game. There will be assigned levels to each area, scaling enemies, and plenty of weaponry to get your hands on and experiment with.</p>
<p>While there have been plenty of dev diaries about this exciting new game, there hasn't been any gameplay footage yet. However, the developers are changing that, and players can expect to see new footage arriving on August 2 in a brand-new gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>Additionally, to anyone who may be making the journey to Germany to attend Gamescom, attendees will have the opportunity to trial Titan Quest II between August 21-25. For those excited about the Titan Quest II showcase, mark your calendar. It will be released on August 2 at 12:00 PM PDT / 3 PM EDT / 8 PM BST / 9 PM CEST / 10 PM MSK.</p>
<p>This game comes from the developers of Spellforce 3, and players will get to explore a hand-crafted RPG world with fast-paced and precise combat where you can learn to exploit their weak spots, as well as huge character customizations that will allow you to make the world easier or harder depending on how you want to play out the game.</p>
<p>For those who are fans of Greek Mythology, this is a game that you will want to keep on your radar. Players will get to ride the gorgeous steed Areion and utilize the powers given to them by the Gods to defeat Nemesis, Goddess of Retribution, who's the main villain in the storyline.</p>
<p>There is no official release date yet, and the system requirements have not been released, but this information may be released soon after Gamescom.</p>

                <p>During the Night Market festival in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a> you can go watch the Mermaid Show, which plays a funky little cutscene. While just watching the show doesn't get you anything besides the short cutscene, there is a hidden secret you can find, if you know the correct password. Here's what you need to know.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The Mermaid Show</h2><p>The Mermaid Show is part of the Night Market festival, which takes place from Winter 15 to 17. The Night Market is located on the pier, right outside Willy's shop and runs from 5 PM to 2 AM all three days, although <strong>the Mermaid Show closes at 12:30 AM</strong>. The Mermaid Show is located on the eastern part of the pier.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331014-mermaidshow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331014-mermaidshow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4331014"></a><figcaption>You can unlock the secret reward by pressing the shells in the correct order after the show ends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4331014-mermaidshow.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When you enter the Mermaid Show, it will automatically start playing, and it will restart if you leave and come back in. The show takes 1 hour and 40 minutes of in-game time to complete. Once the show ends, the curtains will close, leaving you in the room with 5 interactable shells in a line in front of you. Interacting with the shells will play a musical note, and the puzzle requires you to play them in the correct order.</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p dir="ltr">More Stardew Valley guides:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><p>Stardew Valley Traveling Cart Guide</p></li><li><p>Stardew Valley: Should You Pick Bats Or Mushrooms For The Cave</p></li><li><p>How To Get Clay In Stardew Valley</p></li><li><p>How To Use Bait In Stardew Valley</p></li></ul></div><p dir="ltr"><strong>The solution is 1-5-4-2-3, with the leftmost shell being 1 and the rightmost being 5. </strong>The way you learn this information is by finding the Secret Note with the answer. You can unlock Secret Notes by completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-solve-a-winter-mystery-in-stardew-valley/1100-6524843/" data-ref-id="1100-6524843">Winter Mystery quest</a>, which can be done as early as Winter 1. <strong>You don't have to have the note to put in the correct solution.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your reward for solving the puzzle is a Pearl, which you can only get from the Mermaid Show once per save file. Pearls are a treasure that can be sold for 2,500G, but it is also a universally loved gift, if you don't need the money.</p>

From a practical standpoint, this is helpful during the character creation process if you want your Rook’s body to look a certain way, it’s easier to do that when their shirt is off. <em>Game Informer</em> asked if there would be nudity elsewhere in the game, to which director Corrine Busche responded, “This is a mature RPG.”</p><p>As for whether or not <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-genitals-character-customization-options-1850616353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-genitals-character-customization-options-1850616353"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3's</em></a></span> example and include genitalia, BioWare apparently told <em>Game Informer </em>the studio wants fans to discover for themselves. That isn’t a resounding “yes,” but it’s a weirdly evasive answer if it’s “no.” Not to say that it’s impossible that they would avoid giving a direct answer if it’s disappointing news, but that’s also just setting yourself up for backlash if you tease discovering something that’s not there. Notably, you can customize your Rook’s bulge in the character creator, but it remains to be seen if that goes anywhere beyond how their underwear fits them.</p><p>Nudity has become a pretty standard affair in BioWare games over the years.

That plan apparently included prototyping a <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>-style game starring <em>League</em> characters called<em> Pool Party</em>, but according to a new report the project was recently canned, due in part to the uphill road faced by <em>MultiVersus</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,194842,196544" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a new report</a></span> by former <em>Washington Post Launcher</em> editor Mikhail Klimentov on his Patreon, <em>Pool Party</em> was pitched as a <em>Smash Bros.</em>-esque game set in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe that would invest heavily in a competitive esports scene. Once in development, the project took on party game elements and “casual-friendly mechanics,” but Riot Games ultimately decided to walk away, in part because of the perceived failure of <em>MultiVersus</em>, a Warner Bros. crossover fighter that made a massive splash in 2022 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-return-review-fps-laggy-locked-characters-1851506741">but then went offline for months before relaunching to much less fanfare</a></span>. </p><p>Around 80 people were apparently working on <em>Pool Party</em> up until its cancellation in May. Now some have been reassigned while others were laid off. “We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year,” a spokesperson for Riot told Klimentov. </p><p>Riot Games is still working on a 2v2 <em>League of Legends </em>fighting game planned for release in 2025 called <em>2XKO</em>, and it also has an MMO based in the universe in development. Since the MOBA blew up, there have also been autobattlers and card-based spin-offs, as well RPGs, indie action games, and platformers all based around <em>League</em> characters. Riot Forge, the division responsible for publishing these games developed with outside studios, was shut down earlier this year amid 500 layoffs.</p><p>For its part, <em>MultiVersus</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599">remains a fun game trapped in a terrible free-to-play grind</a></span>. There’s nothing stopping Warner Bros. from eventually turning it around but it’s clear its needs a new model to build off of. Still, it would be cool to see more companies take a stab at the platformer fighting genre. Maybe a <em>Dragon Ball Z </em>game could be the one that cracks the<em> Smash Bros.</em> code. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The event is split up into different acts. And on Tuesday, Valve released Act Three, the next big patch for <em>DOTA 2</em>. Inside this new update is a tiny, but impressively well-made fighting game featuring <em>DOTA</em> characters and locations. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/dota-2/news/dota-2-sleet-fighter-how-to-play-best-heroes-tips-tricks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/dota-2/news/dota-2-sleet-fighter-how-to-play-best-heroes-tips-tricks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Dot Esports</em></a></span>, this new fighting game is called <em>Sleet Fighte</em>r (...get it!?) and is a 2D fighter featuring five <em>DOTA </em>characters. Each character has a full move list and the game supports both single-player modes and a multiplayer option that lets you play either online against friends or locally using a second controller. </p><p>It’s wild how good<em> Sleet Fighter </em>looks based on gameplay clips I’ve seen on YouTube and Twitter. This isn’t some quickly made browser thing, but an actual mini-fighting game complete with leaderboards and its own rewards. You can tell this is a real fighting game because if you look online you’ll see people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1dznttq/my_sleet_fighter_tierlist_because_somebody_has_to/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1dznttq/my_sleet_fighter_tierlist_because_somebody_has_to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">creating tier lists and arguing over them</a></span> in the comments. I’ve also found <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1dzjosy/lets_compile_tech_for_sleet_fighter/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1dzjosy/lets_compile_tech_for_sleet_fighter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people compiling move lists and figuring out frame data</a></span>, too. That sounds like a fighting game community to me!</p><p>It’s almost frustrating to see Valve put so much work and effort into making a fighting game for<em> DOTA 2</em> that will leave once Crownfall is over in October. Or maybe it won’t be removed. Perhaps all the positive feedback will convince Valve to invest a bit more into it and let it live on as a free-fighting game inside <em>DOTA 2.</em></p><h2 id="h180486"><a id=""></a><strong>How to play <em>Sleet Fighter</em></strong></h2><p>If you want to check out <em>Sleet Fighter</em> yourself you’ll first need to download and install <em>DOTA 2.</em> (Don’t worry, it’s free.) </p><p>Then launch the game and open up Act Three’s “The Frosts of Icewrack” section on the home screen. You’ll then need to work your way through the story mode a bit before you can find “<em>Sleet Fighter 2: Immortal Combat</em>” at a fork in the road.</p><p>Once inside the Severed Head Pub, you’ll be able to select a mode and begin fighting players or the computer to earn rewards. The five available characters in <em>Sleet Figther</em> are Tusk, Shendelzare, Bristleback, Dawnbreaker, and Marci.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
