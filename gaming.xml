            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-will-make-exploration-feel-truly-rewarding-says-machinegames/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, MachineGames has <a href="https://youtu.be/ik6WEckZKh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>a new deep dive video for the upcoming action/adventure game <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. In the footage, Audio Director Pete Ward claimed that the game will make exploration feel truly rewarding, especially for those players who like to wander off.</p>
<p><em>The game is designed around the charm and resourcefulness of our hero. You will be thrown into this story-driven&nbsp;journey where Indiana must hunt for clues to uncover the Great Circle's mysteries. This race for answers will take you to ancient crypts, lost civilizations, and much more.</em></p>
<p><em>The focus for this game is adventure. When you venture into the unknown we want exploration to feel truly rewarding. We carefully crafted each environment to encourage players to uncover clues left, discover valuable objects, and reveal hidden secrets that can aid you in your adventure.</em></p>
<p><em>While the vividly recreated locations you visit have a clear goal driving the story forward, you'll always feel enticed to explore the world and discover the many secrets hiding around every corner. Open areas give you the freedom to find your own adventures beautiful. In these areas, let your curiosity take you off the main path and uncover new missions and mysteries.</em></p>
<p>As an adventure game first and foremost said to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-a-spiritual-successor-to-classic-adventure-game-fate-of-atlantis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by 1992's classic point-and-click game Fate of Atlantis, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will also place a significant emphasis on puzzles.</p>
<p><em>During your adventure, Indiana's versatile tools are at your disposal. It's up to you to find clever uses for each of them. That includes Indiana's camera. Snap photos to reveal historical insights and important clues. Or if you feel the need, use it to receive puzzle hints.</em></p>
<p><em>The journal is your complete guide. It starts as a blank slate but becomes a detailed archive of your journey with maps, photos, and letters. It's a reminder of where you've been and, for the sharp observer, a hint about where to head next.</em></p>
<p><em>Indiana's greatest tool is his mind. Just like Indie, you'll use yours to navigate buried tombs and activate forgotten puzzles while avoiding deadly traps. Clues from the journal, traversal, and decryption are just a few of the things you'll need to figure out the solutions. Every puzzle is designed to fit seamlessly into the world. They range from smaller challenges hiding forbidden secrets to epic obstacles leading to greater mysteries. Solving these puzzles will make you feel like the world's greatest archaeologist.</em></p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will be released on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, while a PlayStation 5 version is being <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prepared</a> for Spring 2025. Meanwhile, check out our recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a> from a press event.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Minimalist RPG Songs of Rats Revealed for Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-minimalist-rpg-songs-of-rats-revealed-for-next-year.1032573/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/songs-of-rats-dark-indie-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Salient Games and publisher Tesseract Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats</em>, an "indie dark role-playing game inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books". It's coming to PC sometime early next year.</p>

<p><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>takes place in a cluster of broken-down spaceships and space stations "crushed and combined into one massive structure" known as the Wreckage. Bizarrely, due to "advanced self-repair technology", the Wreckage has become a haven for its inhabitants.</p>

<p>You must venture into the darkest, deepest corners of this "dangerous yet livable labyrinth" in order to uncover "the dark secrets of fallen civilizations", together with a team of fellow explorers that will help you to navigate the Wreckage's many dangers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=rtgbYN2L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/songs-of-rats-announced-mutants-battle.jpg?itok=MWG2kHli 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>has a deliberately lo-fi, grainy aesthetic.</figcaption></figure><p>As a roguelike,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>will feature an ever-changing world, along with a range of "strange, human and inhuman enemies" with which to do battle. It wouldn't be much of an eldritch superstructure without them, after all.</p>

<p>Exploring will not just get you combat encounters with horrors; it'll also net you bonuses that you can use to upgrade your character, making you better-equipped to survive the dangers of the Wreckage.</p>

<p>Largely speaking,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>tells its story through text and evocative lo-fi images rather than hoity-toity fully-3D graphics, so if you've got any degree of nostalgia for the old days of RPGs, then this one will likely serve you well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good sense of the strange, chilly sci-fi aesthetic the game is going for.</p>




<p>Aesthetically,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>shares a fair amount in common with 2022's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/norco" rel="nofollow">retro-style adventure game&nbsp;<em>Norco</em></a>, although it's perhaps a little closer to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-gold-box-rpgs-to-hit-steam-later-this-month" rel="nofollow">old-school dungeon-crawlers</a> like&nbsp;<em>Eye of the Beholder&nbsp;</em>on the gameplay front.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Songs of Rats&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam sometime in the first quarter of 2025. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3300470/Songs_of_Rats/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it here if you like</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/27/15958176/wolfenstein-ii-the-new-colossus-gameplay-preview-nazi-punching"><em>Wolfenstein</em></a> studio released a nearly 15-minute-long video, which seems to give a very good idea of what to expect in the full release. That includes plenty of cryptic puzzle solving inside of ancient ruins, and lots of using a whip in both combat and traversal.</p><p>While the exploration is obviously at the heart of the game, the new video makes it look like there will be quite a bit of variety to the combat as well. The hand-to-hand brawling looks a bit like a boxing game, but you can combine it with the whip to pull enemies towards you like Scorpion in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>. And there are plenty of other fun details, like an excellent adventure journal and an old-school camera that can take photos and provide puzzle hints. If nothing else, it should fill that <em>Tomb Raider</em> or <em>Uncharted</em> shaped hole in your gaming time.</p><div><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is arguably Xbox’s biggest release of the year, following other notable first-party games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24161514/hellblade-2-review-xbox-pc"><em>Hellblade II</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24262053/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-review"><em>Starfield</em>’s <em>Shattered Space</em> expansion</a>, and the upcoming<em> </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248947/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-cloud-release-date"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></a><em>. </em>While it’s coming to Xbox and PC this year (it’ll be on Game Pass day one), <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>the Great Circle</em> will also be launching on the PS5 in the spring of 2025</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/8/24291530/dji-neo-vertical-video-faster-tracking"><h2>DJI just added the two most requested features to its $199 Neo drone</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/10/24291418/stardew-valley-mario-luigi-brothership-heretic-installer"><h2>Chill games for a chill weekend</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289937/nyt-tech-workers-strike-games-wordle"><h2>NYT tech workers are making their own games while on strike</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291281/mobvoi-home-walking-pad-review-treadmills-fitness"><h2>I got a desk treadmill to relieve stress — instead, it stressed me out</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293395/mattel-wicked-doll-porn-website-url-misprint-error"><h2>Mattel accidentally linked a porn site on Wicked doll packaging</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This look at the back end, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a></span> by <em>Pokémon</em> community account CentroLeaks, outlines a suspected upcoming schedule of the card game from new events to new booster packs, with the card set after Genetic Apex <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly arriving around January 29</a></span>.</p><p>That deduction was based on the apparent naming convention in the code which tags current in-game events as part of A1, while after January they move to A2. But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that. In the meantime, November appears to have a part 2 to the current Meowth event waiting in the wings, as well as a potential Black Friday event and something called “Mass Outbreak.” </p><p>If you ask me, the updates can’t come soon enough. I’m starting to tire ever so slightly of the existing battle meta, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Lapras event</a></span> is truly a grind. Fortunately, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> still excels at the thing I need it for most: 5 minutes of peace staring at beautiful <em>Pokémon </em>cards while I drink my morning coffee. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After all, we leave behind much more than just DNA, as Solid Snake would say — but again, who is Solid Snake?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, this is one of the reasons Konami chose the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater name for the remake, as opposed to simply calling it Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Timeline wise, Snake Eater is the first game in the series, so going with the Greek letter 'delta' helped get this new beginning across.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thr franchise began in 1987 with Hideo Kojima’s Metal Gear, and last saw a mainline entry with Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-v-the-phantom-pain">Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain</a>, released in 2015. Spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-survive">Metal Gear Survive</a> launched in 2018, with only collections of older games coming out in the subsequent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, it’s easy to understand where Konami is coming from here. Metal Gear is well-known by fans of a certain age and has enormous nostalgia potential, but without a brand new mainline entry in nearly a decade, interest among younger gamers probably isn’t where Konami wants it to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is, after Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater comes out, where will Konami take the series next? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-had-a-pretty-rough-launch-so-konami-says-its-being-more-careful-with-vol-2">We know MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2 is in the works</a>, but could Konami be set to remake Kojima’s seminal Metal Gear Solid next? After that, could fans finally get a brand new Metal Gear Solid game? If so, would Konami continue the story as set out by Kojima, or start fresh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, Konami is yet to announce a release date, but it's due out on 	</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC at some point in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Genetic Apex, the first Pokémon TCG Pocket set and the only one currently available, is labelled as A1 in the game, so A2 is presumably the second full set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event is listed as beginning October 29 (the game's global release date) and running until January 29. It's dubbed "Period A1 to A2 (After Global Release) and therefore appears to indicate the end date of Genetic Apex being the main set in Pokémon TCG Pocket.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, another scheduled event could indicate a supplementary set or expansion to Genetic Apex coming in December. "Period A1 to A1a" is similarly listed as already begun but ends December 16, so players should perhaps expect a smaller card drop then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is far from an official announcement, of course, and no further details will be available until developer Creatures Inc. shares them itself. But a full release every three months lines up with the proper Pokémon TCG schedule and standard card game practice in general.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The December event is more mysterious, as Genetic Apex already includes 226 standard numbered cards and 60 super rare alternate arts. Collecting all of these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take upwards of a year</a>, so it's perhaps unlikely Creatures Inc. will expand the set even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event may point to a special event for Genetic Apex instead, where more packs become available, or perhaps even a new bumper booster pack that contains more cards. Doing something like this is fairly common practice in games, with the larger, more expensive packs usually only available by spending real money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Only time will tell what these events actually are, but fans can enjoy the myriad existing events already added by Creatures Inc. in the meantime. One offers players a free Wonder Pick with the chance of pulling either a Meowth or Chansey alongside event tickets and Wonder Hourglasses, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-adds-new-rewards-and-missions-to-wonder-pick-event">its second part currently active</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A solo battle event <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-releases-lapras-ex-through-limited-time-battle-event">lets players take on a handful of water themed decks</a> for the chance of winning new promo cards including Lapras ex, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a PVP event puts badges on the line</a> in true Pokémon fashion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo and Charizard are naturally dominating the meta so far</a>, but one outlier comes via Misty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/misty-has-become-pokmon-tcg-pockets-greatest-villain">whose heads or tails effect is driving many up the wall</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the collecting front, some players are focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-think-theyve-discovered-a-secret-way-to-get-super-good-cards">a conspiracy theory about crinkled corners</a> while most are swooning over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-swoon-over-mythical-god-packs-that-have-5-alternate-art-cards">mythical god packs that award five alternate art cards in one go</a>.

            <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have released an extended look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, giving us a deeper dive into the upcoming game.</p>
<p>In the 15-minute presentation, the team offers a look at a broad spectrum of gameplay, including combat, puzzles and traversal. The part I am most looking forward to - Indy's turn as an Agent 47-like man of disguise - is also shown off, with MachineGames letting us see the archaeologist infiltrate areas dressed as a member of the clergy. </p>
<p>And yes, just like Hitman's Agent 47, you can hide bodies by picking them up and moving them out of sight of patrolling guards or whoever else you don't want happening upon your corpse wake.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives us a look at the Great Circle's Adventure Points, which are used to unlock new skills. One such skill is Lucky Hat, which allows our hero an extra chance to come back from a fatal blow. Another, Bear Hands, lets Indy do unarmed takedowns of enemies. Speaking of taking down enemies, Indy can use his gun and whip to get the upper hand, but also items he finds lying around the environment. One moment sees the archaeologist bopping his assailant on the head with a rolling pin.</p><p>On the puzzle side of things, we see Indy pouring out some wine to reveal a number hidden within a basin, and elsewhere bouncing light around a secret room with ancient mirrors. He can use his camera to search for puzzle clues, as well. </p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is set to release across Xbox and PC next month, on 9th December. It will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">arrive on PS5 next year</a>.</p>

<p>Our Ian has been hands on with the upcoming release already. "I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's hands on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p><p>"It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-birthday-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy birthday to us! It’s the first anniversary of Aftermath, and we’re spending a whole week celebrating.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve all learned a hell of a lot in our first year of existence—mostly, that our vision of sustainable journalism and a better internet is actually possible. A year ago, all we had was the hope that there were readers out there who wanted to read the stories we wanted to write, <em>and </em>would support us with a subscription. Today, we have a thriving reader community, a ton of stories we’re proud of, and we’re part of a cohort of reader-supported journalism that’s charting a new course for media and the internet. It’s truly all thanks to you, and we couldn’t be more grateful.</p><p>We’ll be running some special blogs this week that recap our first year and that capture what we think is the spirit of Aftermath. But we also want to make sure as many people as possible are along for the journey.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">So from today through November 29, we’re offering new subscribers a month of Aftermath’s Reader tier for only $1</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-little-puppy-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton and developer Dreamotion have announced&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy</em>, an adorable-looking adventure in which you play a corgi who's waiting to greet their owner in the afterlife. Sniff.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the thesis of&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is that "when a person departs from this world, the dog who went ahead will warmly welcome them". Dreamotion head Lee Joon-young says the game was created "to offer warmth and comfort" to those whose dogs have passed away.</p>

<p><em>My Little Puppy</em>'s little doggo protagonist must set out on a journey across the afterlife to meet their owner, exploring "oceans, deserts, and snowy plains" along the way.</p>

I don't know if I have the emotional strength for this.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll be able to engage in what Dreamotion and Krafton call "interactions based on real dog behaviors", including sniffing other dogs, barking, and, well, just hangin' around as a fluffy lil' dog. What's not to love?</p>

<p>Lest you fear that&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>won't have the kind of gameplay variation to keep you engaged, however, think again. It'll feature "a range of gameplay genres, from adventure to action and racing", according to the two studios.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>right here. Just try to make it through the whole thing without welling up.</p>




<p><em>My Little Puppy&nbsp;</em>is part of a slew of recent games that have you playing as little pet friends.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-creator-next-game-time-to-finish<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toshihiro Nagoshi, the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>franchise (formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Yakuza</em>), has revealed some new tidbits of information regarding his next project, and if you're hoping for something less bloated and overstuffed than many modern games, you may well be in luck.</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-creator-says-his-new-game-will-be-an-action-adventure-with-a-rather-high-age-rating-and-complex-game-system/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), Nagoshi says he wants players to be able to complete his new game in "a sensible amount of time", suggesting that the age of games' size being a selling point "is coming to an end".</p>

<p>Nagoshi says that the amount of games available to gamers right now is "bordering on excessive"; he says there are so many games available now that "you can't play them all", and it's hard to disagree with him on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/toshihiro-nagoshi-yakuza-creator-majima-kiryu.jpg?itok=WLhR55Vs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/toshihiro-nagoshi-yakuza-creator-majima-kiryu.jpg?itok=w7jkD6fF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toshihiro Nagoshi was responsible for creating the&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>(now&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>) franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Nagoshi, his new project will achieve a "high level of expression" in terms of its character drama, and the game will be "large scale", although it seemingly won't take you hundreds of hours to finish.</p>

<p>In fact, Nagoshi says that his team is currently trying to find ways to make the in-game map smaller because it's currently "too large", which is a rather endearing thing to admit.</p>

<p>Although Nagoshi says his game's systems are complex, he also says he intends the game to be played by adults; it'll have a "rather high age rating", according to Nagoshi himself, and it'll espouse a unique worldview that will make people "think 'What's that? I need to see more' when they first see it".</p>

She’s an adult woman, it’s no big deal. But it’s <em>maybe</em> more of an issue when she starts leaving tabs open all over the merch sold to kids. This is what’s happened on the boxes for two <em>Wicked </em>movie tie-in Barbie dolls.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s all thanks to a good-old-fashioned mix-up. Two new Barbie dolls have been released, to coincide with the imminent release of the movie version of hit musical <em>Wicked</em>, based on the characters of Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, and Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West (Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo). Each is released in the traditional cardboard box, and as ever, it’s covered in all sorts of tiny writing almost no one ever reads. However, those who did read the fine print on the new dolls got quite a shock when they followed the URL listed for the products.</p><p>It’s easy to see how the mistake was made. The address on the boxes is “www.wicked.com,” which makes sense, right? Except, that takes you to porn site Wicked, owned by Dutch company Digigamma, a company that says it “specializes in running and managing high risk e-commerce businesses.”</p><p>Presumably the intention had been to point people toward Universal’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.universalpictures.co.uk/micro/wicked" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.wickedmovie.com</a></span>, but someone at Mattel assumed the production company had done a better job of scooping up URLs.</p><p>The Wicked porn site must have already been doing a roaring trade in mistaken traffic, long before the Barbie goof. The musical has been an astonishing hit since 2003, sitting on Broadway and touring worldwide ever since. The movie itself will have added to that, with early word suggesting it’s going to be <em>very</em> good. But Barbie has pushed it into the mainstream, with news sites jumping on the error.<br></p><p>Mattel told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/wicked-dolls-mattel-mistakenly-link-to-adult-porn-site-1236058013/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span> that it “deeply regrets” the incident, and the doll was removed from sale in stores like Target, Walmart and Kohl’s by the end of Sunday, the 10th. They’re also gone from Amazon, although <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mattel-Accessories-Movie-Inspired-Removable-HYM40/dp/B0CMGXW1CV&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mattel-Accessories-Movie-Inspired-Removable-HYM40/dp/B0CMGXW1CV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the UK version of the retailer</a></span> still has listings, albeit with no option to buy.</p><p>Those boxed dolls are going to be worth <em>a fortune</em>.

<p>Xbox has teased that Spyro will be added to Xbox Game Pass in the near future.</p>



<p>The tease came from the official Xbox Game Pass X handle (formerly Twitter), which posted a <a href="https://x.com/XboxGamePass/status/1855973786547601437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">27-second short video</a> on a chest from Spyro. Several minutes after the post, the official Spyro X handle replied with <a href="https://x.com/SpyroTheDragon/status/1855974931156054091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">several eye emojis</a>, suggesting that an announcement was on the horizon.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors surfaced that several Activision games</a>, including Spyro, would be coming to Game Pass, but the exact timeframe could never be determined.</p>



<p>In October, Game Pass saw the addition of Call of Duty to the service, which some analysts believed increased the service’s subscriber count by several million. Now, though, it seems like Xbox and Activision are gearing up for another huge release in the form of your favorite purple dragon.</p>



<p>Activision announced in 2007 that the Spyro The Dragons series sold over 20 million units, but as of September 2023, the Spyro Reignited Trilogy sold over 10 million units across all consoles.</p>



<p>Xbox typically likes to announce and release its Game Pass games on a Thursday, so keep your eyes peeled later this week.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Spyro coming to Game Pass? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-teased-on-base-games-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> studio NEOWIZ announced today that it will publish the debut game of <a href="https://zakazane.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, a Polish indie developer founded a while ago by former CD Projekt RED and 11bit Studios developer Jan Bartkowicz, Piotr Chomiak, Radosław Gwarek, and Marta Sobek. ZAKAZANE had previously raised $1 million in pre-seed investment led by The Games Fund to kickstart the development of their first game, and this partnership is worth another $8 million. ZAKAZANE is currently working on a single player Noir Western RPG set in a&nbsp;remote mining town sheriff must solve a case that threatens to destroy the community.</p>
<p>Jan Bartkowicz, CEO and co-founder of ZAKAZANE, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We found a great understanding of our vision with NEOWIZ, who got excited about our debut title the minute we showed them the demo. In conversations that followed, they never tried to steer us away from our principles but rather to make sure we stick to our guns. It’s clear both sides understand that games can become important to people on a personal level, making them both valuable works of culture and good business.</em></p>
<p>Seung-Cheol Kim, co-CEO at NEOWIZ, stated:</p>
<p><em>NEOWIZ is committed to delivering remarkable, story-driven games that resonate with gamers worldwide, and we're actively searching for talented developers with a passion for well-crafted narratives. When we first met ZAKAZANE, we felt an immediate kinship around their passion for developing projects that profoundly captivate audiences. Their upcoming neo-western RPG will be a key addition to our portfolio and reflects our ambition to build lasting franchises across PC and consoles. Together, we will create a brand that unites quality and storytelling for gamers to cherish for years to come.</em></p>
<p>It's not the first time that the developer of Lies of P has signed a deal with a Polish developer. The same happened a year ago with Blank Studio, another team formed from CD Projekt Red alums. They are making a post-apocalyptic character driven game, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/blank-studio-qa-ex-cd-projekt-red-devs-talk-about-their-post-apocalyptic-character-driven-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our Q&amp;A from June 2023.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-3-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>tinyBuild has officially announced&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>, a third mainline entry in the cult classic horror series, and what's more, it boasts the involvement of the franchise's original creator.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>&nbsp;is officially in development, and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov is heading up "a small team of developers" to help bring to life what tinyBuild calls a game full of "systems-based exploration".</p>

<p>You'll explore the town of Raven Brooks as an outsider, enjoying a "cozy yet eerie adventure" as you get to know the locals and their "distinct personalities, circumstances, and desires". It sort of sounds like the original&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=ipNR9EN1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-yard.jpg?itok=gXxd6hRw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s development process apparently closely mirrors that of the first game.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher promises that you'll be able to "stick to the shadows in a full simulation" in which you can make decisions, and making said decisions can "potentially unleash catastrophic consequences" upon the inhabitants of Raven Brooks.</p>

<p>In the screenshots tinyBuild has released so far, the art style of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>looks like something of a departure from its predecessors, utilizing moodier and more muddy colors, although it's still got the strange, spindly art style you know (and potentially love).</p>

<p>Kolesnikov says he's hoping that early alphas of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be available to try out soon, and that he's excited to "keep the development of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>in an open format", so presumably, we'll be hearing more about how the project is coming along soon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=EhmrSxgg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hello-neighbor-3-announced-original-game.jpg?itok=pEQQNLnK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hello Neighbor 3</em>'s art style looks more realistic and gloomy than that of its predecessors.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>may have that number at the end of its title, it's far from the third&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor&nbsp;</em>game overall.</p>

<p>After the first game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-delayed-to-december-8" rel="nofollow">fully released in late 2017</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hello-neighbor-card-game-lets-you-betray-your-friends" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-engineer-releases-first-on-stadia" rel="nofollow">spinoffs</a> ensued, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hello-neighbor-2-announced" rel="nofollow">full-blooded sequel</a> in the form of&nbsp;<em>Hello Neighbor 2&nbsp;</em>(which began life in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tinybuild-announces-hello-neighbor-spinoff-hello-guest-and-not-e3-event" rel="nofollow">pre-alpha form as&nbsp;<em>Hello Guest</em></a>).</p>

<p><em>Hello Neighbor 3&nbsp;</em>will be released for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, although we don't have a release date for it yet, nor do we know whether it's coming to consoles as well.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/video-game-history-falls-into-place-in-tetris-forever.1032486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For such a simple game, <em>Tetris</em> has a wild history. Developed in the mid-1980s by Alexey Pajitnov in the Soviet Union, <em>Tetris</em>’ global expansion involved a complex web of software copyright, clandestine meetings, handshake deals, and someone stretching a tourist visa to the very limits. It’s a story that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">inspired a feature film</a> — but it might be best explored in <em>Tetris Forever</em>, the latest retro game collection from Digital Eclipse.</p><p>The studio has made a name for itself with its interactive documentary format. The idea is that, instead of just presenting a bunch of games and supplementary material and leaving it to players to sort through it, the collections put everything into a timeline you can explore in chronological order. This structure adds context to the games so that you have an understanding of why they’re important or interesting before you play them. The format has been used to tell <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam">the story of Atari’s first five decades</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">how Jordan Mechner developed <em>Karateka</em></a>.</p><p>It’s also ideally suited for the story of <em>Tetris</em>. Like its past collections, Digital Eclipse uses a combination of short documentary-style videos, photos, magazine and advertising scans, and the games themselves, and puts them on a timeline. In this case, you start out watching interviews with Pajitnov about his early life and how he first came up with and developed the concept for <em>Tetris</em>. Then you can play the very first version, made up of ASCII symbols, which was available on a Soviet computer called the Electronika 60.</p><p>From there, the story expands as various figures swoop in to take <em>Tetris</em> to the rest of the world, including Pajitnov’s lifelong friend Henk Rogers, who has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henk_Rogers">his own fascinating backstory</a>. As with all of its releases, Digital Eclipse expertly weaves these storylines together, showing players the importance of each beat in the history of <em>Tetris</em>. It’s augmented by a few important voices — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047826/tetris-effect-tetsuya-mizuguchi-interview-ps4-vr"><em>Tetris Effect</em> designer Tetsuya Mizuguchi</a> — who explain the game’s cultural impact.</p><p>What also makes it work is that <em>Tetris Forever</em> is just a great collection of <em>Tetris</em> games. It features 18 games, including some that were never widely released. Now, there are some notable omissions, namely the iconic original Game Boy version, but the collection gets around this in a few ways. First off, it includes an incredible array of variants that show the many ways Pajitnov and other designers tried to build on the original concept. (My personal favorite is <em>Magicaliss</em>, which came bundled with <em>Super Tetris 3</em> and adds some clever puzzles and a very metal fantasy theme.) Then there’s an unofficial Game Boy version that looks, sounds, and plays like the original, even if it doesn’t have the actual Nintendo license.</p><p>There’s also a brand-new version of the game called <em>Tetris Time Warp</em>. It starts out like a slick, modern rendition of the game, but every so often will literally warp you back in time briefly, reskinning the game to look like one of the many older variants, and introducing some new challenge that you only have a few moments to complete. Then you’re whisked back to the present. Honestly, I’d buy <em>Tetris Time Warp</em> on its own. But as part of this collection, it’s just an added bonus on top of a great group of classic interpretations.</p><p>For all the ways it has penetrated pop culture, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/31/23663214/best-ways-to-play-tetris-2023">finding a good version of <em>Tetris</em> to play on modern hardware isn’t always simple</a>. For that alone, <em>Tetris Forever</em> is worth the price of admission. But like the rest of Digital Eclipse’s work, it takes things a step further and shows how interactivity is the ideal way to dig into video game history.</p><p><small>Tetris Forever <em>launches on November 12th on PC, Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season 1</a> introduces players to a brand-new 6v6 game mode known as Ransack. It’s an objective-based mode with a unique goal that sees players collecting and protecting loot, and it can be played on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">every 6v6 map in the game</a>, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-maps-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new ones arriving</a> with the first season.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in the full details about Ransack in Black Ops 6, here’s how the mode works.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-does-ransack-work-in-black-ops-6">How does Ransack work in Black Ops 6? </h2>



<p><strong>Ransack sees two teams of 6 fighting to collect gold bars from crates dotted around the map</strong>. Once players have the gold bars, they must transport them back to their team’s stash, which must be protected at all costs. </p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Wildcards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, the enemy team can find and raid your stash, so you’ll need to make sure it’s well-guarded. The team that reaches the score limit or has the most gold bars when the time limit has been reached will win the match.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s important to maintain a balance of attack and defense, as you don’t want to fully focus on one or the other. So, Perks and Scorestreaks that aid your speed and knowledge of the enemy team’s location will be essential, as they’ll allow you to move quickly in either attack or defense and see if the enemies are trying to raid your stash.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-ransack-in-black-ops-6">How to play Ransack in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Ransack will be <strong>available to play just like any other game mode in Black Ops 6 Multiplayer</strong>, and it’s not a limited-time mode. You will be able to select it when you filter the game modes you wish to play when finding a match. When Season 1 drops, it’s also likely that the new mode will have its own playlist too so you can easily find and play it.</p>



<p>This is a completely new game mode for Call of Duty, making its debut in Black Ops 6 Season 1. It seems like a mix between Capture the Flag and Grind, where you had to collect tags and bank them before dropping them upon death.</p>



<p>The new Ransack mode arrives alongside Prophunt and limited-time modes in Season 1. Players are also getting some new maps to sink their teeth into, as well as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge update for Warzone</a>. </p>

<p>Genshin Impact’s update version 5.2, dubbed “Tapestry of Spirit and Flame,” will be released on November 20.</p>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 introduces two new Natlan tribes, the Flower-Feather Clan and Masters of the Night-Wind. The elite warriors of this tribe are Chasca and Ororon, and they can be transformed into Saurian companions for players to move and fight mid-air. At the same time, you get to explore the ancient, ruined city of Ochkanatlan while investigating a mysterious incident in the region as a part of the leading seasonal event of the update.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-take-to-the-skies-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">Take to the Skies in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Two new species of Saurians will arrive with this update, Qucusaurs and Iktomisaurs. The Qucusaurs are known to be the best rides in the Flower-Feather Clan. They have an accelerated guiding mode that allows you to cover a lot of distance. You can also use Phlogiston to gain altitude or perform horizontal rolls in mid-flight.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Iktomisaurs, on the other hand, are known for reaching vertical heights rather than travelling horizontally. At the same time, they have a unique ability to see, which helps them discover hidden objects. The Iktomisaurs are known as the guides of the Master of the Night Wind. They can also draw energy from Phlogiston-infused objects or craft special items from graffiti patterns.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-characters-in-genshin-impact-update-5-2-nbsp">New Characters in Genshin Impact Update 5.2&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact introduces Chasca and Ororon in update 5.2. Chasca is known as the great warrior and peacemaker in the Flower-Feather clan and is a 5-star Anemo bow wielder. The characters use a Soulsniper as their firearm and can float in the air while firing different elemental bullets at enemies. Chasca can also use homing bullets for a lethal strike and restore Phlogiston by eliminating enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ororon, on the other hand, is the four-star Electro bow wielder from Masters of the Night Wind. Brought up by Iktomisaurs, this character also can rise in the air and have a keen sense of perception. Ororon can also enter Spiritspeaker state while charging an aimed shot, which allows the character to extract power from the graffiti and runes in Natlan. Lastly, having him on your team increases your gliding speed, too.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-other-features-and-content">Other Features and Content</h2>



<p>Genshin Impact’s update 5.2 will continue the story with Archon Quest Chapter V: Interlude, “All Fires Fuel the Flame, with Captain and Kansan assisting the tribe to recover from the damage caused by the Abyss. New threats and a boss called “Tenebrous Papilla” can be found in Natlan, and this monster has been powered by absorbing memories from the corrupted Ley Lines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have added the Imaginarium Theater, Serenitea Pot, Artifacts, and other key gadgets with this update.&nbsp;Check out the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/10/20241111-genshinimpact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for complete details.</p>

            <p>It was the 20-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-2">Halo 2</a> at the weekend, which saw the shooter's modern counterparts celebrating with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/halo-2s-lost-e3-2003-demo-will-finally-be-playable-thanks-to-modder-magic">classic multiplayer maps and long-lost levels</a>. But also emerging from the dust of time are insights to the sequel's development back in 2004. Rolling Stone <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-2-bungie-development-1235157887/">interviewed two key designers</a> of the game and made a fun discovery. The Flood (the sickly pale alien infestation that briefly turns Halo into sci-fi horror) was partly inspired by a colourful and innocent children's book about a nice elephant.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Halo and its sequel had a smaller development team than an equivalent blockbuster today might have. This meant some designers would have to do odd jobs outside of their wheelhouse. This is what led Lorraine and Robert McLees, a husband and wife who worked at Bungie during Halo 2's development, to create various things for the game beyond the requirements of their job description. </p>
<p>Although Robert was a weapons designer, for instance, he was also made responsible for coming up with concept art for the Flood. And he particularly remembers creating the infection form of the creature (the little creepy bug-bois that burst and infect their victims with spores).</p>
<p>The first concept "looked like a cross between a house centipede and a blood sausage," he told Rolling Stone. "That was disgusting, but didn’t look very mobile." </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/halo-2-anniversary-20-years-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie / Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Unhappy with the first pass, the artist discovered the perfect shape for the alien creature in time for another attempt. And it turned out to be an image that had been "skittering around in the shadowy parts of my brain" since childhood.</p><p>“When my daughter was born, I gathered up all those Golden Key books I remembered from my own childhood so I could read to her before she went to sleep at night. And there it was, in <a href="https://littlegoldenbooks.fandom.com/wiki/The_Saggy_Baggy_Elephant">The Saggy Baggy Elephant</a>, a palm tree launched into the air by dancing elephants — the weird shape that had been haunting my subconscious mind for thirty-odd years. That was the basis for the Flood Infection Form.”</p>
<p>You can see the exact palm tree he mentions in <a href="https://youtu.be/LrxiNYuqcKI?feature=shared&amp;t=16">this YouTube reading of the book</a>. And sure enough, the tree's roots do evoke the unmistakable tendril legs of a Flood critter. The trunk also looks a lot like that ugly conical appendage that crowns the alien larva's head. So I guess we all need to thank children's illustrator Gustaf Tenggren for inspiring a horrifying monster. Neat.</p>
<p>The interview is interesting reading if you're a Halo head. The two designers talk openly about how crunch at the studio affected their life, even as they dealt with a newborn baby. Lorraine, who was responsible for the game's cover art, was also the person who designed the Pillar Of Autumn, the human spaceship from the first Halo. That's cool. If I am ever asked to imagine "human military spaceship", to this day I would instantly summon that vessel to mind.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>A lot of the crunch suffered by Bungie devs is well-documented already. One engineer at the studio said the brutal environment <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/bungies-13-year-battle-to-kill-crunch-culture">"almost killed Bungie as a company."</a> Another lead engineer, Chris Butcher, once told our sister site Eurogamer that they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-recalls-brutal-halo-2-crunch">worked seven day weeks</a> for months on end. Or as he put it:</p>
<blockquote>"The crunch on Halo 2 was, 'Oh my god, we're f***ed. We're all going to die.' Months and months of that emotional, negative tone was really hard to deal with - but at the same time, we did a lot of awesome work."</blockquote>
<p>The Rolling Stone interview basically confirms a lot of that history. </p>
<p>"Bungie, up to then, never had good managers,” said Robert McLees. “They had creatives that were forced into managerial roles while still remaining in their creative roles — basically working two jobs. This kinda worked when there were 12 of us. It worked less well when there were 30 of us. It collapsed when there were 60 of us.”</p>
<p>"At the time, we really didn’t know what was going to happen," added Lorraine. "If we were going to make it or not. It was the make-it-or-break-it period for the young Bungie crew. So much burn-out.”</p>
<p>Crunch continues to be a problem for game developers today. The management of the studio working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-citizen">Star Citizen</a> recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cloud-imperium-quietly-steal-star-citizen-developers-weekends-from-under-them-with-mandated-overtime-in-the-lead-up-to-citizencon">imposed a mandatory seven-day week on its employees</a>, for example. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo IV</a> workers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-developers-allege-mismanagement-crunch-and-disturbing-creative-decisions-in-new-report">also complained about unsustainable work demands</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation, recently confirmed that they have 26 games actively in development.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameWatch</a> (via <a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/1637630.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kadokawa Corporation confirmed these games during their latest earnings report. Out of the 26 titles, 20 are being developed for consoles, and the other six are being created for mobile. FromSoftware, Spike Chunsoft, Gotcha Gotcha Games, Acquire, VIC GAME STUDIOS, and more will develop these games. Acquire from the Tenchu series was acquired by Kadokawa in December 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>FromSoftware has several anticipated games on the horizon. Popular franchises like Armored Core and Dark Souls already have multiple instalments, so fans can expect new entries in these series. Additionally, FromSoftware may develop new sequels for titles like Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice and Elden Ring. Moreover, there is a possibility of receiving remasters or remakes of some of their classic games.</p>



<p>In other news, FromSoftware recently increased their base salaries <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-increasing-salaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by 11.8% and offered more to new graduates</a>. Also, I learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-final-boss-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC saved the Kadokawa corporation</a> from cyberattack losses. What are your thoughts on FromSoftware, the parent company confirming 20 console games?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>Arcane Season 2 is the most popular show on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> right now, not just in the UK or US, but across 60+ countries worldwide.</p>
<p>As detailed by data collated by <a href="https://flixpatrol.com/title/arcane/">FlixPatrol</a> - official figures will likely come from Netflix later this week - Arcane leads the pack by a considerable margin and is presently number one on the streaming platform in 65 different countries.</p>

<p>This is great news for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off given both seasons of Arcane cost a total of approximately $250m USD to create and promote, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-spin-off-arcane-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-report-says">making it the most expensive animated series of all time</a>.</p>
<p>The show's first nine episodes are said to have seen a production cost "north of $80m", while the second set of nine episodes - which will make up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">the show's final season</a> - reportedly had a production cost "approaching" the $100m mark.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen how the rest of the series will fare - right now, just three of the nine episodes are available to view. Episodes four, five and six will debut on 16th November, and the final three on 23rd, bringing the hit show to a close.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-2-review">Eurogamer's Arcane Season 2 review</a>, which earned a respectable four out of five stars, Chris T. said, "Some iffy pacing moments aside, Arcane's second and final season truly puts the money on screen. This is a striking, emotionally wrought, hard-punching climax."</p>
<p>Not all game TV and movie adaptations see the same success, of course, although Lara Croft fans were delighted to learn that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-animated-tomb-raider-series-is-returning-for-season-2-and-laras-teaming-up-with-an-old-pal">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft Netflix show was coming back for a second season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Combining classic and modern game design sensitivity and featuring a world created in collaboration with Chris Avellone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alaloth-champions-of-the-four-kingdoms-preview-tradition-and-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms</a> looked, right from its reveal, as a game that could bring a welcome breath of fresh air for top-down role-playing games. The most intriguing feature of the role-playing game by Gamera Interactive is definitely its combat system inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series, but labeling the game as a simple isometric Soul would be a disservice, as it has a lot to offer besides its involving combat system which comes together really well, despite some issues here and there that have a slight impact on the experience as a whole.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241029225501_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms is set on Plamen, a continent where four kingdoms have prospered since ancient times. At some point, however, the harmony of the continent was broken by the demon Alaloth, who managed to defeat the many gods worshipped by the people of the four kingdoms that were constantly at odds with one another and establish his dominion on Plamen with a fifth kingdom. Centuries after Alaloth started sowing chaos on Plamen, the people of the four kingdoms have had enough of the demon and elected their champions to recover the Light of Vaizmil to get access to the fifth kingdom and send back Alaloth from whence it came.</p>
<p>The story overview above barely skims the surface of what Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms offers in terms of story, lore, and worldbuilding. It is one of the very few games I've played that makes its world feel as big and alive as it should be, featuring countless locations, including cities, towns, and other points of interest for each kingdom. Inside each of these locations, players can find additional information on the world's history, its happenings, internal strife, and so on. These are not superficial events that are just skimmed over but feature a certain level of complexity that makes them feel like they belong in a fantasy novel.</p>
<p>The presence of different companions, all with their own plight and dedicated storyline, also adds a touch of more personal involvement that the story at large seems to be lacking a bit at times, but even so, for those who love the fantasy genre, Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms has a lot for them to delve into. The world is so big and with so many permutations depending on the race and alignment of the champion, that a single playthrough is not enough to experience everything it has to offer.</p>
<p>While the story is clearly inspired by Tolkien's masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, the lore of D&amp;D's Forgotten Realms, and so on, Alaloth: Champion of the Four Kingdoms shows the developer's attitude of innovation within tradition in the gameplay even before the actual campaign begins. Besides a straightforward main campaign with optional local co-op, the game also features an extremely interesting Competitive Campaign that pits the player's champion against those of the other kingdoms, challenging the player to reach the fifth kingdom and destroy Alaloth before any other champion does. This mode, needless to say, is not exactly suited for the first playthrough, given the complexity of the experience and the need to be always on point to stay ahead of the competition. Still, it is a very clever way to up the challenge level after the game's mechanics have been mastered.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241030113639_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned above, Alaloth: Champion of the Four Kingdom is all about innovating within a traditional framework. After creating your champion in proper RPG fashion, picking the race between human, elf, dwarf, and orc, choosing a god for some additional benefits, and picking a weapon, which in no way restricts what the character can wield during the course of the adventure, you are given your mission to destroy Alaloth, which involves recovering the Light of Vaizmil and complete a few more tasks. How you go on about doing so, it's all up to you.</p>
<p>You can focus on exploring the game's many beautiful locations rendered in a visual style that is extremely close to classic cRPGs like the original Baldur's Gate, help NPCs with their woes and get fully involved in the story of the four kingdoms, or you can play the game as if it were Diablo, focusing only on clearing the Fighting Areas, the game's actual dungeons, gather loot and enhance your character as it levels up by increasing stats, learning perks and a variety of skills ranging from weapon-specific skills for all weapon types and elemental spells. While playing the game as if it were Diablo may not be the best way to go, as you would miss much of the game's story and worldbuilding, it is absolutely viable and enjoyable, mostly thanks to the game's combat system, which takes more than a few pages from the Souls series book.</p>
<p>The combat system of Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms is both one of its best features and the one feature that somewhat drags the experience down, depending on how the player tackles the experience. Gamera Interactive undoubtedly did a solid job bringing the mechanics that make Soulslike combat what it is, such as stamina management, positioning, weight, and commitment to performed moves, but, in my opinion, fell into the same trappings most development teams that aren't FromSoftware do. Right from going into the very first Fighting Area, it's clear how this combat system doesn't suit the game's encounter design very much when playing solo. The Soulslike combat system is mostly meant for duels or fights against small groups of enemies, and not the hordes of mobs that are often encountered all over Plamen, which force the player to learn a crowd control skill as quickly as possible or enlist the help of companions. Even so, the game's encounter design often forces a hit-and-run fighting style that becomes stale as the adventure proceeds. When fighting single or only a couple of enemies, however, the combat system truly shines, featuring a rewarding parry system and movesets for each weapon type that feels weighty and impactful, forcing players to balance offense and defense to make it out of a Fighting Area alive.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the combat mechanics don't get too much time to shine, even not counting enemy groups being too big for Soulslike combat, due to the game's current balance. A strength dual-wielding build, for example, works so well that there's, in my opinion, no reason to try other builds if not for variation. Some skills are also way more useful than others, mostly due to the long recovery time of the champion and the short recovery time on hit from enemies, which further limits the viability of several builds. The developer, however, is working on balancing mobs' stats and other aspects of the combat system for the soon-to-be-released 1.0 version and beyond, so there's a good chance that all that I talked about above won't be an issue in the game's future versions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241031140255_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides combat mechanics, which are still solid enough and will likely get their time to shine with upcoming changes, Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms features a lot of interesting mechanics. Character progression, for example, is not tied to experience points like in the vast majority of RPGs, as the champion level increases after completing a Fighting Area. At every level up, it is possible to either increase one of the core stats, invest Legacy points in Proficiencies or Talents, or learn weapon skills and elemental spells, depending on the current level attained. As champions can only level up to level 20 (a clear nod to Dungeons &amp; Dragons) and there are a limited number of Stat, Legacy, and Talent points to allocate, players need to make choices when building their champion. Thankfully, respeccing is pretty easy, so there's no need to create an entirely new character to test out different builds unless one wants to try out another race.</p>
<p>Traversal is also handheld in a very interesting way. While towns, points of interest, and dungeons, which also feature plenty of varied designs and even simple puzzles that prevent them from becoming stale, are explored in a classic top-down view, traveling over the continent requires the players to move the champion on a huge map complete with roads, rivers, lakes, forests, mountains, and so on that can impact travel speed. On roads, for example, the path to one location may be longer, but travel speed is faster, and there's less chance of getting attacked by a random enemy. Traveling through forests could save you some time but also exposes your champion to danger and could make you waste precious time to defeat Alaloth as well since getting defeated not only transfers your champion to the nearest shrine but also reduces the durability of all your item and disperses your gathered artifacts in nearby dungeons, forcing you to complete them to recover them even if they have already been cleared.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/20241101110839_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking about items, Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms features plenty of loot divided into different rarity tiers and a crafting system that allows the Champion to create all sorts of items, from food to potions and gear. In the game's current version, the November 6th version that is still the latest at the time of writing, it is quite inconvenient to take advantage of crafting since you need need to have the materials for making potions, cooking meals, or creating items in your inventory, which can be a problem at the beginning of the adventure when your carry limit is low, but the developer is addressing this issue, alongside others, with a soon-to-be-released patch, so this won't be a problem for players who will jump into the game when the game officially launches later this month.</p>
<p>One of the things that Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms does right is its visuals, which were clearly inspired, as much of the rest of the experience, by classic top-down role-playing games. This choice definitely paid off, allowing the developer to create tons of nicely designed locations that have a distinct identity while looking great. Character models are far from great, honestly, but the top-down camera is zoomed out far enough that they look decent enough as they traverse the many locations the game features on the continent.</p>
<p>These undemanding visuals also ensure Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms can run well on any relatively modern system. At 4K resolution, in a benchmarking session featuring exploration and combat of multiple towns and Fighting Areas, the game ran at an average of 310 FPS, 27 FPS 1% Low, which was caused by the menus being capped at 30 FPS. Given the type of visuals, the game doesn't feature any graphics options outside of resolution and frame rate cap, so there's not a lot to tweak if the game doesn't run well, which I don't expect will happen even on very dated system configurations.</p>
<p>While I may have sounded a little negative when talking about combat and current balancing, I have enjoyed Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms quite a bit for how it blends together rather well mechanics lifted from other RPGs while giving them a personable spin. With just a few tweaks, some of them actually coming in future patches, the experience will become even better, reach a much bigger audience than it had during its Early Access phase, and possibly pay back the development team for all the issues they had to face to get their game out.</p>

<p>Alaloth: Champions of the Four Kingdoms is one of the most intriguing role-playing games released in recent years. While some design choices, such as the Soulslike combat system that doesn't work too well with Diablolike enemy encounters in the current version of the game, impact the experience, Gamera Interactive blended elements of both traditional and modern RPGs rather well, creating an experience that is more than worthy of any RPG fan's time.</p>

			<p>Being a recent game, there won't be any need for an Elden Ring remaster anytime soon, but this isn't stopping fans from attempting to develop so using the latest technology and game engines.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Konariin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Konarlin</a> shared a video showcasing an impressive Unreal Engine 5-powered fan-made recreation of the popular action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware, going over the process from concept to actual creation, which looks better than the original game thanks to higher quality textures and more. The end results are extremely impressive, even more so considering this is a fan-made solo project developed in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="I copied Miyazaki to remake Elden Ring… in Unreal Engine 5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/atFn2E1anrg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Despite being far from the best-looking open-world action role-playing game released in recent times, Elden Ring is a game that is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">more than worthy of anyone's time</a>, thanks to a masterfully crafted experience that is the natural evolution of the Souls series formula introduced by Demon's Souls so many years ago. This formula was further refined in the massive Shadows of the Erdtree expansion released earlier this year. You can learn more about one of the best expansions ever released by the Japanese studio in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p>Elden Ring and its Shadow of the Erdtree expansion are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rps-100">RPS 100</a> is our list of the best games to play on PC. It encompasses the full breadth and width of PC gaming stretching back to 1873, but focuses solely on those games that remain great to play today. It's updated yearly by our crack team of writers, and the first half of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">2024 edition is live now</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You might note that the format has changed this year. Instead of a long article to scroll through, the list is presented as a sortable, filterable list of game covers, and you can click on each cover to read the RPS team's  evangelism for that game. We hope that it's a pleasant browsing experience.
</p>
<p>Favouring games that are great to play today means that we've paid no mind to importance or influence, but it doesn't mean we've ignored older games, and you'll find plenty of older classics on the list. We've also made a conscious effort to encapsulate the diversity of experiences available on PC. For a start, that means that all games playable on PC are PC games, no matter where they were first released or what extra peripherals (such as VR headsets) they may require. It also means we've made difficult choices and not simply filled the list with excellent-but-similar sequels from beloved series, except in instances where those games feel significantly different from one another.
</p>
<p>You might, as you browse our selection, wonder when you'll reach the bar charts, diagrams and decimal points which explain the cold mathematical logic of our selections. These things are not present in our list. The RPS100 is a work of human beings, for human beings, and as such has been constructed using the twin blades of subjectivity and taste. We think we have pretty great taste and the expertise to explain ourselves, so if you would like to know how wet a game is, how fungible or how zealous, we have explained our opinions under each game when relevant.</p><p>The second half of the list will go live at noon tomorrow. Don't see your favourite game on there when the list is done? There are too many great PC games for us to include them all, but there are comments below the list where you can share your own great taste and bask in the evangelism of your fellow readers. 
</p>
<p>Go, read, and whether you agree with us or not, we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">hope you enjoy this year's RPS 100</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> creator Warren Spector reckons "if someone made Deus Ex today", the cyberpunk role-playing game "might be perceived as a documentary", given its themes of a dystopian world and evil factions competing to control it.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/deus-ex-director-warren-spector-thinks-that-if-someone-made-deus-ex-today-it-might-be-perceived-as-a-documentary-so-if-he-made-a-new-one-it-would-be-pretty-different/">PC Gamer</a>, Spector reflected on how the world - and game design - has changed in the 25 years since Deus Ex first debuted, adding "I wouldn't make Deus Ex again as it was in 2000 when it could be read as a believable fantasy".</p>

<p>"Y2K was around the corner, AI was becoming a thing, conspiracies were everywhere, terrorism was on the rise, bioengineering was in its infancy, techno-augmentation was in the works," Spector said, talking about how he leaned into real-life issues rather than "trying to convince people to be interested in something" more fantastical.</p>
<p>"All that stuff was floating around in the zeitgeist. Making a game about it was an obvious thing to do."</p>
<p>If he returned to the series now, however, Spector says he'd like to examine "other concerns that would be more relevant, more pressing, more worthy of exploration".</p>
<p>Spector also commented on Embracer's decision to cancel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-in-development-for-two-years">Eidos Montreal's new Deus Ex game</a> earlier this year, putting almost a hundred people out of work.</p>
<p>The project had been in development at Eidos Montreal for around two years, following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">acquisition by Embracer in 2022</a>. The decision to call an end to this project was part of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-confirms-900-employees-laid-off-in-previous-financial-quarter">Swedish conglomerate's ruthless restructuring</a> and cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>"I really have no idea why Embracer would abandon the Deus Ex franchise, at least for now," Spector said. "From my perspective, the gameplay approach is still relevant, but the world and situation needs some updating."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Spector - who also created Epic Mickey - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-mickey-3-currently-impossible-warren-spector-says">said he was unavailable to work on a third game in the series</a>, despite the announcement it was being revived.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A Monster Hunter Wilds open beta comparison video was shared online, highlighting how much the PlayStation 5 Pro can brute force better performance in unpatched titles.</p>
<p>The comparison, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ElAnalistaDeBits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ElAnalistaDeBits</a>, also confirmed the target resolution and performance on each system. On Xbox Series S, the beta featured a single display mode targeting 1080p resolution, which ran at an average of 40 frames per second; on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, the beta targeted 1080p resolution and ran at an average of 50 FPS in Performance Mode, 2160p resolution running at an average 50 FPS in Resolution Mode. Without a dedicated patch, the Monster Hunter Wilds beta targeted similar resolutions on PlayStation 5 Pro but ran better than on the base model, at an average of 45 FPS in Resolution Mode and 65 FPS in Performance Mode, reaching even 80 FPS in certain scenarios, but sometimes dipping below 60 FPS, which is to be expected for an unoptimized beta. Much like on PC, performance on consoles was very unstable in all display modes, and the reduction in texture, terrain detail, lighting, and draw distance in Performance Mode wasn't enough to achieve the stable 60 FPS a game like this requires.</p>

<p>Being an open beta likely based on an old build, there's a very good chance Monster Hunter Wilds will run much better at launch. Besides the hopeful performance optimization and improvements, the game's launch version should offer quite a bit for hunters to sink their teeth into, as revealed by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-unrevealed-monsters/">datamined information.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th worldwide.</p>
