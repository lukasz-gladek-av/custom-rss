            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-010e<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grinding Gear Games has released&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile&nbsp;</em><em>2&nbsp;</em>update 0.1.0e, and it's designed to introduce several oft-requested quality-of-life features to the action RPG, including checkpoint fast travel and more.</p>

<p>The update introduces the ability to travel between an area's checkpoints, and more checkpoints have also been added to areas "generally at all the entrances and exits", so traveling around an area should be a little less painful now.</p>

<p>On the whole, this update is focused on adding lots of little changes to make your&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>experience smoother, rather than one or two bigger additions. It's all in keeping with the promise made by Grinding Gear last week to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access" rel="nofollow">address user feedback and implement changes</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=-Cr6spvP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-update-0.1.0e-forest.jpg?itok=8tSksYdi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update adds a ton of quality-of-life features.</figcaption></figure><p>Various changes have been made to&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s endgame content as well, and its monster balance has also been addressed. Monsters will now deal 40% less bonus damage from critical strikes, for instance, while higher-tier maps no longer have extra elemental resistance penalties.</p>

<p>You'll also find a ton of changes to individual classes and skills, with lots of abilities' damage values and effects being changed to improve the difficulty curve.</p>

<p>There are far too many tweaks in update 0.1.0e to list here, but you can check out the full&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3645467" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> if you want to read everything that's new. If you're a buildcraft hound, I'd recommend doing so.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>, it's an action RPG that serves as a followup to 2013's popular&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. Originally planned as a major expansion of the original game, it was instead <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-will-be-standalone-game-closed-beta-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">revealed to be a full sequel in July last year</a>.</p>




<p>The sequel released in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">earlier this month</a>, proving so popular that its developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">expressed concern</a> regarding whether or not the game's servers would be able to hold up. Luckily, it seems those issues didn't manifest to any significant degree at launch.</p>

            <p>Will Wright, creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> and co-founder of its developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/maxis">Maxis</a>, has shared fresh details of his forthcoming AI life sim, Proxi.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spore-and-sims-creator-will-wright-unveils-proxi">first announced back in 2018</a> and a gameplay trailer was shared a month ago by its developer Gallium Studio to explain its concept. Then yesterday, Wright appeared on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> to discuss development of the game (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/the-sims-designer-will-wright-is-making-his-next-life-sim-more-personal-by-building-it-with-your-actual-memories-no-game-designer-has-ever-gone-wrong-by-overestimating-the-narcissism-of-their-players/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>Proxi is a dreamlike life sim where players seemingly train an AI to create worlds from their memories. Players record a memory through text, known as a "mem", which the game interprets and forms into an animated scene using assets created by the developers (and eventually players too).</p>

<p>These scenes can then be edited by players to tweak the details. Then players "train your Proxi's mind with each new memory" by placing them on a memory timeline and mindmap to create connections.</p>
<p>Players also place these memories into a private mind-world made of terraformable hexagons, while sentiment analysis will alter the world according to the emotions of memories placed within. Shared worlds will also be possible, constructed with others.</p>
<p>The trailer shows players can add Proxies of friends and family to their world, play games together, and export them to other worlds - Minecraft and Roblox are used as examples.</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2329386880">BreakthroughT1D Twitch stream</a>, Wright explained why he wanted to use the real memories of players for a personal experience.</p>
<p>"I found myself getting continuously closer and closer to the player," he said. "Kind of a saying I've lived by, which is that no game designer has ever gone wrong by overestimating the narcissism of their players."</p>
<p>He laughed: "It goes to figure that the more I can make a game about you, the more you'll like it."</p>
<p>BreakthroughT1D is a global organisation funding research into type one diabetes, with a Twitch channel of talk shows and podcasts. The stream was hosted by Simmers Arielehm and Emily Morganti.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.galliumstudios.com/">studio website</a> states Proxi is coming soon and doesn't list platforms.</p>
<p>Wright appears keen for Proxi to explore the varying perceptions and philosophy of memory. It certainly seems like a powerful tool and a clever concept, though six years after its initial reveal the perception of AI has drastically changed. I suspect Gallium Studio has an uphill battle explaining Proxi in full.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/game-of-the-year-2024-best-remake-or-remaster/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s that time of year again where we take a little break from endlessly looking forward to the Next Big Thing, and instead look in the rear view mirror at all of the Next Big Things that came out over the past twelve months. That’s right, it’s time for our Game of the Year 2024 awards to get started.</p>
<p>But we’re going to start things off once again by looking even further back into the past. Kind of. Best Remake or Remaster has become one of the most over-stuffed categories we have, with developers and publishers keen to make the most of what they already have.&nbsp;Some remasters are slavishly faithful on a technical level, some remakes are ambitious reimaginings, others are quick and breezy ports for newer systems.</p>
<p>What stood out most for us this year?</p>

<p>The Persona franchise is well known as a Japanese school life simulator with surprisingly dark undertones, and Persona 3 was quite possibly the darkest of the lot, with death, sacrifice and the cost of victory being front and centre. Even your attack in this turn-based RPG involves putting a gun to your head and pulling the trigger.</p>

<p>Faced with mortal peril, your resolve to live and fight bursts forth as your Persona — your ‘other self’ that wields arcane power — to fight the baddies and save the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a> takes this fan-favourite and improves almost every aspect of it, reviving and revamping it for modern consoles and modern players. The remastered music is incredible. The visuals (including the obligatory anime sections) are absolutely stunning, and the gameplay takes the lessons learned in the past few releases and applies them here as well.</p>
<p>Persona 3 Reload is a stunningly good game. It will make you laugh, it will make you choke up and it will stick in your head for years to come. If you’ve enjoyed other Atlus games, you will absolutely love this.</p>
<p><em>– Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Silent Hill 2 – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Bloober Team had some convincing to do with their remake of the classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a>, but any concerns proved to be unfounded once we got our hands on the finished game. Bloober took everything that made the original such a historic title and updated it for a contemporary audience, beefing up the combat, the exploration, and obviously taking full advantage of the technological developments since the original released.</p>
<p>The end result is a game that feels like Silent Hill 2 but the way that you remember it rather than through nostalgic rose-tinted glasses. Incredible graphics bring the town to brutal, foggy life whilst the voice acting is genuinely superb. All of this excellent presentation is topped off by some of the best audio design I’ve heard in years and another fantastic soundtrack by series stalwart Akira Yamaoka. The remake is so polished and brings out the best of a game that was already a genre classic, leaving us wondering only one thing – when will they remake the first Silent Hill?</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Sonic X Shadow Generations – Runner Up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review/">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> isn’t just a remaster, there’s also a whole new game bolted in alongside the 13 year old platformer, giving the dark and moody Shadow the Hedgehog the Generations treatment and taking a trip through his past as well.</p>
<p>Sonic Generations is still one of the best Sonic games in recent memory, but Shadow Generations adds an extra layer of refinement and polish that help to tip it over the edge, particularly with improvements to level design and with Shadow’s own abilities – slowing down time is always cool in games, even when you’re a broody hedgehog. Speaking of which, you can have Keanu Reeves voicing Shadow in it courtesy of a tie-in DLC with release of the latest Sonic movie.</p>
<p>Yes, really.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-models-textures-couldnt-processed-playstation-5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC release of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will allow the game to shine, and some of its visual settings and features will scale beyond what was possible on PlayStation 5 with the appropriate hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games</a> regarding the game as a whole and its PC release coming next month, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the lighting rendering has been greatly adjusted for the PC version of the game, addressing one of the most common complaints about the PlayStation 5 release. In addition, the game will feature even richer 3D models and texture resolutions on high-end hardware that couldn't be processed on PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth on PC will also feature, as confirmed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/">reveal trailer</a>, NVIDIA DLSS, and VRR support, alongside graphical presets perfect for those who do not want to tinkle with graphics settings too much. Further granular options will also be available, so the PC version of the second entry in the series should have way more options than those offered in the disappointing PC port of Final Fantasy VII Remake.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director also commented on mods, saying that the game won't have official mod support but that the development team welcomes user modifications, except for inappropriate mods, which the director asks modders not to make. Seeing how it went with Final Fantasy XVI, however, Hamaguchi-san shouldn't get his hopes up.</p>
<p>Unlike Final Fantasy XVI, whose additional PC features eventually made their way onto the PS5 release, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will not launch with anything of the sort, although the team did have to resist the urge to add new content. Originally, they wanted to add an episodic story as a new DLC, but ultimately decided that finishing the final game in the trilogy was the highest priority, also considering limited resources. However, if the team receives strong requests from players after the PC release regarding certain matters, most likely including the additional story DLC, they would like to consider them, so there's still the possibility of maybe being able to see Cid or Vincent in action before the launch of the third part of the remake, as was done with Yuffie with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">INTERmission DLC</a>, which turned out great.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5. The game launches on PC on January 23rd.</p>

Original developer Guerrilla Games has its hands full with the Horizon Online project and the inevitable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">Horizon 3</a>, so any new game would probably have to come from another developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Fists up, a big fighting game mod is due out this weekend. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</a> came out in 2017 and got some flak for its plastic figurine art style. But this year a modder <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-modder-is-beautifying-marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-with-cel-shaded-visuals">began work on an overhaul</a> that would grant the game pretty cel-shaded visuals. Since then the modding team has grown to 40 people and the scope of the mod's features has ballooned. It's now going to include new moves, stages, costumes, and a chaotic-looking 2v2 multiplayer tag team mode. All good news for biff 'em up sickos, as the mod is due to release on Friday. </p>

<p>They're calling the mod "Marvel Vs Capcom Infinite And Beyond". Worth noting that Buzz Lightyear is not a character within either universe but we'll let that go. The trailer above shows off a lot of thick black outlines, halftone effects, and a flash of Venom as he dons a cute baby blue symbiote. You can also catch a glimpse of an alternate costume for Spider-Man - the get-up of British quipster Spider-Punk, who appeared in the most recent animated webslinger flick Spider-Man: Across the Spiderverse. Cool.</p>
<p>We spy some of those new arenas too, which we're told are "nods" to stages previously used in the series. I don't play a whole heap of MvC, so I only recognise the wireframe training room from Street Fighter. Please don't take my biff 'em up badge. I worked so hard for it.</p><p>You'll be able to grab the mod on <a href="https://www.mvcib.com/">the team's website</a> when it launches on December 20th, the creators say. "This was a labor of love from nearly 40 people over 8 months of work," said Maximillian Dood, a streamer who commissioned the principal modder to continue work on the mod after <a href="https://x.com/maximilian_/status/1785829442780274830">catching wind of it back in May</a>.</p>
<p>So there you go. It's a neat overhaul. The cel-shaded style is used well to evoke manga and anime in the Arc System Works fighting games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>, so it makes perfect sense to me that an MvC game would look swish when done in a similar style.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Helldivers 2 has just released their first official crossover with none other than Killzone 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 collaboration is <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1869324489391268335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">now live</a>, bringing some uniquely-themed cosmetics to the Superstore for players to grab. Apart from the new cosmetics, players also have the chance to receive an additional Killzone 2 reward, depending on their success with the ongoing Galatic War. Check out all the new Helldivers 2 x Killzone 2 cosmetics below.&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>AC-1 Dutiful (Armor Set)</li>



<li>StA-52 Assault Rifle (Primary Weapon)</li>



<li>Strength In Our Arms (Player Banner)</li>



<li>Strength In Our Arms (Cape)&nbsp;</li>



<li>Assault Infantry (Player Title)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Apart from the Helldivers 2 x Killzone collaboration, Arrowhead has provided some new details about the Superstore. Player feedback has made them realise that “items are in rotation for too short a time”. Hence, the developers will temporarily test longer rotations, with Killzone cosmetics sticking around for 5 days per page.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The collaboration with Killzone 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killzone-helldivers-warbond-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked a few days ago</a>; however, at the time, it was believed that two Armour Sets would make their way to the Superstore. In other news, check out Helldivers 2’s latest major update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-announced-and-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omens of Tyranny</a>.&nbsp;</p>

It shares a similar over-the-shoulder look to Mass Effect, with a special "celestial tech" granting you the ability to freeze enemies, before shattering them into shards of charcoal. There's a pretty planet covered in sickly fog and a fight with an armoured space bear. The key to beating the bear is to bash it in the head. There is also an inquisitive frog in a vat of water, as well as a larger frog who is more menacing.</p><p>On a more serious note, this "celestial tech" seems to be the crux of the combat. Allowing you to turn your arm into a temporary energy blade, while your offhand provides the grappling hook goodness to flank or reposition. The protag's gun also morphs, transforming from a shotgun in the first bit, into a grenade launcher later and rifle later on. I'm unsure how exactly your pals help you out in the more explosive moments or whether you can direct them, as they're not really the focal point of this trailer. You do see them do a bit of shooting and a bit of stealthing, though.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a sense for the writing off only the shortest snippets, but from a general vibe sort of view, I think it looks like a 7/10 special. Not that this is a bad thing at all! 7/10 games are some of the very best, in my opinion.</p>
<p>There's no release date on Exodus yet, but you can follow the game over on its <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US">official site</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After much teasing, the vicious tyrants of Arrowhead Games and their noxious puppets, the "democratic government" of Super Earth, have announced the very first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> licensed crossover. In yet another hollow display of solidarity in the name of "Liber-tea", they've teamed up with the loathsome fascists of Killzone, the elderly shooter series from Sony and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>From today, you'll be able to buy weapons, armour and cosmetics belonging to Killzone's despicable stormtroopers from the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> Superstore, and there's the suggestion of an additional Killzone-themed reward depending on the fortunes of the so-called Galactic War, a xenocidal bloodbath couched as an exercise in bringing "freedom" to the huddled masses of the upstanding socialist Automatons, the blameless wildlife of the Tyranids, and the Wellsian cosplayers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-update-adds-the-dreaded-illuminate-faction-plus-city-maps-and-bouncy-jeeps">the recently added Illuminate faction</a>.</p>
<p>We here at Rock Paper Shotgun stand against Super Earth and Arrowhead's wanton aggression, which absolutely isn't a big satirical joke based on some Verhoeven film or other. Anyway, those capes. Find an image and further details below.

If you've not played Killzone, it used to be Sony's silver bullet in the battle against Halo, Gears and Call of Duty for control of shooterdom. It's a natural choice of licensing partner for Helldivers, being a series about a pseudo-World-War clash between intergalactic space empires, one of which was briefly ruled by Logan Roy. 
</p><p>
I was nuts about Killzone 2, which released in 2009 and was one of the first "big" games I ever reviewed. It was notorious for an E3 2005 trailer featuring pre-rendered footage made to look like real-time gameplay. In practice, it proved to be perfectly OK FPS with thunderous grimdark set-dressing and a mildly confuzzling first-person cover system. The mainline sequels Killzone 3 and Shadowfall are straightforward examples of the law of diminishing returns, with spin-offs Mercenary and Liberation being respectable handheld shooters. They're all exclusive to Sony consoles, so this Helldivers 2 crossover is, I guess, Killzone's formal debut on PC. Hmm, I should put that in the headline.
</p>
<p>
The Helldivers X Killzone goodies form "a new tier of special Premium content" on the Superstore. There's been some blowback from the diver community about both the pricing and the fact of selling primary weapons as DLC. The second part of the crossover deal arrives on 23rd December, and then there are those hints in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491">the Steam announcement blog</a> about "an additional Killzone 2 reward for all Helldivers depending on your success in the Galactic War". 
</p>
<p>
Arrowhead have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-boss-would-love-to-do-a-take-on-star-wars-predator-and-warhammer-40000">any number of crossover collaborations</a> in mind for Helldivers 2. For a time, they envisaged a system that would effectively let individual Helldivers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-devs-once-planned-a-licensed-cosmetic-system-that-basically-let-you-hallucinate-a-different-world">hallucinate licensed worlds</a>, with map cosmetics that are invisible to their non-buyer comrades. I'm not wildly excited to see Killzone's militaristic trappings in action once again, but one Killgadget I'd love Helldivers 2 to implement is Killzone 2's open-roofed infantry dropships. Check them out in the aforesaid E3 2005 trailer, below. Now, imagine riding one of those to the surface of Vindemaitarix Prime.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has received its first ever crossover DLC, adding <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-2">Killzone 2</a> cosmetics.</p>
<p>The crossover is part of a new tier of special Premium content, a post from developer Arrowhead reads, suggesting more collaborations will be on the way.</p>
<p>"We decided a long time ago to do crossovers only if and when they make perfect sense for the game," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750491?sf275819234=1">Steam post</a> reads.

<p>Available now in the Superstore are a new armour set, primary weapon, player banner, cape, and player title.</p>
<p>A second batch will then be available from 23rd December.</p>
<p>The post also hints at other content: "High Command informs us that beyond the Superstore content, there’s also an additional Killzone 2 reward for all <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> depending on your success in the Galactic War…"</p>

</figure>
<p>The collaboration additionally marks the start of a longer rotation of items in the store, as Arrowhead temporarily tests a five day rotation.</p>
<p>"Right now, many of you feel the items are in rotation for too short a time, and that you sometimes miss out on that killer look you had your eyes on," it said. "At the same time, the more things we add to the store the longer it takes to come back into rotation."</p>
<p>Following the collaboration, page rotation on the store will return to normal as the developer gathers feedback.</p>
<p>Last week, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-soon-be-able-to-spread-democracy-with-a-limited-edition-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-in-hand">Helldivers 2 limited edition controller</a> was revealed.</p>
<p>Killzone 2 was released for the PS3 back in 2009 by Guerrilla Games, published by Sony. It was followed up by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-3">Killzone 3</a> in 2011, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone-mercenary">Killzone: Mercenary</a> on the PS Vita in 2013, and then Killzone: Shadow Fall for the launch of PS4 that same year.</p>
<p>Since then, there's been no word of a new game in the series.</p>
<p>Indeed, in October Guerrilla art director Roy Postma suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">studio was done with the series</a> and created Horizon Zero Dawn to "refresh the palette".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fresh details on Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra have been revealed by writer Amy Hennig, as well as a first look at its version of Wakanda.</p>
<p>The game was first announced in 2021, with former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> writer Hennig (Uncharted) at the helm of Skydance New Media, and a proper reveal was given earlier this year at the State of Unreal livestream. It features Captain America and Black Panther feuding during World War 2.</p>
<p>"[The setting] led us to do a bunch of interesting things," Hennig told <a href="https://ew.com/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-globe-trotting-wwii-epic-wakanda-setting-exclusive-8760326">Entertainment Weekly</a> in a new interview, "one of which was to not only tell a story with a young Steve Rogers who's still trying to find his feet, as opposed to the more seasoned guy that we've seen in a lot of the films. It also let us introduce a new Black Panther of 1943."</p>

<p>She continued: "It led us to tap into all the things that I love, all of the wonderful tropes of World War II-era adventure films, classic men-on-a-mission movies and all of that.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of intrigue in our story, a lot of twists and turns, fascinating characters, and interesting locations."</p>
<p>This era's Black Panther is Azzuri, T'Challa's grandfather, who Hennig described as "more mature" than the young Captain America.</p>
<p>The jungles of Wakanda will be a key setting alongside Occupied Paris, with the below screenshot providing a first look at its "photo-real, cinema-real level of detail", according to Hennig.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Marvel-1943-Rise-of-Hydra-01-121224-3ab812b589ea4a4ba8004f7b64c5a70b.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Skydance / Marvel / EW</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game will tell a "globe-trotting story" she added, stating there are more locations yet to be revealed.</p>
<p>"Wakanda at this point in time is hidden away from the outside world and protected by this impenetrable jungle," she said. "They are non-interventionist, but events transpire that pull them into the conflict. They have to protect their interests. The world is getting smaller. No satellites yet, but there will be soon. You can shoot down planes that maybe want to fly over Wakanda, but how long can you stay in the shadows?"</p><p>The story will see Captain America and Black Panther work together against the same enemies, though they begin as rivals. And as the game's name suggests, the villains are clear. Said Hennig: "It's pretty black and white. Who doesn't want to punch a Nazi?"</p>
<p>The previous trailer hinted a third super soldier will also feature in the game, though their identity remains under wraps.</p>
<p>That trailer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-jaw-dropping-look-at-amy-hennigs-new-captain-america-and-black-panther-game">impressed for the game's use of Epic's MetaHuman Creator</a> that gives each character remarkable detail.</p>
<p>"We really wanted the visual fidelity to be high so that you could kind of forget that you're looking at a game, that it should feel and look and sound and smell like you're watching a great Marvel movie or TV show, but you're driving the action," said Hennig in this new interview.</p>
<p>"As a new studio trying to do some groundbreaking stuff with cinematically presented games, the way we invite the most people in is by bringing them something they already know and love, but in a new form."</p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is expected to release next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Archetype Entertainment has finally unveiled a first look at gameplay of its forthcoming sci-fi RPG Exodus.</p>
<p>The game was first revealed at last year's The Game Awards and was notable for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/matthew-mcconaughey-to-make-his-video-game-debut-in-sci-fi-rpg-exodus">starring Matthew McConaughey in his first video game role</a>.</p>
<p>A year later and we finally have a better idea of how exactly it will play, thanks to a new gameplay trailer (below) - it's got alien planets, third-person space shooting, and a very very angry bear.</p>

<p>In short, it's looking a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> running on current platforms: from its shooter gameplay to its sci-fi aesthetic and narrative focus.</p>
<p>That's not surprising considering the studio's BioWare pedigree. This is the debut game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-bioware-vets-working-on-story-driven-sci-fi-game-at-new-wizards-of-the-coast-studio">Archetype Entertainment</a>, co-founded by BioWare veterans James Ohlen (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>) and Chad Robertson (Anthem).</p>
<p>The game will be published by Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>Further details on Exodus were provided in a livestream following the trailer's reveal with both Ohlen and Robertson.</p>
<p>In particular, details on its setting were shared. It takes place in a post-Earth exodus scenario (hence the name, presumably), where humanity has explored star systems and created advanced civilisations, as well as genetically modified creatures. That explains the bear, then.</p>
<p>There's competition between the human colonies, too, creating a web of various relationships and alliances players will need to navigate.</p>
<p>A key element will be Livestone, a hybrid of mineral and vegetation created by the Celestials that can be controlled by certain humans - I'm guessing the player protagonist will be one of them.</p>

<p>Time dilation is also a major focus, with the passage of time moving at different speeds across the universe. For instance, players will make personal and civilisational choices in their journey to other star systems, and while this may only be weeks for their character their homeworld will be significantly changed once they return due to differences in time.</p>
<p>Missions will be led with two companions - and yes, there will be romance.</p>
<p>We still don't know, though, who Matthew McConaughey will be playing.</p>
<p>So if you're done with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and you're itching for some space adventure ahead of the next Mass Effect game, Exodus should have you covered.</p>
<p>That said, Exodus still doesn't have a release date. However, there's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-episodes-of-amazons-secret-level-anthology-hints-at-a-rich-visual-picknmix-but-is-that-enough">themed episode in Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>

            <p>
Times Of Progress is a special game for me, because is the first news tip I have ever received from Sin Vega, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-rally-point">Prime Minister of Strategy Gaming</a>. Sin once described writing news articles for our former news editor Alice0 (RPS in peace) as like practising backflips in front of the kung fu master. Writing about a new city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> at Sin's suggestion is like being invited to budget the development of Londinium by Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>The terror of screwing it up - together with other, more trivial distractions, like international games industry conferences- has stopped me from writing about Times Of Progress for months. Today I bite the bullet, and emerge from my lodgings to issue a hesitant speech to the masses, hoping like hell that Caesar is too preoccupied with the latest Gaul uprising to notice my errors.

<p>
For starters, that introductory analogy is from the wrong millennium. Times Of Progress is set during the Industrial Revolution - the dawn of steam engines, trade unions and high-density urban housing. The first thing that grabs you about it is the presentation and aesthetic. We are in procedurally generated Isometric Land, with roads and railways binding together diamond-shaped town layouts. The buildings, terrain types and overall colour scheme are pleasantly clean - pale earth, red brick, green hill - but it isn't barren. There are some engrossing animated flourishes such as smoke plumes, and the way houses slowly fatten up into more complex dwellings.
</p>
<p>
Nonetheless, you might be tempted to call Times Of Progress "minimalist". It definitely seems more condensed than a lot of city-builders, but there are systems aplenty, including a few that spring more directly from the choice of period.
</p>
<p>
Take scientific innovations and new technologies, such as typewriters, water frames or electrolysis. You don't simply assign scientists to research them yourself. Rather, they unlock according to a timeline as part of the wider Industrial Revolution, which encompasses your city and all the other, AI-governed cities on the map. You then spend points earned by meeting certain goals (like achieving a certain food output) to import new technologies and get access to them faster. In general, trade appears to be a big deal in Times Of Progress. There isn't a military element, and seemingly no distinct "culture" layer either, so your interactions with other metropoli will be mostly mercantile.
</p><p>
There's also the question of labour politics. Workers in Times Of Progress may go on strike if a certain percentage in a certain place of work haven't been paid (in the form of food) for several weeks. You can meet their demands or implement a police crackdown. Workers may also unionise, once you pass the associated laws, making them more expensive but more efficient. Those with university educations may be more likely to strike.
</p>
<p>
I like the balance Times Of Progress seems to be striking between the joy of building a model trainset and a carefully considered degree of historical fiddliness. I suspect/hope that Sin will be along in the new year to write something more elaborate about the game. Please look kindly upon my fumbling early efforts, Sin! For the moment, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2628450/Times_of_Progress/">you can read more about Times Of Progress on Steam</a>. The developer Pressing Thumbs Games is a solo operator, based in Berlin, who uses the Rust programming language and the Bevy Engine. The studio's name apparently comes from the German equivalent for crossing your fingers to ensure good luck. Awww.

            <p>Secret Level is set to return for a second season, following its debut on Amazon last week.</p>
<p>The animated anthology is inspired by video games, with episodes dedicated to the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/unreal-tournament">Unreal Tournament</a>, Pac-Man, and Dungeons and Dragons.</p>
<p>Details of the second season are under wraps, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/secret-level-season-2-amazon-prime-video-1236251726/">Variety</a> reported, though Secret Level is the most-watched animated series debut of all time on Amazon's Prime Video streaming platform.</p>

<p>Exact viewership numbers have not been released, though Luminate estimates the series was watched for 155.3m minutes in the US during its first week - that's around 1.4m views as per its 109-minute runtime.</p>
<p>The series covers gaming past, present and future, from the iconic Mega Man to Amazon's MMORPG New World, to forthcoming space opera Exodus.</p>
<p>It's perhaps become best known for its Concord episode, which follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's decision to shut down the online shooter</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't feel bad that it's a part of the show," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-episode-in-amazons-secret-level-series-shows-potential-of-world-and-characters-says-creator">series creator Tim Miller told Rolling Stone</a>, "because I think it's an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters. If it's the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it's in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it."</p>
<p>Miller also directed the first Deadpool movie and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated anthology Love, Death &amp; Robots.</p>

            <p>Amir Satvat was the recipient of the first 'Game Changers' award at The Game Awards last week, but has since received "countless hateful messages", "disturbing comments" and antisemitic remarks about his wife.</p>
<p>Satvat received the award for his work helping laid-off employees across the games industry to find new work. The award was host <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>'s way of addressing the "significant and unprecedented industry-wide layoffs", which he admitted the show struggles to address "in a constructive way".</p>
<p>Satvat has helped to place nearly 3000 people into jobs, and was described at the awards show as "career Santa Claus". Yet since last week, he's been subjected to abuse online due to his current work at Chinese tech conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>.</p>

<p>"Over the past four days, I have received countless hateful messages targeting me personally, alongside hundreds more on YouTube and Twitter," Satvat wrote in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/amirsatvat_fellow-members-of-the-games-industry-i-need-activity-7274667576159350787-Zzpw?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">LinkedIn post</a>.</p>
<p>"People have made disturbing comments about my family - I am only not sharing those comments because they are disgusting, but I will share some other sample comments. My wife and me have been targeted with anti-Semitic slurs. Several videos mocked my comments suggesting I sounded autistic - riffing on it for their audience's amusement."</p>
<p>Due to his work as a business development director at Tencent, Satvat has been accused of being some sort of agent or plant exploiting the community, or that he's a fraud, he wrote.</p>
<p>However, he explained his community work began in November 2022 before he started at Tencent in August 2023. Before this he worked for Amazon, but again his community work was separate.</p>
<p>"I didn't / don't work on mergers and acquisitions at Tencent or Amazon," Satvat continued. "This stems from one innocent, erroneous mention of what I do in a Level Infinite article, since corrected to show I only work on investments."</p>
<p>He has also never laid employees off.</p>
<p>"They simply didn't mention Tencent at TGA because it had nothing to do with this community and they wanted to focus on how we drove this ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>"I've been accused of creating 'jail-worthy fraud' and mocked for 'just making one spreadsheet people enter info into', usually by people who spent all of eight seconds looking at our site with no understanding of the work we do or the impact we've had. We have 15 resources across five different resource homes and there is a lot of depth to our community, as any of you who have used it know."</p>
<p>He surmised: "This can happen to you too when you sacrifice over 2,000 hours of your time to help the industry - this is the 'reward' for two years of service."</p>
<p>Finishing the post, he said he would now "return to our mission of positive, public service".</p>

			<p>As customary at the end of the year, ZeniMax Online Studios boss Matt Firor <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> a letter about the state of The Elder Scrolls Online, the popular MMORPG that just celebrated its tenth year of live service.</p>
<p>Firor discussed major changes coming to the structure of upcoming content. The team has focused on delivering annual expansions called Chapters ever since 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-online-morrowind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morrowind</a>. They released the eighth this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-hands-on-with-scribing-plus-qa-with-rich-lambert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gold Road</a>, which added a new Scribing mechanics that allowed users to tweak skills/spells and three zones in the vicinity of Cyrodiil.</p>
<p>Gold Road will be the last Chapter released for Elder Scrolls Online, though. The team is changing its approach to new content, switching to a seasonal distribution instead. Firor said the Seasons might last anywhere from three to six months, featuring a blend of content like new stories, events, in-game store items, dungeons, and more.</p>
<p>2025 will be a transition year as the team shifts to the new model. As such, players can expect new zone-based content that has been in the works for some time, as well as 'some larger items.' According to the Studio Director of ZeniMax Online Studios, the new approach will allow the team to release more varied content more efficiently.</p>
<p>He actually went on to detail the specific areas of focus where 'experiments' will be conducted and evaluated based on community feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cyrodiil performance. ZeniMax Online Studios will be experimenting with a Cyrodiil campaign where all classes will have PvP-specific (and more performant) skills that replace the standard player skills with the expectation that we can support more players per campaign</li>
<li>Increasing the difficulty of standard overworld combat</li>
<li>Improving the overall feel of combat with animation, FX, and potentially audio work</li>
<li>Experimenting with more zones like Craglorn (although not as large in area or scope), created exclusively for high-end group and soft-group content with associated gear chase</li>
<li>Adding and refining tools to make guild recruitment, interaction, and management easier and more logical</li>
</ul>
<p>That's not all, as the development team also wants to improve the experience of new and returning Elder Scrolls Online users alike. Other objectives include a new PC patcher, improving the visuals of base game zones with updated textures and assets (this will begin rolling out next March), enhancing the game's PC UI, and other map and UI systems currently in the design/concept stage.</p>
<p>Overall,</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chess-esports-world-cup/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/chess-will-appear-at-the-esports-world-cup-in-2025.1064109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chess-esports-world-cup/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been announced by the Esports World Cup Foundation that at next year’s monumental event in Riyadh, <strong>Chess </strong>will make an appearance. In recent years, Chess has been on the up and up in terms of digital gaming and streaming, and the centuries-old board game has earned a place alongside some of the world’s best competitive titles.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the team at the EWCF announced: ‘The ultimate game of strategy and intellect joins the lineup!’</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ancient-growth">Ancient Growth</h2>



<p>Chess.com, the number one digital site that services users of the game online, hit 150 million members just over a year ago as a craze swept the world. More players than ever before were finding their way into the ecosystem, and on streaming platforms like Twitch, the game saw a huge boom in viewership figures.</p>



<p>It all started at the beginning of 2021, with a spike taking place following a series of high-stakes tournaments. Before long, the grandmasters of Chess were appearing on these platforms, their profiles being boosted in many ways, such as through the popularisation of The Queen’s Gambit on Netflix.</p>



<p>In a milestone step, TSM signed Nikaru Nakamura as a creator and competitive Chess player. Soon after, Envy picked up the Botez sisters, a Canadian duo focused on streaming Chess and IRL content. </p>



<p>To celebrate the Esports World Cup announcement, Magnus Carlsen, a grandmaster of the game and one of the ambassadors surfacing for the EWC 2025, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I’m thrilled to see Chess join some of the biggest games in the world at the Esports World Cup</em>. </p>



<p>T<em>his partnership is an incredible opportunity to grow the game, by introducing Chess to new audiences and inspiring the next generation of players. Being part of the esports family is an amazing opportunity for Chess to broaden its reach to a massive group of esports fans.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will be a $1.5 million prize pool up for grabs – one of the largest in the history of Chess. It’ll be integrated as part of the Champions Chess Tour, and a new format will be introduced to allow for quicker matches that keep the excitement high while retaining the notions of strategy and tactics.</p>



<p>Will you tune in to watch Chess at the Esports World Cup? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Something different than a gaming headset arrived at my doorstep recently - a full desktop gaming sound system from manufacturer OXS. Established in 2021, OXS is dedicated to providing gamers with a comprehensive gaming audio experience, and delivers, alongside home cinema products, audio solutions for gaming. Products include the Storm G2 wireless headset, the Thunder Lite compact gaming soundbar, and the Thunder Pro soundbar. I was given the opportunity the test the latter, complete with the unique satellite neck speaker.</p>

</ul>
<figure><figcaption>The full OXS Thunder Pro + setup</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>The audience</strong></p>
<p>The OXS Thunder Pro + Gaming Soundbar is designed with gamers in mind, offering Dolby Atmos-certified sound in a more compact form than many other soundbars. It supports multiple audio input options, but for the best performance, connecting via HDMI to a PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X will deliver the full Dolby digital audio experience. Additionally, an optional "neck pillow" accessory can be attached to a chair, providing two rear speaker channels for an enhanced audio setup. PC users can also download OXS Audio, a free app that captures screen images to synchronize the soundbar's dynamic in-game RGB lighting effects and also allows users to customize channel volume and equalization settings.</p>
<p><strong>Design and features</strong></p>
<p>While the Thunder Pro + offers a modern design with a slim profile and matte finish, it doesn’t quite fit the typical TV room aesthetic. The soundbar’s design feels more suited to a desktop or PC setup, with its compact size and angled form factor that’s better positioned in front of a computer monitor rather than beneath a television. This gives it a somewhat out-of-place appearance when paired with a larger TV, especially in living rooms where a more traditional, wide-surfaced soundbar would be preferable.</p>
<figure><figcaption>OXS Thunder Pro with blue RGB lighting</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Thunder Pro's plastic construction and front perforated grille give it a more "techy" feel, but it lacks the premium build expected from soundbars designed to seamlessly integrate into a TV setup. As a result, it might feel out of place for console users seeking a more polished, TV-friendly look that blends well with their home entertainment systems.</p>
<p>OXS's offering has excellent connectivity, supporting USB-A, USB-C, Aux, Bluetooth, and HDMI. However, it doesn’t come with the necessary cables, so you'll need to supply your own. The variety of connections is impressive, and being able to switch between them using the remote means you can keep several devices connected simultaneously. In addition, players can also plug in their headset and mic for chatting during gameplay. The only drawback in terms of connectivity is the lack of a separate sub-output.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>The OXS Thunder Pro + soundbar delivers clear and crisp audio, especially when it comes to dialogue and vocals. It's well-suited for watching TV shows, listening to podcasts, and general audio use.</p>
<p>That said, the bass performance falls short of expectations. Despite claims of a deep, punchy low-end, the bass lacks the impact and depth one might anticipate from a high-end sound system. For action-packed games, media, or music with heavy bass, the soundbar doesn't quite deliver the rumble and power that you might expect from a $699.99 gaming sound system.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Thunder Pro woofers on top (also on bottom)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At its high price, the OXS Thunder Pro + may not satisfy those seeking a full, balanced sound. While it does shine in terms of clarity and mid-range performance, the weak bass can make it difficult to justify the premium cost—particularly for those who prioritize a rich, immersive audio experience.</p>
<p><strong><span>Neck speaker</span></strong></p>
<p>The OXS Satellite Neck Speaker accessory stands out for its impressive comfort. Its soft, ergonomic design provides excellent neck support, making it ideal for long gaming sessions. Gamers will appreciate the comfort it adds to their setup, especially for extended playtime.</p>
<p>However, performance-wise, the neck pillow doesn't quite deliver. Though it’s meant to add extra rear channels to enhance the audio experience with the Thunder Pro soundbar, the sound output is surprisingly weak. The added channels don’t provide the powerful, immersive audio expected, leaving the experience feeling underwhelming.</p>
<p>Additionally, the pillow's battery life is a major downside. Despite its innovative features, it drains power quickly, requiring frequent recharges during longer sessions. This high battery consumption can be a hassle, especially for those hoping for a more efficient accessory.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the OXS Satellite Neck Speaker excels in comfort, its low sound output and high battery usage diminish its overall appeal. It’s a great option for those in need of neck support, but it may not be the best choice for audiophiles or users looking for a more powerful, efficient audio solution.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>In conclusion, the OXS Thunder Pro + Gaming Soundbar offers solid performance with clear dialogue and crisp audio, making it a good choice for casual listening and general media consumption. However, its bass performance falls short, lacking the deep, impactful low-end expected from a high-end sound system, especially for gaming or music with heavy bass. Its design is more suited to a PC setup, and the absence of a separate subwoofer further contributes to the lack of a full, balanced sound.</p>
<p>At its premium price, the Thunder Pro + may not fully justify its cost for users seeking a richer, more immersive audio experience.

            <title><![CDATA[Elder Scrolls Online Devs Are Stopping Annual Chapter Updates]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elder-scrolls-online-devs-are-stopping-annual-chapter-updates.1064100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-online-devs-stopping-chapters/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>ZeniMax Online Studios has revealed in a recent blog post that, going into 2025, it’ll be <strong>halting </strong>the annual chapter updates that have been running since 2017. It all started with <strong>Morrowind</strong>, and most recently, players got their hands on <strong>Gold Road</strong>.</p>



<p>Going forward, that cadence will change, with the team doing away with the larger chapters that are released every June and focusing on a season-based model. This will allow them to sprinkle content throughout the year, rather than crunching to meet the June deadline for a new chapter every year.</p>



<p>Read on to check out this major change coming to Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shaking-things-up">‘Shaking Things Up’</h2>



<p>In a post on the Elder Scrolls Online site, the game’s studio director, Matt Firor, broke down the chapter changes coming to ESO in 2025.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At the end of last year, we gave a slight heads up that we would be shaking things up.</p>



<p>We will still do lots of story content, but now, looking into 2025, we need to concentrate on different types of content to support all types of&nbsp;<em>ESO&nbsp;</em>players. So, we are putting Chapters aside and will be focusing on new types of content, and a new release philosophy.</p>



<p>Over the course of 2025 we will be moving more towards a seasonal content model and away from launching massive content updates once a year, as we did with Chapters. We will be talking much more about this in the future, but in 2025 expect to see named Seasons of three or six months duration with a mix of themed story content,&nbsp;events, store items, dungeons and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This overhaul is designed to free up the development team and reduce the stress of keeping to an annual schedule, which has been running consistently for the last seven years. In <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/67321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a>, Firor referenced changes in the gaming industry, player habits, and the rise and fall of competing titles as reasons behind this major update.</p>



<p>To that end, players can stop expecting a major update every year, and instead, they’ll get ‘bite-sized’ content drops every few months.</p>



<p>In Firor’s words, it’s a community-led change that will allow the team to become ‘less predictable’. </p>



<p>There’s an ambitious roadmap shaping up for 2025, though. The team is hard at work on new story content in existing territories, boosting the new-starter experience, and bringing more light to ‘hallmark’ factions like The Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild.</p>



<p>Those changes will come hand-in-hand with UI upgrades, visual enhancements, and tweaks to animations and game performance, as you’d expect. Elder Scrolls Online is now more than ten years old, but ZeniMax Online Studios shows no sign of slowing down when it comes to these enhancements.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-nadeshot/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there%E2%80%99s-no-integrity%E2%80%99-nadeshot-stepping-back-from-cod-because-of-failing-anti-cheat.1064097/</guid>

<p>Nadeshot has stressed on stream that he’s stepping away from Call of Duty to play other games until Black Ops 6’s anti-cheat mechanics are ‘fixed’. In recent weeks, pro players worldwide have been writhing in agony every time they play Ranked on Black Ops 6, because the mode is inundated with cheaters.</p>



<p>Recently, Team RICOCHET – Activision’s anti-cheat team – admitted that it ‘missed the mark’ with Black Ops 6’s anti-cheat ecosystem, and promised that upgrades are on the way, but they’re several weeks in the distance at least.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-exodus">Exodus</h2>



<p>Nadeshot is one of many pro players and streamers giving up on Black Ops 6 after a few weeks of dealing with incessant cheating in Ranked Play. He also cited the ongoing network issues and some of the game’s core bugs.</p>



<p>During <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1869174028822564975" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent stream</a>, he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The core mechanics of the game are fun. </p>



<p>I enjoy the movement, I enjoy the gunplay, I enjoy some parts of the foundation of the game, but I can’t play it.</p>



<p>I can’t enjoy it; there’s no integrity. Somebody is cheating or the network sucks or the game is broken.</p>



<p>I don’t enjoy it enough to sit here and play it every day.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For a while, it looked as though Black Ops 6 was serving up a redemption story for the Call of Duty franchise. Now we can see that most players entered a honeymoon period with the title as it was just better than what came before, like last year’s shambolic release in Modern Warfare III.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nadeshot is stepping away from Call of Duty for other games for the time being

Citing server issues, the game being broken, constant cheaters, and more </span></p></article></div>







<p>Despite the game’s core issues being very public, Activision’s teams seem in no hurry to fix them, and some of the baser issues have been present in the Call of Duty ecosystem for years, such as issues with packet burst across almost every game. </p>

The Santa Clause, Miracle on 34th Street, Pulp Fiction, and Forrest Gump are duking it out at the global box office. Boyz II Men’s On Bended Knee is about to (temporarily) cede the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 to Here Comes the Hotstepper by lyrical gangster Ini Kamoze. In video games, the original PlayStation has just launched in Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But forget the PlayStation for a moment, because December 1994 also marked the arrival of <em>another </em>interactive icon: The Need for Speed, on the ill-fated 3DO home game console. The 3DO, despite being lauded as <a href="https://time.com/archive/6675290/the-best-products-of-1993/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Time Magazine’s 1993 Product of the Year</u></a>, was ultimately a flop. There was no '3DO II'. The Need for Speed, however, was <em>not </em>a flop. There <em>was </em>a Need for Speed II. And III. And a fourth, fifth, sixth, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, 30 years later the Need for Speed series is still with us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s become one of the best-selling game series of all time.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-1-3do-1734000662200.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1994's Road &amp; Track Presents The Need for Speed.</figcaption></figure></output><p id="the-need-for-speed-debuts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="The Need for Speed Debuts">3DOh Yeah</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Need for Speed is actually one of the most successful game franchises ever,” notes Criterion Senior Creative Director John Stanley. Stanley has been with Criterion for 14 years working across multiple EA series, from Battlefield to Battlefront, but his predominant focus is Need for Speed. “So it’s a very big honour and mantle to be lifted each time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">15 years ago, sales figures for the franchise hit 100 million copies. A decade ago they’d rocketed past 150 million. Precisely what they sit at today is not known, but what’s clear is Need for Speed’s success and longevity make it a monster within the racing genre.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Need for Speed is actually one of the most successful game franchises ever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly got off to a flying start. The original Need for Speed was an immediate critical hit, despite the 3DO’s own particular woes. Fortunately, subsequent ports to PC, PlayStation, and Sega Saturn would go on to make The Need for Speed a commercial smash as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presented by Road &amp; Track Magazine and developed by EA Canada, The Need for Speed’s 3DO debut boasted just eight cars – a modest mix of European exotics and 1990s sports icons from the US and Japan. It also featured a total of three tracks. Yes, that’s paltry by later standards, but it’s worth keeping in mind that this was entirely typical for the time – at least, until the original Gran Turismo arrived several years later with a garage pumped up to unprecedented proportions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also important to note that EA Canada had previously been known as Distinctive Software. Prior to its acquisition by EA in the early ’90s, Distinctive Software was responsible for the influential original Test Drive, its follow-up The Duel: Test Drive II, and cult, early 3D racing favourite Stunts (known as 4D Sports Driving in some regions). That high-speed experience was abundantly evident in The Need for Speed. Like the early Test Drive games that came before it, The Need for Speed asked players to dodge traffic as fast as they dared while outrunning the pursuing police. Electronic Gaming Monthly called it “the racing game to beat on the 3DO.” Edge Magazine declared it featured “the richest 3D environment ever seen on a home system.” GamePro was similarly full of praise, positing that “[i]f you dream of racing exotic sports cars, it doesn’t get any better than this incredible game.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-2-1734000726995.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Need for Speed featured cabin views for all vehicles.</figcaption></figure></output><p id="raising-the-high-stakes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Raising the (High) Stakes">Raising the (High) Stakes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, it <em>did </em>get better. Need for Speed built itself into a true racing juggernaut throughout the remainder of the ’90s, and it lapped Test Drive as the premier purveyor of playable police pursuits and illegal street racing. The series became <em>the </em>place to find the greatest exotics of the era: the Lamborghini Diablo and Ferrari 512TR. The Jaguar XJ220 and McLaren F1. Down in my own native Australia, the games were even localised with their own, regional-exclusive covers, and injected with the hottest homegrown sports sedans of the time. That was truly something, as a teenager; to be stalking a games store and see the sickest Australian cars on the street staring back at me from the shelves. That was unique to Need for Speed during this era.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-aus-1734000792323.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Regional-exclusive cars and covers made Need for Speed unique.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But perhaps more than anything, Need for Speed carved itself out a reputation as a series that celebrated not just racing, but <em>risk</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I argue it’s the forerunner, or has been and still <em>is </em>the forerunner, in the only franchise really delivering on consequence,” says Stanley. “That thrill of the chase. I think nothing else out there in the racing game genre does that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By asking people to outrun police, and eventually even place their pink slips on the line, Need for Speed was a series that pushed its players to take risks. For clarity, by the time Need for Speed came around, we’d admittedly already faced the long arm of the law in 1987’s Test Drive, and many of us would’ve already lost rides to rivals after racing for slips in 1989’s Street Rod. But even if it wasn’t the first, Need for Speed was an extremely early adopter of these philosophies of risk – and it certainly became the most recognisable. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-high-stakes-1734000845837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1999's Need for Speed: High Stakes.</figcaption></figure></output><p id="going-underground"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Going Underground">Tuna, No Crust</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the years went on, the property eventually found itself taking risks of its own. Firstly, with 2003’s radically reinvented Need for Speed: Underground, and then with 2005’s Need for Speed: Most Wanted – which is still the best selling game in the whole series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oh man, they’re my beloved,” grins Justin Wiebe, who jokingly describes himself as the “old fossil” EA dug up for this chat. Currently Studio Design Director at Ripple Effect, Wiebe’s history with the Need for Speed series dates back to Hot Pursuit 2 in 2002. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re like my crown jewels, to be honest with you,” he continues. “I’ve had a long career here and boy am I proud of having a chance to work on those games.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Underground, Wiebe explains the team didn’t quite know what they had on their hands at the time, but they were all hooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was so addictive to play,” he says. “It was the introduction of things like drag racing for the first time, where it was a completely new way of playing at high speed. And we were starting to explore other new, emerging racing genres – like drift racing and stuff like that – and starting to bring all of these new and cutting edge ideas, and then mixing in customisation. We were pioneering at that time.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-ug-2-1734001037130.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2003's Need for Speed: Underground arrived in the slipstream of The Fast and the Furious.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">EA followed Underground with a direct, open-world sequel – the first open world in the series – but the bigger question was where to take it next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We kept asking ourselves, ‘Well, what do we do now? How do we one-up this? What are we gonna do?’” says Wiebe. “And we had an exceptional executive producer at that time, Mike [Mann], who came in and he basically said, ‘I want to make it <em>the </em>most elicit experience that we’ve done to date. I want to bring in the cops, and I want to make them feel so threatening, like they are the real world.’”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So that was the mandate to me: take these cops and make everyone absolutely terrified of them.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that was the mandate to me: take these cops and make everyone absolutely terrified of them.’ And I said, ‘Then, Mike, I gotta take away people’s cars that they earned; I’m gonna impound them, and they’re gonna lose them for a while.’ And he’s, like, ‘<em>Do it</em>.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“[Need for Speed is] a franchise which is big, but it’s also unafraid to try to take risks. To do things differently. To challenge the norm. And that’s what I love about working on the franchise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an entertaining twist, Wiebe even found himself <em>in </em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted as the racer Taz – number 14 on the Blacklist – after one of the actors failed to show up for a photoshoot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They started wandering around the office trying to see, like, ‘Who’s the most shifty-looking person we have here?’, and then they’re, like, ‘<em>You!</em>’” chuckles Wiebe, stabbing his finger in the air. “So yeah, they just grabbed me and did a couple of shots and there I am. It was a good time.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/taz-nfs-most-wanted-1734001094796.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vince Kilic, aka 'Taz', was number 14 on Need for Speed: Most Wanted's famous Blacklist.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Stanley, within the corridors of Criterion, Most Wanted remains a revered example of the series at the peak of its power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I cite Most Wanted so much within the studio,” he says. “Just around the way that it managed to weave together the narrative, the gameplay, the progression. Everything comes together in this.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A term that I use a lot, and now I’ll have to drink a shot for this: ludonarrative harmony. Because actually executing on that in a game? So important. And Most Wanted is a masterclass in that, and something that I definitely cite a lot.”</p><p id="always-changing"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Always Changing">On: The Run</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been almost two decades since Need for Speed: Most Wanted, and the series has continued to evolve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you look at it, Need for Speed’s never remained the same,” says Criterion Producer Patrick Honnoraty, who’s worked on every Need for Speed since 2012 – from Criterion to Ghost and back to Criterion. “From one iteration to the next, it’s always had something that was different.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For good and for bad – because those things don’t always work and they don’t always resonate with players – but we guarantee that we’ll always be doing something different.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Things don’t always work and they don’t always resonate with players – but we guarantee that we’ll always be doing something different.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“‘For good and for bad’ is a great example,” says Wiebe. “For example, my experience on creating Need for Speed: The Run. We really tried to break some new ground there. We talked about getting out of the car, and we had all these grandiose visions for how it was going to be more than just racing; the character’s going to get out of the car. But then we realised very quickly, ‘Well, we can’t <em>really </em>do that’, so we introduced some quicktime events.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, we all love quicktime events, right?” he adds with an ironic smile.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Wiebe believes they ultimately created “a grand racing adventure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted it to feel like your life is on the line,” he says. “That it’s more humanised than ever before about the character and the story that they’re in, racing from coast to coast. I’ll be the first to stand up and say that didn’t really work, but I’m proud of the fact that we tried it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was actually on a fan forum a few months ago and I actually was shocked at how highly-rated some of the fans actually made that game. I had thought, ‘Well, that’s a bit of a lump of coal in my resume.’ But it turns out that it actually has a massive cult following, and there are certain people that absolutely <em>adore </em>that game. And that brought a little joy to my heart; that we took a risk and there are some people that really found something to love about it.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That brought a little joy to my heart; that we took a risk and there are some people that really found something to love about it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Honnoraty has noticed the same thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think every Need for Speed I’ve worked on, when it’s come out it’s been, ‘Oh my god, it was no good; it was rubbish,” he says. “People didn’t like it. And then years pass and it’s, like, ‘Ah, it was so good! It had these great elements to it. It was the best Need for Speed. Why don’t you go and make one back like that?’”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Need for Speed is always too ahead of its time, is my thing. Every time we bring one out. Every time we bring one and it doesn’t strike, people look back on them so fondly.”</p><p id="defining-the-series"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Defining the Series">Defining the Series</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">30 years on, building a Need for Speed game is an exponentially more complicated task than it ever was, and more challenging than ever. For Senior Vehicle Artist Frankie Yip the work required is significant, but he wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The cars in Need for Speed are far more intricate now compared to the earlier days of the franchise,” explains Yip, who has worked on the franchise for the entirety of his 20-year career in the gaming industry. After picking up a copy of Need for Speed: Underground for PlayStation 2 as a teenager, Yip got so hooked he took a 3D modelling course and was soon living his dream, making cars for Need for Speed: Underground 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I actually thought I was going to fail in the 3D school,” says Yip. “All the assignments? All I did was just model cars. And they’re, like, ‘That’s not part of the assignment.’ I don’t care; I like cars. So my portfolio was just all cars.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I actually thought I was going to fail in the 3D school. All the assignments? All I did was just model cars.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Yip, dealing with the vast amount of content produced for each car is not as straightforward as it may seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’ll give you an example, just to break it down,” he begins. “Bodykits, for example. Say a car has three bodykit designs. That’s three front bumpers, three rear bumpers, three sideskirts, three front fenders, so on and so on. That tallies up to 15, 20 individual parts. But allowing the player to seamlessly and smoothly mix and match those parts? Yeah, it sounds simple, but it actually involves a significant amount of work. You run into issues; like, this part doesn’t fit with this. This part doesn’t fit with <em>that</em>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There’s different variations in bumper widths, fender shapes, fender sizes; the list goes on. Panel lines, shut lines; nothing lines up. So, how do we make this all work? We actually have to build out <em>every single part combination out there</em>. You take that 15 to 20 individual parts I mentioned, and you multiply it to an additional 60, or well over a hundred. It depends on the car. Like, every car is a different shape. It <em>is</em> a ton of work, but what this does allow is it allows the player to have thousands of part combinations. And who doesn’t want that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So now you know why, in earlier Need for Speed titles, we just restricted the body kit to be equipped as one whole unit. But honestly, where’s the fun in that?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Criterion Vehicle Art Director Bryn Alban, there’s a bigger-picture challenge; that is, what defines Need for Speed to its massive and multi-generational audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It means so much to so many people, and everybody’s got a different opinion as to what a good Need for Speed is,” says Alban, who’s been around since the days of Need for Speed: Shift and brings the experience of building his own Skylines over the past 20 years to his role on the franchise. “So trying to appease everybody at all times is super difficult. Even down to the nitty gritty details of what customisation we put on our cars; it’s so divisive a subject for our players that it’s almost impossible for us to get it a hundred percent right, all the time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So when we do get things somewhat correct, it’s great. But when you see those comments where you’ve missed something, it really hurts. It hurts to your core. You’re, like, ‘Oh yeah, I forgot that we should’ve added <em>that </em>to the game.’ So, yeah, it’s really tricky and tough to get that balance of making the perfect Need for Speed, really.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So when we do get things somewhat correct, it’s great. But when you see those comments where you’ve missed something, it really hurts. It hurts to your core. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For what it’s worth, I’ve been missing Australian cars in the Need for Speed series since they stopped featuring back in the early 2000s, and Alban agrees it could be time for the series to circle back and include them again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, that’s a very valid point, and I think it’s true that Australian cars have been underrepresented in Need for Speed in its most recent history,” he says. “I can’t give you a reason why that is the case, but it’s definitely something that we should take a look at in the future moving forward, to see if we can redress that balance a little bit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When you look at things like Holden, they’re very iconic within Australia,” adds Honnoraty. “They’re very interesting things; the utes that you have. So I think those are interesting examples for us to look at. And I’m sure, Bryn, you’d tell me there’s plenty of them in the drift scene as well?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, you see them crop up,” Alban responds with his finger clearly on the pulse. “I mean, just this last week there’s the Drift Matsuri that’s happening in Japan, and I saw that there were a couple of Ford Falcons over there in Japan doing their thing. So there’s definitely opportunities to tap into that, I think.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s obvious Alban knows his cars. There’s also a fun synergy in the fact that the first Instagram video I’d watched of the very Falcons Alban is referencing features one <a href="https://www.instagram.com/au.house/reel/DCl4xGNMaXX/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cruising through a Tokyo tunnel to Get Low by Lil Jon &amp; The East Side Boyz.</a> It should go without saying that anyone who played Need for Speed: Underground has that song seared into their synapses.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/nfs-hp2-1734001289099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Redress away, team!</figcaption></figure></output><p id="need-for-speeds-biggest-challenge"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Need for Speed's Biggest Challenge">To the Window, to the Wall</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Need for Speed itelf has cruised both high and low over the last three decades but, while the team seems conscious that the series hasn’t <em>always </em>been at its best, there’s a clear feeling that it’s always remained faithful to being fun and approachable above all else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the trajectory has been bumpy, actually, in some cases,” admits Honnoraty. “But what’s happened – and I think what’s been most important – is if you think about the first inception of what The Need for Speed was, it was really accessible.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I remember going to what was probably the local video game shop, or computer shop, at the time, and me and my friends saw it on the 3DO. We were like, ‘What’s this?’ We all jumped on it, on the 3DO, and you felt badass. Being able to drive it, being chased by the cops; there wasn’t an experience that was really like it at the time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think today the biggest challenge we face is literally the age of the franchise, and what it's been.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s really tried to stay true to that formula. It’s still accessible today; a lot of car racing games are not so easily accessible, so people still have the option to jump in and have fun with a Need for Speed game. It makes you feel like you’re just a bad-arse... It’s really inside of the DNA; it’s always there.</p><div id="rank-the-need-for-speed-series" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank the Need for Speed series</h3><h3>Rank the Need for Speed series</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For Honnoraty, what makes handling Need for Speed tricky today are the side effects of how long the series has survived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think today the biggest challenge we face is literally the age of the franchise, and what it's been,” Honnoraty continues. “It’s been so many different things and appeals to so many different people.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We even see the debates between players: which is the best game, and why is it the best game? You look at [Underground and Most Wanted]. The divisive debate that happens between which one of those is better and why – and how different they really are and what they were looking at – means that we sit in a place where Need for Speed means many different things to many different people.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Honnoraty gives an example where, after speaking to attendees of the Need for Speed Payback booth at EA Play, some players compared the demo to Most Wanted, and others were adamant it reminded them of Underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And I’m, like, ‘How? What? They’re completely different!’ he says. “So I think it’s just that people carry with them the feeling that they had when they played those games… I think that’s the hardest thing today; it’s honestly reconciling what Need of Speed means to players. And you’ve seen it; when we go in one direction with something that doesn’t quite work, and it doesn’t appeal to certain sorts of players. Or we go in another direction, so it’s a real thing that we have to tackle with, day in and day out. But John [Stanley] and I work with it constantly. We think we’ve nearly cracked it, so we’ll see.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Don’t forget the Porsche Unleashed crowd that would argue that that is the number one Need for Speed of all time!” adds Wiebe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Exactly! Exactly!” smiles Honnoraty. “We have a very vocal member in our player council that’s <em>very </em>vocal on Porsche Unleashed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then the Carbon crowd, the ProStreet crowd,” lists Stanley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The list goes on,” replies Honnoraty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The list goes on indeed. So too, we hope, will Need for Speed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To the window, to the wall, ‘til the sweat drop down… well, you get the idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-new-nvidia-app-is-probably-hurting-your-pc-gaming-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Nvidia replaced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/latest-nvidia-drivers-to-be-locked-behind-geforce-experience-app/">the longstanding GeForce Experience App</a> with <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/">a new, unified Nvidia App</a> last month, most GPU owners probably noted the refresh and rebranding with nothing more than bemusement (though <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/nvidias-new-app-doesnt-require-you-to-log-in-to-update-your-gpu-driver/">the new lack of an account login requirement</a> was a nice improvement). Now, testing shows that running the new app with default settings can lead to some significant frame rate dips on many high-end games, even when the app's advanced AI features aren't being actively used.</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/we-tested-nvidia-app-performance-problems-games-run-up-to-15-percent-slower-with-the-app">noted the performance dip</a> after reading reports of related problems around the web. The site's testing with and without the Nvidia App installed confirms that, across five games running on an RTX 4060, the app reduced average frame rates by around 3 to 6 percent, depending on the resolution and graphical quality level.</p>
<p>The site's measured frame rate drop peaked at 12 percent for <em>Assassin's Creed Mirage</em> running at 1080p Ultra settings; other tested games (including <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, <em>Flight Simulator 2024</em>, and <em>Stalker 2</em>) showed a smaller drop at most settings.</p>
<h2>Unfiltered</h2>
<p>This is a significant performance impact for an app that simply runs quietly in the background for most users. The impact is roughly comparable to that of going from a top-of-the-line RTX 4070 Ti Super to an older RTX 4070 Ti or 4070 Super, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/4070-ti-super-review-faster-gpu-for-the-same-799-but-not-nvidias-best-value/">based on our earlier testing of those cards</a>.</p>

<p>For any fan of gaming, a great title becomes even better when it’s subjected to fantastic post-launch content – and that tends to come in the form of top-shelf DLC. This could be anything from a few missions to an entire sub-campaign some ten or fifteen hours in length. In this list, we’re taking a look at the best DLCs ever released, deciding once and for all what the greatest game expansions are. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-dlcs-ever">Best DLCs Ever</h2>



<p>Here’s our representation of the best DLCs ever released in gaming – let us know in the comments if you agree with this breakdown. </p>



<h3 id="h-1-shadow-of-the-erdtree-elden-ring">1. Shadow of the Erdtree (Elden Ring)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Elden Ring’s Shadow of the Erdtree expansion was such a phenomenal release that it became a candidate for <strong>Game of the Year</strong> at 2024’s edition of The Game Awards. This stellar piece of DLC brought millions of players back into the fold, all ready to fight notoriously difficult bosses in a brand-new section of the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-blood-and-wine-the-witcher-3">2. Blood and Wine (The Witcher 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blood and Wine was effectively a ‘send-off’ for The Witcher 3, taking place long after the main story was completed (chronologically) and serving as a ‘retirement’ of sorts for our hero, Geralt of Rivia. There’s a fourth-wall break at the end of the expansion that is worthy of a chef’s kiss – one of the best DLCs ever, indeed.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-point-lookout-fallout-3">3. Point Lookout (Fallout 3)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Point Lookout is one of the creepiest Fallout DLCs ever, plunging players into a foggy, mutant-infested backwoods county and leaving them to fend for themselves. It was one of the largest expansions Bethesda Game Studios had released at the time, boasting a wide, open map and hours of extra content for the best Fallout game ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-left-behind-last-of-us">4. Left Behind (Last of Us)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left Behind was a poignant, emotional expansion to an already heart-wrenching game. It told the backstory of Ellie and explored the journey she took before becoming bitten and discovering she was immune to the Cordyceps infection in The Last of Us. It was a perfect prequel that offered a few solid hours of gameplay.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-burial-at-sea-bioshock-infinite">5. Burial at Sea (BioShock Infinite)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>BioShock Infinite was released back in 2012 and at the time of writing is the last game in the series. It was a phenomenal and beautiful game that was perfectly expanded upon in Burial at Sea, a two-part DLC that spans BioShock’s in-game ‘multiverse’. It takes players back to Rapture, the instantly recognisable location from BioShock and BioShock 2.</p>







<h3 id="h-6-dragonborn-skyrim">6. Dragonborn (Skyrim)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dragonborn was a massive piece of DLC that took players from the province of Skyrim to Solstheim to face off against an ancient dragon priest with a thirst for power. In this expansion, players travel through the likes of Apocrypha, learn new and powerful abilities, and explore a sizeable and dangerous map. </p>



<h3 id="h-7-nuka-world-fallout-4">7. Nuka-World (Fallout 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s another Fallout DLC, but honestly, Bethesda Game Studios did such a phenomenal job expanding these games that it deserves another spot on this list of the best DLCs ever. At the end of Fallout 4’s lifecycle, BGS released Nuka-World, an expansion that serves as a perfect endgame, ultimately giving players one last opportunity to make a grand choice to impact their ‘status’ in the game for the final time. </p>







<h3 id="h-8-freedom-cry-aciv-black-flag">8. Freedom Cry (ACIV: Black Flag)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Freedom Cry ultimately arrived on the scene as a standalone expansion, telling the story of Adéwalé, the strong and memorable supporting character from 2013’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. It’s one of the most impressive stories in Assassin’s Creed history, with players assuming the role of this former slave turned pirate turned assassin in an adventure that lasts a good few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-9-phantom-liberty-cyberpunk-2077">9. Phantom Liberty (Cyberpunk 2077)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Phantom Liberty quite literally changed the face of Cyberpunk 2077, going hand-in-hand with an update so large it was dubbed ‘Cyberpunk 2.0’. Phantom Liberty was a star-studded expansion that introduced an entirely new area of Night City and took players through a story so emotional that it broke hearts worldwide when it wrapped up.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-undead-nightmare-red-dead-redemption">10. Undead Nightmare (Red Dead Redemption)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Undead Nightmare is legendary, and these days, fans of the Red Dead Redemption franchise are wondering why Rockstar Games hasn’t released a new version for RDR2. Released in 2010, Undead Nightmare saw players revisit John Marston, gunslinger extraordinaire, as he attempts to survive a brutal and terrifying zombie outbreak. It was a brilliant expansion that boasted its unique multiplayer modes. </p>

<p>Starfield is a great game, but sometimes, using one of the title’s best commands or cheats can make it a more enjoyable experience. If you’re playing on PC, you can lean on <strong>hundreds </strong>of commands and codes to alter your game – sometimes with hilarious results., In this guide, I’m breaking down the best Starfield cheats and commands, just for you.</p>



<p>I’ll also teach you a trick that’ll allow you to unlock Starfield cheats on Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats">How to Use Starfield Cheats</h2>



<p>Call them commands, call them cheats, it doesn’t matter – they’re basically the same thing. On PC, it’s seriously easy to use Starfield commands, and it all begins with tapping the key that sits alongside the ‘1’ on the top left of your keyboard, just beneath the ESC key. It might be a tilde or it could be a ‘grave’ symbol, but whatever it is, it’ll produce the same result.</p>



<p>Once you’ve hit the right key, your on-screen console will pop up and you’ll be able to just type in the Starfield cheats you want to enable, hitting enter and applying them at will. For most of these Starfield commands, you’ll be able to type the same thing into the console again to disable them but bear in mind that any save with cheats applied will be locked out of achievements. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-starfield-commands">Best Starfield Commands</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are hundreds of Starfield cheats, but we’ve broken down what we think are the best ones to use.</p>



<ul>
<li>tgm (Enable godmode)</li>



<li>tdetect (NPCs won’t detect you)</li>



<li>tcl (Noclip – fly through walls)</li>



<li>kah (Kill all hostiles in the area)</li>



<li>resurrect (Resurrect targeted NPC)</li>



<li>unlock (Unlock targeted door or container)</li>



<li>showmenu sleepwaitmenu (Sleep or wait without having to have a bed or seat)</li>



<li>saq (Trigger all quests in the menu – can crash your game)</li>



<li>caq (Complete all quests – will almost certainly crash your game)</li>



<li>SetTestPlanetAndBiome (Creates a ‘test planet’ and biome for testing)</li>



<li>additem (Item ID) (Value) (Add items using a code and value – see below)</li>



<li>player.addperk (perk ID) (Add perks at will)</li>



<li>psb (Unlock all available ‘powers’)</li>



<li>tfc (Toggle free-cam to fly around the map with a camera)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-starfield-commands-item-codes">Starfield Commands – Item Codes</h3>



<p>Here are the best Starfield item codes you’ll need.</p>



<ul>
<li>Credits: 0000000F</li>



<li>Digipicks (Lockpicks): 0000000A</li>



<li>Ship Parts (Repair Ships): 0003FB19</li>



<li>Med Pack: 0000ABF9</li>



<li>Trauma Pack: 0029A847</li>



<li>Regulator (Pistol): 0002CB5F</li>



<li>Coachman (Shotgun): 0026D96B</li>



<li>Magpulse (Rifle): 23606</li>



<li>MagSniper (Sniper): 0002EB45</li>



<li>Sidestar (Pistol): 0026D95D</li>



<li>Old Earth Hunting Rifle (Sniper): 0021BBCD</li>



<li>Peacemaker Spacesuit: 0013F97D</li>



<li>Reactive Experimental Nishina Helmet: 65926</li>



<li>.27 Ammo: 002B559C</li>



<li>Caseless Shotgun Ammo: 002B4AFB</li>



<li>6.5mm Ammo: 002B5590</li>



<li>7.77mm Ammo: 0004AD3E</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-starfield-cheats-on-xbox">How to Use Starfield Cheats on Xbox</h2>



<p>If you want to use Starfield cheats and commands on Xbox, you’ll need to have a PC – that’s the caveat at play. As Starfield is ‘Play Anywhere’, you can access your saves across the two different platforms. That means you can open Starfield on PC, enable the cheats, then boot up your save on Xbox, and the commands and cheats will still be applied. </p>



<p>Again, this will still disable achievements and can result in a corrupted save or crashed game. </p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/contrary-to-popular-belief-final-fantasy-and-warframe-voice-actor-ben-starr-is-not-a-gerbil-breeder.1063971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ben-starr-wikipedia-gerbil-breeding-final-fantasy-warframe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ben Starr has had a wild past couple of years. A professional actor for over a decade, Starr’s star turn in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> as main character Clive Rosfield put him on the map in the world of video games, and his good looks and oddball sense of humor took things from there. He’s since <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amassed a sizable online following</a>, something in which he takes great pride. He also likes to mess with his fans. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Starr_(actor)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Starr’s Wikipedia page</a> claims he was “president of the gerbil breeding society” at his alma mater, University of Durham. This is not, strictly speaking, true.</p><p>Starr, who has posted videos of himself as <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1752344712663417281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tifa from<em> Final Fantasy VII</em></a>, a very sexual version of <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1832784072700989503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s <em>Astro Bot</em></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1719716479111692583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a glitched-out cube from <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a>, among others, loves a good bit. So when I mentioned his Wikipedia page during an interview at a <em>Warframe: 1999</em> press event in LA last week, he happily finished my sentence for me.&nbsp;</p><p>“Gerbil breeding,” he said with a look of satisfaction on his face.&nbsp;</p><p>"I did a podcast once where I said, 'You can change my Wikipedia, and I won't ever change it back. I don't really care,'" Starr told Aftermath. "And someone did. So the fact is, no one's ever changed it or checked, and I haven't changed it. I should do more due diligence, but I quite like this scenario where somebody is like 'One more question...' and I'm like 'There you go. You read my Wikipedia.' I love it."</p><p>Despite his far-reaching reputation as a vaunted gerbil breeder, Starr does not plan on ever trying his hand at turning two gerbils into significantly more.</p><p>"I would know nothing about that, and I would never want anyone to think that I would breed gerbils,” Starr said. “I love gerbils, but I think gerbils should breed by themselves of their own free will. I think gerbils should be allowed to live on their own terms. I shouldn't be their lord and savior and enforcer of breeding. I fight for the rights of all gerbils. I stand here now with gerbils in solidarity saying 'Strike, strike, strike for your rights.'"</p><p>Starr might carry himself with an air of madcap silliness, but he takes his craft extremely seriously. He views games as fertile soil for performances he couldn’t pull off anywhere else, and he’s thrilled that this industry has welcomed him with open arms.</p><p>"I'm fortunate enough to lend my, for lack of a better word, talents to really interesting explorations of the human condition, but on social media, I can be a complete idiot – to be genuine and serious and emotional and vulnerable in a game, but online, I can be a clown at the same time," he said. “I'm really excited to see where the rabbit hole goes, like taking a lot of the learnings I've been fortunate to take from film theory, from stage, to see what I can do in a performance sense – getting on the performance capture stage and seeing what I can do there and push myself in ways that I haven't done before. ... You're not restricted by the way you look. Aesthetics are not important. It's about the essence of your character and what you bring to it. It's honesty reflected in a very different way."</p><p>Starr, who’s recently landed gigs in games like <em>Warframe </em>and <em>Hades 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/events-conferences/ff16s-ben-starr-will-host-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-this-november/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hosting this year’s Golden Joystick awards</a>, is happy to see the video game industry shine more of a spotlight on actors.</p><p>"I think for a long time in this industry, many incredibly gifted performers have been sidelined because people don't often play games for the performance. But there's something like [<em>Warframe: 1999</em>] where they are showcasing the talent,” Starr said. “They're celebrating us as an integral part of what makes this expansion special, and it's been a really cool thing to embrace."&nbsp;</p><p>Starr does, however, wish a few select companies at the top of the food chain would do a better job of respecting the talent that lends so many games their unique voices. Striking, after all, <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t just for gerbils</a>.</p><p>"As a fan of video games, I want to see them made,” said Starr, who is based out of England and isn’t currently part of SAG-AFTRA. “But also as a person who works in [the industry], I want to see them done in a fair way that rewards the incredible amount of work that goes into performance and certainly how we can as fans engage with games, which I think more and more and more you've seen [involves voice actors]."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The nonstop barrage of jokes, then, belies Starr’s awareness of what he views as a responsibility to fans.</p><p>"There's a desire to paint fans and parasocial relationships as very dangerous things, and I get that,” he said. “I'm sure those can exist. But as a fan myself, I recognize how to interact with performers and know when to step back. I know my responsibility. It's my responsibility to let fans know that I'm engaging in a way that's healthy and in no way anything other than that. I think we get it: I'm a playful idiot. If you want to play along with me, I'm playing games with you. … How do we nod and wink and understand that, fundamentally, this is all pretend, but at the same time respect and venerate the work?
