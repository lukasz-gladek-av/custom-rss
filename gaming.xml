<p>The team at Bungie has sat down in front of a live crowd to carry out one of the most exciting reveals in recent years – <strong>Marathon gameplay</strong>. This game is a reboot of a title that dropped in the 1990s, but it’s coming back to the market in an entirely different format: an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Bungie has put a lot of stock into Marathon; that much is certain. The extended showcase that revealed Marathon gameplay was a big-budget affair in a full-fledged studio packed with Bungie employees and guests.</p>



<p>And it makes sense because Marathon looks fantastic.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>The gameplay trailer for Marathon was stunning, showcasing how the core gameplay mechanics will work. This is a much more manageable extraction shooter that uses arcade elements. There are on-screen prompts, a helpful UI and HUD, and contextual pings sitting front and centre.</p>



<p>‘Death is not the end’ is the running theme in this game, and Bungie has designed Marathon to be a flawless team-based shooter.</p>



<p>It’s all about adapting to ever-evolving games that never go the same way twice. </p>



<p>You can see what I’m talking about in the extended gameplay trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Marathon | Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZvJIQoWIQP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>There’s so much to soak up in the extended gameplay trailer. We get a look at some of the maps and Runners, which are the cybernetic characters that players will control in Marathon. We’re seeing invisibility upgrades, energy shields, scanners, and many other augments. There are traversal and movement mechanics that keep things fluid, but it all depends on your Runner.</p>



<p>The team stressed that the gameplay loop will feature ‘costs’. No one Runner is without a weakness. For example, if one character can overdrive and move faster, they’ll overheat, and it will impact them in another way.</p>

I won't lie, sometimes when I hear a string of words like "beautiful hand-drawn Metroidvania with challenging combat etc., etc.," my eyes do start to glaze over a bit. It can be a bit buzzwordy! But, gosh, that there <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-eternal-life-of-goldman">The Eternal Life of Goldman</a> looks a bit stunning doesn't it? It was shown off last month during Nintendo's Not Switch 2 Direct, but earlier this week it received another trailer offering another look, and more importantly, who'll be composing it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There'll actually be a few people making music for the game, though the trailer is geared around Yasunori Nishiki, whose work you'll have most recently heard in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>: Rebirth through a few arrangements. He's worked on a few other Square Enix games too, like helping out on Final Fantasy 7 Remake and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, and he's the lead composer for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> series. I've not played any of them but I have heard a few tracks from them and they all have quite lovely scores, so Nishiki seems like a pretty damn good get.

<p>
He'll also be joined by the likes of Kevin Penkin (Florence, Star Wars: Visions), Mason Lieberman (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-legends-wild-rift">League of Legends: Wild Rift</a>), and Pete Lepley (Wargroove, Sky Rogue). The new trailer is quite cute, as it's framed as Nishiki not having started working on any music yet, with the other three composers giving him some friendly, perhaps contrasting advice.
</p>
<p>
The music that has been made so far is sounding good too. I'm really quite fond of how the game has an elderly protagonist too, despite being an action-focused game. Love it when a game knows anyone can be the hero!
</p>
<p>
Currently The Eternal Life of Goldman doesn't have a release date, but you could always <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

<p>Bungie has revealed that Marathon, an ambitious first-person extraction shooter, will be released on September 23, with a closed alpha coming soon. This information was revealed today during a live showcase hosted by the game’s developers.</p>



<p>In case you’ve been left out of the loop, Marathon is an ambitious extraction shooter that has serious sci-fi vibes. It’s colourful, innovative, and exciting, and it has been described as accessible and more social than your average extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Read on to find out more about the Marathon release date.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-escape-will-make-me-god">Escape Will Make Me God</h2>



<p>Marathon stands out immediately from the opening trailer that revealed the game’s release date. The palette pops on the screen, and everything from the class systems to the in-game abilities are exciting and punchy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full reveal trailer:</p>

<p>An extraction shooter isn’t necessarily what we expected from Bungie, the team best known for Halo and Destiny, but we’re here for it. It’s a reimagination of one of the toughest genres in gaming, with the team having created a never-before-seen vibe that still retains that core gameplay loop that you’d expect from an extraction shooter.</p>



<p>Marathon is effectively a reboot of a game that surfaced in 1994 – but it wasn’t an extraction shooter, of course. This is a total pivot that ‘does justice’ to the original title and ‘pays homage’ to the game’s creator.</p>



<p>This is a team-based extraction shooter that features cybernetic characters tactical of ‘tactical and fast-paced combat’. It will be released with several maps that players can explore at will, battling ‘worldly threats’, AI enemies, and other players. It’s all about looting, completing quests, and getting out again without succumbing.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Marathon? Let me know what you think in the comments, or check out the community on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is about to become an even better-looking game with the NaturalVision Enhanced mod, which promises to bring the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>The new version of the popular mood now available for the original version of the game has been showcased this week with some brand new screenshots that highlight the stunning visual improvements it will bring. In addition to the brand new improvements, the developer behind the mod, Razed, confirmed on <a href="https://discord.gg/gtav" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> that they have been able to enable an unused feature in Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition which casts additional shadows from all light resources, resulting in more depth and detail in the vast majority of scenarios, as highlighted in some <a href="https://content.razedmods.com/enhanced">comparison screenshots</a>. A release date for the mod, which will be launched for free, has yet to be confirmed, but a trailer is already in the works, so it shouldn't be long until we see more of this mod in actual action.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is, without a doubt, the best way to experience the fifth entry in the series ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI release later this year on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. In addition to providing a great experience that looks better than ever, the new version of the game is likely also a<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-v-enhanced-edition-preview-grand-theft-auto-vi/"> preview of some of the tech</a> players should expect to see in the upcoming new entry in the series, although it will be only until the PC version until the game's gorgeous visuals will run at anything beyond 30 FPS if how the Enhanced Edition runs on CPUs on par with those powering current generation consoles is of any indication.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about this version of the game in Alessio's<a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-enhanced-makes-the-12-year-old-game-look-great-again/"> analysis.</a></p>

            <p>
The time is almost upon us all to prepare for the end of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and by end, I mean the RPG's final big update. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/larian-studios">Larian</a> cheekily shared last year that it'd be getting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-expanding-yet-again-with-12-new-subclasses-including-drunk-monks-teleporting-beekeepers-and-shadow-sorcerors">one final hurrah</a> in spite of the fact they'd said that patch 7 would be the last major one. Now, in a quick little video posted to the official Larian YouTube channel yesterday, the developer confirmed that patch 8 will be dropping April 15th next week. There's even a special little livestream coming April 16th, 9am EST/ 2pm BST where senior systems designer Ross Stephens will be chatting about the game, alongside a look at the new patch.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It's also quite a doozy of an update! For starters, there's cross-play coming with this one meaning you'll be able to play with, well, anybody. There's also a photo mode coming with this game, something that'll really elevate Baldur's Gate 3 to the 2000s era dress-up game it deserves to be. Looks pretty in-depth too, lots of settings to fiddle around with, lots of ways to make your party members look even hunkier.

<p>
The biggest addition to the game is definitely all the new subclasses. There's one for each of the main classes, all of which come with new abilities, summons, cantrips, that sort of thing. Clerics will have access to the Death Domain subclass, for example, which comes with some new necromancy cantrips and spells. 
</p>
<p>
I quite like the look of the Wizard's Bladesinging subclass, which lets you use a sword to cast your spells, plus an ability that gives you "supernatural speed, agility, and focus, plus gives you a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make."
</p>
<p>
Larian have said that there might be a few smaller updates to come, but in the meantime they're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-devs-tease-future-non-dd-games-say-morale-is-super-high-were-doing-our-own-thing-again">cooking up something new</a>, whatever that is.

<p>The playlist features 45 tracks, the synth score "providing the perfect backdrop to Mio and Zoe’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures with unique tracks ranging from atmospheric to high tension".</p>
<p>"Since every chapter in Split Fiction is so different, we wanted to do things similarly to the visuals and the gameplay and throw the player into a new world of music," Grefberg explained in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/news/spilt-fiction-official-soundtrack-out-now">Q&amp;A</a> about the game's music.</p>
<p>"Sometimes the inspiration comes from common genres like trance or drum and bass or cinematic new age music. Other times the inspiration originated from a single instrument. For example, the traversal music throughout most of Summit is based on our own live recordings of hangdrums. There are a few subtle references in there, but most inspiration is based on the foundations of genres or instruments taken in our own unique direction."</p>
<p>Grefberg explained that to create the dynamic score that jumps between different genres, the composers "sat down and played through with what we had, which often meant something very much work-in-progress".</p>
<p>"We discussed the overall feeling before we spent some time (usually one to two weeks, depending on available time) to just try out ideas and moods. We then sat down with Josef and listened together and came to a final direction. Sometimes we got them down right away, other times we went through a few iterations to get the feeling and mood that we all aligned with and Josef enjoyed."</p>
<p>Split Fiction shifted 1m units in 48 hours, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">another million copies in its first week</a> - and now it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">officially record-breaking, too</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Guinness World Records revealed Hazelight's part-fantasy, part-sci-fi adventure "broke an impressive three world records within days of its release", becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-prototype-game-in-the-works-playtester-claims/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-prototype-game-in-the-works-playtester-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Prototype game is reportedly in development. According to a user on reddit by the name of Bigbyy, they were given details about a new game in the series as part of a recent study group session.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jxhctt/upcoming_call_of_duty_black_ops_7_leaks_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">user claims</a> that the game will see Alex Mercer return as its protagonist. Gameplay will reportedly feature shapeshifting and transforming into other people in order “to infiltrate areas”. Lastly, it will be based in New York City.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Bigbyy regarding these claims, and was told the following:</p>



<p>“[It] was YouGov survey which asked me to sign an NDA and confirm that I would not disclose the contents,” they said. “It then confirmed a series of features that upcoming games will include and how popular this was with me [percentage wise]. It was not a playtest but did specify that these features were already planned as part of upcoming games.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has yet to fully verify the validity of the claims, but felt it was a rumor worth covering. As always, until it’s verified by Insider Gaming with more details or officially announced by Activision, take all of the information with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>The Prototype series hasn’t seen a new game release since 2012’s Prototype 2. That game was also ported to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2015, but there has been any news surrounding the series since. After Prototype 2’s initial launch, Activision say that the game “did not find a broad commercial audience” leading to layoffs at its developer Radical Entertainment.</p>



<p>In addition to claims of a new Prototype game, the same person revealed some <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">details planned for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. Per his claims, the game will feature a co-op story mode with up to four players, updated omni movement, changes to Zombies, and more.</p>



<p>What do you think of a potential return of the Prototype franchise from Activision? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1873/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/more-black-ops-7-details-have-been-leaked-by-a-playtester/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another Call of Duty playtester has given more details on what you expect with Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The leak comes courtesy of Bigbyy on Reddit, who claims that he was a part of a recent Call of Duty study group. Allegedly </p>



<p>Most of the details have already been reported on by Insider Gaming in some capacity, including that the game is a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2 sequel</a>&nbsp;and that the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original zombies crew is likely making a return</a>. We’ve also previously reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 has already got all of its six round-based zombies</a> planned and figured out. </p>



<p>That being said, the playtester has given some further details on what to expect, and the information lines up with what Insider Gaming has heard but has yet to report on. Caution, spoilers ahead – It should also be stressed that this is a <strong>study group</strong> and is a means to gauge interest and feedback, meaning some features might not make it into the final game.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-details-leaked">Black Ops 7 Details Leaked</h2>



<p>According to to the playtester, this is what to expect in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<ul>
<li>The story will focus on 2035 and will be a follow up to the Black ops 2 story. Story will also involve Woods and Mason.</li>



<li>Story mode will allow for up to 4 player co-op</li>



<li>Story will also include a big open world map titled “Avalon”</li>



<li>Omni movement will return and include wall running.</li>



<li>Zombies mode will have the original crew return as mulitiverse variations (Dempsey etc)</li>



<li>Zombies mode will have a Tranzit remake</li>



<li>Zombies will be round based</li>



<li>Zombies mode will also have a difficulty toggle, a “wonder vehicle” and a more story focused role as well</li>



<li>Zombies mode will feature the largest round based map ever created (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more details by Insider Gaming here</a>)</li>



<li>Multiplayer will feature a 32vs32 player mode</li>



<li>Will feature some remakes of popular maps in a 2035 futuristic Japanese style theme</li>



<li>Plan for everything to have a progression level system, including grenades, killstreaks and perks</li>



<li>Plans for multiplayer progression to carry over from Black Ops 6</li>
</ul>



<p>To me, and again, a lot of what’s been said here lines up with what we have already reported and what I have heard, but the last thing that the user claims it a little bit of a headscratcher and a curveball.</p>



<p>According to the user, he said got a glimpse of some kind of view of another Prototype game, where he said, ”&nbsp;I also saw that another Prototype is planned with Alex Mercer returning as the protagonist. Gameplay will involve shapeshifting, transforming into other people to infiltrate areas and the game will be set in New York.”</p>



<p>Of course, it’s entirely possible if the majority of the Call of Duty information comes to fruition, but nonetheless, it’s a tad weird to have another game as a part of a study group! </p>



<p>I’ve reached out to the user for verification of his claims and should I receive them, I will update the article. </p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has outlined what's coming up in the first event of 2025, Cursed Hollow, when it launches on 17th April.</p>
<p>Fans can expect "new bone-chilling challenges and secrets to uncover", as well as a number of "exciting changes from previous events" including new reward categories, daily map rotation - nine of which have been seasonally decorated - and gameplay modifiers as you unearth mysterious Jackalope totems.</p>

<p>Players can also expect "additional reworks" recommended by the Phasmo community itself, including two different types of rewards: Community and Personal. Completing the former will grant points that go towards the wider community pool, whilst personal rewards are precisely that. However, to unlock personal objectives, players have to work together to reach the Community goal first.</p>
<p>"During Cursed Hollow, Ghost Hunters will need to work together to identify ghosts, complete objectives, and search for Jackalope totems hidden across the game’s maps," the developer teased. "But beware: interacting with the totems will have eerie effects, some helpful, and some that may hinder even the most experienced of teams."</p>
<p>"We're really excited for Cursed Hollow to launch next week, and once again have our players join together to tackle this season's Community goals," said lead developer and director of Kinetic Games, Daniel "Dknighter" Knight.</p>
<p>"We've made some changes this year following direct feedback from our previous events; from the new reward split, to some interesting new gameplay modifiers. Our community is everything, and we're always looking for ways to improve - we hope everyone enjoys what 'Cursed Hollow' has in store for them this Easter, and keeps the feedback coming on what they want to see in the future."</p>
<p>Cursed Hollow will kick off on 17th April and run for three weeks. Phasmophobia is available on PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X/S</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blue-prince-will-steal-your-time-just-like-balatro.1162641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647451/blue-prince-review-architectural-roguelike-balatro<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I know, I know. It’s become a bit of a faux pas to describe one game using another and yet I am compelled. After a few hours with <em>Blue Prince</em>, I realized this game elicits the same feelings in me as <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">Balatro</a></em>. Not because it has anything to do with cards or passive-aggressive clowns named Jimbo, but because those hours I played passed as breezily by completely unnoticed as they did when I was knee deep in the poker roguelike. <em>Blue Prince</em> is a time-stealer and as with <em>Balatro</em>, you will be happy to be robbed.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is an architectural puzzle mystery game from developer Dogubomb. In it you play as a young man who inherits his uncle’s magical mansion. On your first day at the house you receive a note laying out the rules by which you will earn your inheritance. This house has 45 rooms. Find the secret 46th room that’s not displayed on any of the mansion’s blueprints (get it, <em>Blue Prince</em> / blueprints) and the house is yours. </p><p>To find the 46th room you must create or “draft” rooms one after the other connecting them via their doors. You start each day with 50 steps and passing into a room takes one step (or more depending on the type of room). When you run out of steps you are exhausted and forced to retire for the day. At the end of every day, the layout you drafted is reset and you must start all over again with a blank mansion.</p><p>At its heart, <em>Blue Prince</em> is a roguelike puzzle game laid over an overarching narrative involving the secrets of your extended family. Its main mechanic is drafting rooms and laying them out over the mansion’s 5x9 grid. Each room comes with any number of doors that open in one of the four cardinal directions. You build your map each day by trying to connect as many rooms with as many doors while avoiding dead ends as much as possible. </p><p>There are so many different types of rooms to draft with their own strengths and weaknesses. Bedrooms, for example, reward you with additional steps extending your day. Closets yield goodies like keys to unlock doors but are dead ends. Drafting a puzzle room early, like the billiard room or the parlor, rewards you with gems to draft higher quality rooms like the library or the laboratory. The more rooms you draft, the more likely you are to encounter rooms you haven’t seen before revealing secrets and clues that will help you in your journey. </p><p>On top of trying to draft rooms that will yield you the most benefits, you’re also trying to draft rooms in the correct sequence. Tinkering with the breaker box in the circuit breaker room, will let you open the door in the garage, bringing you that much closer to finding the 46th room. It’s all an interconnected, incredibly dense puzzle game that makes use of every ounce of your brain power to solve and then some. You <em>will</em> need to take notes – the game tells you as much. And any time I need to write stuff down to play a game effectively, it is cooking with the highest quality gas.</p><p>Solving puzzles in <em>Blue Prince</em> brings all my powers of spatial, mathematical, narrative, and memory reasoning to bear. And the thing I love about it, something I don’t think I’ve ever said about a video game ever, is its pacing. <em>Blue Prince</em> unfolds almost infinitely — solving one puzzle leads to the next and on and on like a fractal of overlapping mysteries. Some of those mysteries are easy and satisfying to figure out. When I first encountered the darkroom, the lights went out. Not only could I not see what was in there, the darkness forced me to draft the next room without seeing what it was or if it was a dreaded dead end. But I remembered from the circuit room seeing a darkroom setting on the breaker box.</p><p>On my next run, I made sure to draft the circuit room and flip on the power before drafting the darkroom. When I went in, <em>voila</em>, the power stayed on and I collected a treasure trove of new clues. </p><p>But the game’s other mysteries are less intuitive and can lead to frustration that no amount of note taking can assuage. The dartboard in the billiard room is a mathematical puzzle with different colors on the board corresponding to different functions. At first it was easy enough to figure out: blue next to a number means addition, yellow is subtraction, pink is multiplication, and purple is division. Instead of recalling the elementary lesson of PEMDAS, order of operations is determined by working from the inside of the dartboard out.</p><p>After about 20 or so days, when I had everything down pat, the dartboard began throwing new symbols and colors that were far less intuitive. I just could not figure out what to do and it got so frustrating that I avoided drafting the billiard room altogether, locking me out of obtaining valuable keys.</p><p>(<strong>Author’s note</strong>: another extremely frustrating and frankly unacceptable thing about the billiard room is that solving the puzzle requires the ability to see in color and as of this writing there are no colorblind settings. From comments about this on social media, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/557876/blue-prince-colorblind-color-assist-mode-update">the developers are working on deploying colorblind options</a>, hopefully soon.)</p><p>There is a story in <em>Blue Prince </em>but from what I’ve seen so far, it has little bearing on the puzzles and isn’t all that interesting. There’s a mystery involving members of your family’s political leanings, a missing author, and a disgruntled employee, but I’m so hungry to figure out how to open the door to the basement that I don’t pay it much mind. I’m about 27 hours in, which feels pretty hefty for a puzzle game. And I feel with all that I’ve uncovered and all I think I have left to uncover, I could go 30 hours more and it would pass in the blink of an eye.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With the president putting a 90-day pause on the bulk of his announced tariffs and instead maintaining a 10-percent across-the-board tax, Nintendo is stockpiling consoles in the U.S. in advance of the planned June 5 launch date. In other news, new puzzle game <em>Blue Prince </em>has taken critics by storm, becoming the highest-rated game so far this year, and the developers of <em>No Mercy</em>, a visual-novel-style game with subject matter many find reprehensible, announced that they will be pulling the game from Steam, though they also defended the game in the same announcement.

		<p>I love a good pun, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> is right up there with the best of them.

		<p>Anyone buying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition will not be getting the fullest, most complete version of the game. Nintendo has now confirmed that the Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC is not bundled in with the Switch 2 Edition release, whether phsyical, digital or upgrade, and will instead remain a separate purchase.</p>
<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">IGN</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said, “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC. That DLC is available as a separate purchase.”</p>


<p>Pricing has been a major bone of contention around the Nintendo Switch 2 release, and this will be another sour note for the Switch 2 Editions of a small selection of games. These upgraded versions of games can bring technical improvements and added content, but are premium upgrades that start at $10 for Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">in contrast to free patches that will be made for other titles</a>. The two Zelda games included will, however, have their Switch 2 Edition upgrades made available through Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack.</p>
<p>Breath of the Wild’s Switch 2 Edition brings improved resolution and performance, support for HDR, an a new Zelda Notes feature for Nintendo Switch smartphone app. Sticking with USD for simplicity, that brings a $10 price hike over the original release, whether both afresh as a $70 game, or with a $10 upgrade cost. The Expansion Pass is then a further $20 on top.</p>
<p>The Expansion Pass DLC for Breath of the Wild features two DLC packs: The Master Trials, which added some new game modes with the Trial of the Sword challenge, Master Mode difficulty, and the Hero’s Path feature, and The Champion’s Ballad, which added a new dungeon, story content, gear, additional challenges and the Master Cycle Zero motorbike.</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_and_splatoon_2_will_get_new_physical_releases_with_dlc_included_in_japan">a Japan-exclusive Expansion Pass edition of the game</a> which added the DLC onto the game card, there’s no Game of the Year edition, so it is most straightforward to keep the Switch 2 Edition purely for the new console upgrade. Nintendo has been very strict to maintain the price of their games over the Switch generation, and any newcomers are really seeing and feeling that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/">Nintendo has clarified</a> that physical Switch 2 Edition games will on Switch 2 cartridges and will not bundle a download code with an original Switch card.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-developers-comment-on-sbmm/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-developers-comment-on-sbmm-and-the-vast-amount-of-battlefield-labs-leaks.1162590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-developers-comment-on-sbmm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest saga of Battlefield leaks, the community has voiced its frustration of leaked code suggesting that SBMM is in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>The news first surfaced earlier this week, after internal code obtained by the Battlefield Labs playtests showed that Battlefield 6 will have matchmaking commands to match players of similar skill – AKA, Battlefield 6 will have Skillbased Matchmaking (SBMM).</p>



<p>Predictably, the community was up in arms about the leak, with most voicing their frustrations that they would much rather have a server browser as games such as Call of Duty, which notoriously has a harsh SBMM system, is no longer enjoyable. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-developers-weigh-in-on-sbmm">Battlefield Developers Weigh in on SBMM</h2>



<p>David Sirland, one of the Lead Producer’s on Battlefield 6 took to the closed Battlefield Labs Discord server to explain (uploaded by Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Old_Doubt5886</a>) the situation around Battlefield 6 and SBMM. </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“PSA: 2042 has SBMM according to this definition – this is what I tried to detail above yesterday. It has a factor of skill, its used, but ping and time to game is the TOP priority, and in a 64 player game our want is to spawn a server that starts as soon as possible – thus the skill factor is negligable in terms of sorting into servers. Also with a party that is more or less ignored. Just for clarity – saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is “Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad”.</p>



<p>But that doesn’t make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams – no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn’t be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?</p>



<p>Just to calm this thing down a tad – the fact a skill value is in the matchmaker (it’s been there since we started being able to matchmake BTW) – doesn’t mean we are going with a heavy handed SBMM solution. Quite the opposite, Battlefield is at its best when you play the all out war modes with friends and different types of players – we do not want to limit that.</p>



<p>All of this is also true (skill being important for team balancing) regardless of in which way you join the server For reference, did you feel like the BF labs playtests were heavy handed SBMM? No? then we good. It’s the same matchmaker and settings we’ll use (with tweaks if we find any issues of course).”</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – EXCLUSIVE – EA’s Next Battlefield Game Will Also Have a Free-to-Play Battle Royale</a></strong></p>



<p>So, at face value at least, the current theories on Battlefield 6 and SBMM are unwarranted, at least where Sirland is concerned. Of course, things are subject to change during development, but <strong>that’s why</strong> Battlefield Labs was set up an NDA’s have been enforced. On this, Battlefield Community Manager <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/comment/mmkie21/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">T0TALfps</a> weighed in on the recent leaks.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay&nbsp;<strong>enough,</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield Labs is about building and collaborating on the future of Battlefield, and we want to do that in the correct way. I want to remind everyone things that are taking place in Battlefield Labs may or may not make their way to the final finish line. This is the greatest thing about this program, it allows us the ability to get creative, see what works with those involved, gain educated and informed feedback from those that are participating and potentially spot bugs around the features too. We’ve long wanted to implement this program, responding to your requests for greater involvement and a return to this type of reactivity around all things Battlefield.</p>



<p>There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it. We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to.</p>



<p>Information and content that gets shared&nbsp;<strong>is out of context</strong>&nbsp;and often with a narrative wrapped around it that is doing damage to the trust and transparency we want to establish. Things simply are not the same when it comes to hearing about something out of context versus actually experiencing it – or reading about it in detail with the correct descriptions around it.</p>



<p>While the allure of brief internet fame might be tempting, it undermines our efforts to remain open and communicative. And quite honestly, if that is your intention, then I question where this aligns with the interests of our, THIS, community.</p>



<p>We all can agree that we wanted to have an environment that allowed for testing and collaborating once again. We want to be as transparent as we can be, you have seen us return to the values you once recognized in us. We all want to make Battlefield play like Battlefield, but we cannot do it if the trust continues to be tampered with. We must be allowed the ability to do it right – alongside you all and in the correct way.</p>



<p>And to all those of you who do wish to see things grow, we commit to you that we are reading your comments and feedback in and out of the program, we are seeing and exploring your experiences with Battlefield, and we are paying attention just like what we stated in our&nbsp;first Community Update&nbsp;&lt;3</p>



<p>If you want to be a part of the moment and participate in Battlefield Labs you can sign up via&nbsp;<a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">http://go.ea.com/bflabs</a>&nbsp;and rest assured that your moment will arrive.</p>



<p>One final reminder that when it comes to features, content, functionality, and more – it is only official when we share it and we are comfortable with the topic at hand.</p>



<p>To those who are here for community and wish to see a bright future for Battlefield, thank you – truly. I truly believe community has been closer to the development of Battlefield than ever before, and I have been around for quite some years now. What we’re doing is something different, I know that you feel that too. It is truly refreshing to see you experience pre-alpha content and share your thoughts but for us to then react and change in a short time frame – it’s something else.</p>



<p>Rules aren’t fun, but they exist to make it better for us all. Thank you to those that are abiding by them, but thank you for your trust and time too to make this great for you – our community.</p>



<p>Let’s keep doing this together, and do expect more Community Updates in the very near future!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/12/nintendo-clarify-that-physical-switch-2-editions-will-not-feature-download-codes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has clarified that physical versions of Nintendo <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Switch 2 Edition</a> games will feature <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> game cards, and will <em>not</em> be an original Switch card and a download code.</p>
<p>Various things have kicked up a storm in the wake of the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal, and one of the biggest bones of contention has been with regard to Switch 2 Editions upgrades of various games. Thanks to a mixture of ambiguous wording on Switch 2 Edition game packshots – see the gallery below – and erroneous statements by customer support, it was believed that Switch 2 Editions could be an original Nintendo Switch cartridge alongside an upgrade code to redeem at the Nintendo eShop.</p>


<p>We were caught up with this story as well, and apologise for the confusion.</p>

		
		

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/">Vooks</a>, a Nintendo spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>That physical versions of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card (i.e. they are exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards, with no download code). Alternatively, some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging, with no game card.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, Nintendo’s Switch 2 Edition games – which includes upgrades for the likes of Breath of the Wild, Kirby and the Forgotten Lands and Super Mario Party Jamboree – will all be coming on the new red Switch 2 specific game cards. This means that they will not be usable with the original Switch consoles.</p>

<p>Third parties may make use of digital downloads in a box, or (while not explicitly stated) even the new Game Key cartridge, which acts as a digital license to download and play the game.</p>
<p>Of course, if you already have a game for Nintendo Switch, you will be able to purchase an upgrade via the eShop to get the added features and enhancements.</p>
<p>Switch 2 Editions are typically a mix of boosting game graphics and performance with a new build of the game for Switch 2 and added content. However, there are also a number of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">Nintendo first party games that will receive free updates</a> to support the Switch 2’s increased power, typically in instances where there’s just a bump to resolution and frame rate with minimal extra work.</p>

<p>Marathon is the next contender in the extraction shooter space, attempting to carve out a name for itself alongside games like Escape from Tarkov. It’s a sci-fi epic that prioritises teamwork and collaboration over milsim mechanics, and for that reason alone, it’s a refreshing title that promises to disrupt the genre.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’re answering a critical question that many have on their mind: ‘Is Marathon coming to Xbox and PS5?’</p>



<p>Read on to learn what we know about Marathon on console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-will-marathon-be-on-console">Will Marathon be on Console?</h2>



<p>Most extraction shooters are only ever released on PC. The top dog is Escape from Tarkov, which is PC exclusive. Then you’ve got competing titles like Gray Zone Warfare, Marauders, and Dark &amp; Darker, all of which are locked to PC platforms.</p>



<p><strong>Marathon will be released on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC</strong>, emerging as one of the few extraction shooter titles on console platforms.</p>



<p>It’s a revolutionary thing that’s sure to turn heads, given that it has been compiled by the creators of Halo and Destiny.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Marathon on PS5</a>, and the Xbox link is coming soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-marathon-crossplay">Is Marathon Crossplay?</h2>



<p>Marathon will be a fully crossplay and cross-save title, which means you can play with your friends on PC if you’re playing on Xbox. It also means that if you play on PC then want to pick up your progress on PlayStation 5, you’re more than welcome.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most seamless ways to play games, and it makes sense that Bungie would support it, given how progress works in other titles that the team has worked on.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Marathon? Let me know what you think about this upcoming extraction shooter in the comments, or check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

And that's before the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="884f35ab-23fc-4898-a479-26bb82edbd6b" href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">Trump administration's tariffs postponed US and Canada preorders</a> as Nintendo contemplated raising the price further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the more consumer-friendly announcements came in the form of how Nintendo is handling the upgrades for the two Switch entries in the Legend of Zelda franchise, Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. If you already own those games, you can upgrade to the Switch 2 version, which adds improved framerate and resolution, as well as access to the new Zelda Notes app functionality, which offers additional lore in the form of voice memos, the ability to send items and Ultrahand blueprints to friends, and a voiced GPS system. Even better, Nintendo offers the updates at no additional cost for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. However, we learned this week that the upgraded version of Breath of the Wild does not include the downloadable content.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, <em>Game Informer </em>obtained a statement from&nbsp;a Nintendo spokesperson confirming this news. "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC," the statement said. "That DLC is available as a separate purchase."&nbsp;</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4cbc59d9-7786-4152-bf54-2de7cee7f034" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC arrived in two parts spread across 2017: The Master Trials and The Champions' Ballad. The Master Trials allows Link to participate in the Trial of the Sword, a combat-based gauntlet where he must take down waves of enemies. As he clears the three trials, he bolsters the Master Sword's attack strength. The second part, The Champions' Ballad, adds a new dungeon, more story content, and the most difficult boss battle in the game. If you complete this DLC, you earn Master Cycle Zero, a motorcycle that Link can ride around Hyrule.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The expectation that the downloadable content would be included with the upgraded edition likely stems from the industry-wide trend where new-gen versions of older games are released as "definitive editions," consisting of both a remastered version of the game and all the content that came out for said title. With Breath of the Wild more than eight years old, it would stand to reason that Nintendo could make the Switch 2 version follow that philosophy, but it would make for a tricky pricing structure when the Expansion Pass is $20 and the upgrade to the Switch 2 version is $10. This also further highlights the fact that Nintendo's first-party games rarely go on sale, even when they're nearly a decade old.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild launched on Switch and Wii U in 2017 to widespread critical acclaim. It earned a 10 out of 10 from&nbsp;<em>Game Informer&nbsp;</em>and went on to claim the outlet's Game of the Year award in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
