			<p>Once Human received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-dev-promises-strict-action-against-pvp-exploits-being-abused/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">huge new update</a> today, allowing players to explore a completely new region in the free-to-play supernatural shooter. To celebrate the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release of the update</a>, there is a trailer that showcases the content that players will be able to dive into. It's two minutes long and showcases the frosty North that players can explore and attempt to survive in. This new update brings in a brand new scenario for players to experience, named The Way of Winter. There is plenty of new content to experience and a lot of difficult enemies that players will have to come up against while fighting off the harsh conditions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Once Human | The Way of Winter Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OyIXqa9ikZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since Once human's release, The Way of Winter is the largest and most content-rich scenario update since the game originally came out, as this scenario is focusing heavily on hardcore multiplayer survival in the north. Players who want to tackle this scenario will find themselves in the northernmost part of Nalcott, where there are new Deviations to encounter as well as new Deviants to fight off. However, Deviants aren't the only threat in this region, as there is also the Vultures faction that is responsible for domineering the region. Since this scenario is the largest to be released since Once Human came out, the scenario will take place over 35 days in total, with four different stages. There is also the season break, which will last 28 days during this time.</p>
<p>To make sure that this scenario is as immersive as possible, The Way of Winter scenario adds temperature as a survival mechanic. On top of micromanaging your sanity, energy, hydration, and stamina, you now need to make sure that you are regulating your temperature in both hot and cold climates. To be able to withstand the drastic temperatures, you'll have to learn how to craft heat and cold-resistant gear as well as cook spicy dishes, similar to the mechanics seen in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</p>
<p>For this scenario in particular, playing in co-op is recommended as players will be able to survive for longer in the Thermal Tower building, which can be scouted and secured quicker with a large group of friends to help you.</p>
<p>Those who are eager to get stuck into this update will be glad to know that the chilling event is already available, and you can begin your journey to the north of Nalcott to try and survive the harsh weather climates. Bring a friend or ten if you can.</p>

Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn bonus Strange Coins from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

But, while playing <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, I discovered an important detail that I thought was worth sharing. Namely, that pooping raises your main character’s stats. So, for the sake of SEO and because I want to have an article with this headline, let’s break down how that works.</p><figure><figcaption>These are the days to poop. Credit: Atlus</figcaption></figure><p>The toilet that your protagonist needs to use to become a better person is on your gauntlet runner, which is the big ship with legs you eventually get. The world of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> has a five-day week with thirty days in a month like a weird version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">French Republican calendar</a>. The days of the week are Flamesday, Watersday, Arboursday,&nbsp; Metalsday, and Idlesday. The time you want your character to poop is Idlesday, which is the fifth day. Pooping on this day will permanently increase your luck by 1. Doing so on the other days will do nothing statistically, so basically, if any day of the month is divisible by 5, you want to crap. The reason for this is left ambiguous, but showering also gives you experience, just as in life.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Should I? Credit: Atlus </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Wait a tick... Credit: Atlus </figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Eureka! Credit:Atlus </figcaption></figure><p>Anyway that’s it. I hope this guide was useful in your<em> Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> playthrough, but also in your day-to-day life, although I would probably have more than one bowel movement every five days.</p><figure><figcaption>An alternate text of the same interaction.

			<p>One day before the yearly CitizenCon event, Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizens-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> an expose on Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games, painting a relatively bleak picture of the game's future. According to Henderson, CIG employees working on stuff that needed to be ready for CitizenCon were asked to work on weekends, too. After employee complaints, CIG changed the policy to allow for Sundays off, provided they had already worked 56 hours that week.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the mood isn't great, and there are deep-seated issues to be found. Firstly, funds seem to have dwindled despite Star Citizen raising a record-breaking $790 million. Over a hundred jobs were cut at Cloud Imperium Games earlier this year at the Los Angeles and Austin offices, while wage increases have stopped. Meanwhile, there are lots of expenses that many feel are unnecessary, such as the huge bar located on the ninth floor of CIG's shiny new Manchester building or the pricey custom Star Citizen furniture that decors the same office.</p>
<p>More importantly, though, the development is taking too long for a variety of reasons, including CIG founder and frontman Chris Roberts. A former employee told Henderson:</p>
<p><em>I've genuinely been sat in meetings that got derailed for 30 minutes so that the placement of objects that players are likely never to interact with could be discussed in detail. There's just no actual focus on getting the game done.</em></p>
<p>Another added:</p>
<p><em>Sometimes the most basic features can be reviewed by Roberts half a dozen times, for it then to be scrapped or changed on the 7th review.</em></p>
<p>The much-vaunted <a href="https://wccftech.com/starengine-video-shows-off-stunning-visuals-for-an-open-galaxy-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Engine</a> is also reportedly one of the reasons for the slow development of Star Citizen. As you might remember, the game was originally based on CryEngine but then <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-switches-engines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moved on the Amazon Lumberyard fork</a>. At this point, though, it has gone through so many changes and modifications that CIG developers described it as a Frankenstein of a game development tool that is unwieldy to use, to say the least.</p>
<p>Going back to the funding issue, Henderson says Cloud Imperium Games plans to leverage Squadron 42's relatively close launch to fund Star Citizen and possibly Squadron 42 sequels, too. However, the insider reckons the game actually just made it to the feature complete stage, despite CIG telling fans that development stage had been reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/squadron-42-feature-complete-polishing-phase-no-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly one year ago</a>. Beyond Squadron 42, CIG plans to continue selling in-game ships at high prices, but Henderson also uncovered another potential venue: a third game that would take place in a medieval fantasy setting. Needless to say, details are scarce on this project.</p>

		<p><em>One thing the entire Remap staff have in common is they've all in longterm relationships with their partners. For Rob and Patrick specifically, that means relationships that are entering into their second (!!) decades. Relationships change over time, but they also have a habit of condensing, as people come to understand one another more deeply, and more and more of their lives overlap.</em></p><p><em>Some habits and hobbies overlap, while others...look, it's okay to have YOU time. But what defines YOU time, and how does it change over the years? And as you better define who you are and how each of you slot into the relationship, doesn't it become harder and harder to carve out time to develop your own interests?</em></p><p><em>And somehow, this conversation all starts because of Silent Hill 2...</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I couldn’t help but laugh during a moment on last week’s podcast where, after excitedly accepting my offer of a download code to play<em> Silent Hill 2</em> on your PlayStation 5, you ended up not spending any time with the game before your partner declared it was not a spooky evening.</p><p>My wife, on the other hand, looked at me booting up<em> Silent Hill </em>2 and went “thank god, I can go to bed early.” If she can find an excuse to be in bed before 10pm, she’ll take it. Despite our shared love of horror, it does not really extend to watching me beat the crap out of flesh blobs and trying to figure out what arcane pieces are needed to progress past a jukebox puzzle.</p><p>What it got me thinking about was something we <em>don’t </em>have in common: partners who are into video games. My wife has never had a problem with my career or the amount of time that I spend playing video games, free time or not. This is a woman who, prior to me getting seriously into football and arguably becoming a bigger nerd of it these days, would spend Sundays at the bar down the street, cheering with strangers, while I tracked down another side quest in<em> Fallout 3</em>. Our worlds eventually overlapped on sports, but games have never quite clicked with her.</p><p>There have been a few exceptions and both involve, perhaps not shockingly, zombies.&nbsp;</p><p>When <em>Left 4 Dead 2 </em>came out, she was entranced by the pitch. This was an era where games still supported split-screen, so we booted it up on Xbox 360, and gave the game a few rounds. A first-person-shooter is a tough genre to dive into when you haven’t really played a video game since high school, and the moment that ultimately broke everything was realizing climbing a ladder meant looking up and moving forward. It was too much. Years later, when the first season of Telltale’s <em>The Walking Dead</em> was a phenomenon, we’d play that game side-by-side, with my wife calling the shots on the decisions. It was so fun that we ended up playing a few different Telltale games that way, too, before falling off them the way the rest of the world eventually did.&nbsp;</p><p>Generally speaking, my habits overlap with my wife’s. I love <em>sports</em> but she, at least, loves football, and has no problem spending all afternoon with the neighbors, beers in hand, watching the games roll on. (But I will say her interest drops sharply when the Chicago Bears are done, win or lose.) Our tastes on movies, television, and especially horror are on the same page, as well, which means there’s rarely any real debate over what we’re watching on a given night.</p><p>I like that. I love that we have many genuine reasons to spend time with one another, where the rare “free time” we get from the kids isn’t also fighting for our personal interests. There have been times in my life where I see photos of couples with two TVs lined up next to each other, as they dig into a game side-by-side, but I actually sorta like that video games are my thing?&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe I’d feel differently if she suddenly got into them, too, but it <em>is</em> nice to have your own thing.</p><p>My mind started off with video games, but I suppose this dynamic applies to all sorts of hobbies.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Patrick actually wouldn't mind his wife helping calm his nerves in Silent Hill 2. Credit: Ko</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob:</strong> The longer MK and I have been together the more overlap there is. It might just be that as stuff like grad school and the challenges of our earlier careers recede, there’s simply more time and it’s easiest to fill it with stuff that’s already right in front of her because I’m so into it already. Or maybe we were uncannily well-matched from the start, we just wouldn’t fully realize it until a decade or so had passed. But sports went from my thing to our thing. Games were always her thing, but she got into them way more once I was working as a games critic. But the exact things she likes are different than the things I like. Her relationship to these hobbies is always distinct from mine.</p><p>I’ll give you an example. We both adore the Mercedes coupe I bought last year. It’s the greatest car we’ve ever owned, a sleekly luxurious highway cruiser. Like a lot of luxury touring cars, the E450 has different drive modes but the major ones are Comfort and Sport. I like Comfort a lot: it’s still a responsive and agile car, but it’s also got this incredibly smooth and quiet ride that honestly makes it one of the most comfortable places I spend time. Seriously, there are times I hit stop-and-go traffic that adds 45 minutes to my drive home and I honestly feel more relaxed because it’s like a spa day got extended.</p><p>In Sport mode, the priority is on handling and responsiveness. The sensitivity of the controls goes up sharply, and the suspension firms up so you can really feel the road. It’s twitchy and kind of harsh but it gives you quick access to pretty much all the clubs the car has in its bag. It’s… kind of unpleasant, if you ask me. But MK loves it. It’s turned highway ramps into her absolute favorite bits of road when traffic is light, because you can get a taste of what the car can do without actually going too fast. Where I love the Mercedes’ poise and comfort, she loves its eagerness and power. As she often says, there is no law about how <em>quickly </em>you get up to the speed limit.</p><p>A few weeks ago, she came back from having the car detailed and told me that while she was killing time and looking for something to do, she realized there was a karting track nearby. There was nobody there, so she got to go set laps by herself and absolutely <em>loved </em>it. She ran laps until her head was about to fall off her shoulders. She came back from that thinking she might want us to get a “track day” car someday, where it’s comfortable to drive on city streets but can absolutely carve up race courses. Think of stuff like the Mazda Miata / MX-5, the Chevy Corvette, or an M-model BMW and you get the idea.</p><p>Now I love racing and I love cars but this is not something I’ve ever felt a strong pull to do. Would I like to take a nice car onto a track? Absolutely. But would I go to the trouble of making that happen? Probably not. But my interest in racing and cars led to her having this moment of realization about how compelling driving can be.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a landmark release as it signals a proper return to Treyarch’s iconic brand of CoD. You are likely clamoring to know the full extent of the Black Ops 6 release date and its launch details. Luckily for you, we have all the details below.</p>



<p>Treyarch is back at the helm after a few years of Modern Warfare. Black Ops 6 continues Treyarch’s storied history with innovation and historical relocation, with new mechanics such as omnidirectional movement, intelligent mantling, and maneuverability. We are also zapped back to the late 1980s to rewrite history via a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-black-ops-6-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign</a>.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is set to be one of the most exciting Call of Duty titles in years, and if the wait is proving too much, fear not, check out when it releases, its launch time, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-black-ops-6-release-date">When is the Black Ops 6 Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The next era of CoD is almost here. Credit to EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 <span>will be released on&nbsp;<strong>October 25, 2024</strong>, and its launch date will see the latest CoD title come out with</span> all guns blazing on the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>



<p>Since the dawn of man, Call of Duty titles have typically been released in the final week of October or the first week or so of November. Black Ops 6 falls into the former here, and its Friday launch should see many expectant players kickstart their weekends with a bang.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-time-does-black-ops-6-launch">What Time Does Black Ops 6 Launch?</h2>



<p>According to the official Call of Duty website, Black Ops 6 is set for regional rollouts, including 9 pm PDT / 12 pm EDT / 10 pm CST / 5 am BST.</p>



<p>You can check out the complete list of regions and times <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pc-trailer-specs-preloading-intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, provided by Activision: </p>



<p><strong><span>October 24</span></strong></p>

<li><strong>Los Angeles:</strong> 9 pm PDT</li>



<li><strong>Mexico City:</strong> 10 pm CDT</li>

<li><strong>Tokyo: </strong>1 pm JST</li>



<li><strong>Sydney:</strong> 3 pm AEDT</li>
</ul>



<p>Depending on your area, it will either be a late-night binge or an early-morning start. That’s 5 am for me, nothing the booming sound of a grenade can’t fix. With Black Ops 6 having no early access this time, all aspects of the FPS go live simultaneously: the Campaign, Zombies, and Multiplayer.</p>



<p><span>I’ll be awake and ready to deploy into&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-nuketown-in-black-ops-6-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nuketown</a>&nbsp;and attempt to drop banger after banger.</span></p>

                <p>Since 2012, Sony has been in legal battle in the European Union with Datel, the parent company behind the Action Replay cheat software. Sony argued in the European court that Datel infringed upon its copyright, but now the battle is over and the court has come down in Datel's favor. </p><p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that Datel's cheating software didn't change the source code or the internal structure of Sony's games. Because Action Replay only temporarily changes the content for cheats, it doesn't violate the intellectual property of Sony that is protected under European law. It's a victory for Datel, but it may not open the floodgates for more cheating software.</p><p>"No doubt developers and publishers of cheat software will rejoice. [But] they should not be too enthusiastic about this judgement," said Dr. Andreas Lober--a partner in the international law firm ADVANT Beiten--during a discussion with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/european-court-of-justice-rules-against-sony-in-lawsuit-over-action-replay-cheats" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "For procedural reasons, the Court only ruled on one single ground: whether merely changing variables of a computer program qualified as an unauthorized modification. When publishers of multiplayer games act against providers of cheat software today, they typically rely on other legal instruments which are not affected by this decision, e.g. breach of EULAs and unfair competition."</p><p>Lober went on to explain that third-party software created for cheats or mods may still be considered acts of copyright infringement on other legal grounds. Any company that intends to make a business out of marketing that software will likely run into more lawsuits from Sony or another game publishers. And just because Sony lost this round, it still has plenty of legal options to explore against any would-be infringements from other companies. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/surgent-studios-puts-entire-game-division-on-hiatus-undisclosed-number-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Surgent Studios, the creators of the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing/">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a>, have reportedly put their entire game division on hiatus after announcing the choice to do this in a<a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1847194285545848933" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> statement on X</a>. They have asked for help to find collaborative partners, as they haven't yet secured funding for their next project. As a result, they've put the team on notice for redundancy. It doesn't specify whether that is the entire team or just part of it, but this isn't the first layoff experience for Surgent Studios, either. Shortly after Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was released, Surgent Studios laid off "just over a dozen people" in June, which was three months after the release of Tales of Kenzera: ZAU.</p>
<p>Surgent Studios first appeared on the map in 2020 after announcing themselves as Silver Rain Studios before eventually re-branding. The company was founded by Assassin's Creed Origins and House of the Dragon actor Abubukar Salim. The company not only dabbles in games but has also worked in movies and TV shows, with a focus on bringing "a pioneering philosophy to storytelling across film, television, games, and emerging platforms." Whether this announcement means that the other branches of the company will also be affected remains to be seen. The careers page from the official Surgent Studios website has been removed, which isn't a fantastic sign of what's to come for the company.</p>
<p>While the game was well received by critics and the general audience who played it, it didn't perform well commercially. As a result, Surgent Studios is unable to fund its next projects, as it didn't particularly profit from the release of Tales of Kenzera: ZAU. Now, the team at Surgent Studios is working on a new prototype, which it claims is "darker, edgier, and more visceral" than the previous title. However, the prototype is said to still retain all "ZAU's high-octane combat and cultural depth." While they are working on the new prototype, they are said to still be releasing some upcoming content and updates for ZAU.</p>
<p>In the comments, plenty of people are being supportive of the company, and are tagging studios that have the potential to collaborate with Surgent Studios. Some are also suggesting for them to create a Kickstarter or GoFundMe, as this is something that has been successful for many indie games in the past, especially games such as the "My Time At" series.</p>

The new patch added a difficulty option that some players feel is too frustrating while tweaking other parts of the game to make co-op missions harder, resulting in backlash from the community. Now, the devs are promising more changes as players complain that the game isn’t as fun as before. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196653" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="196653,195618,195752" data-current="196653"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Star Wars Classic Returns &amp; More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196653/196653_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22209.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029"><em>Space Marine 2</em> launched last month</a></span> to rave reviews from critics and players. The sci-fi third-person shooter quickly became one of 2024's biggest games, and it’s only set to grow more as developer Saber Interactive has promised future updates that will add new features, cosmetic options, modes, missions, weapons, and more. However, players are worried about the future of <em>Space Marine 2</em> as its most recent patch has nerfed co-op weapons and items, making it harder than ever to finish missions. </p><p>On October 17, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?l=english&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4538031058666780902?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s 4.0 patch arrived on all platforms</a></span>. It added a new co-op mission featuring a big new alien monster to kill, but it also made changes that players aren’t happy about. These include limiting how often you can collect ammo from crates, making it harder to parry enemy attacks with certain melee weapons, substantially nerfing a powerful weapon used against bosses in Operations, and lowering armor effectiveness on the Ruthless difficulty setting. </p><p>Ruthless was previously the highest difficulty setting in the game. However, 4.0 added a new Lethal difficulty setting intended to be the hardest option. But some players think it might be too impossibly hard. One reason is a new trait found in this difficulty option that requires you to stick close to your co-op buddies to regain armor. This is hard enough with a coordinated team, but is damn near impossible with randoms. And it also forces all classes to stick together and makes it harder to be a sniper or a tank. </p><h2 id="h105163"><a id=""></a>Players and devs react to the 4.0 update</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-up-in-arms-over-bullst-nerfs-have-you-learnt-nothing-from-helldivers-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-up-in-arms-over-bullst-nerfs-have-you-learnt-nothing-from-helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The community is not happy about these changes</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61qmm/this_game_brought_me_into_the_golden_era_of/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61qmm/this_game_brought_me_into_the_golden_era_of/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Reddit</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61lkx/yeah_this_is_no_fun_anymore/?share_id=8mbk2WeKa1nrN4VdX9Bk9&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SpaceMarine_2/comments/1g61lkx/yeah_this_is_no_fun_anymore/?share_id=8mbk2WeKa1nrN4VdX9Bk9&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players have posted</a></span> about how the Operations mode now feels annoying to play, even on lower difficulties, due to these changes.

It’s not enough to change the game’s overall rating, but it seems to indicate that players might start review-bombing the game. </p><p>Thankfully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1847275025528696871&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1847275025528696871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the devs have already responded to the backlash</a></span> and negative feedback. On October 18, Saber Interactive and publisher Focus posted a message on Twitter confirming that they were aware of all the backlash and had plans to release another patch with new balance changes “next week.” </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We closely read your feedback regarding the latest patch for <em>Space Marine 2 </em>and we’re actively working on another one including balancing fixes. It should release next week.  Again, thank you for your support.</p></blockquote><p>For now, that seems to have cooled the community off as players wait to see what Saber’s next patch tweaks in <em>Space Marine 2</em>. </p><p>And to be fair to the developer, the patch notes for this new update did indicate that the devs found Operations “too easy” and these changes were intended to fix that. But they also included a message stating that they wouldn’t know how much more difficult they had made co-op until the update was live and in players’ hands, adding: “We will continue to monitor those changes and will continue to adjust the balance of Operations mode. This is not the last change.” Well, they were right about that last part. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ricochet was active during the Black Ops 6 beta, and Activision says cheaters were able to complete around 10 multiplayer matches during weekend one before being removed.</p><p dir="ltr">"After tweaking our systems and deploying new detection methods for weekend two, we cut that time in half to five matches. That timing achieved our Time to Action goal. In fact, 25% of all weekend-two bans happened during the first match a cheater ever played," the publisher says.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Black Ops 6 will launch with the following upgraded protections:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">An updated version of the kernel-level driver</li><li dir="ltr">All mitigations, including Damage Shield, Disarm, Splat, Hallucination, and others will be live</li><li dir="ltr">New machine-learning behavioral systems, focused on speed of detection</li><li dir="ltr">New machine-learning detection models to analyze gameplay to combat aim bots</li><li dir="ltr">Upgrades when Ranked Play launches, which include continuous examinations to determine if leaderboard placements are accurate</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Activision revealed that new Warzone-specific anti-cheat features are also active, and players can expect a future blog post to discuss those methods.</p><p dir="ltr">For future advancements to Call of Duty's anti-cheat, Activision says the Ricochet team has been working on a suite of tools that uses AI to find and fight cheaters. The publisher says it already has data from cheaters, but now it's using data from the pro players in the Call of Duty League to learn more on the behavioral side.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cheat developers can't hide player behavior," the publisher says. "How people play -- the legit, the phony, the good, and the bad -- gives us information and we use that to build ways to pick those bad folks out of a lineup."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also reminds players that anti-cheat is a constant effort. "We are always working to stop and thwart the efforts of cheaters. It's an effort we're deeply committed to, through and through."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this new report on Ricochet comes just a day after Activision confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-anti-cheat-was-falsely-banning-legitimate-players-but-all-accounts-have-been-restored/1100-6527252/">players found a workaround in a Ricochet detection system</a> that allowed them to target legitimate players in Warzone and Modern Warfare 3, resulting in false bans that have since been reversed.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-lightless-world-wants-to-redefine-the-action-roguelike-genre/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Lightless World, the upcoming action roguelike game from The3rd.One Games, aims to redefine what players expect from the roguelike and survivor genre.</p>



<p>With a focus on dynamic progression, skill customization, and cooperative gameplay, it offers a fresh twist on the fast-paced, wave-based combat popularized by titles like Vampire Survivors and Soulstone Survivors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It comes as a passion project from the team at The3rd.One Games and its founder and CEO Yannis Ziakas. Ziakas is also the CEO and founder of Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>“We wanted to create something that looked better, played better,” Ziakas said. “We were sick of being in Discord and sharing our screens. We wanted to play together.”</p>



<p>Rather than settling for familiar mechanics, The Lightless World builds on the genre with a procedurally generated talent system. Every run presents players with a unique skill tree and nodes hidden beneath a fog-of-war, filled with rare abilities and stat boosts waiting to be discovered. This ensures that each session offers new challenges and character builds, encouraging experimentation and making every playthrough feel distinct.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“It’s a mini game down to exploring the fog of war in your talent tree, reconnecting the nodes, the chance of nodes spawning as rare or epic nodes, and so on and so forth,” Ziakas said.</p>



<p>The game will feature 12 playable archdemons when it fully launches with the goal of making sure that no two runs feel the same.</p>



<p>“You could play as a Barbarian – Ker’beroth – and play 300 hours, and none of your runs will be identical,” Ziakas added.</p>



<p>It’s not just a single-player experience, either. Unlike most roguelikes that focus on solo play, The Lightless World introduces multiplayer, letting two players sync up for intense, coordinated runs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ziakas believes there’s a simple reason that nobody, so far, had made a game like this multiplayer yet because, as he put it, it’s “pretty hard”. Making a game like this multiplayer took quite a bit of research and development to make sure everything from collisions to spells being in sync to hit markets and more were all done the right way. With things like the spell synchronization and combat, the game creates a dynamic experience that scales with teamwork, enhancing both the strategy and fun.</p>



<p>Thematically, the game flips the typical hero narrative by casting players as archdemons defending their realms against invading forces of good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“It’s reverse horror,” Ziakas said.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As players control archdemons, they must gather souls to reclaim their lost immortality while fending off waves of knights, archangels, and warriors. This narrative twist breathes new life into the genre, framing the endless waves of enemies with a compelling backstory that sets the stage for future updates and expansions.</p>



<p>The game’s visuals, powered by Unreal Engine 5, aim to elevate the genre with semi-photorealistic environments inspired by Doom and Diablo. Despite its graphical ambition, The Lightless World is optimized to run well on a variety of platforms, including the Steam Deck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Some of us have Steam Deck and run it without any optimization,” Ziakas said while also hinting at the potential for future mobile and console ports.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With simple but effective controls – WASD for movement, space for dodging, and R for Ultimates– the game remains accessible to a wide audience. Players will even soon be able to activate auto-targeting for more casual play as well as to be more accessible for players.</p>



<p>While the original plan was to release shortly after Steam Next Fest, where there is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2406480/The_Lightless_World/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently a demo available</a>, The3rd.One Games is targeting a February or March 2025 Early Access release. This time window, Ziakas says, allows the game a better chance of standing out in what can be a crowded genre. Whenever the official release happens, however, he’s certain that what the team has built will provide players with a consistently fun experience.</p>



<p>“It has a lot of depth and difficulty and complexity in gameplay without losing its identity as a roguelike game,” he said.</p>

"If we like the opportunity, we'll take it." Bloober Team released the Silent Hill 2 remake on October 8 to glowing critical reception <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week">and strong sales too</a>, leaving many fans of the previously dormant horror franchise eager for more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I do believe that everything's possible.</p></div><p>"There are opportunities that you have to seize," Piejko added. "Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible."</p><p>The decision will also be in the hands of Silent Hill publisher Konami, though it is presumably happy with how the Silent Hill 2 remake turned out. Nothing has been announced regarding another remake or full sequel yet, however.</p><p>Bloober Team has already announced one of its new projects in the aforementioned Cronos: The New Dawn. Coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam, the game is set in a post apocalyptic 1980s Poland and promises a "twisted time travel story" in Bloober Team's first foray into an original survival horror franchise.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">In our 8/10 review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, IGN said: "Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>The MW3 campaign was the worst-received Call of Duty campaign in recent memory. In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-review-return-of-the-makarov/1900-6418152/" data-ref-id="1900-6418152">GameSpot review</a>, S.E.

However, the campaign's reception allegedly did not affect Black Ops 6's development. In conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-dev-raven-didnt-react-to-modern-warfare-3-campaigns-terrible-reception-we-were-already-pretty-locked-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, associate creative director at Raven Software John Zuk said, "...we were already pretty locked in on the story we were telling and the missions we were creating."</p><p>Reportedly, MW3 was originally envisioned as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-was-developed-on-a-very-rushed-schedule-report/1100-6519074/" data-ref-id="1100-6519074">an expansion for Modern Warfare 2</a>. When it was upgraded to a full release, developers reportedly crunched to develop a new campaign in just a year and half (Call of Duty usually has a three-year development cycle). In contrast, Black Ops 6 has been in development for four years. According to Zuk, "The extra development time certainly gives us time to do a little bit more prototyping and a little bit more trying something out, finding out if it's fun and if it works and throwing some things away."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/10-10-games-head-of-publishing-says-uk-has-become-hostile-to-new-game-studios<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843310/Funko_Fusion/">Funko Fusion</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer 1010 Games was brought to life in 2021 by a number of TT Games veterans, who'd all worked on various LEGO games at the Warner Bros.-owned studio. They were experienced with the family-friendly 3D action genre, and wanted to make an "older" version with Funko pops taking over for the beloved branded bricks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What they found, head of publishing Arthur Parsons explained to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, was that starting up a brand new studio in the United Kingdom was incredibly difficult. So difficult in fact, that he's worried the country as a whole is losing out on fresh talent and opportunities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's not enough support," he explained. "When you look across the UK industry, it's no surprise that there's not more studios starting up."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parsons' bluntness was refreshing—he seemed as eager to ring the bell about the UK's funding troubles as he was to show off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Funko Fusion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (which admittedly caught my eye because of how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.polygon.com/horror/456218/funko-fusion-review-impressions">surprisingly nightmare fuel-inducing</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> it was).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What's to be done about the UK industry's struggles? Parsons explained it's not just what the government can do, but also what needs to be done in the investment community if they want to keep revenue flowing into the British isles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Little funding and less assistance">Little funding and less assistance</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parson's description of the beleaguered UK funding scene sounded like a confluence of small catastrophes, some borne out by the economic impact of Brexit, and others by shrinking interest in game companies in training the next generation of developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1010 Games is privately funded, so Parsons said they dodged a number of initial challenges that come with standing up a studio. "It would be great if there were more grants, more incentives to do stuff," he said. "We've had to do a lot of stuff off our own back, off our own money."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lack of funding and incentives, he worries, is disincentivizing companies from hiring and training junior developers. Over half of 1010 Games employees were hired fresh out of university—a fact Parsons is proud of, but he's frustrated they're one of the few companies reportedly doing so. He said "one of the biggest problems the game industry is facing is a shortage of talent because people aren't hiring juniors."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We as an industry are not being sustainable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like other developers trying to make game studios and not VC-friendly exit vehicles, Parsons said the team ran into headwinds chasing funding because investors weren't interested in an old-fashioned company that turns out premium product. Funders wanted to hear the words "web3," "AR," or "VR" whenever they took a pitch. ("We weren't cool enough," he joked.)</span></p><p>Image via 1010 Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers in the UK have also been hit hard by a Catch-22 that's impacting up-and-coming indies everywhere: the cost of the "first-playable." Investors are (perhaps rightly) not satisfied anymore by prototypes and pitch decks, and want to see vertical slices and first-playable that capture the general feel of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Funko Fusion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game inspired by the TT Games</span><br><span data-testid="content-text">Lego series and produced by its veterans, it took a solid chunk of time to answer</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a reasonable request...but both of those products cost money. Money that can only be secured with decent funding. He agreed with a sentiment expressed by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">the developers at Mobius Digital</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that investors and publishers need to become more comfortable "funding failure."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The British government does offer game developers some incentives in the form of tax relief, but that tends to benefit existing studios. New companies have to deal with challenges like legal fees or securing office space and equipment. "I can imagine that for other people, there's they're just hitting a brick wall, and that's maybe why nothing sort of happens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Increasing government funding for games or the arts might be a tough sell in the UK at this moment. A number of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66937239">structural challenges</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are keeping down the country's economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and challenges like an underfunded National Institute of Health require faster intervention than flagging video game development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Parsons said he'd like to see the country introduce students earlier to the basics of game development, noting that the UK has great universities, but that careers in the creative arts aren't pitched the same way in primary schools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He hopes one day students can be encouraged to pursue careers in game development with the same gusto as they are engineering or medicine.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Help me get my feet back on the ground">Help me get my feet back on the ground</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges Parsons described are the same ones developers are enduring across the globe, but calling out what struggles the United Kingdom is facing is still important, as it will need unique solutions to weather the storm. A </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/working-paper/2019/the-impact-of-brexit-on-uk-firms">Bank of England report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from early 2024 shows the country is still struggling to attract new investment years after exiting the European Union, meaning developers are chasing some of the same funds for the last few years.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The British Film Institute </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-indies-to-receive-510000-in-lottery-funding">did announce today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that it's awarding £510,000 to four projects meant to support developers across the nation, but it's a drop in the bucket for what will be needed in the years ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So what's to be done in the country that gave us the ZX Spectrum, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sea of Thieves</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alien Isolation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Probably a lot. A shortage of juniors, more flexible investment strategies, and proper incentives could go a long way. But it's fair to say more will need to be done to help the nation compete in a business that's becoming more global by the day.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

Fellow environment artist Julian Hofman, meanwhile, said the remaster has a “fresh generation of moss,” and I know you’re probably thinking, “Who cares?” but in terms of a game whose best moments are often found in just quietly walking around its hyper-realistic sci-fi landscapes, well, I do!</p><p>The prospect of more populated cities also sounds really neat. “We added many more places for NPCs to stand, sit, work and fulfill their needs,” said senior technical game designer Brian van Nunen. “We gave them more varied schedules to increase movement and liveliness in different areas. We also tried to make creative use of existing animations. For example, there is now a woman feeding geese at the well in Meridian, reusing an existing sowing animation.” Yes...ha ha ha...yes!</p><p>That’s not to say I’m on board with all of the changes.

These remasters also have a tendency to wash out the colors and mood of the original in the process of trying to make them look even more  realistic. While the remaster looks very impressive in a lot of ways, some of the changes seem to to be the result of artists not knowing when it’s time to just leave their masterpiece alone. </p><p><em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster </em>is out on PS5 and PC on October 31.

                <p dir="ltr">Rare has finally broken the pirate's curse in Sea of Thieves that kept players from bending their knees. That's right--buccaneers can finally crouch in the multiplayer action-adventure after exactly six years, six months, and 27 days.</p><p dir="ltr">But who's counting? Well, Rare actually is, as the Sea of Thieves studio shared the fun fact <a href="https://x.com/seaofthieves/status/1847001696133661153?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>. A short clip also shows off the flexibility of a pirate in the game, with some silly fanfare to celebrate to boot. It's all part of a Season-14 push for "sneaky strategies," per the developer.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 14 for Sea of Thieves is officially called Making Mischief. On top of crouching, Rare highlights the free update's additions of disguises, a grapple gun, and a blowpipe with darts in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ernQH53ZUD4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouTube video</a>. The newest season went live yesterday, October 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Sea of Thieves became <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-launch-these-four-games-on-rival-platforms/1100-6521266/" data-ref-id="1100-6521266">one of four Xbox games to come out on rival platforms</a>, as the multiplayer-centric title launched on PS5.
