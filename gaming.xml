<p>Makes a change from climbing up and down trees</p>

<figure><a title="Miyamoto dk Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53e3e436b4539/miyamoto-dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Cast your minds back to the year of our lord 2017, and you may remember we reported on how a certain Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto liked to play a pre-release version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/03/shigeru_miyamoto_spent_a_lot_of_time_climbing_trees_in_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">climbing up and down trees repeatedly for treats</a> that the devs would leave for him. No, this isn't a wind-up, and he can do what he wants. He created the series. Jeez.</p>
<p>Now, as revealed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/top-bananza-donkey-kongs-long-awaited-return-is-a-literal-smash-hit">The Guardian</a>'s interview with Bananza's producer, Kenta Motokura, (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/nintendo-icon-shigeru-miyamoto-spent-his-time-testing-donkey-kong-bananza-smashing-and-digging-in-one-spot-which-tracks-following-his-hour-long-breath-of-the-wild-playtesting-stint-just-climbing-trees/">GamesRadar</a>), it seems "Shiggy" has an equally unique and stylish way of playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which involved simply smashing and digging instead of doing anything that would further the campaign along whilst playing a pre-release version of the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4nykwto&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Motokura let slip (thanks) that whilst the team had the legendary creator check the unfinished adventure occasionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Instead of progressing through the game, he just stuck to one point, smashing and digging around a lot. It was a good thing to see him playing that way … it proved that there are a lot of things that players could potentially be curious about in the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. We're gonna be honest, this is how we play, too. Not quite sure what the issue is.</p>
<p>Of course, by having the man transfixed like this on one spot, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team was able to ascertain that they <em>were</em> onto something good with the basic mechanics at the very least, which, with something as freeform as Bananza and all the voxel-based destruction presented therein, could be a challenge to keep track of.</p>
<p>As Kazuya Takahashi, the game's director, explained in the same interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For this sort of game, where you can destroy anything, there was no precedent...So in that sense, we did struggle with various things. Developing the levels was quite challenging. For each stage, we wanted to make sure that the level would be fun even without that destruction element.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when he's just messing around, it seems, Miyamoto can't help but be useful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware, the development studio behind the Souls series and the wildly successful Elden Ring, is deep into the development of an unannounced project that could launch in 2026.</p>



<p>According to a new report posted on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">MP1st</a>, the Japanese development studio is working on multiple projects at this time, including updates for Elden Ring Nightreign, the Nintendo Switch 2 game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> and a third, unannounced multiplatform project codenamed <em>"FMC"</em>. This project is expected to be in an advanced state of development, and should release no later than next year, if there are no delays. Sadly, the codename doesn't tell us much about the project, but as the report noted, projects belonging to the Dark Souls and Armored Core series traditionally have codenames starting with F, so the new project could be related to either series.</p>



<p>If the unannounced project being developed by FromSoftware is indeed related to the Dark Souls series, it will be very interesting to see what it will be. In the past, series creator and studio's president Hidetaka Miyazaki said that the series was done, so it could be either a spin-off or a remaster. In the latter case, it would probably be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster/">rumored remaster</a> of the third entry in the series, as both the first and the second entries in the series have already been remastered.</p>



<p>The aforementioned Elden Ring Nightreign is the latest game released by FromSoftware, a co-op game which masterfully combines the mechanics of Elden Ring and the Souls series with some roguelite elements. You can learn more about the game now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>

		<p><em>A reminder, before we begin. In early April, the a pro-Palestinian human rights movement BDS that’s pressuring Israel by promoting boycotts, divestment, and sanctions against the country added Xbox to its boycott list. </em><a href="https://www.bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox?ref=remapradio.com"><em>Learn more here.</em></a></p><p><em>Microsoft laid off more than 9,000 employees in and around its gaming divisions earlier this month, while at the same time spending billions in trying to convince the world its advancements in AI are going to change the world. It's even spending more than a billion to [deep breath] </em><a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/a-week-after-layoffs-linked-to-ai-cost-microsoft-pledges-4b-to-ai-education/?ref=remapradio.com"><em>something called AI education.</em></a></p><p><em>Xbox, weird green coloring and tank-like controller, used to represent something. These days, it's hard to figure out what it represents, beyond reckless spending, endless layoffs, and countless pivots to trying to figure out the future of games.</em></p><p><em>Today, Rob and Patrick chat about how Xbox did (or didn't) enter their lives when the console first launched in 2002, and the different ways seminal games like Halo signaled a sea change in the relationship between consoles and PCs.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>There were two formative first-person-shooter moments in my friend group: <em>GoldenEye</em> and <em>Halo</em>. These were games that we played often enough with the exact same groups of people that the modifiers in the video games themselves to change how matches played out was never enough; we’d come up with our own house rules that defined how we wanted to play.</p><p>With <em>GoldenEye</em>, I remember that we’d call out one another if someone else was overly relying on determining where someone was based on looking at their section of the split screen on the TV. We also banned people from playing as Oddjob, unless someone was a dick and decided to pick Oddjob anyway. At that point, the group would gang up on Oddjob and make sure they lost.</p><p>It was also a race before someone screamed “GOLDEN GUN,” because the mode where you could one-shot someone was deliriously fun. There was no faster way to make someone upset.</p><p>It was six years in-between <em>GoldenEye</em> and <em>Halo</em>, and while my friends and I still regularly played video games with one another, it wasn’t until <em>Halo</em> arrived that it became an appointment all over again. Hangout sessions after school were determined by “Where are we playing Halo?”</p><p>Because unlike the Nintendo 64 era, where fewer of my friends owned video game consoles and it was largely people using all the ones I’d been amassing in my room, a lotta folks had an Xbox. They played other video games on it, but for young teenagers it was really a Halo box.</p><p>The difference between 1995 and 2001 was also that we were a little older and a little meaner than before. <em>Halo</em> produced legitimate arguments where friends would storm out in protest, especially during moments where it felt like everyone was secretly ganging up to kill one person over another. Most of the time, they were right to be angry, because we <em>were</em> secretly plotting.</p><p>Xbox felt, I don’t know, <em>edgy</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>I was 16 years old, too young to articulate what I found appealing about a new game console other than “hey, it’s new,” because I was legitimately hoovering up everything I could get my hands on in those days. But dude, that launch era up for Xbox was killer in retrospect, and so when I say “edgy” I probably mean “different.” <em>Dead or Alive 3</em> was probably the last time I spent significant time memorizing fighting game moves. <em>Oddworld: Munch’s Odyssey </em>was just plain weird.<em> Project Gotham Racing</em>. <em>Jet Set Radio Future</em>. (I will defend that game!). <em>Gunvalkyrie</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Scrolling through a list of Xbox games produces a reaction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“oh, <em>that</em> game.”</u></a></p><p>There was a sweaty desperation from Xbox that I found appealing. You knew they had something to prove, they didn’t exactly have an identity, and it felt like it wasn’t playing it safe.</p><p>I think you were mostly playing on PC during this era, but what did Xbox mean to you then?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jawfox_photography?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Alexander Jawfox</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I have a hard time figuring out what I felt about the Xbox era versus the 360 era. There was always a mix of trepidation, resentment, and excitement. You have to remember, <em>Halo </em>was going to be a PC game. There had already been major previews for it, it was something I was excited about. The realization that it was going to exclusive to this new console, the pitch for which felt like it was staking out a position between PC gaming and traditional consoles, made me wonder what it meant for the PC. If a home computer developer like Bungie could turn its back on the PC to promote a console, did that mean the PC was going to start losing a lot of games and genres to the Xbox? By the middle of the 360 era, that worry had been compounded by a glut of third-rate PC ports, the abysmal Games for Windows experiment (man, Microsoft not really knowing what to do with all this is nothing new, is it?), and the outright hostility a lot of publishers had to the PC as a platform. The Xbox may have been aimed at Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo, but its success had brought forth a really troubled, frustrating era for PC gamers like myself.</p><p>On the other hand, it did that partially by being really good at translating PC games to a console format. It felt like a <em>miracle </em>the first time I saw <em>Halo </em>running on the Xbox. How could a game that incredible-looking run so seamlessly on a box that cost half what a mid-range PC build would run you? I resented the shit out of that console because outside of strategy games, it was clearly the easiest and best way to play most shooters and increasingly even RPGs now. Sports games existed solely on the consoles, largely thanks to EA’s exclusivity and (temporary) near-abandonment of the PC. When the 360 came out and suddenly it basically had solved all the friction of online play? You didn’t need to be whispering IRC channels and Vent servers to people over multiplayers servers? Meanwhile everything on the PC was a huge pain in the ass and actually getting more so because so many games were lousy ports burdened with terrible bloatware.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Julian LeFay - who oversaw multiple Elder Scrolls games as chief engineer at Bethesda, and is often referred to as the 'father' of the series - is stepping back from game development to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones" following his cancer diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and worked on the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994 and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall, before departing the company in 1998. LeFay briefly returned for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, and pursued various other ventures before setting up independent studio OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls alumni Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
News of LeFay's departure from the project, and from game development as a whole, was announced in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwMyPR8Li6k">emotional video addressed to The Wayward Realms community</a> on YouTube. "Our technical producer Julian LeFay, who I'm sure needs no introduction, has been fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years," creative producer Victor Villarreal explained. "He's fought bravely and strongly but it seems he doesn't have very much time left. He has stepped away from the project to spend that remaining time with his family and loved ones."

<p>
Villarreal also invited fans to "share any words, thoughts, or memories you might have of Julian, as well as any well-wishes you might have for his family." He noted the studio would discuss how the news impacts The Wayward Realms at a later date, adding: "It is something we've been preparing for. Julian has made his vision of the game very clear to the team and we will work tirelessly to bring that vision to life."
</p>
<p>
A separate, lengthier statement from LeFay's long-time friend and colleague Ted Peterson was shared alongside the video. "I could talk stories about our friendship and how we've worked together recently with our team on Wayward Realms as creative and technical directors," Peterson wrote, "but I need to come to the point of this. Julian has been courageously battling cancer. His doctors have informed us that his time with us is limited, and we are preparing to say goodbye to a true legend of the industry."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously, the team has already had a chance to say goodbye and give their individual messages, and I sat by his hospital bed, reading them to him," Peterson continued. "In that case, I was reading them out loud and Julian was giving me dictation to reply back, which is rather hard to do through my tears... To me, this is deeply personal, and I regret every second I didn't spend with one of the most charming, smart, funny, and interesting people I've ever met. It's also a spur to action for me: I will not let down his legacy."
</p>
<p>
"That said," Peterson concluded, "a final quote from the eminently quotable Julian LeFay. He said this at our last team meeting, and I believe it represents him and his beliefs well. 'It is personal. And if it's not personal, then you're just doing work for hire and you'll never have the motivation to accomplish a significant goal.'"
</p>
<p>
OnceLost also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1945983192617652588">shared a follow-up message</a> from LeFay's daughter Shae on its social media page. "The best any of us can hope for is to leave this life and know that we have made a positive impact," she wrote. "That is my dad's greatest motivation to this very day. We are truly grateful for the outpouring of love and support since the announcement was made."
</p>
<p>
"It has reinvigorated both myself and my father and given us a sense of peace in stressful times, knowing of the impact he has made on all of you. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, everyone. We will continue to read the comments to keep our sprits up in the days ahead."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-waterfield-designs-cityslicker-for-switch-2-a-classic-design-lives-on.1247082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="WaterField Designs CitySlicker - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b014b30eaf852/waterfield-designs-cityslicker-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><p>The WaterField Designs CitySlicker is a design that has been around for at least 10 years, and it has barely aged a day. From its full-grain leather front flap to its pleasingly voluminous rear mesh pouch, it’s a case that oozes quality and style, which is just as well given the $129 price tag.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is not a cheap case, we should nip that in the bud right away. But it’s unfair to judge a case on that alone, and when you consider that this is a product that has been handmade in San Francisco with seriously high-quality materials, you’ll realise that although the price is steep, you <em>absolutely</em> get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Its slim profile means it’ll slip into practically any bag that would’ve fit the console in the first place, and the internal padding not only keeps the console in place, but also provides some handy little bonus pockets should you wish to use them, although I wouldn’t recommend putting anything bulky or awkwardly shaped in them, as you could put undue pressure on your console.</p>

<p>What’s more, the padding for the screen is a red microfibre pad, meaning every time you put your console in or take it out, the screen is getting a little polish to take off the worst of your grubby fingerprints. Now <em>that’s</em> service!</p>
<p>You’ve also got five little leather pockets to store some game cards at the front, and although they’re a little stiff at first, the nature of the material means that the more you use them, the easier they’ll be to use. The magnetic clasps on the flap mean everything you put in absolutely will be staying in its place, and that peace of mind is worth its weight in precious materials.</p>
<p>We do have one minor gripe, however, and that’s the rigidity of the case. When your console isn’t inside, it’s surprisingly bendy, and doesn’t offer much in the way of support for itself, no doubt due to the extended length of the case and our old friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">the square-cube law</a>. We’re sure it’s not going to cause any issues, but it’s something to consider should you wish to pick one of these up.</p>
<p>And honestly, if you have the cash, you should. That, or perhaps their magnetic version if simplicity is more your bag (read: case).</p>



<p><em>Waterfield's CitySlicker for Switch 2 is priced at $129 and produced in batches that <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/nintendo-switch-cityslicker-case">you can pre-order from their website</a>. The sample used in this review was provided by the manufacturer.</em></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have made clear that they're still very much all-in on the game right now, with adding more stuff to the good shootery thing they've got going being the main focus. That said, the studio's bigwigs have provided a couple of hints at what the future might hold for them, with the latest being that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3 is "hopefully many years away".</p>
<p>Also, they aren't fans of players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">voting to rename a city on Super Earth 'Gun'</a>, which is a thing that's been going on in Helldiverland lately.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This rare mention of the next Helldivers game is from Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani, who hopped on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1395509386113450106">the game's Discord last night</a>, and was asked to paint a picture of what the next two years of Helldivers could look like.</p>
<p>"I'm very bought into the vision that Micke, Felix, Niklas and Marre (our game directors) and Johan have for the game," he responded, "It's great to be part of the ride. We honestly are focusing on the here and now. HD3 is hopefully many years away." This is one of very few times, as someone who's been covering Helldivers pretty closely over the past year, I can recall Jorjani ever mentioning Helldivers 3 by name.</p>
<p>When he talked about the studio's future on the same Discord server <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-ceo-still-main-focus-next-game-start-slowly-this-year">back in May</a>, he referred to whatever Arrowhead's next project is as "Game 6", which is an altogether more mysterious way to refer to something he said a "very, very small team" would start working on later this year. Meanwhile, Jorjani's predecessor and Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt has very much said Helldivers 3, but only when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-growing-into-helldivers-3-says-arrowhead-cco-pilestedt-taking-design-suggestions-miniguns">suggesting on Twitter</a> that Arrowhead would transform Helldivers 2 into that next game by continuing to update what they've already got on the go.</p>
<p>Nothing in what Jorjani said here contradicts any of that, but assuming the grow-one-game-into-another plan is still on the cards, it's noteworthy that he mentions HD3 by name, rather than just telling folks Helldivers 2's the thing to watch.</p>
<p>Anyway, beyond that, this spot of Discord chatter also saw Jorjani tell another player that the devs have discussed adding support for DLSS and FSR frame generation, but "other more fundamental problems that impact performance" will need sorting first.</p>
<p>Also, he voted for Everlasting Memory in Arrowhead's ongoing poll to pick a new name for the Super Earth city of Remembrance, which players recently helped rebuild via their in-game exploits, and are hellbent on renaming 'Gun' Jorjani joked about Arrowhead possibly naming the city what the studio likes anyway, adding: "I really don't like the name <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gun">GUN</a> personally. but not my decision".</p>
<p>Shooting from the hip there, Mr video game fellow.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/18/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-review.1247058/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>8Bitdo have grown into one of the most unassuming heroes of the controller world in recent years. They’re not flashy or hyper premium, but they continue to top many a gamer’s peripheral list. There’s something unequivocally cosy about a company whose output is consistently brilliant, wrapped up in iconic, often retro-inspired designs, but that do so without fanfare or glitzy campaigns or placements. Their latest is a serious dose of modern controller design though, and the 8Bitdo Ultimate 2 line up has all the hallmarks of a modern pro controller, infused with 8Bitdo’s inimitable charm.</p>
<p>The Ultimate 2 Wireless is (quite shockingly) a 2.4Ghz wireless and Bluetooth-equipped controller, designed for use across PC with a USB-C dongle, and Mobile with Bluetooth. But it’s also a controller with a secret, because a swift update to the latest firmware means it’s also able to play with the Nintendo Switch 2 as well, so long as you accept that this really isn’t designed with Switch in mind.</p>



<p>The Ultimate 2 Wireless bears all the hallmarks of an 8Bitdo controller. It feels incredibly solid in the hand, with good-quality plastics that reminded me of my beloved Xbox 360 Elite controller. It apes that asymmetrical stick layout of the Xbox and Switch controllers, and its form factor sits somewhere between the Xbox Official Controller and the Nintendo Pro Controller as well. It’s slightly narrower than those designs, though,&nbsp;which feels as though it’s tailored towards smaller hands, and my 14 year old son thought it was perfect. Personally, I think it’s a very comfortable controller to hold, but if you have extremely large hands it may feel more cramped.</p>
<p>It manages to be both understated and eye-catching at the same time. Each analogue stick features an RGB ring around it, and out of the box it’s setup to light up different sectors of the opposing analogue stick depending on the direction you’re pressing. It’s a neat effect, and it combines with a smart light strip at the bottom of the included charging stand to great effect. The lighting makes the Ultimate 2 Wireless a really enjoyable controller to interact with, and it looks cool on your desk too.</p>


<p>Otherwise, the black colourway is as minimal as possible. The main ABXY buttons have the traditional Xbox colouring, but if you turn the RGB off, this is a controller that makes close to as little fuss as possible.</p>
<p>In action though, this is a top performer. The two analogue sticks feature magnetic TMR tech, which will make them both accurate and long-lasting, stamping out the possibility of stick drift. In the modern controller sphere, it’s practically essential, and alongside the metal stems and wear-resistant ring guards, it’ll certainly save you from replacing your controller too early. They feel excellent in use too, and they’ve stood up to an unending month of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/">Nightreign</a> punishment, consistently helping to keep me alive in the crunch.</p>
<p>You’ve then got an interesting mix of button tech, with the central buttons, pro inputs in the grip and the D-pad all housing traditional membrane switches. The shoulder buttons however have the distinct click of a mechanical input, and where the main inputs feel responsive, there’s the sense that the shoulder buttons have the distinct edge.</p>

<p>The triggers are also up to suitable pro standards, and there’s my favourite controller tech here in the shape of trigger lockouts. These catches allow you to shorten the distance of travel and they’ll make your reaction time ever so slightly faster than that stinking Zenyatta I keep coming up against in Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>Further pro inclusions include two programmable back buttons in the grips, and a further two set just beyond the shoulder buttons and triggers. While the grip buttons are a decent size, and sit well beneath your fingers, the third input next to the shoulder buttons are small and in a weird, less-intuitive place. Still, we won’t complain too much about having more options.</p>
<p>Whether the Ultimate 2 Wireless suit your hands or not, you can fully customise all the inputs, as both traditional inputs or macros, giving you a huge advantage over those without. The 8Bitdo software doesn’t stop there either, and its clear and intuitive interface gives you access to a full spectrum of tweaking and tailoring for deadspots and response curves. It brings the Ultimate 2 Wireless as close to your personal idea of perfection as possible, and you’ll undoubtedly be able to find your own performance sweet-spot.</p>

<p>This is also where you can update your controller’s firmware, with 8Bitdo having a good track record in that regard. It’s through the latest firmware update that the secret Switch mode was added, and while it’s great to have, it doesn’t help the confusion around the Ultimate 2 lineup. The Ultimate 2 Wireless has the Xbox button layout, you see, while the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth has the Nintendo button layout and Switch 1 support out of the box, and then there’s cheaper Ultimate 2C versions of both. But now that Switch 2 support is included via firmware updates for everything? It’s all a bit of a muddle.</p>
<p>To get this controller working with Switch 2, you don’t just need to update the firmware, but then also need to turn it on while pressing Y. If Switch and Switch 2 gaming is your main goal, get the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth or the newly announced 8bitdo Pro 3 Bluetooth, but this is handy in a pinch when you just really need an extra Switch pad, and does at least function with both rumble (not of the HD variety), and gyro operating as expected.</p>

            <p>4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> games tend to look an elegantly patterned tablecloth covered in toy soldiers. Entrotria looks like a geode full of maggots, or the inside of a prehistoric fridge. Admit it, you did not clock the screenshot above and think "4X".

<p>The visuals are even more unhinging for the seeming straightforwardness of the game as described on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3484960/Entrotria/">the Steam page</a>. "A turn-based space 4X strategy game with distinctive resource management. Explore exotic systems and acquire powerful technologies," it reads. "Exploit your planets, trade with other races and destroy those who stand in your way."</p>
<p>Clarity is often a virtue, developer Simon Alber, but I fear you are underselling the plankton. Assuming that's plankton. Continuing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morsels-is-my-game-of-the-summer-a-stinking-collage-of-nuclear-throne-and-pokemon">my recent thoughts about Morsels</a>, I love the splattergun strangeness of this game, which really comes alive in the real-time autobattling segments. I am looking forward to discovering whether it plays as differently as it looks, as and when it releases, which will be... somewhen. In the meantime, here are some bullet points:</p>
<blockquote><p>- 12 asymmetric species</p>
<p>- 300+ technologies</p>
<p>- 150+ different hexagon types</p>
<p>- 250+ buildings / building upgrades</p>
<p>- complex politics and market system</p>
<p>- versatile spaceships and epic space battles</p></blockquote>

However, participants were under strict instructions to keep it all secret, so we still don’t know what...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">it was some sort of <em>Minecraft</em>-like MMO</a></span>.

The game’s leaked descriptions read, “As you progress across the planet, you’ll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will be come essential to your journey.” Dataminers soon claimed that this was coming from Nintendo Production Group No. 4, the utilitarian name for the incredibly imaginative people who created the wonderful cardboard <em>Labo</em> products for Nintendo Switch. </p><p>Nintendo obviously went wild removing copyright-infringing screenshots and videos of the project, but it was bizarrely naive to think that making 10,000 unvetted strangers sign an NDA would have any effect.

            <p>A little while ago, Nintendo said smartphone racer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-tour">Mario Kart Tour</a> would stop receiving new content updates. But, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-updates-end-next-month">even though that was the official line back in 2023</a>, Tour racers do in fact have some new content to look forward to after all.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the Mario Kart Tour team shared a new trailer for the mobile game's upcoming Sunshine Tour, which will feature a collaboration event with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. This "special campaign" celebrating Mario Kart World's release last month will take place in Tour, with moustachioed brothers Mario and Luigi in mechanic outfits. Additionally, four new Karts will make their Mario Kart Tour debut.</p>
<p>The Mario Kart World Special Campaign - to give it its full name - will run from Wednesday, 23rd July until Wednesday, 6th August. You can check out a trailer for it all below.</p>

<p>Mario Kart Tour originally launched for iPhone and Android devices back in September 2019. It went on to become one of Nintendo's most lucrative mobile launches. In September 2022, so three years after its launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-tour-is-nintendos-second-highest-grossing-mobile-game">Mario Kart Tour had made Nintendo an estimated $293m globally</a>.</p>
<p>While it proved popular, there were some muddy waters on the game's initial release, as Mario Kart Tour included a gacha-style system where players pulled on Mushroom Kingdom warp pipes for a chance at unlocking new characters and kart pieces. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-to-gut-mario-kart-tour-of-grubby-gacha-elements">Nintendo ultimately removed this feature from the game in 2022</a>, and replaced it with an in-game item shop.</p>
<p>As for Mario Kart World on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, well we rather enjoyed the latest series release on its debut, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-review">our Tom calling it "entertaining, snackable, fun" in Eurogamer's review</a>. He awarded Mario Kart World four out of five Eurogamer stars.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/smartphone-racer-mario-kart-tour-gets-first-new-content-in-years-to-celebrate-switch-2s-mario-kart-world]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you don't have anything else on this morning, perhaps you'd like to fill the life of a small clay golem up with purpose. I cannot be certain, but at present I believe that the easiest way to do this is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2393760/Tall_Trails/">with the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tall-trails">Tall Trails</a>. It reminds me of playing old N64 3D platformers round my mate Liam's house between watching VHS recordings of Keenan and Kel, which is a nice place to be. It's also got Breath Of The Wild's stamina wheel and freeform clamouring, although you don't need to worry about that too much because you can stuff chilli peppers into your boot and use it like a jetpack.</p>

<p>Tall Trails is very generous in many of the best ways. It's generous with the sonorous cheer of its colour palette and wobbly strumfoolery of its music. Most of all, it's generous with its movement tricks. You pluck peppers and sunflowers and mushrooms from the soil and stuff them in the boot you carry on your back. Spend a mushroom for a big jump. Use a chilli pepper to rocket off to a better life in the sky for several seconds. Commandeer a sunflower to fly, watching the individual petals tick down to mark your remaining air time.</p>
<p>It's also just rhetorically doofy in ways that make me smile.</p>

<p>Here are some features:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>Blast off with your Rocket Boot!</strong> Use items as fuel in your Rocket Boot to blast yourself upwards! Each item has different powers: jet pack with hot peppers, hover with whirligigs, or swing on webs with spiders!</li>
<li><strong>Explore a weird &amp; wonderful world!</strong> Summit mountains, help out at camp, and search for treasure. Traverse 5 unique biomes, each full of new and exciting ways to move and explore.</li>
<li><strong>Find your purpose in life!</strong> Every golem has a purpose… but not you? What's up with that??</li>
<li><strong>Customize your look &amp; build!</strong> Find &amp; upgrade powerful badges to increase your platforming abilities to unreasonable levels! Or just focus on collecting hats!</li>
<li><strong>Tons of Replayability!</strong> Once you're done with the main story, start your adventure anew in a randomly generated world. Explore islands no one else has seen before!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>If you like the demo, the full game is out next month, August the 4th. It's made by Brady Soglin. Brady Soglin is an anagram for Yr Sad <a href="https://theboglins.com/">Boglin</a>. Don't be sad, Boglin. Play some Tall Trails.

            <p>Oblivion arguably isn't really Oblivion if you're not bouncing around Cyrodiil in an effort to level up your acrobatics slightly faster. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a>'s devs knew that, and so opted to keep the classic "level up by doing the abilities you picked" approach, with some minor tweaks to make it less frustrating.</p>
<p>If, however, you long to ding by being handed boatloads of XP simply from completing quests and killing NPCs by any means, a modder's got you covered. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-delivering-fallout-4-style-settlement-building-reckons-the-game-could-still-usher-in-a-modding-renaissance">working on</a> fleshing out a full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-esque settlement system for Oblivin' after midnight, MadAbormodding's decided to double down on the rads and bring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s levelling system to Cyrodiil.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Their mod, an <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4881?tab=description">alternate levelling system</a> dubbed Mad Experience, is billed as a simple effort to let you gain XP from kills, quests, and discovering new locations, instead of levelling being tied to skills.</p>
<p>It looks like your skill stats will still go up as they do in the original game, they just won't contribute to you vaulting up the levels and getting the option to boost the values of three attributes. So, you're just racking up points in a different way. That said, I'd say that MadAbormodding's maybe underselling how impressive all this is, given that making fresh additions that fit seamlessly into the base game's mechanics or interface is something modders have initially struggled with.</p>
<p>Cue mods that add new skills, but, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/oblivion-remastered-skyrim-style-smithing-system-mod">for example</a>, require you to track your progression up the ranks of that particular skill by consulting a book, rather than just being able to glance at the same menu which displays the rest of your abilities. That's not say modders haven't successfully made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/99">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/100">of</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1414">tweaks</a> to aspects of how Oblivion Remastered's level-by-skilling system works, but to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time someone has totally rejigged it like this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether it's a mod I'll actually use in the long-term, bouncing around the map because I specced into acrobatics being a thing I consider pretty central to the wider 2006 charm that I'm looking for when I decide to fire up Oblivion. That said, more options are always nice, and mixing 2006 nostalgia with 2008 nostalgia to form a weird rose-tinted soup could make for an intriguing experiment.</p>
<p>As it stands, Mad Experience lets you tweak how much XP each source dishes out via a config file or an in-game menu, with the latter requiring you to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/4810">MadMCM</a>. MadAbormodding wrote that they're working on adding the likes of a proper progress bar, plus the ability to gain XP from the likes of lockpicking and pickpocketing. They're also thinking about static skill leveling that'd increase the Falloutyness by making skill values something you control by delegating points on level up.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving this mod a go, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32">UE4SS</a> is a hard requirement. Unlike in vanilla Oblivion, a set of knees made of particularly robust jelly are not.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-remastered-modder-splices-fallout-3s-level-by-questing-into-cyrodiil-and-my-virtual-knees-are-glad]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 or next-generation Xbox APU may have been revealed, alongside the first details on CPU core configuration and memory bus.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">YouTube</a>, Moore's Law is Dead revealed the existance of an AMD Zen 6 APU called Magnus, featuring a massive 264mm squared graphics die with a 384-bit memory bus, which a wider bus than any current generation system, wider than the 320-bit bus of the Xbox Series X, connected with a Bridge Die to a 144mm squared SoC die. This big, square design isn't the only interesting thing about the Magnus APU, as the 11 CPU cores configuration featuring three Zen 6, eight Zen 6 C cores is equally unusual.</p>



<p>Initially, as the configuration made sense for it, Moore's Law is Dead thought the new AMD APU looked like a focused mid-range gaming laptop APU. In the documents, however, the Magnus APU was not listed for clients like the other yet-to-be-released Medusa Point APUs, nor for servers. It was listed for the semicustom business unit, which is the unit where APUs for consoles. Looking at other similar codenames in the same unit, the leaker found Mero, which powers the Steam Deck, and Jupiter, which is rumored the APU for the PlayStation handheld. As such, the naming convention, the square design, which looks remarkably similar to other Mark Cerny's designs, and the known specs with the unusual CPU core configurations with no low-power cores that would work well for running games at 120 Hz, suggests this could be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-24gb-ram/">PlayStation 6</a> APU.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Zen 6 Magnus Leak: AMD's MASSIVE APU for PS6? (+ Medusa Point Specs)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GKdRXEgV82g?start=933&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Although many details seem to indicate the AMD Magnus APU could be the PlayStation 6 APU, there's a chance it could be the next-generation Xbox APU. Over on X, known AMD leaker Kepler_L2 suggested that the Magnus codename doesn't fit the PlayStation naming convention, and that the design, in general, looks to be too expensive to be a PlayStation design, as Mark Cerny tends to be a bit more conservative with the die area. Given how the Xbox Series X has a wider memory bus than the PlayStation 5, the 384-bit bus could be another strong indication that the Magnus APU is the APU for the next-generation Xbox system. The leaker also added that the Magnus APU will sport <a href="https://xcancel.com/Kepler_L2/status/1946127954372698385#m">80 Compute Units</a></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That is probably the next-gen Xbox, the codenames that AMD uses for Playstation SoCs are from Shakespeare characters.</p>— Kepler (@Kepler_L2) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kepler_L2/status/1946062711730602372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Whether the AMD Magnus APU will power the PlayStation 6 or the next-generation Xbox system, things look pretty exciting for the next generation of consoles. Hopefully, it won't take long to learn more about what these new systems will be capable of, and how they will surpass their predecessors.</p>

            <p>Valve have begun removing a variety of sex games from Steam in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">their recent updating of the platform's rules and regulations</a> to allow banks and credit card companies to essentially forbid certain kinds of "adult content". In a statement to RPS, a company representative confirmed that games are being delisted as a result of the rules change, adding that the developers in question are being given Steam app credits as compensation.

"As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam.</p>
<p>"We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they'd like to distribute on Steam in the future," it concludes. For context, app credits <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/appfee">cost $100</a> and are required to publish games on Steam. $100 is not a lot in terms of game sales: Valve don't appear to be compensating the devs concerned for the loss of future revenue.</p>
<p>Valve don't specify which payment processors, card networks and banks they're referring to in their statement, or which games have been removed. But a quick trip to <a href="https://steam-tracker.com/">Steam Tracker</a> reveals that a number of games have been delisted this month. (You can find them by typing "sex" and so forth into the search box and organising them by date. I know, my methods are pretty forensic.) There are also scattered <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lu32vdlsmg27"> </a><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrhands31.bsky.social/post/3lu7mpmf2jk2n">reports</a> of delistings on Bluesky and other social media platforms.</p>
<p>I'm not going to go through the specifics of the games removed from Steam this month, mostly because there are scores of them and I can't confirm which were delisted for breaking the new rules. I will say that I find some of them repulsive, and that we should challenge, if not bury games that actively contribute to a culture of abuse. As in much of life, I do not think massive unaccountable finance corporations should get to decide where those goal posts stand.</p>
<p>Sexuality is as vast and miscellaneous as a skyful of constellations. Providing they are doing no harm, people should be able to explore and get their rocks off however they choose. I have played plenty of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/help-a-pair-of-very-different-games-set-on-living-starships-have-caught-my-eye-simultaneously">games that look at sex</a> in ways I consider "unconventional", and yet not damaging, which I can well imagine the likes of Mastercard and Visa deeming beyond the pale.</p>
<p>Kaile Hultner of noescapevg.com was kind enough to quote my piece on Valve's revised "adult content" policy yesterday in <a href="https://noescapevg.com/banning-porn-is-one-of-valves-dumbest-decisions-yet/">their commentary article</a>, which brings in more context about the political climate in the USA, and expands on the point that banks and finance firms have long sought to play moral censor, disallowing the transaction of "adult" material or services they find objectionable.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Italian retro gaming YouTuber Once Were Nerd recently revealed that he was visited by Italian law enforcement, with concerns that his reviews of third-party gaming handhelds could be in breach of Italian copyright law.

The handhelds often ship with unauthorized ROMs of various retro games originally published by companies like Sony and Nintendo.</p><p>The agency is investigating potential breaches of Italian copyright law, under which it's illegal to promote copyrighted material via social media. Once Were Nerd disputes that he was promoting the devices, saying that none of his material was sponsored by the console manufacturers, and that he is simply providing impartial reviews of available products.</p><p>If officially charged, Once Were Nerd could face fines of up to 30 million Italian Lira and up to three years of jail time, as well as the threat of having all his channels shut down by the authorities. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

                <p>Later this year, Sucker Punch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> will carry on the legacy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review-you-khan-do-it/1900-6417501/" data-ref-id="1900-6417501">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Nate Fox and Jason Connell directed both games, and they have a plan to keep Ghost of Yotei from making players feel like there's an overwhelming amount of things to do in its open world.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/ghost-of-yotei-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Fox and Connell noted that Ghost of Yotei won't feature a lot of guidance for players about where they should go. Instead, it will let players choose their own path through the game.</p><p>"The thing that Jason and I love the most is that moment when you're on your horse and you're looking at this big, beautiful landscape," said Fox. "And maybe the wind is telling you, if you would like to continue the story, go that way. But you see something out of the corner of your eye that catches your curiosity. And you say, 'you know what? I'm going to go check that out.' That moment where the game's not telling you really about where to go or what to do. It's you. That's the most beautiful thing about open-world games."</p><p>"We have this approachable, samurai cinema-inspired game, and so the trick for us as developers is to create a game that provides that extra level of creative freedom we strive for," added Connell. "Allowing players to enjoy it, while at the same time, we're never going to abandon the structure of the story."</p><p>Sucker Punch recently revealed that Ghost of Yotei will pay homage to classic samurai films, and it will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">the return of Kurosawa mode</a>, which was inspired by the late Akira Kurosawa's movies. Connell and Fox also had a longer conversation with GameSpot about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-of-the-same-ghost-of-yotei-devs-on-striking-a-balance-between-familiar-and-fresh/1100-6533254/" data-ref-id="1100-6533254">striking a balance between Ghost of Yotei's new elements</a> and the familiar aspects from Ghost of Tsushima.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei will hit PlayStation 5 on October 2, and it will be released alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-a-limited-edition-playstation-5/1100-6533106/" data-ref-id="1100-6533106">a pair of limited-edition Ghost of Yotei PS5 bundles</a>.</p>

            <p>Sucker Punch's Nate Fox would "love to see a trilogy rerelease" of the Infamous games, but the studio only works on one game at a time - and right now that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>.</p>
<p>Fox was interviewed by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">Game Informer</a> about Sucker Punch's forthcoming Japanese epic, when he was asked whether the studio would be open to revisiting its Infamous series of superhero games.</p>
<p>"I would love to work on more Infamous," said Fox. "I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yōtei."</p>

<p>Fox has long worked at Sucker Punch, beginning as a designer on the first Sly Cooper game in 2002. He also worked as the game director for all of the Infamous games and expansions - Infamous, Infamous 2, Infamous: Festival of Blood, Infamous Second Son, and Infamous First Light.</p>
<p>After working as game director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, he's now co-director on Ghost of Yōtei along with Jason Connell.</p>
<p>The first Infamous game released on PS3 and was notable for its Karma system that allowed protagonist Cole to become either good or evil, with suitably evolving powers. Later, on PS4, Infamous Second Son featured Troy Baker as protagonist Delsin Rowe, who could absorb a great variety of supernatural powers.</p>
<p>It's been 11 years since Second Son and its expansion First Light, but it seems Sucker Punch won't be returning to the series anytime soon, especially considering the success of Ghost of Tsushima</p>
<p>Ghost of Yōtei will be released on 2nd October exclusively on PS5. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yoteis-gorgeous-gameplay-deep-dive-reveals-refined-combat-lo-fi-beats-mode-and-more">recent State of Play gave us a longer look at its open world gameplay</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/infamous-director-would-love-to-see-a-trilogy-rerelease-but-sucker-punch-is-a-one-game-at-a-time-shop]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> will end support for the Windows 10 operating system on 14th October, 2025.</p>
<p>This is due to Microsoft itself no longer providing security updates or support for PCs running Windows after this date.

<p>The company added it's likely players will still be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems after this time, but it will no longer be able to provide support for any OS issues.</p>

<p>Some technical support may be provided, it said, but this will be informal, on a case-by-case basis, and not guaranteed.</p>
<p>Along with this change, the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/system_requirements/#windows">OS/CPU requirements</a> for the Windows version of Final Fantasy 14 will also be updated on 14th October.</p>
<p>Windows 10 was first released in July 2015, so this end of support from Microsoft comes after a decade of use. Windows 11 is the latest version of the Windows OS, which was released in 2021.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14, of course, released back in 2010, so has been available across multiple operating systems. This is somewhat par for the course for such a long-running game.</p>
<p>The game's most recent expansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a>, introduced a graphical update in an effort to modernise the visuals.</p>
<p>The next patch, 7.3, will be released early next month. It's called <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/patch_7_3/">The Promise of Tomorrow</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-ending-support-for-windows-10-os-alongside-microsoft]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's not a <em>massive</em> one, but there are definitely a few tweaks here that should improve your experience with the game considerably. Heck, we love Woolby, but reducing how often the dude pipes up is a big win in our books.</p>
<p>So without further ado, let's check out the patch notes:</p>
<h6>Features</h6>
<ul>
<li>Adds the ability to adjust village farmer behavior in the Options menu. You can now toggle the following tasks on or off: sow seeds, water fields, and harvest crops.</li>
</ul><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067syjnkv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<h6>Bug Fixes</h6>
<ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes.</li>
<li>Adjusted the volume of certain lines for Zaza and Woolby in Japanese.</li>
<li>The Sacred Sword can now harvest crops over a wider range.</li>
<li>Added new warp points for Spring Village’s and Autumn Village’s development zones.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where players could not obtain the Evasive Leg Guards. You can now purchase them at blacksmiths once your village level is high enough.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the ema plaque request “The Divine Sword Dance is the Best!” would not be available.</li>
<li>Adjusted the Blade Shard drop rate so you can now obtain them from high-level toad and fallen warrior enemies.</li>
<li>Fixed bugs that halted progression during certain Bonding Quests.</li>
<li>Adjusted the frequency of certain “Woolby” voice lines.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where player names could not include character names from the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which certain Bonding Quests and main story quests could not progress.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in which some Ema Board and Hometown Quests could not be completed.</li>
<li>Other minor fixes including some localisation adjustments.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We reckon Guardians of Azuma is well worth checking out if you haven't done so already. We awarded the game a 9/10 on the Switch and Switch 2, stating that it's "a must-play for Rune Factory fans and would be well-enjoyed by newcomers to the series as well".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Tayutama: It’s happy days</em> first launched for PC on May 29, 2009 in Japan.</p><div><p><strong>■ About</strong></p><p>This updated edition, supervised by Lump of Sugar, has been reimagined as an all-ages experience, partially remastered in high-definition, and localized into multiple languages.</p><p><strong>■ Story</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The wild days I spent with the Tayutai were nothing short of life-changing… So much so that I completely forgot I’d even won a hot spring trip in the shopping district raffle.<br>Now that things have finally settled down, I—Yuri Mito—am about to enjoy my last summer break as a student at Sohsei Academy.</p><p>Just as I hit peak exhaustion after everything that happened, I remembered it: the hot spring voucher, almost expired and totally forgotten.</p><p>This is a story that picks up after the main events… or maybe one that could’ve happened somewhere along the way.</p><p><strong>■ Characters</strong></p><p><strong><a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>hiro Mito</strong> (voiced by Risa Matsuda)</p><p>Upon meeting, she immediately declares Yuri her husband and even shows up on the first day back to school. Her pursuit of Yuri is what many would call “intense,” and she ends up living in the Mito household. But as a Tayutai, she’s not exactly human…</p><p>Mashiro is tolerant and level-headed, but that just makes rousing her anger all the more terrifying. She may seem naive, but that’s just because her understanding of the world is a few years out of date.</p><p><strong>Ameri Kawai</strong> (voiced by Kaori Hanano</p><p>The childhood friend and classmate of the protagonist, Yuri. She’s a student in the Slightly department of Sohsei Academy, where her father is also the director. Lately, her favorite pastime is teasing Yuri and Sankuro.</p><p>She can be persistent and persuasive in drawing others into her way of handling things, but when it comes to love, she’s a bit on the timid side…</p><p><strong>Mifuyu Kisaragi</strong> (voiced by Rina Misaki)</p><p>She is the Lady, the Prefect, of the Flawless Girls’ Boarding Department of Sohsei Academy. As the heir to the aristocratic Kisaragi Conglomerate, Mifuyu has been raised to be both strong of character and someone others will naturally rally behind. She’s well trained in many things, including swordsmanship and martial arts. But that doesn’t mean she isn’t without her flaws.</p><p>She’s rather fond of romance novels, the kind where things are depicted a little too pure for reality. Which will certainly make things tough for a red-blooded man…</p><p><strong>Yumina Takanashi</strong> (voiced by Yu Aoto)</p><p>Yumina looks up to Yuri as an older brother. When her birth parents went bankrupt, they gave her to the Mito family to raise. Unfortunately, Mari Mito, the family matron, passes away long before the start of our story, and Yumina is ultimately adopted to the Takanashi family out of concern of a lack of mother figure.</p><p>She’s one of those people who immediately fails at a task whenever someone is watching out of nervousness. But she doesn’t mind working hard, and she’s actually rather good at handling the household chores. She tends to get lost in her own imagination.</p><p><strong>Nue</strong> (voiced by Mika)</p><p>One of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.</p><p>She transformed into a human-like form over 500 years ago, but due to some unknown incident, lost her memory and has remained that way ever since.</p><p>After Mifuyu offered to become her guardian, she quickly grew attached and now brings a cheerful, innocent energy that puts everyone at ease.</p><p><strong>Ouryu</strong> (voiced by Taiyo Sorano)</p><p>One of the Three Mightiest Tayutai, dangerous beings sealed away in ancient ruins by Kikuramikami no Hime.</p><p>Once thought to see humans as nothing more than prey, it turns out the truth is quite the opposite—he simply envisioned a different kind of coexistence from Mashiro.</p><p>Though he usually hides in the pond in the Kawai family’s garden, he often takes human form to walk among people.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/remastered-romance-visual-novel-tayutama-its-happy-days-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>
