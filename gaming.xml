<p>It's a beast</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you happen to be lucky enough to own a Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X, then chances are you've had to do a little rearranging just to get them all to fit correctly underneath (or to the side of) your TV.</p>
<p>Well, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xnzxnz">Xiao Ningzi</a> has come up with a rather novel – and surprisingly elegant – solution, by combining all three consoles into one giant machine. The result is pretty cool, albeit not one that we'd be in a rush to emulate anytime soon.</p>
<p>Essentially, with a simple press of a button, the 'Ningtendo PXbox 5', as it's been christened, can switch between all three consoles at will. You might be wondering how it works with docking the Switch 2, and this is done by sliding the console into the side of the device, with a red eject button used to pop it back out. The downside to this is that it has to go in sideways, which is a little concerning, but if the vents are kept clear, that's the main thing, right?</p>
<p>Switching between each console takes mere seconds, though we remain unconvinced that it would stay cool enough to keep everything safe and in good working order. Still, it's a fun little experiment, and we applaud the process Ningzi went through to get everything done.</p>

			<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> went through a <strong>deep identity crisis</strong> following the glorious 16-bit entries in the series. The transition to <strong>3D gameplay</strong> wasn't smooth at all, and the <strong>many experiments conducted by Team Sonic weren't always successful.</strong> </p>



<p>2022's <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/"><strong><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sonic Frontier</em> is, in my opinion, among those experiments that</strong> <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">succeeded,</strong></a> as, even with some issues, the game did a great job <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">capturing the spirit of the franchise</strong> while trying to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">push the formula in a new direction</strong>. SEGA and Team Sonic, apparently, share my sentiment.</p>



<p><strong>Known and reliable insider Nate the Hate</strong>, who has an <strong>excellent track record</strong> with many early reveals (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">including the Switch 2 official announcement date last year</a></strong>) <strong><a href="https://xcancel.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013707082789237065#m">replied to an X user question</a></strong> regarding the <strong>next entry in the Sonic the Hedgehog series</strong>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Did you like Frontiers?</em>" the leaker replied, leaving <strong>little doubt about the direction of the yet-to-be-announced game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is generally regarded as a solid entry in the series, the community seems divided on a hypothetical <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sonic Frontiers 2</em>. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Hopefully the artstyle is more cartoonish. Frontiers felt too much like one of those "Mario in UE5" type videos,"</em> said Reddit user KittenDecomposer96 on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qif3a7/natethehate_seemingly_says_the_next_sonic_game/">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a></strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"I really felt like they dropped Sonic on a generic UE5 terrain and randomly sprinkled some Sonic elements over the place,"</em> agreed Phos-Lux, echoing the wider community sentiment.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The evolution of Sonic Frontiers' open-world gameplay</strong>, however, is making other fans <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">excited</strong> about the possibilities. <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"They could make it open world and connect the areas, let us actually see Sonic's world properly,</em>" said Phos-Lux, highlighting well what Team Sonic could do for the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>As the identity crisis I mentioned above often led Team Sonic to almost completely discard gameplay formulas in favor of others, I would definitely welcome the developer <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">iterating on and improving the Frontiers open-world formula</strong>. While the game's plot justified the generic visual identity of the open world, I couldn't help by wonder how much better the game would have been if it had the colorful cartoonish visuals that have defined the series, no matter the quality of each game.</p>



<p>Regardless of how the next Sonic the Hedgehog game will play, it hopefully won't take much longer to know <strong>what's next for the franchise. </strong>2026 marks the series' <strong>35th Anniversary</strong>, and its celebrations would be perfect to unveil what's next for it.</p>

            <p>Ah, no, not that one. That, I assume, has been the reaction of folks who've gone to pre-order the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon-2025">Marathon</a> reboot on Steam, and immediately been informed that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> is sneaking its way back onto their machines. Thankfully, Bungie have now fixed whatever issue was causing the latter to take pre-purchases of the former as a cue to re-install itself.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yep, ahead of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">arrival on March 5th</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s been trying to do its mate and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">higher-ups at Sony</a> a solid by persuading folks they might as well fire up the MMO.</p>
<p>Hence the following post from Bungie early this morning: "We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>Given PC Destiny 2's file size can balloon up to around 170 GB, that's certainly a relief. I'd liken it to suddenly having a piano dropped on your hard drive, but I reckon Destiny 2 would want to be classed as some sort of weird futuristic instrument with a name like 'The Keypresser'. As opposed to Marathon, which would almost certainly insist that whatever the instrument's name was, it must be painted lime green and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nobodys-reinventing-the-wheel-with-marathons-mechanics-says-former-art-boss-so-the-visual-design-needed-to-take-risks">vaguely remind you of plastic IKEA furniture</a>.</p><p>Then again, the Destiny 2 side of the fence has had its own Marathon pre-order problem. Bungie have also <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/2013356027261935971">fixed an issue</a> which was leading Marathon-themed gear for the MMO, which is included as part of a Marathon pre-order, from showing up for collection at Destiny 2's special deliveries kiosk. So, people who wanted Marathon got an extra Destiny 2, and people who wanted Destiny 2 with a bit of Marathon in it just got Destiny 2.</p>
<p>If only I was as good at self-promo as the shooter about running around with a wee robot eye. I'd probably be ruling the galaxy by now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-boombox-4-drops-below-black-friday-prices-as-the-latest-portable-speaker-hits-a-new-low-2000661377</link>
            <guid>1411708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="585">A dependable portable Bluetooth speaker is one of those essentials you don’t realize you need until the moment music is missing. Whether you’re hosting friends in your living room, hanging out in the backyard, spending a day at the beach, or heading off on a weekend camping trip, good sound can completely define the mood. Phone speakers sitting in red cups simply don’t cut it, and that’s where a powerful option like the JBL Boombox 4 earns its place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">Right now, it’s even more appealing thanks to its first big price drop that brings it down to $450 — an 18% discount and its lowest prices to date.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="734" data-end="777">Big, Powerful Sound That Fills Any Space</h2>
<p data-start="587" data-end="1128">The JBL Boombox 4 is built to make a statement, both visually and sonically. Weighing in at about 13 pounds and stretching nearly 20 inches wide, it’s unapologetically large. That size translates directly into sound performance. This speaker delivers room-filling volume with deep, punchy bass that small portable speakers simply can’t match. From blasting music outdoors to filling a large indoor space at a house party, the JBL&nbsp; Boombox 4 creates an immersive, high-energy atmosphere.</p>
<p data-start="1130" data-end="1626">Despite its size, JBL designed the Boombox 4 with portability in mind. A sturdy integrated handle makes it easy to carry from place to place, so moving the party from indoors to outdoors is effortless. It’s also built to handle the elements. With an IP68 waterproof and dustproof rating, the speaker can survive splashes, rain, sand, and poolside accidents without skipping a beat. Durability like that means you can just sit back and enjoy the music instead of worrying about protecting your gear.</p>


<h2 data-start="1805" data-end="1850">All-Day Listening</h2>
<p data-start="1628" data-end="2130">Battery life is another standout. On a full charge, the JBL Boombox 4 can deliver up to 28 hours of continuous playback. That’s more than enough to last through an all-day event and well into the night. If you need even more time, JBL’s Playtime Boost mode can extend listening by up to an additional six hours, bringing it to a maximum of 34 hours of playtime. There’s also a built-in power bank, allowing you to charge your phone or other devices directly from the speaker—super useful when outlets are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Bluetooth connectivity keeps things simple, letting you stream music from phones, tablets, laptops, or TVs. With Auracast support, you can even link multiple compatible speakers together for synchronized audio throughout a larger space.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">The JBL Boombox 4 comes in your choice of three colors.</a> There’s the standard black, a stylish blue, and “Squad” which is a camo pattern. All three options are on sale for the same discounted price of just $450.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After a lengthy wait and a last-minute delay last month, Echoes of Elysium is finally poised to release in early access, with the release date and exact start times now confirmed.</p>



<p>The action-adventure RPG hands players their very own airship to customize and expand with crafting, weapons, and more, as you explore the world of Elysium, an environment full of mysteries to uncover.</p>



<p>If you’ve been anxiously waiting for the Echoes of Elysium release date, Insider Gaming has all the details on the exact start time, so you can work out exactly how many hours there are to wait.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-echoes-of-elysium-release">When Does Echoes of Elysium Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Skybound. Image via Loric Games Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium is set for release on Tuesday, January 27, bringing an end to the long wait fans have had to endure.</strong></p>



<p>An initial early access release date was slated for December 4, before a last-minute announcement pushed the release date back to the above date.</p>



<p>The delay allowed the team to be “deeply focused on improving stability and overall game feel,” and was about “addressing real issues” so that when players jump in, the “experience is solid, reliable, and ready to grow.”</p>



<p>Tweaks include crash resolving and smoothing out rough systems, as well as porting the game entirely to a new version of Unity. The result is a build that is “significantly more stable” and “in a far better position,” so the delay has been worth the wait.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-echoes-of-elysium-release">What Time Does Echoes of Elysium Release?</h2>



<p><strong>Echoes of Elysium will be available worldwide from 10 AM PT on January 27, with a simultaneous release for players across the world.</strong></p>



<p>Details of the start time come from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2644050/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> and show that the time of day will vary depending on where you are in the world, with players in some regions only seeing the doors open for them to play in the early hours of January 28.</p>



<p>The table below shows the exact start time and release date for major time zones across the world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new gacha-RPG title is spinning onto the scene with the release of Arknights: Endfield, and a customary question to ask with every release is whether the title will be available with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<p>Arknights: Endfield releases on January 22, expanding the Arknights universe on the back of the original game, which was released in China in May 2019 and in other countries in January 2020.</p>



<p>If you were a fan of that title and are keen to jump into Arknights: Endfield, Insider Gaming has all the details on whether the title is available with a Game Pass subscription.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-arknights-endfield-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Arknights: Endfield on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New journey. Image via GRYPHLINE</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Arknights: Endfield is not available on Xbox Game Pass, and it isn’t available on Xbox Series X|S at all.</strong></p>



<p>However, that doesn’t close the door entirely to Game Pass fans as, while it isn’t available on the service, Arknights: Endfield is available on PC, and it’s a free-to-play game, so you don’t need to splash out any additional funds to enjoy it.</p>



<p>While it won’t be available through Game Pass specifically, PC players can still enjoy it. Unfortunately, there’s no similar news for Xbox Series X|S players, as there is no indication the game will arrive on the console.</p>



<p>That might be frustrating for Xbox Series X|S players, particularly as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-platforms-ps5-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield is available on PlayStation 5</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-will-arknights-endfield-be-added-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Arknights: Endfield be Added to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that Arknights: Endfield will be added to the Xbox Game Pass service, as the free-to-play approach means it’s not necessary.</strong></p>



<p>Recent updates to the Xbox app on PC make it easy to launch games across different launchers, so putting the title on Game Pass wouldn’t make much difference, and, due to the free-to-play nature, there’s no need to add Arknights: Endfield to the service if a console release on Xbox Series X|S occurs later down the line.</p>



<p>Free games have been added to Game Pass in the past, however, often providing additional in-game bonuses, so this is a route that could appear in the future. For now, though, there is no indication that Arknights: Endfield will be available on Game Pass anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has said players who spawn late don’t realize they “economically profit way more” than players who don’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar</a>, design lead Virgil Watkins discussed the extraction shooter’s divisive late spawn system, which can see players join games with around 20 minutes left to go. The feeling from some is that this can be a frustrating experience because it gives late joiners less time to complete objectives, and there isn’t as much loot around. But Watkins suggested the data tells a different story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We 100% acknowledge the whole thing of, 'Man, I came in to do that trial and now I clearly don't have enough time to do that, and that sucks, so I'm just going to leave,' or whatever. That aspect is definitely not great,” Watkins admitted.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, 'The loot's all gone,' or whatever else. But players who late join economically profit way more than people who aren't. The session, when they are fresh, does eventually get quieter, and very often they come across the remnants of fights or can maybe take out bigger drones or hit high-ticket areas more readily than other players. So that's been a very interesting thing to look at."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the goal behind the late join system? According to Watkins, it helps mitigate deserted raids. Indeed, Embark distributes loot in such a way so “there should be plenty of stuff for players to do” even if they join late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will be interesting to see if Watkins’ explanation here turns sentiment on late spawns around. Since Arc Raiders’ explosive launch, its late spawn system has come under fire from some who feel it needs to be overhauled. There’s frustration on both sides, with those who have to face late spawns having been in a game from the start also expressing concern.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's crazy that my team can clear a section of Stella Montis, place traps near the popular entrances, and start looting... only to have a full team of three, heavy shield, volcano running players spawn 50 FEET AWAY from us in a random room in the corner of the area... spawning basically on top of us, at 15 MINUTES REMAINING,” said one fan last month. “There is no counter, there is no chance of winning, they bypassed our traps as they spawned in the room next to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The ONLY players who should be spawning in five minutes into the raid or later are FREE LOADOUTS. Tarkov got that system down with the player Scavs, and it works very well. The initial spawn should be player loadouts only, then free loadouts come in at 25, 20, and 15 minutes remaining. Does that sound reasonable?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not crazy right? I've spawned literally on top of players who were looting and have gotten extremely unfair free kills because of it. Even reworking the spawning mechanic wont fix it, as you shouldn't have to worry about a random full geared 3-man at 15 minutes remaining after 5 minutes of silence after your team wiped out 12 players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Spawning in a 20 with gear sucks. Most of the PVP is gone, half the loot is already extracted. It sucks for everyone else too, they are low on meds, shields are nearly broken, and now 3-9 completely fresh, geared players have arrived at unexpected locations you just cleared.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-update-targets-infamous-stella-montis-glitch-but-some-say-rats-are-still-in-the-walls">Embark released a new patch for Arc Raiders</a> that stamped out some infamous out-of-bounds exploits – but players said "rats" still live in the walls of Stella Montis.

<p>Reunion, which is set to release on March 26th, kicks its tale into gear via a big fire at Caledon University, where Max teaches photography. "Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the hallowed grounds and ends the lives of Max’s friends, students and faculty alike," reads the blurb. Max, having escaped thanks to her supernatural time rewinding powers, then has three days to work out who did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFTLKWw542g">reverse Billy Joel song</a> and became a twisted firestarter.</p>
<p>Chloe shows up to help, with developers Deck Nine explaining her return as "a shocking repercussion of Max’s merging of the timelines" at the end of previous entry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Double Exposure</a>. Chloe's got "nightmares of a past she never lived", and also her handy backtalk ability, which is perfect for interrogating suspects to help Max solve the game's narrative puzzles.</p><p>Deck Nine promise plenty of choices, many words, and all of the emotions as the pair's story wraps up. If you fancy seeing how all the time travel shenanigans shake out, the standard edition will set you back £44.99 / €49.99. Pre-ordering will net you some extra outfits as DLC, while a <a href="https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-gb/games/life-is-strange-reunion/buy">£50 deluxe edition and £60 collector’s edition</a> offer the usual sorts of in and out of game extras you might expect, such as behind-the-scenes stuff, copies of the soundtrack, and some Life is Strange guitar picks.</p>

<p>Arknights: Endfield is a mix of elements, featuring action, RPG, and adventure-style gameplay, wth some strategy and base-building thrown in for good measure. If you’re looking forward to Arknights: Endfield, check out its release date and start times.</p>



<p>On the surface, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arknights-endfield-release-date-start-times/Endfield%20is%20Coming%20to%20PlayStation%205%20-%20Insider%20Gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arknights: Endfield</a> looks like another cutesy action game featuring ‘interestingly dressed’ characters, certain to catch the eyes of players. But there’s more to Arknights: Endfield than this, and it’s a significant step up over its predecessor.</p>



<p>It got a great reception at Gamescom 2025, and its pre-registrations show it could be very popular.</p>

That drives more engagement and more retention," he added.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Bottom line: we're very bullish on the opportunity side.

            <p>Those who pre-ordered Marathon on Steam following its release date reveal may have noticed something strange come in the aftermath of their eager purchase, as Bungie's other big release was being sneakily installed for those keen on the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147">In a statement</a> from the official Marathon development team account, news that this ultimately harmless (but funny) bug has been fixed was conveyed to the public.</p>
<p>It reads: "We've resolved an issue where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam."</p>

<p>Marathon has proven quite the popular pre-order <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-xbox-store-pre-order-trailer">ever since the release date announcement occurred earlier this week</a>. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">quickly soared to the upper echelons of Steam's top sellers page</a>, ranking only under some AAA titles with major discounts and mainstays like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-art-lead-departs-bungie-of-his-own-volition-ahead-of-games-new-release-date">The art lead for Marathon recently left the team of his own volition</a>, only a few months before the game's release. This came following a major gameplay overhaul for Marathon following public tests, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-plagiarism-scandal-resolved-satisfaction-of-artist">an art plagiarism scandal</a> which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">reportedly rocked morale</a> at the company.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">Game Awards ceremony</a> had its highs and lows, but everyone keeps talking about the strange decision to end with a new live-service hero shooter that wasn't looking exactly fresh in its big <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/highguard-official-reveal-trailer-the-game-awards-2025">debut trailer</a>. Former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/titanfall-2-review">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> devs deserve the benefit of the doubt, however, which is why we're keeping tabs on what's going on with <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">Highguard</a> ahead of its 26th January launch.</p>
<p>Only a few days ago, we learned (via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2026/01/17/highguard-did-not-pay-for-its-infamous-game-awards-finale-slot/">Forbes</a>) that showrunner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> enjoyed what he'd seen of the game so much that he offered Wildlight Entertainment that final slot at the show free of charge. Glance around social media for a bit and you'll also notice the talk has slowly shifted towards "what if Highguard is actually good?" after its middling trailer. After all, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> and Apex Legends are among the best-feeling FPS we've had in recent times. What if marketing for the game simply hasn't been <em>good</em>?</p>
<p>There was nothing offensive about the first look at the game; <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-big-reveal-this-year-was-for-a-shooter-from-the-creatives-behind-apex-legends-and-titanfall-and-it-looked-fine">it looked fine</a>. The problem is "fine" rarely cuts it anymore, and the shadow of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/concord-review">Concord</a> cratering in 2024 still looms over the entire hero shooter space. FPS aficionados have been wondering why we haven't heard anything from the official channels since The Game Awards. The official website has been running a countdown, sure, but where's the buzz? Is Wildlight trying to pull off an Apex Legends-inspired shadow drop here?</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/history/">SteamDB's update history</a> suggests the game's alive and well, on track for its launch next Monday across PC (Steam) and current-gen consoles. In fact, activity has ramped up again this week, with new tags being added and taken out, and package changes happening in the background. Even if the initial wave of backlash was scary, it appears plans haven't changed and we're just look at an unusual pre-launch period.</p>

<p>Across X/Twitter and BlueSky, YouTubers, streamers, and other notable names in the games industry are beginning to believe in <a href="https://x.com/Snamwiches/status/2013742846629601773?s=20">the possibility of the game popping off</a> once we actually get to play it. "I'm half convinced it's going to be good.

			<p>You can’t imagine an RPG landscape without Final Fantasy at the centre of it. From its formative years on the NES and SNES through to Final Fantasy 7’s iconic transition to the original PlayStation, this is a series that hasn’t just characterised generations of consoles and RPGs, it has extended its reach through music, movies, and myriad different gaming genres.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - One-Winged Angel Trailer | Switch 2 &amp; Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwZ8SkxWIQU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s impossible to understate just how crucial the success of Final Fantasy VII Remake was. Thankfully, it thoroughly exceeded expectations, and after a period of PlayStation exclusivity (with a PC port lagging behind), it’s now arriving on Xbox Series X|S consoles and Nintendo’s Switch 2 with its improved and expanded Intergrade form. &nbsp;Looking at the version for Nintendo’s incredible hybrid, this is a truly excellent way to experience this iconic game.</p>


<p>The sense of scale in Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is incredible. From the opening cutscene that captures the city of Midgar, the lived-in streets and children’s playgrounds loomed over by mako reactors, it’s clear that the original game’s vision has been fully realised here. The art direction stays true to the polygonal originals, while bringing the cast, and the world, to life like never before. Perhaps most surprisingly, the Switch 2 port manages to retain some of the visual enhancements from the full-fat PS5 version of Intergrade, rather than simply targeting the original PS4 outing.</p>


<p>Straight away, it’s clear that this is the upgraded lighting and texture package, and it serves to enhance what was already a fantastic-looking game. Light diffuses through smoke and fog, armour and clothing textures look more realistic, while shadows and reflections are of higher quality.</p>
<p>Rejoining Cloud, Barret, Jessie, Biggs and Wedge for that initial infiltration mission sets you on course for one of the most iconic journeys in gaming. We can argue all we like about whether the second game in this remade journey lives up to the first, and we can argue all we like about whether the original should have been broken up in the way that it has, but indisputably, Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade remains one of the best RPG games of recent years. That doesn’t change here in this Switch 2 version.</p>
<p>There’s also no change to the frame rate, at least compared to the original PlayStation 4 release. Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade runs at a locked 30fps on Switch 2. There’s no apparent dips, no fluctuations, and it’s a rock-solid experience, one that feels excellent whether playing docked or handheld.</p>

<p>That said, if you’ve played the PS5 edition, you can feel the slower response time in combat from playing at 30fps, and during exploration. Still, you cannot expect a game with this degree of visual fidelity to hit 60fps on the Switch 2, and given how well it does run, and the fact it has some of the next-gen visual upgrades, it feels like Square Enix have made another high water mark for what we should expect from Switch 2 ports going forward.</p>
<p>There’s a suite of difficulty levels available, and you need to be careful about which of these you opt for, because they really do make a key difference to how Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade feels. While there’s the expected Easy and Normal options, you can also opt for ‘Classic’, which sees your character automatically attack, leaving you free to select abilities, items and special attacks.</p>
<p>Here, though, there’s also a head start option that sees you begin from a higher level, equipped with swords that hold a huge chunk of SP, and pockets packed with an insane number of potions, Phoenix Down and the like. If you’re a returning player, it does serve to speed you through the earlier hours, but if you’re a newcomer, it removes so much of the experience that I’d advise against this mode. It’s nice to have all these options, but just take a moment to think about how you want to experience this incredible title.</p>

<p>There’s so many reasons that I absolutely love this game, but replaying it on Switch 2, it’s the sense of place, the sense of community and the boring, mundane, vital sense of humanity that strikes hardest. It’s the rats in the street, the snippets of overheard conversation, the crowds who grumble as you steam right through them in Sector 7. It’s a world that feels lived in, a trick that George Lucas got right the first time in Star Wars, and which Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade uses to ground the world, and its story, while giving you the kind of setting to create a cavalcade of ideas, daydreams and half-truths.</p>
<p>Of course, the exquisite visual design gives you rather more than the PlayStation original. The added fidelity allowed the team at Square Enix to capture interactions that feel realistic, Cloud’s awkward-but-sweet pauses and attempts at aloofness are countered by Barret’s gruff persona, rubbing up against his true tender nature. Aerith, Tifa and Jessie all feel like real, rounded characters, and as you dig into each of their individual back stories, you come to understand what’s led them to this place. For all that the 1997 original managed to achieve plenty of that same character building with far less at its disposal, Remake Intergrade brings everything into stark relief, fulfilling the true vision of its creators.</p>

<p>On top of the original Final Fantasy VII Remake, Nintendo and Xbox players are getting the Intergrade DLC as well, available from the off at the title screen, should you want to leap straight into the extra content. This puts the delightful Yuffie front and centre, and adds a chunk of extra story, context and new mechanics in the form of Fort Condor. It completes the opening chapter in Square Enix’s immense three-part reimagining of this story, and it’s well worth playing through, especially for the interactions with many of the characters you’ve met in the main game.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Square Enix has made this a thoroughly approachable port by pricing it at £39.99 at launch. While the initial release of Final Fantasy VII Remake was nearly six years ago, this is the first opportunity that Xbox and Nintendo fans have had to get their hands on it, and plenty of companies would have popped this out for £60. Square Enix definitely deserves kudos for a more consumer-friendly approach.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released a surprise update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, with features for both original Nintendo Switch and free <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> improvements as part of the update.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Update Overview – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sl2YybDiluQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>All players across Switch and Switch 2 will now be able to play as and with Dixie Kong, subbing in for Diddy Kong. She has a different boost that she offers DK while jumping in single player, while she is also usable as the Player 2 character in co-op.</p>
<p>The update also adds a new Turbo Attack mode, which takes Time Attack and ramps up the speed of the game for even more challenge.</p>
<p>But the biggest benefits are for Switch 2 players, with improved game resolutions to take advantage of the 1080p built in screen and 4K output, as well as reduced loading times. The game also now supports local GameShare for its multiplayer.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD launched around a year ago in January 2025, a late-feeling port and remaster of the game for Switch, but with the (then unannounced) <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the horizon. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-switch/">our review,</a> I said, “[it] is a fine remaster of the Wii platformer, bringing along all the tweaks from its Nintendo 3DS port. It’s not much more than that, but it’s still a great platformer.”</p>
<p>Here’s the full patch notes:</p>
<p><span>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – Ver 1.1.0 Patch Notes</span></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now play as Dixie Kong. Her action when jumping is different from when jumping with Diddy Kong.
<ul>
<li>When playing alone, as you grab a barrel, you can switch between either Diddy Kong or Dixie Kong as the character that appears.</li>
<li>When playing with two people, P2 can switch between Diddy Kong or Dixie Kong by pressing the stick (the L Stick in the case of playing with both Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con controllers) on the world map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A Turbo Attack mode where you can race through the stage at high speed has been added.
<ul>
<li>If you clear the course once, it will appear at the same time as the Time Attack mode.</li>
<li>If you can clear it within the time limit, you will acquire a turbo medal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now supports Brazilian Portuguese language.
<ul>
<li>You can switch the language in the “Language” setting in the “System” menu of “System Settings.”</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Now supports “GameShare (Local User).”
<ul>
<li>You can select “GameShare (Local User)” from “2 Players” on the game start screen or the menu screen of the world map.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Optimized for the <a title="Platforms > Nintendo Switch 2 [737 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/nintendo/nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> display and high-resolution TVs for improved image quality.</li>

            <guid>1411669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gawked at the opening sequence to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/final_fantasy_vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> over the years. From a three-year-old, gazing up at the intro for the first time from the carpet of my living room, to watching the camera zoom out and pan across Midgar in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/final_fantasy_vii_remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> back in 2020, I’ve watched this cutscene in its various forms time and time again, and it never fails to amaze me.</p>
<p>So it shouldn’t surprise anyone that I’m in awe once more with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on Nintendo Switch 2, except this time, I’m watching the same bird fly over Midgar, the kids play in the slums, and Aerith walk through the city all on a 7.9-inch LCD screen. And I’m not just in love with the wonderful music or the perfect set-up to one of the most incredible worlds in RPGs; I’m actually amazed at how good the whole thing looks on my little Switch 2 screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161490/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake is astonishing on Nintendo’s console, and is easily one of the best Switch 2 ports so far. Yes, there are caveats like 30fps, softer screen resolution, and some fuzzy textures. But Square Enix has clearly put the time and effort in here to ensure the best possible result, and with the Episode INTERMission DLC included as standard too, this might be the definitive way to play Remake on the go.</p>
<p>And that’s how I spent most of my time with it. Honestly, it’s a bit of a revelation: in both handheld and docked, Remake looks spectacular, especially when you’re exploring the iconic dieselpunk metropolis. It’s packed full of people, scrapheaps of junk, vehicles, and flowers and dead grass attempting to break through the otherwise barren grounds. I had to pinch myself a few times as I reacquainted myself with the Sector 7 Slums or the narrow alleyways of Wall Market.</p>
<p>Every single inch of Remake on Switch 2 is a real testament to the lighting, which director Hamaguchi-san <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/lighting-is-the-crucial-factor-how-square-enix-made-final-fantasy-vii-remake-look-great-on-switch-2">has acknowledged as key</a>. It makes this version appear closer to the PS5 release’s Performance Mode than the original PS4 one. I’d say that playing it docked, other than the lower frame rate and the 'dithering' around Cloud and other spiky-haired characters’ hair (apparently something to do with the upscaler struggling to interpret subpixel information), I wouldn’t be able to tell at first blush.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161491/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Areas like the aforementioned Slums are where those texture problems are most noticeable on flowers and scrap heaps in particular, but this is where most of the original's texture problems were, too. NPC faces here are also a little odd-looking, but again, this is an existing problem with Remake on other platforms. Basically, you really have to be paying attention and looking for cracks, or have ludicrously high expectations.</p>
<p>In terms of the frame rate, while docked, I didn’t notice any significant dips at all – not in combat where I was punching and kicking my way through foes with Tifa or slicing and dicing as Cloud, nor in some of the busiest areas like Wall Market. Even the motorbike sections, where lighting and particle effects are flying around the place, nothing distracted me.</p>
<p>Handheld was a little less consistent, but mostly just during cutscenes and transitions when there’s fire, trains, or a <em>lot</em> of close-up movement. And it’s never for more than a few seconds, which I can live with when playing on a small screen. The softer image quality might also take a bit of getting used to, but again, this isn’t a high-powered PC or a PS5. And this is based on the PS5 Intergrade version anyway.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161496/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, the <em>port</em> part of Remake is a huge success, and luckily, the game itself is, as well. It’s a fantastic RPG with some of the best combat in the genre, and a complete reimagining of the iconic three-to-five hour sequence of the PlayStation’s original release over 30 hours. And it works.</p>
<p>The action is superbly tuned, focused on utilising your entire party to take down enemies and bosses by staggering them, then dealing a huge amount of damage by using ATB-consuming skills. Every character is very different to play as, too; Tifa is excellent at putting pressure on the enemy and then dealing the big numbers once staggered, while Barret’s long-ranged gun arm can easily take down airborne enemies. You have to engage with every system in order to win, even in Normal Mode.</p>
<p>It’s not turn-based, which I know some purists aren’t happy with, but Remake still incorporates a little traditional RPG with a menu which allows you to briefly pause battles and select skills for you and your allies. I use a mix of menu-hopping and shortcuts, the latter of which doesn’t break up the flow of combat — helpful for Cloud and Tifa, who are almost always in the heat of action — and I also constantly switch between characters depending on the situation.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161501/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Touching on the narrative, I want to stress that, while Final Fantasy VII Remake is pretty darn faithful to the 1997 original, it also tests the boundaries of what a ‘remake’ actually is, particularly towards the end. I don’t like all of the changes, and a few of the new characters didn’t click with me at first, but when Remake nails it, it <em>really</em> nails it. Particularly with its characters.</p>
<p>If, like me, you grew up with Final Fantasy VII, it’s incredible to see this world and these characters fully realised on modern hardware. Cloud is not the mopey fellow the Compilation will lead you to believe; he actually has some snark and silliness to his character. And Aerith is just a remarkable human who carries the story of both this and Rebirth on her back – <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/more-than-just-a-flower-girl-a-personal-thank-you-to-aerith-gainsborough/">I’ve sung her praises before</a>, and I’ll keep doing it.</p>
<p>And seriously, the dialogue and banter in this game can be hilarious, with Cloud’s stoicism often challenged by Aerith’s teasing, and Barret’s over-enthusiastic pleas to save the planet batted down by Cloud’s own bluntness. It knows when to balance the levity with serious moments, and that's something I think most video games struggle with.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161499/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For those who haven’t touched Final Fantasy VII before and are worried, don’t fret – even with some of the additions, the Switch 2 port is still an amazing way to experience (part of) one of the most influential games of all time. The story beats are all the same, and the tone and outright weirdness of the original are also all intact, perhaps even better than ever. The new Honeybee Inn sequence alone is worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> is still the best port on the system due to its sheer size and scope, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is close behind for its visual detail, incredible lighting, and largely consistent frame rate.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even in its attempts to swing big and do something different, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade respects where it’s come from. The classic's pro-revolutionary heart is still intact, and it’s never afraid to get a little weird and funny. The Switch 2 version makes impressively few compromises to get this gorgeous-looking game running on the system – even at 30fps, this looks and feels fantastic.</p>
<p>The fact that everything from the PS5 release is preserved in such excellent fashion here is remarkable, and it makes me excited (and anxious) about Rebirth’s incoming port.</p></section>

It was crazy to see, after so many years of rumors, tech demos, fan-made projects, and mods, we were getting a retelling of Cloud's story (mostly) in high definition.

That's almost half of the base Switch 2's storage and over quadruple what is required for <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p><picture>

From the opening sweeping shots of Midgar, to the close-up facial detail on Aerith and Cloud playing in Handheld mode, I was honestly a bit shocked at just how great this game looked, knowing I was playing it on mobile hardware.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/undefined" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Moving from the Mako Reactor and its neon lights to the soft city streets and the full light of the Sector 7 slums, the game looked and played incredibly well. While there were obvious downgrades in the graphical quality to accommodate the Switch 2, it's a fantastic way to experience the game for the first time, or return, letting you play while enjoying a second screen experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The one aspect of the game that was noticeably downgraded was that of characters' hair and certain particle effects. For a character so well known for his hairstyle, it's a shame to have a Cloud whose face is so clear and expressive have a grainy mop on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the same for all hair in the game, which becomes very apparent when completing the side quest where it's your goal to round up cats.</p><picture>

Whirling around the screen as Cloud, particle effects from various spells and Barrett's gunfire, and enemy explosions didn't tank the framerate in any noticeable way.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the cutscenes. There would be a variety of times when hitching would appear not when looking at something impressive, but instead a few moments beforehand.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leak has revealed how the Fortnite x Fall Guys collaboration will play out, and it will introduce a new game mode called Crown Jam. </p>



<p>Fall Guys had announced that they would be returning to Fortnite with a new collaboration, with something to do with a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fall-guys-and-fortnite-tease-new-collaboration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ball</a>” this time around. It was later leaked that ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pimlico</a>‘ was a working title for Crown Jam, the Fall Guys-themed game mode. Now, a leaked video has confirmed these details, with the new mode arriving on January 23, 2026. </p>







<p>The Fortnite x Fall Guys Crown Jam mode leak comes from Loolo_WRLD on <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/2013913593419378859" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), who has seemingly got their hands on an IGN video describing the new game mode. The video explains that this is a 3v3 limited-time mode that blends basketball, football, and obstacle-course chaos, where the goal is to dunk the ball into the opposing team’s hoop. </p>



<p>The game mode will also introduce new physics for the Fall Guys game mode, allowing players to feel “every jump, tackle, and slam dunk”. There’s also a new mechanic called ‘Hype’, which can be increased by playing to unlock new abilities. The abilities include Big Bean, where the character becomes bigger, Bounce Pad, which allows them to jump higher, and Confetti Crash, which you can use to attack enemies. Players will be randomly assigned to one of 6 teams. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fortnite x Fall Guys Crown Jam mode will release on January 23 and will only be available until February 9. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a free update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> on Switch and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This update adds iconic Kong clan member Dixie to both single-player and two-player local co-op. Dixie can give DK a boost when jumping, while her ponytail acts as a sort of propeller for "reaching new heights". I mean, I can't even get my ponytail to stay in place for an entire day, and most of what I do is sit at my desk, but I promise I am not jealous…</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>As well as the addition of Dixie Kong, this update also adds Turbo Attack, which means players can race through "high-speed versions of each level" with the aim to get to the end before the time limit runs out. From the teaser video for this update, which you can check out further below, it looks like you will need some good reflexes to make all the jumps and what not in good time.</p>
<p>While the above additions are for both Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch and Switch 2, there are also some improvements specifically for Nintendo's newer console. These include enhanced resolution, higher-definition graphics, and quicker load times.</p>
<p>So yes, we are getting the Switch 2 update to a Switch 1 game, which was a port of a 3DS game, that was a port of a Nintendo Wii game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country-returns">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a>, and returns, and returns, and returns again. Now, try parsing all that after a few drinks.</p>
<p>Nintendo has added GameShare support to Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, as well. Now, as promised, you can check out the Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Update Overview trailer below:</p>

<p>Not played Donkey Kong Country Returns HD on Switch (or Switch 2) yet, and wondering if you should give it a go? Here is what Katharine Castle had to say about the release on its debut last year: "A straightforward remaster that struggles to outshine the Switch port of Tropical Freeze, but Returns HD is still a challenging and satisfying platformer that stands the test of time."</p>
<p>Katharine awarded it three stars in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-a-formidable-platformer-that-still-holds-up-today">Eurogamer's Donkey Kong Country Returns HD review</a>.</p>

<p>Arknights: Endfield has plenty for players to sink their teeth into, and a bunch of codes are available to redeem for handy bonuses to help your progression.</p>



<p>With so much to explore, it always helps to get everything you possibly can in your possession, and Insider Gaming has all the active codes to redeem in Arknights: Endfield.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-arknights-enfield-codes">All Active Arknights: Enfield Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Goodies. Image via Hyppergryph</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are several codes available to redeem in Arknights: Enfield, providing a boost of rewards, including various forms of currency.</strong></p>



<p>The majority are available for players across all platforms, though there is one additional PC-exclusive code. While some of the codes appear to be available permanently, others are limited-time and must be redeemed before the expiration date.</p>



<p>Once redeemed, all rewards must be claimed from the in-game mailbox within 30 days, or they will disappear, so it’s a good habit to claim the rewards immediately after redemption.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the active codes in Arknights: Enfield and the rewards earned for redemption.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-arknights-endfield-codes">How to Redeem Arknights: Endfield Codes</h2>



<p><strong>Code redemption in Arknights: Endfield is completed through a specific menu in the game, though it won’t be unlocked immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Early progression must be ticked off before the feature to redeem codes is made available, and more playtime is required to unlock the Mail feature, where bonuses can be claimed.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process to redeem codes in Arknights: Endfield.</p>



<ol>
<li>Play through the main story in Arknights Endfield until you complete the Valley Reboot mission.</li>



<li>In the menu, select the settings cog in the top-left of the screen.</li>



<li>Select the ‘Platform &amp; Account’ section.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Exchange Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input the desired code.</li>



<li>Claim the rewards from your mailbox.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re yet to unlock the Mail feature, don’t worry, as any redeemed rewards will be waiting for you when you reach that stage in progression.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Life is Strange Fans Dismayed at Ashly Burch’s Absence from Reunion]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-fans-dismay-reunion-ashly-burch/</link>
            <guid>1411642</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, Life is Strange: Reunion was unveiled in full, with Deck Nine and Square Enix revealing the next game in the decade-old franchise. It follows directly on from 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure, and for the first time since 2017, it brings back Chloe Price, the other half of the ‘Pricefield’ ship.</p>



<p>She’ll join Max Caulfield in a race against time to once again save the world (or at least their little bit of it) from certain cataclysmic catastrophes. However, following the reveal, much of the Life is Strange community has shared a wave of disappointment about Ashly Burch, the original voice actor for Chloe Price, <strong>not </strong>reprising her role.</p>







<h2 id="h-chloe-price-will-not-be-played-by-ashly-burch">Chloe Price Will Not Be Played by Ashly Burch</h2>



<p>Ashly Burch brought Chloe Price to life in the original Life is Strange title, released in 2015. However, she was unable to reprise that role in 2017’s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, a prequel, because of an embroilment in a voice actor’s strike at the time. This meant that Rhianna DeVries stepped in and fulfilled the role, doing a fairly decent job overall.</p>



<p>Yesterday, when Deck Nine unveiled Life is Strange: Reunion, it went with the announcement that DeVries would be returning alongside Hannah Telle (Max Caulfield) to play Chloe Price.</p>



<p>Fans took to social media to stress their concerns about this decision, with many suggesting that it’s not a ‘true reunion’ if the original voice actor isn’t involved.</p>







<p>One distressed user wrote, ‘My expectations could not be lower for Life is Strange: Reunion. It’s hard to be excited after the last game, and now we know it’s not even Ashly Burch as Chloe… Like what the f*** are you guys doing?’</p>



<p>Another offered a lengthy explanation to cover the community’s dismay:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Life is strange bringing back Chloe due to fan backlash but still not giving enough of a s*** to fork up enough cash to hire her original voice actor whenever <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong>’s performance was half the reason anyone even liked that character in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an attempt to dig deeper, one user raised a fair point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Something definitely off with this game when Deck Nine brought back Rhianna DeVries for Chloe instead of <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong> while there’s no SAG-AFTRA strike currently happening like during Before the Storm’s development.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the diehard fans of Life is Strange, Reunion will be more or less a guaranteed purchase, even if it’s a reluctant one. The wrapping of Max and Chloe’s story is too much of a dramatic pull to be ignored, and it’s a sequence that’s almost a decade in the making (and wanting).</p>







<p>Will you still be buying Life is Strange: Reunion this March, even though Ashly Burch isn’t in it? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>As much as single-player solitude's a big reason why I love getting lost in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a>, running around its world with a small crew of mates also seems like it'd be a nice time. A good thing it is then that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-pc-mods-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">mod</a> for the decade old RPG allows it to host online multiplayer sessions with several players running amok at once.</p>

<p>Named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590?tab=description">Witcher Online</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/witcher-3-online-multiplayer-mod/">Polygon</a>, the mod's the work of a user going by Rejuvenate7. As they demonstrate in the trailer above, their creation's mainly focused on simply letting you hang out in The Witcher 3's gorgeous world with your mates on a custom server, with emotes providing basic ways to interact with each other. The premise is similar to mods like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-skyrim-together-co-op-mod-is-out-now-bringing-multiplayer-to-elder-scrolls-v">Skyrim Together</a>, though Witcher Online seems less advanced than that mammoth project at this stage. By the looks of it, gangs of up to five characters are supported.</p>
<p>You can wander the streets of Novigrad or Toussaint, go riding or swimming together, get a fresh trim, or just find somewhere with a nice view to sit and chat. Witcher Online's also compatible with another mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6402">Chill Out</a>, which looks to be responsible for some of the emotes and facilitates hanging out in taverns. By default, everyone plays as their own Geralt, but grabbing the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters</a> mod allows you to swap his model out for the likes of Yennefer or Lambert.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/playguide">technically do missions and contracts together</a>, as shown in the video above, but this comes with the caveat that "other players cannot help you fight monsters, solve puzzles, or complete objectives". So, you'll be playing together simply by trying to work through each story beat in your character's version of the game world simultaneously, for example trying to sync up when you all step into a certain cutscene and which choices you make. Rejuvenate7 wrote that they've gone this route to prevent risk of folks' saves corrupting or softlocking, which very much makes it a worthy sacrifice in my eyes.</p><p>To get started with Witcher Online, you'll need a non-pirated copy of The Witcher 3 from either Steam or GOG, updated to its latest version, 4.04. If you're unsure which version you're running, verifying you game files should push you up to that latest one. You also look to need the Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone DLCs, plus the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2110">Community Patch - Shared Imports</a> mod. Beyond that, there's a setup guide <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/guides/getting-started">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all I need to do is find someone willing to accompany me on a jog up towards Kaer Trolde, so we can chill on the bridge in a fashion which definitely won't see them nudged off the edge to see how big a splash that causes.</p>

            <p>EA and BioWare's failed action-RPG shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fond-anthem-farewells-begin-as-biowares-destiny-like-game-reaches-last-day-of-operation">Anthem was put down on 12th January</a>. No offline or P2P alternative for this one, at least officially. It was gone for good, with both the publisher and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">seemingly eager to move on</a>. However, fans aren't ready to let go.</p>
<p>Even though plans for a community-led revival project were already underway a couple of months ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1pb8b3v/cenotaph_an_anthem_revival_project/">under the name Cenotaph</a>, it was the video posted on 17th January by user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@andersson799">And799</a> on YouTube (hat tip to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-revival-private-servers-shutdown-bioware-fan-2000661358">Kotaku</a>) that ignited real hopes of getting the back online:</p> <figure>

<p>This person was quick to underline this is just a personal research experiment, and if you look at their YouTube channel, it's clear they enjoy the process of looking through files and systems, mostly of EA-published games. Still, you can see for yourself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anthem">Anthem</a> doing mostly fine while running on private servers. Moreover, two players are shown in the same lobby. What doesn't work is the whole layer of the player's online profile and other stuff probably centralized on EA's now-missing servers.</p>
<p>Right after Anthem's death, ex-BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah pointed out during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">his massive video</a> on the game's inception, life, and death that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-local-servers-existed-at-bioware">code for local servers actually existed</a> and could be "salvaged and recovered." In fact, he suggested a $10m plan to reboot the game as a single-player-first experience if EA decided to part ways with the IP. That's a lot of wishful thinking, but it's definitely something the game's fans would celebrate. Looking at private experiments like And799's showing a lot of promise already, we're betting on fans figuring this one out eventually at the very least.</p><p>For now, other industry figures are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation">chiming in on multiplayer game preservation</a> as more and more online-only games are shut down. Up next on the chopping block is Amazon's troubled MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/new-world">New World</a>, which was recently delisted and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-world-shutting-down-unless-saved-by-rust">will shut down on 31st January next year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Yakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties to Get Demo Today; System Requirements Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-get-demo-system-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1411624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku</strong> <strong>Studio</strong> and <strong>SEGA</strong> have announced that a free <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</strong> demo will be released later today on all platforms, albeit at different times. The PC version will get it first, at <strong>7 AM Pacific Time</strong>, while the console versions for Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for download at <strong>9 PM Pacific Time</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike other recent demos, users <strong>won't be able to carry over their save data to the full game</strong>, so it's really just a way to try the game before purchase. RGG Studio and SEGA have also outlined which sections have been prepared for the demo:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Yakuza Kiwami 3, players can explore <strong>Ryukyu</strong> in <strong>Okinawa</strong> as <strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong>, beating down bad guys and dynamically switching between the brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style and the weapon-based Ryukyu style. Players can also indulge in immersive side experiences such as karaoke, sub-stories, and outfit customisation.</li>



<li>In Dark Ties, players can enjoy <strong>an all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine</strong> and explore <strong>Kamurocho</strong>, experiencing a variety of activities while also mastering Mine's shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced at the <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong></a> in September. According to the developers, this is <strong>an 'extreme' remake</strong> of the third mainline installment in the series, which originally launched in 2009 for PlayStation 3 and later appeared on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Additionally, there's new content in the form of Dark Ties, which is centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, <strong>it is a prequel</strong> in which Mine willingly plunges into the dark world of the Yakuza after losing everything. Driven by the pursuit to find true bonds, he embarks on a dramatic journey coloured by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will be released <strong>on February 12, 2026</strong> for all the aforementioned platforms. Pre-orders are already available, too, and pre-order customers will receive the bonus item Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga that adds the fan-favorite character <strong>Ichiban Kasuga</strong> (protagonist of the more recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon</a></strong> games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang.</p>



<p>As part of the demo news, the Steam store page was also updated with the <strong>official PC system requirements</strong>, which we've added below.</p>

<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in December 2021, following the success of <strong>Tainted Grail: Conquest</strong>, a deck-building/roguelike/RPG hybrid. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wasn't so fond of his experience with The Fall of Avalon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as you can read in the review</a>, but the user reception on Steam is great, with a review rating of 86% for recent reviews and 88% for overall reviews.</p>



<p>Given the successful launch, it is likely that Questline and Awaken Realms will work on a bigger, more polished sequel, though it may be a long time before it materializes. We'll keep you apprised of any news from the developer and publisher.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bizarre Marathon Bug Auto-Installs Destiny 2 When You Pre-Order]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-destiny-bug-auto-install/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie recently uncovered Marathon’s release date, and shortly after, the ability to pre-order the game went live on platforms like Steam. However, a strange backend bug caused <strong>Destiny 2 </strong>(also developed by Bungie to <strong>install </strong>on Steam when you pre-ordered Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>The strange bug was lauded on social media by fans and critics alike, with one user writing that preordering Marathon triggers a ‘virus called Destiny 2’ to install on your machine.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-fixes-marathon-bug">Bungie Fixes Marathon Bug</h2>



<p>Hours after the Steam bug went live, <strong>Bungie resolved the issue</strong>, also taking the time to address a concern where Collector’s Edition owners <strong>could not </strong>redeem their game code on Steam.</p>



<p>The team wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If there was one entertaining thing to come from the debacle, it was the slew of comments poking fun at the situation.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘Marathon’s development was so cursed it created a malevolent spirit in the code. If it catches you, it will force you to install Destiny 2.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘Bungie trying to revive Destiny 2 by any means possible.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a pretty bizarre bug, especially given that, aside from the developer link, Destiny 2 and Marathon are totally separate from one another.</p>



<p>Recently, Bungie shared a new trailer for Marathon, also uncovering the game’s impending release date as March 5. To celebrate the game’s launch, PlayStation has created an exclusive line of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/limited-edition-marathon-dualsense-and-headset-revealed/">limited-edition peripherals</a>, which will be available to pre-order from January 29.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope that pre-ordering the limited edition controller won’t trigger the automatic purchase of a PlayStation Portal, or something.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon’s Recommended PC Specs Are Surprisingly Forgiving]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-recommended-pc-specs-surprisingly-forgiving/</link>
            <guid>1411606</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, Bungie unveiled the release date for Marathon, the studio’s stab at an extraction shooter, along with a brand-new trailer. Shortly after, the game’s Steam page was updated with a full spread of system requirements for PC players, and they’re remarkably forgiving.</p>



<p>One of the leading elements that’s driving prospective fans to Marathon is the game’s art style and visual palette, which apparently needs very little in the way of tech specs to run.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pc-specs-confirmed-as-low-entry">Marathon PC Specs Confirmed as Low Entry</h2>



<p>On Steam, you can check out the full recommended PC specs for Marathon, noting that they’re extremely accessible. This continues a trend where new games are coming out with more forgiving minimum and recommended specification requirements, a fact that pleases gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>8 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / RX 5500 XT (4 GB)</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Recommended Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-10400 / Ryzen 5 3500</li>



<li>16 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 2060 (6 GB) / RX 5700 XT (8 GB)</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">recommended specs for Marathon</a> are centered around a CPU range that was released almost six years ago, and a GPU spread that dropped as far back as January 2019. That lowers the barrier massively for PC players wanting to get into Marathon, one of the most (tentatively) anticipated first-person extraction shooters coming out this year.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, the extraction adventure title released by Embark Studios in October 2025, followed a similar pattern. For the recommended PC specs, ARC Raiders requests almost the same components.</p>



<p>By comparison, Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that launched as a 1.0 game in November, has <strong>sky-high recommended specs</strong>. To run Escape from Tarkov at the optimum level, you need a 2024 CPU, an RTX 4070 ‘or better’, and a whopping 64 GB of RAM.</p>







<p>Do you have the computing power to run Marathon at a decent level? Let us know what settings you’ll be choosing on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1411591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Any game built around gacha mechanics needs to have a certain hook to keep things interesting in the long term, especially if there’s potential to invest your hard-earned dollars into it. For all their systemic sins, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review"><u>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review"><u>Persona 5: The Phantom X</u></a> at least piqued my interest by expanding on already-revered lore, allowing me to intertwine myself in their beloved worlds. The much more enjoyable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-review"><u>Zenless Zone Zero</u></a>, on the other hand, pulled me in with a mix of high-octane combat, endearing character development, and Y2K flair. Arknights: Endfield is the latest competitor in this genre’s fierce attention economy, offering not only an engrossing sci-fi open world to explore, but another mechanically moreish addition: base building and automation. After approximately twenty hours of Endministrating, it’s clear there’s a lot more to uncover here beyond its sticky login loop, but crucially, I’m keen to expand my horizons in search of character motives, upgrades, and ultimately rewarding depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Arknights: Endfield, you play as the Endministrator (or Endmin for short) who, after a 10-year absence and an unfortunate case of amnesia, returns to the world of the living to reinhabit the planet of Talos-II. Taming the wilds is no small task, though, and on top of trying to remember who you were before your big sleep, you’ll also face off against a range of evil entities, including leather-clad maurauders, shifting zoomorphic creatures, and other mythic, well-dressed baddies. It’s an intriguing premise, unfortunately told through an exposition-heavy opening with awkward stop-and-start pacing. Still, if you brave its dialogue-dense beginning, Arknights: Endfield eventually opens up, delivering visually enticing battles and a captivating atmosphere that help make up for it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arknights: Endfield Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your job primarily involves adventuring with your team to the surface of Talos-II to hunt for resources, solve simple environmental platforming puzzles, and eventually clear out whole areas which you can access in the metagame to build and automate machinery. To do this, you’ll use a team of up to four Operators who, under your control, fight and collect items to push the lengthy story ever onwards. Early on, you’ll have a limited pool of story-specific characters to play as, like the masked Endmin, the empathetic mission-oriented Perlica, and the spirited Chen Qianyu, though eventually you’ll be able to use a specially earned gacha currency to pull new characters, too. It’s not the most imaginative gameplay, with many of the puzzles involving finding and pressing a few buttons on a small map to find success, or trawling through the same few groups of bad guys to push through an area. Still, this is all set against a striking cyberpunk backdrop that makes it surprisingly easy to sink hours into. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can imagine, there is an eye-watering array of currencies to consider here — a painful staple of the genre. On top of the usual gacha pulling, which allows you to randomly unlock unique characters and weapons, there’s also a paid Battle Pass that rewards you with resources that can be filtered into systems that help speed up progression, that is, if you can figure them out. It’s hard to say from only the week I’ve spent with it so far whether this feels balanced or not, but I’ve not run into any significant roadblocks that would encourage me to pull out my wallet in the early game – though only time will tell, and based on what I’ve seen so far, I’m not overly confident I won’t eventually find a few.  </p><p>A lot of effort has been put into worldbuilding and character design.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While my humble crew was more than enough for me in the beginning, once I’d earned the currency needed to try out the character lottery firsthand, my feelings began to shift. In my first pull, I drew Estella, an adorable beanie-wearing warrior who compelled me with their nonchalant attitude and stylish techwear garb. Soon after that, I fell in love with Da Pan, a hungry panda whose leather jacket and belt combo gave him the aura of a dad navigating a midlife crisis. I’d like to say I stopped becoming attached to the characters as I kept pulling more. Alas, the range of unique designs, alongside their quippy one-liners, was effective enough to tug on my heartstrings. While I wouldn’t pay for currency with my own money beyond what is provided organically, I was happy to see that, if I did, developer Hypergryph has put a lot of effort into its worldbuilding and character design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that a character’s personality also tends to shape how they move in battle, and throughout my time with Arknights: Endfield, the flashy combat quickly became my favourite aspect. Hits are delivered with vibrant visual payoff, so much so that even my silly mistakes looked like intentional moves. As you explore, you’ll encounter groups of various enemies camped out, like violent blobs of possessed water or sword-wielding bandits, all of which feature level indicators hovering above their heads. Once ready to engage, you run directly at them, weapons brandished, and start swiping away. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of controlling the Edmin alone, you switch between all the members of your team in battle, applying button-mashing combos that feel engaging in motion. Each character has a dodge, a light attack, and a special attack that string together nicely, delivering well-choreographed combos. Once you knock back an enemy and start to juggle them, you can call in your compatriots to deliver electrifying blows that feel slick – the Endmin’s sword slashes away with golden strikes, while Da Pan delivers belly bounds and butt slams with his towering form. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, the rest of your time is spent investing in the infrastructure of your base. Unlike the complex, automation-based gameplay of beloved factory management simulators <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/factorio-review"><u>Factorio</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/satisfactory-review"><u>Satisfactory</u></a>, Arknights: Endfield’s base building is much more tame, at least early on. And, thanks to lengthy explanations delivered by NPCs, it’s a process that ensures even the most build-averse players can learn how to create a functioning base of operations. </p><span data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><section data-cy="user-list-embed"><span><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite sci-fi jaunts</h3></p><span><a href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/sarahathwaites/lists/sarahs-favourite-sci-fi-jaunts" sx="[object Object]" data-cy="see-all-btn" title="View All Games">See All</a></span></span></section></span><p data-cy="paragraph">First, you’ll plant electric pylons and connect them with relay towers to supply electricity to the area. Though soon enough, you’ll also be able to implement mining as well as machinery that can refine and process raw materials. As someone who hasn’t always enjoyed the intense, efficiency-focused approach of similar automation games, Arknights: Endfield provides a friendly alternative that’s ripe for community collaboration – something I hope develops post-launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still so much to see before I deliver my final score, like expanding the factories, fully automating my production, and leveling up my team and gear – and that’s before I uncover the truth behind the Endmin’s amnesia. So far, though, I’ve found myself comfortable in its world, and I’m keen to get stuck in and see how far I can push before I hit an inevitably uncomfortable grind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/arknights-endfield-review]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="33deec88e9222"><a title="EB Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33deec88e9222/eb-games.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Last week, we got an update about GameStop's EB Games business in New Zealand, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/gamestop-kicks-off-2026-by-reportedly-shutting-hundreds-of-stores">38 stores in the country would be closing</a> at the end of this month. At the time, no information was provided about the future of the 336 Australian stores, but we've now got some details.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dont-freak-out-a-handful-of-australian-eb-games-stores-are-closing-this-month/">local Nintendo fan site Vooks</a>, the video game retailer will be closing "at least" 10 stores across Australia this month, and many have already shut their doors. One of these stores includes an EB 'Zing Pop Culture' shop, which specialises in merchandise, trading cards and various other items.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytvEee42ub-Hw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>No other details about these closures have been shared, but it is the end of the financial year for parent company GameStop, so underperforming stores (or shops not extending their leases) sometimes get cut. This isn't the first time this has happened in Australia, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/gamestop_subsidiary_eb_games_closing_19_unprofitable_stores_across_australia">around 20 "unprofitable" EB Games stores</a> closed down under in 2020.</p>
<p>EB Games, originally named Electronics Boutique, began in Australia in 1997 and started operations in New Zealand in the year 2000. It was then acquired by GameStop in 2005. If we hear any other significant updates about these EB Games store closures (or GameStop shutdowns in general), we'll let you know. Find out more about the closures in our previous story:</p>
