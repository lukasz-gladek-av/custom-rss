<figure data-uuid="347d15142edfd"><a title="Switch and Switch Lite" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/347d15142edfd/switch-and-switch-lite.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It was back in 2024 that Nintendo really kicked its emulator takedown requests into overdrive following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/switch-emulator-yuzu-to-pay-usd2-4-million-to-nintendo-and-cease-development">removal of Yuzu and 3DS emulator Citra</a>, and a fresh wave came late last week.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1r32zz6/switch_emulators_got_hit_with_dmca_notice/">Reddit</a> user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Devile/">Devile</a>, Nintendo issued a new DMCA notice on Friday calling for the removal of 13 Switch emulators' GitHub pages. Alongside any that still rely on Yuzu, the takedown targeted Citron, Eden, Kenji-NX, MeloNX, Pine, Pomelo, Ryubing, Ryujinx, Skyline, Sudachi, Sumi, and Suyu (the one <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/creators-of-new-switch-emulator-suyu-hope-to-avoid-nintendos-wrath">formed in Yuzu's wake</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8lszpmn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>As with previous takedowns, Nintendo cites the circumvention of its technological protection measures (TPMs) as grounds for removal.</p>
<p>"Nintendo Switch emulators are primarily designed to play Nintendo Switch games. Specifically, these Nintendo Switch emulators illegally circumvent Nintendo’s TPMs and run illegal copies of Nintendo Switch games," the notice reads.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus, they are primarily designed to and unlawfully "circumvent a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected under"the DMCA, and distribution of these emulators constitutes unlawful trafficking in technology that is "primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access" to copyrighted works."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet, not every emulator outlined is ready to pack up just yet. As noted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/">wccftech</a>, one of the project managers behind Switch emulator Eden took to its dedicated Discord channel on Friday to note, "Our source code is unaffected, as it isn't hosted on GitHub. The only thing targeted was our GitHub releases page".</p>
<p>According to the post, Eden seems confident that its emulator source code will remain available, despite the GitHub takedown. "Our development will continue as always," the message concludes.</p>
<p>In a message to wccftech, Eden founder Camille LaVey said, "We want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware". While LaVey didn't specify whether the goal was to keep running the emulator even if the GitHub page was removed, he hoped that "Eden can still be alive for the years to come" if the community stays on board.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Adds Solid Snake to its Operator Roster, New 1v1 LTM, and More Coming in Year 11 Roadmap]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-metal-gear-solid-ubisoft-konami-solid-snake-sam-fisher/</link>
            <guid>1437244</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Over the weekend, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">Ubisoft</a></strong> hosted the <strong>Rainbow Six Siege Six Invitationals</strong> tournament in Paris, where it also took the opportunity to reveal what players can expect in <strong>Year 11</strong> of Rainbow Six Siege, starting with <strong>Season 1: Operation Silent Hunt</strong>, which arrives on <strong>March 3, 2026,</strong> and adds an iconic stealth-action hero to its Operators roster: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-pc-system-requirements/">Metal Gear Solid's</a></strong> own <strong>Solid Snake.</strong></p>



<p>The collaboration between <strong>Konami</strong> and Ubisoft means we can finally have two of the video game industry's most well-known stealth icons work together, between Solid Snake and <strong>Splinter Cell's</strong> protagonist, <strong>Sam Fisher</strong>. Which is exactly what Ubisoft showcases in its Solid Snake reveal trailer, with <strong>David Hayter</strong> returning to voice his iconic character, which you can check out below.</p>



<p>As part of his introduction to the roster, Snake and Fisher will team up in a new infiltration mode 4v4 event where they lead a team of operatives to recover stolen data. Snake's iconic Tactical .45 semi-automatic pistol with its integrated suppressor is also joining the weapons arsenal.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We're excited to bring the world of Metal Gear Solid series into Rainbow Six Siege with Season 1's new Redacted event, a limited-time 4v4 infiltration mode where Snake and Zero lead a team of elite operators to recover stolen data</em>," said <strong>Joshua Mills</strong>, the recently crowned creative director of Rainbow Six Siege who took over from <strong>Alex Karpazis</strong>, after Karpazis announced he would be moving elsewhere within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>"<em>Players will also discover exclusive skins such as Jackal as Grat Fox and Ash as Meryl, and we're thrilled to have David Hayter lend his iconic voice to Snake's in-game cues. The team also went a step further with 'Last Assignment,' a new mission for Dual Front designed as a special nod to long-time Metal Gear Solid series fans</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of Dual Front, Year 11's Season 1 will be the last season to include Dual Front, with the mode getting removed at the start of Season 2. Season 1 also introduces a new cadence of updates, with the Rainbow Six team now aligning to deliver four balancing updates and two Ranked map rotations per season. </p>



<p>Season 1 also adds a new limited-time mode (LTM) that lets players go one-on-one in a new arcade mode. "<em>This fast-paced duel mode strips Siege down to its fundamentals and offers players the opportunity to challenge friends and random online players alike, or to test their pure mechanical duel skills</em>," Ubisoft writes in a press release.</p>



<p>Looking beyond Season 1, Season 2 will add some Rainbow Six nostalgia for players who remember the series' Vegas era with the arrival of the <strong>Calypso Casino</strong> map, while Season 3 will add a brand-new Defender operator to the roster, and Season 4 is set to introduce a new Social Hub to the game, giving players a space to hang out in-game without trying to shoot at each other.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>When McDonald’s PR tipped me off that there would be an announcement today regarding the fast food chain and a trading card game, I assumed we were being prepared for the announcement of 2026’s annual <em>Pokémon</em> tie-in, when the entire planet <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">loses its collective mind</a> buying Happy Meals just to get the packs of cards. But no, these are literally McDonald’s trading cards, with a set of 24 to collect including the “beloved” Ronald McDonald.</p> <p>It’s set to launch in the UK on March 17, and we’ve chased up to find out when the equivalent is happening in the U.S. The cards feature all your favorite McDonald’s characters, like Grimace, and wait what, a sentient stool called “Cheeseburger Chair,” and, oh god, Fry Girl, who appears to be a <em>ball</em> of fries with legs and eyes. This is truly cursed stuff. She’s wearing shoes. Why is she wearing shoes? Apparently this is something to do with a 1972 campaign called Fry Kids, who were originally collectively known as “French Fry Gobblins” and seem to have popped up here and there throughout the decades.</p>

 <p>Other cards glimpsed in photos from this weekend’s London Card Show show the non-sentient Multimixer, which appears to be a milkshake dispenser, and an iconic Milkshape Dip, showing a french fry being dunked into a milkshake. And respect for that. Thankfully neither has eyes or any sense of self-awareness ahead of their being consumed, but good lord, find me the person who’s going to be excited about pulling a card showing a drink distribution system.</p> <p>An enigmatic “trailer” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DUtKkY_AYfm/">on Instagram</a> shows a teasing hint of what looks to be a foil reverse of a card featuring the M logo and absolutely nothing else. It declares this to be “A new game from The M Universe,” which is not a reality I’d previously been aware of. We’re also promised that one card will feature Pennywise’s more sinister cousin, Ronald McDonald, which we’re told will “stand out.” This is described as “the return of Ronald McDonald,” and I’ll confess I didn’t know he’d been away. Although perhaps this is some sort of day-release scheme? I imagine the card would cut off before it showed any tags on his ankles.</p>

 <p>I know the wait is going to be unbearable, but the information concludes that “the brand is keeping a few cards close to its chest, with plenty more to come. So, keep your eyes peeled…” I’m not sure why, but that really reads like a threat.</p>

 <p>The reality is, if McDonald’s has any sense and has this be a complete one-off, these cards are going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-illustrator-pikachu-psa10-auction-pokemon-card-2000669385">be worth a billion-kerjillion bucks</a> in 20 years. Quite how the game aspect of them works is yet to be outlined, but I did read the words “Take it or Flip it game,” and that’s their capitalization. The UK gets to find out next month, and we’ll let you know when Americans can get in on the McD’s TCG action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162022/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>It feels like just yesterday that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ys_x_nordics">Ys X: Nordics</a> slashed its way onto the Switch to deliver another one of the series’ action-packed adventures for the ages — and, really, that’s not too far off the mark. The 10th mainline entry in NIS’ seminal RPG franchise made its way westward back in late 2024, which is still plenty recent enough for it to remain fresh in the minds of players and established fans. However, that hasn’t stopped NIS from forging right ahead with the global launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ys-x-proud-nordics">Ys X: Proud Nordics</a> on Switch 2 just a year and change later.</p>
<p>As its title suggests, this is an expanded re-release of the original Ys X: Nordics with a bevvy of additional quality-of-life features, enhancements, and gameplay scenarios. I’ll cut to the chase: nearly every addition in this enhanced version is a win, all but eliminating common grievances from the base game and tossing in a bunch of new features that make it far and away the definitive way to experience Ys X.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162030/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, I’m not sure if anyone who recently dropped a bag of gold on the original will be swayed by what this release has in store.</p>
<p>Just like the base game, Proud Nordics focuses on two leads: recurring series protagonist and fanatical adventurer Adol Christin and Norman warrior princess Karja Balta. Mysterious forces (quite literally) bind this unlikely duo together before an unexpected catastrophe sends the pair scrambling across the Norse-inspired Obelia Gulf to defeat the undead forces of the Griegr.</p>
<p>Gameplay sees you controlling both Adol and Karja to explore the realm, engaging in real-time combat with an array of monsters, and even piloting your very own pirate ship across the sea.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162029/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additions aside, Proud Nordics is as much of a blast to play as the original. The combat is great fun, maintaining a straightforward slash-block-and-dodge system while also letting you simultaneously control both protagonists on the fly to pull off devastating attacks via Duo Mode. The game’s RPG systems are all polished to a fine sheen, with a ton of different ways to customise your stats and movesets for both your protagonists and your ship.</p>
<p>Traversing Obelia Gulf brings me right back to the good old days of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, with oodles of treasures, side quests, and hidden lore drops littered across the map. The story bridging everything together is no slouch either — not groundbreaking by any means, but compelling in its own right with plenty of emotional beats further elevated by an excellent English voice dub.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ys-x-nordics">Mitch reviewed Ys X: Nordics on Switch 1</a>, some of his key issues centred around the tedious nature of sailing, as well as the game’s performance and visual fidelity. I’m happy to report that this updated version takes pretty major strides in addressing both of these areas.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162021/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Obelia Gulf now features a vast swath of wind currents, which the Sandras can ride to quickly sail between locations. It’s not a perfect fix for those who were frustrated by bouts of sluggish sailing in the original game — many currents must first be unlocked via brief naval skirmishes and there are still plenty of points on the map where you can only rely on your ship’s innate abilities — but this change goes a long way in reducing downtime for map traversal.</p>
<p>Perhaps even more critical to the moment-to-moment gameplay experience, however, is the massive bump in performance and graphical quality that Proud Nordics offers over the original. Back on Switch, Ys X often struggled to hit its 30fps target and the resolution could get pretty fuzzy. The strain on the ageing hardware was obvious, but Proud Nordics on Switch 2 feels like the game has traded in tight working boots for a nice, roomy pair of slippers.</p>
<p>In addition to retouched graphics, it now features options for Quality and Performance modes. Quality Mode bumps up the resolution tremendously while keeping things running at a stable 60fps. However, Performance Mode is the real star of the show here, with a solid resolution of its own and a deliciously smooth 120fps target.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162025/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Action RPGs live and die by their game feel, and this refreshed version of Ys X brings a level of responsiveness that makes the simple act of picking up the controller and hitting a few buttons an amazing experience. The only remaining issues I noticed are strictly in the visuals department, as some textures in the game still look rather flat and enemies have an odd penchant for moving at a lower frame rate in handheld mode. All told, these are only minor problems that didn’t impact my overall enjoyment.</p>
<p>Enhancements and quality-of-life features are just half of what Proud Nordics brings to the table. The most substantial addition to the game itself is the newly explorable Öland Island, which brings with it an extra side story, a host of extra dungeons to explore, and a new Mana Action to add to your mystical arsenal.</p>
<p>This large landmass houses previously unrevealed truths about the history of the Norman people while also introducing two new characters, Canute and Astrid, a pair of Shield Brethren with a surprising connection to Karja’s past. The narrative, which sees the game’s heroes in a race with Canute to discover the island’s secrets, may not be a game-changer, but it does a great job of further fleshing out Karja in particular.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162028/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>More parts of Öland Island become accessible as you progress through the main story, encouraging you to come back every so often. Progression also requires use of Mana Hold, a new Mana Action that allows you to pick up select objects and fling them forward for use as platforms or projectiles.</p>
<p>Considering how tactile and fun to use many of the base game’s Mana Actions are, I was disappointed by how finicky Mana Hold is by comparison. Aiming is far more complicated than it should be due to awkward camera angles, and the blocks you launch tend to spin arbitrarily or phase through the environment where you can no longer reach them. Couple these issues with the fact that Mana Hold is essentially locked to exclusive use on Öland Island, and it feels pretty underwhelming.</p>
<p>Beyond the new story scenario on Öland Island, there are a fair few other things to do. Astrid hosts the Coliseum, where you can rematch powerful foes for time-based rewards. Meanwhile, the new postgame dungeon Muspelheim challenges you to battle against ultra-strong enemies and avoid traps to reach the end within a strict time limit. Repeated runs net you rewards that allow you to lessen the dungeon’s difficulty in a variety of ways, injecting the core gameplay loop with a decidedly roguelite flavour.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162024/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the breezier side of things, you can also now participate in a couple of new Gullinboard races for performance-based prizes — a major win for those who, like me, could not get enough of the breakneck land surfing action in the main game.</p>
<p>While all of Proud Nordics’ new experiences are certainly welcome additions to the overall Ys X experience and do a particularly effective job at expanding the postgame, I can’t help but feel that a lot of what’s exclusively on offer here feels just a tad superfluous. The new stuff is perfectly good, but Ys X was already crammed so full of things to do both on and off the beaten path that most of what’s added here feels like just another layer of icing on a delicious cake — it’s nice to have, but that bite is going to taste almost the exact same as before.</p>
<figure><a title="Ys X: Proud Nordics Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162026/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyone who already had their fill with the original Nordics may be too full to go back for seconds, and it leaves me wondering whether Proud Nordics would have been better suited as a Switch 2 enhancement patch and further DLC packs for the original game rather than a standalone release.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It may have all the same bones as the original version, but Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 is undoubtedly the way that this landmark action-adventure title deserves to be experienced on Nintendo hardware. Not only are the visuals improved, but the major performance bump makes everything from striking down enemies to simply navigating menus an absolute joy.</p>
<p>The new gameplay additions, ranging from new story scenarios to tough-as-nails dungeon crawling, are nice to have as well, even if they ultimately feel like a small speck awash in the sea of gameplay variety that Ys X already contained. This enhanced version's siren song may be too faint to lure back anyone who forged through the original release, but newcomers and prospective fans owe it to themselves to answer the call and embark on the definitive version of this grand adventure.</p></section>

On release, <em>Guards</em> had a starter set and its first expansion, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">Busy Streets,</a> which added extra options and gameplay. Expanding even further on its success, Grey For Now Games has released 2 more expansions, Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes, another miniatures pack, and a hardback rulebook. In this article, we check out all 4 of these new releases to see what they add to your games.</p><p>If you want to know more about <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>, the Busy Streets expansion,<em> </em>and how they play, you can check out our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

  </picture><h2>You Have To Pay The Toll</h2><p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> is a fantasy semi-cooperative campaign game set in the city of Traitor's Toll, an independent city blocking a mountain pass that connects 2 Kingdoms. The city built up over time on the riches of the tolls paid by those wishing to use the pass to the point where now, an entire ecosystem supports the collection of those taxes. The Baron oversees all of it, supported by his Lord and Lady sons and daughters, who each control a different element of the city, and the guards they have to enforce it.</p><p>That's where you come in. You are a Guard Captain looking after a shift of guard constables in support of one of Baron's children. Keep the peace, ensure the taxes are collected, and maybe make a bit of extra coin for yourself while you're there.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Hardback Rulebook</h2><p>The new Guards of Traitor's Toll hardback rulebook is an upgraded version of the one from the starter set (or digital download). This one is in a larger format, nearly A4-sized, and in a robust hardback. It contains updated rules, new photos, along with errata and clarifications incorporated into the rules. It also features 32 extra pages, including original design work and 5 short stories set in Traitor's Toll that bring the city to life.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll New Recruits</h2><p>Releasing with the hardback rulebook is the New Recruits expansion, which, unlike the other 2 we cover in this article, contains only miniatures. New Recruits contains a Halfling Guard, a Dwarf Guard, and a Guard with Attack Dog. All 3 miniatures are single-piece resin miniatures that only require sticking to the base, rather than the multipart miniatures found in the Starter Set.</p><p>The stat cards for these miniatures can be either a standard guard recruitment and an appropriate trait card for the halfling and dwarf, from the Starter Set, or the Diminutive Guard card from the Guardhouse Heroes set (which we look at below). The stat card for the guard with attack dog is also in the Starter Set.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>If you want some extra depth in your games, Sinister Citizens includes 5 new major plots with ongoing multicard plots and a new permanent trader with their own plot cards.</p><p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Sinister Citizens expansion includes:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e35e08d6c66583246e67aeb87cee12b19">6 resin figures (Clumsy Apprentice, Little Lost Child, Pale Handsome Stranger, Kai-an the Assassin, Spectral Soldier, and Polly the Pie Maker)</li><li data-list-item-id="e66b7bcdc7311563f35bc738793f95cc7">36 Gaming Cards (1 Rules card, 5 Major Plots, 18 Secrets, and 12 Plots)</li></ul><p>The 5 new major plot cards can be used in the Patrol Duty mission, and once played through, a separate standalone plot card goes into the regular plot that can then come up during other games, and the unique miniature is added to the roster of regular civilians. Polly the Pie Maker doesn't have a major plot, and her plot cards are shuffled straight into the others, and her miniature is added to the table for use when her plot cards come up. The expansion also includes 4 new standalone plot cards and 3 associated secret cards to add some extra variety to games.</p><p>Sinister Citizens is a great expansion, which delivers a lot of playtime across the 5 new major plots and with the addition of extra normal plot cards and a new named NPC. I love the normal plot cards that fit into the game after playing through the major plots, so the story doesn't feel over when they appear again. You also sometimes get random instances where their miniature is on the board, and you can create a tie in narrative for them again in a normally unrelated plot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Guardhouse Heroes</h2><p>The Guardhouse Heroes expansion specifically adds new recruitment options to <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>, including named characters, unnamed guard varieties, and new traits and advances.</p><p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Guardhouse Heroes expansion includes:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ee9a5afe525c1453964b29dd78a130cec">4 resin figures (Captain Bellough, Sergeant Krustin, Perricule - Gnome Guard, and Lug - Ogre Guard)</li><li data-list-item-id="e839e64ba08d499079ef5028d23dc97fc">36 Gaming Cards (8 Recruitment, 6 Traits, 1 Plot, 1 Secret, 20 Advances)</li></ul><p>The 4 miniatures in this expansion all come with unique recruitment cards for them. Bellough can inspire a nearby guard to copy their action, the mounted Krustin gets a bonus to seize and subdue if they move 6 inches, and Perricule the gnome and Lug the ogre come on separate stat cards, but have linked abilities with Perricule being able to use Lug's brawn to intimidate, and Lug rushing in to help Perricule if they're attacked.</p><p>The expansion also includes 2 diminutive and 2 oversized recruitment cards, which can be used for other larger/smaller guards, or the halfling and dwarf from the New Recruits set. The 6 new traits offer more unique ways to add flavor to your guards, like zealous and brutish, and the 20 new advances add extra abilities to your force as they develop. My favorite is the Forceful Leader, which lets your captain order a rival guard to make a close or ranged action, which always feels thematic when they shout a command with such conviction that a rival guard simply responds. There is also a new plot card to be shuffled into the deck that gives a unique mission to one of the players.</p><p>Guardhouse Heroes adds a lot of extra depth to your guard forces. The extra advances and traits are especially welcome and help to bring your individual guards to life. The named characters, while a little more expensive, are worth the cost, and if you can afford both Lug and Perricule, they are fun to operate together.</p><h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes Final Thoughts?</h2><p>The extra depth that both Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes add to your games of <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> makes them easy purchases. The time to tabletop for the Starter Set does take some investment for learning the rules, then assembling the miniatures and scenery, but both of these expansions include miniatures with limited hobby time required, and the rules fit straight into your existing games. The new Sinister Citizens major plots are fun and rewarding, and the new variation and named guards with Guardhouse Heroes is very welcome.</p><p>The new hardback rulebook is great if you like physical rules and want the extra stories, but the digital rules serve just as well if you play that way, and I like that the New Recruits miniatures weren't forced into a pack, but can be purchased separately if you want to include those in your guard force.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of</em>&nbsp;<strong>Guards of Traitor's Toll Sinister Citizens and Guardhouse Heroes</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by Grey for Now Games.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Discord have belatedly confirmed that they're working with Persona, an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel, as part of Discord's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">new global age verification system rollout</a>. The collaboration is described as an "experiment" involving people in the UK specifically, whereby Persona will store user information on their servers for up to seven days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Always good when your personal data forms part of an "experiment", isn't it? Never mind that Discord <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-promise-they-wont-force-everybody-to-do-a-face-scan-following-outrage-at-new-age-verification-policy">assured us earlier</a> that "identity documents submitted to our vendors are deleted quickly--in most cases, immediately after age confirmation." Discord haven't yet said what the "experiment" is supposed to explore or prove. I'm sure it's fine, though. It's not like Thiel joints have a track record of working with any bloodthirsty snoops.
</p>
<p>
Following the announcement of Discord's new age verification policy - already in force in the UK and Australia, with a global rollout beginning in early March - social media users <a href="https://x.com/GiveMeBanHammer/status/2021851054519001133">shared screengrabs</a> of prompts to consent to Persona collecting their data over the weekend. Discord then sought to calm the flames by updating <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">their site FAQ</a> with the below disclaimer:
</p>
<blockquote>"If you're located in the UK, you may be part of an experiment where your information will be processed by an age-assurance vendor, Persona. The information you submit will be temporarily stored for up to 7 days, then deleted. For ID document verification, all details are blurred except your photo and date of birth, so only what's truly needed for age verification is used."</blockquote>
<p>
Many Discord users were already hopping mad about the new "age assurance" system, which involves face scan videos and a machine learning model, and the revelation of Persona's involvement only made them madder, with critical coverage appearing in <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951">Kotaku</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-advises-uk-users-that-they-may-be-part-of-an-experiment-where-instead-of-their-age-verification-data-never-leaving-their-phone-it-will-now-actually-leave-their-phone">Eurogamer</a> and cheery RPS fanzine <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/">PCGamer</a>. The FAQ disclaimer has now vanished (here's an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260214070331/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord">older version</a> preserved by the Wayback Machine).
</p><p>
As PCGamer note, Persona's lead investors during two recent rounds of venture capital funding were Founders Fund, who <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion">valued them at $1.5 billion</a> in 2021. The Founders Fund was co-founded by Peter Thiel in 2020. Aside from being a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/10/peter-thiel-lectures-antichrist">well-heeled Doomsday cultist</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">frequent Epstein correspondent</a>, Peter Thiel is one of the moneymen behind omni-payment platform Paypal and, more recently, Palantir, a godawful work of Saruman fan fiction that specialises in using AI for government and military surveillance. 
</p>
<p>
Palantir have, among other things, worked extensively with the USA's Immigration and Customs Enforcement, aka ICE, to track undocumented migrants, amid allegations of human rights breaches that include the recent <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cr571qg4m61o">killing of an ICU nurse</a>. The UK government have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2026/feb/12/nhs-deal-with-ai-firm-palantir-called-into-question-after-officials-concerns-revealed">commissioned</a> Palantir to make a patient database for the NHS, despite much opposition from doctors. I know children aren't responsible for the sins of their parents, but it doesn't seem wholly irrelevant here that Palantir's UK division is headed by Oswald Mosley's grandson.
</p>
<p>
All told, I would prefer not to participate in any identity verification "experiment" bearing Thiel's fingerprints, particularly not one that uses machine learning to check your identity in the background. And this is before we get into Discord's <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">recent history of privacy breaches involving third parties</a>.

            <p>"You will get anywhere between a fairly surgical battle with the more simple moves and synergies, to a downright-drunken-disaster run. [They] act with basically zero understanding of enemy mechanics, no regard for their ability order, and they couldn't give less of a damn about tile hazards." This is a section taken from the description of a mod which turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a> into an auto-battler, but turning the controls over to an AI chessmaster. That AI chessmaster just happens to play almost exactly like I have in my seven hours with it thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Seriously, modder Bigbrotherjakeb appears to have found a way to clone me out of sheer desire not to have to play Mewgenics' fights themselves. Their creation, '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/8">Auto-Battler Mode</a>', applies the Uncontrollable passive to all of the cats in your party. So, the computer will handle moving them about, targeting enemies, and unleashing abilities. Not that it'll do a good job of any of that. "This is effectively a challenge mode with how dumb the default player AI can be with this implementation (simplest I could quickly find)," the modder wrote.</p>
<p>Cool. Bigbrotherjakeb has hopes of teaching the stupid computer how to pick suitable movement strategies based on the specific class of cat it's controlling in future. I should probably get around to master the same thing.</p>
<p>A couple of other early Mewgenics mods which've caught my eye are '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/24?tab=description">Less Cats</a>' and '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/32">good poop</a>'. Contrary to what its name might suggest, the first one actually results in you having more cats by lowering the number of moggies the game's coterie of weirdos ask for in return for upgrades. As someone who's been a bit sad to part with my retired bois not long after they return from their sole adventure, that sounds good to me.</p><p>Good poop, meanwhile, leaves no room for misinterpretation. Poop now adds two pints to both your cats' health and comfort, rather than dragging it down by the same amount. A relatively small tweak, unless you find a way to play in smellivision further down the road, in which case you might get a nasty surprise.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving the auto-battler mode or less cats a go, both require the Mewgenics Mod Manager dubbed <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/1">Mewtator</a>.</p>
<p>Also among the roguelike cat breeder's early mods are a couple which <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mewgenics/mods/29?tab=description">swap around the audio files</a> for in-game meows. This follows criticism directed at the decision of developer Edmund McMillen to include meows voiced by internet personalities such as Ethan and Hila Klein. You can read McMillen's response as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/edmund-mcmillen-on-assembling-mewgenics-meow-cameo-list-the-inclusion-of-people-with-clashing-ideologies-felt-appropriate">our report on the topic</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410</link>
            <guid>1437199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies across tech are freaking out about the worsening memory chip shortage. It’s already delayed pre-orders for <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">Valve’s Steam machine</a> and could torch Sony’s planned rollout for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">upcoming PlayStation 6</a>. The unannounced console was rumored to be arriving in late 2027, but a new report suggests Sony is considering delaying its next hardware generation until 2028 or even 2029.</p> <p>That’s according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, whose latest report on the AI-fueled memory crisis includes two sources familiar with Sony’s “thinking” who claim the console manufacturer is already “considering” pushing its PS6 launch plans back by a year or two. The report claims the delay would have big consequences for the company’s “carefully orchestrated strategy” to transition <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">users from PS5 to the upcoming hardware</a>.</p>

 <p>Alleged specs for the PS6 began <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">leaking last summer</a> and suggested Sony was prioritizing trying to keep its hardware affordable even as it ramps up power in a solo console arms race with ever diminishing returns. Speculation was that more moderate spec improvements could keep the PS6 priced at around <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">$400-to-$600 instead of $700-to-$1,000</a>. Sony is also believed to be currently working on a handheld that would be able to play PS5 and some cross-gen PS6 games, potentially scaling down performance to keep up with higher-end blockbusters.</p> <p>Why would a single component price shock delay an entire console generation? In the past, Sony might have released a much more expensive machine to compensate. But in recent years as the total footprint of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">console gaming market has plateaued</a>, companies have faced pressure to be more aggressive on price to compete with free-to-play ecosystems that are still thriving on old hardware and weaker devices like smartphones. Sony actually ended up winning the recent holiday sales quarter against the newly released Switch 2 in part by slashing the price of PS5 with big Black Friday discounts.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the Switch 2, whether Nintendo will be forced to raise the price of its new console is another big question posed by the memory shortage. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">has previously told investors</a> it has inventory and contracts to help it weather volatility in the first half of 2026, but if conditions persist it will have to re-evaluate its pricing strategy with an eye toward balancing profitability with maximizing install base. Bloomberg’s report reiterated that Nintendo is already “contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 this year.</p>

<p>Pearl Abyss has stated that Crimson Desert’s premium price is “not something for microtransactions.” </p>



<p>Pearl Abyss’s upcoming action-adventure, Crimson Desert, is all set to release next month on March 19, 2026. Ahead of the release, we have heard a lot of information about the title, including the fact that it has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone gold</a>. Now, we have understood the developers’ views on microtransactions. </p>



<h2 id="h-crimson-desert-doesn-t-have-a-microtransaction-shop">Crimson Desert Doesn’t Have a Microtransaction Shop</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MR9QMXJuGx4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dropped Frames</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/2023176928870662217?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Okami</a>), Crimson Desert PR director Will Power addressed microtransactions. Powers stated that he can definitively say there is no “cosmetic shop.” Powers added, “This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world and not something for microtransactions.” The PR director concluded, “this is a premium experience, that is the transaction, full stop.” </p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It is fair to say God of War creator David Jaffe is less than enamoured with the series' newest entry, 2D side-scroller Sons of Sparta.</p>
<p>God of War: Sons of Sparta was announced during last week's PlayStation State of Play, coming from Mega Cat Studios in partnership with Santa Monica Studio. It's a canon story all about Kratos and his brother Deimos in their youth at training at the Spartan Agoge (which was very "brutal").</p>
<p>At the same time it was announced, Sons of Sparta released on PS5 consoles. And, well, Jaffe is not impressed.</p>
<p>During a nine minute YouTube video, Jaffe quickly laid into the series' latest offering. "This is the kind of game I have always wanted in terms of 2.5D God of War… but this to me is not what I was talking about," Jaffe begins, before stating in no uncertain terms: "I don't like it, I don't recommend it."</p>
<p>That was fairly gentle, though, compared to the rest of the video, where Jaffe calls Sons of Sparta "crap", "dumb" and even "stupid".</p>
<p>"What the f**k are they thinking," Jaffe expressed. While the original God of War director did say the gameplay in Sons of Sparta is "fine" and "servicable", he still can't wrap his head around why the game is "in existence" at all.</p><p>"I don't understand, I don't understand," Jaffe said with his face in his hand, reflecting on a conversation he had had with a former Sony Santa Monica developer about the scene in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> where Atreus and Angrboda chat while riding along together. Allegedly, the developer told Jaffe Sony Santa Monica is "these days driven primarily by story", which Jaffe seemed less than enthusiastic about.</p>
<p>"In Sons of Sparta, what I played – which was only about an hour of it, and I'll never go back to it – it's just like 'get over yourselves, man,” the God of War creator said. "They just kept stopping over and over and having the characters just talk and talk and talk. And the voice acting's not very good, the story - at least what I played… maybe it gets really good… - [but] who the f**k wants to play [Sons of Sparta]. This is not God of War."</p>
<p>He continued: "I want you to think about this for a minute, and the choice this team had… the idea of saying 'hey, we want a 2.5D metroidvania God of War game'. Most gamers would say 'oh my god, yes please'. [But] the idea of 'aaand, we don't want it to be the Kratos that you know and love from either 2018's God of War, or the Greek trilogy God of War. F**k it, that character's boring, no one likes that Kratos, that we've built billions of dollars franchises on. Let's make him just some generic f**king kid'... it makes no f**king sense."</p>
<p>Jaffe then said Sons of Sparta's origin story for Kratos as a "dumb idea", and suggested fans would have rather played a game like the much bloodier and violent Metroidvania title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. This, Jaffe said, has the "tone" of the earlier God of Wars. "I'm pretty sure when people said they wanted a 2D God of War, they meant [like Blasphemous]", not Sons of Sparta. "Who the f**k greenlit this? Who thought this was what the audience wants?"</p><p>Meanwhile, if that wasn't enough, Jaffe also laid into Sons of Sparta's production quality. "Compared to what we got just this last year," he said, "if you look at the gameplay variety and just the joy of playing a game like Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, if you look at the art and level of detail and just genuine interesting scenarios at a moment-to-moment gameplay level of Neon Inferno – which also came out towards the end of last year, which is just an excellent shooter by the way, I highly recommend it - if you of course look at the production value of the 2D Shinobi, I mean look at that thing.</p>
<p>"People want this production value, and they want this vibe, and they want it to be classic Kratos."</p>
<p>Jaffe suggested that if you "pulled God of War" out of Sons of Sparta, and instead said "hey, we are making a game about this kid", people wouldn't be interested. "I want to know who at Sony thought this was what people wanted," he said. "By the way, I don't need the big budgets. I would have loved bigger production value, smoother animations, this, that, and the other, but I don’t need that, right? If the gameplay was interesting, if it was violent, if it had personality, if you opened immediately and the players were like 'oh my God, I've never thought of that kind of mechanic in a game like this', or 'this is so fun to do', you could make it super inexpensive like this seems to be. I can't imagine this cost that much money to make.</p>
<p>"But why would you even put this out? All it does is leave a bad taste in God of War fans' mouths, in my assumption."</p>
<p>Jaffe said this whole thing "shows such a collapse of the great executive work that Sony in the past has done", and "the fact that they would think this is what people want from God of War… I just don't know what to f**king tell you".</p>

<p>As well as this Sons of Sparta, the original God of War trilogy is getting remade (which will hopefully not receive the same reception from Jaffe on its release). However, this particular project is still in the early days of development, so don't expect anything more soon. "As we look to the future, we also want to invest in the past and tend to the series' roots that got us to where we are today," Sony said last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">announcing the remakes</a>.</p><p>"We know that remaking the Greek saga has been a frequent request – the genuine, passionate interest from fans to see the original games return is something we're very thankful for and can’t wait to share more when the time comes!"</p>

            <p>Like it or not, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> was a hit. Developer Shift Up (and PS5/PC publisher Sony) has been trying to avoid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up">all sorts of drama</a> since its release, but with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/as-stellar-blade-reaches-3-million-sales-shift-up-ceo-rewards-all-300-employees-with-a-switch-2/">over 3m copies sold</a> overall by mid-2025, it's safe to say the action-adventure game found an audience.</p>
<p>Shortly before its PC release last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-developer-confirms-sequel-plans">Shift Up confirmed the game would get a sequel</a>, and that plans were already underway. Now, thanks to the Q&amp;A section in <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=339&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">the company's last financial report</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sounds-like-stellar-blade-may-launch-on-xbox-and-nintendo-switch-2-this-year">IGN</a>), we've gotten confirmation that the powers that be are looking at expanding to platforms beyond PS5 and PC... which essentially means current-gen Xbox consoles and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> are in their sights.</p>
<p>The Korean studio has once again described <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> as a "steady, long-tail IP" which will be capitalised on in the coming years. Since the sequel is (predictably) a way off, we don't find the news of tentative Xbox and Switch 2 ports particularly shocking. Again, this doesn't mean they're 100 percent happening, but the move makes sense and is definitely on the table. "This approach is expected to both introduce the title to new players and gradually build anticipation for the next chapter in the series," Shift Up added, before explicitly mentioning advances on that front will happen as soon as later this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the developer is also working on <a href="https://in.ign.com/project-spirits">Project Spirits</a>, an all-new "flagship title" which will be published by Level Infinite and is targeting consoles, PC, and mobile. Whether the new versions of Stellar Blade would be self-published is up in the air too, but if I had to bet, I'm not expecting Sony to be involved after helping out with the PS5 and PC launches.</p><p>In December, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shiftup-ceo-receives-presidential-commendation-for-stellar-blade-and-nikke">Shift Up's CEO received</a> "a presidential commendation for boosting the South Korean games industry" following the game's exceptional financial performance and its impact on making the Korean games industry another heavyweight to watch out for in the AAA space, with Neowiz and Round8 Studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">Lies of P</a> also adding to that conversation.</p>

<p>We don't yet know when we can expect <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O. </em>to launch, although if the game wants to arrive in time for CyberConnect2's 30th anniversary, then a release this year would probably be advantageous. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

              <p><em>Mewgenics</em>, the new roguelite RPG battler from <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>developer Edmund McMillen and&nbsp;<em>The End Is Nigh</em>‘s Tyler Glaiel, has proven to be an extraordinary success. Launched February 10, during less than a week on sale has hit the #2 spot on Steam’s bestsellers and seen an extraordinary 115,428 simultaneous players—extraordinary because this is a single-player, offline game. At the time of writing it has more people playing than&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Given this, McMillen has announced that the game will be coming to consoles <em>and </em>receiving DLC. Oh, and it’s incredible soundtrack is now available to buy.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><em>Mewgenics</em></a> is the bastard child of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, <em>X-COM</em> and&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em>, a game about taking a team of cats on an adventure to fight in a series of turn-based RPG battles, then breeding the victors to create your next crew. And while we don’t know officially sales numbers yet, it’s fair to say they’re not small. On launch day, just three hours after the game came out, Glaiel posted that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-steam-best-seller-strategy-roguelike-2000667706">the seven-year development budget</a> had already been recouped. Glaiel has also posted that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3mermwjydf22m">650,000 people had played the game by Friday</a>, and assuming those are all legitimate sales, that’s over $12 million&nbsp;<em>after</em> Steam’s cut.</p>   <p>There was also a moment of excitement for the pair when the game showed more players than&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>   <p>All this means there’s budget and an assumed audience to bring the game to consoles. There are no specifics yet, with updates promised for later, but given the game works well with a controller it’ll be a natural fit for Xbox, PS5 and Switch. I also cannot fathom why this isn’t already on mobile, given it’d be the perfect medium.</p>

 <p>The success also means DLC is in the works, and that’s no small feature either, given the core game is so big that the developers reckon still no one’s finished it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mewgenics updates: <br>-OST is live on the steam page <br>-it’s coming to consoles ( updates later )<br>-there will be dlc <br>-update with some bug fixes soonish<br>-mewgenics merch here &gt; <a href="https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8">https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8</a></p> <p>— 🜏 Edmund McMillen 🜏 (@edmundmcmillen) <a href="https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Certainly not least, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4415490/Mewgenics_ULTIMATE_Original_Soundtrack_Of_All_Time/">the OST is now up on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The creator of the God of War series has shared his views on the recently released Sons of Sparta title, and it is evident he is not pleased with the game. </p>



<p>Fans of the God of War franchise had an exciting State of Play event last week. Santa Monica Studio not only confirmed that a God of War <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-original-trilogy-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trilogy Remake is in development</a> but also revealed that <span>it&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-son-of-sparta-shadow-drops-today/" target="_blank">shadow-dropped</a>&nbsp;a</span> game exploring Kratos’ childhood. However, the newly released title is facing harsh criticism from the series creator.</p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-trashed-by-original-series-creator">God of War: Sons of Sparta Trashed by Original Series Creator </h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/god-of-war-creator-david-jaffe-sons-of-sparta-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, God of War series creator, David Jaffe, has gone off on Sons of Sparta on two separate occasions. The first time was after playing the game for just an hour, where he ended up saying things like “this is not God of War”, “who the f**k greenlit this”, and “who thought this is what the audience wants”. Jaffe also went on to say that the “production quality is not very good,” comparing it to games like Ninja Gaiden, Ragebound, and Neon Inferno.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The series creator released a 32-minute video echoing the sentiments expressed in the previous video. In this new video, he critiques the gameplay using clips from the title. It’s evident that the creator is dissatisfied with this installment, particularly because he feels that the character of Kratos, beloved by fans, is not accurately represented. Instead, players are presented with a different character. </p>

"That attention has also made me realize how many people are worried about this issue. However, our decision to go multiplatform with the FF7 Remake series will not in any way lower the quality of the third installment. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our development structure simply doesn't work that way to begin with... I suppose I'll just have to keep saying it," he said, laughing. He also stressed that because of the growing popularity of gaming on PC both in Japan and beyond, the game has been built with PC "as the foundation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While PC gaming is gradually expanding in Japan, overseas growth has been even more rapid," Hamaguchi added. "The market has broadened tremendously across both consoles and PC. The FF7 Remake series has sold very well on platforms like Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we develop assets with the broad PC market in mind. In fact, our 3D assets are created at the highest quality level based on PC as the foundation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When FFVII Rebirth launched, there was talk about how the PC version looked better than the PS5 version, and our philosophy will not change for the third instalment," he concluded. "As our fundamental principle, we do not design assets to meet the lowest baseline. Instead, we create them for high-end environments first."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Gold Saucer Date (1997 vs. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth)</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, Hamaguchi teased that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-director-issues-update-on-part-3-progress-and-reveals-clouds-iconic-buster-sword-was-almost-resized-to-make-it-more-realistic"><u>"core game experience is almost complete,"</u></a> and while he "really want[s] everyone to play it as soon as possible," the team has now moved on to "refining and polishing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>'s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-card-game-queens-blood-will-be-enhanced-for-ff7-remake-part-3"><u>Queen's Blood card game is making a “powered-up” comeback</u></a> for the final chapter in Square Enix’s remake trilogy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Could an Xbox version of Insomniac’s Spider-Man games eventually be released, given parent company Sony’s recent softening on multiplatform not just on PC, but with the likes of Helldivers 2 and Marathon coming to Microsoft’s console? Based on a comment from Insomniac itself, Xbox owners shouldn’t hold their breath.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan replied to a tweet from Insomniac celebrating Valentine’s Day to ask about the possibility of Spider-Man swinging onto Xbox, and <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2022752405444505766" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the developer’s response</a> was pretty clear: “Not likely.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, you might say that’s obvious. But, as the replies have pointed out, once upon a time Insomniac ruled out Marvel's Spider-Man ever coming to PC, and it ended up making the jump from PlayStation exclusivity to personal computers.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">it will never appear on Xbox or PC. It's a permanent PS4 exclusive publisher by Sony Interactive Entertainment</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/879913482845511681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, nearly nine years after that tweet, Sony not only publishes games on PC, but on Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Arrowhead’s record-breaking Helldivers 2, for example, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-officially-getting-halo-odst-content-but-its-first-legendary-warbond-is-going-to-cost-you">launched on Xbox Series X and S complete with a Halo crossover</a>. And Bungie’s upcoming extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is coming out on Xbox as well as PC and PlayStation. The times have changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spider-Man, though, does feel like it would be crossing a thicker line to get to Xbox, and Insomniac’s tweet suggests that to be the case. In the shorter term, Insomniac’s Marvel’s Wolverine is due out later this year — exclusively on PlayStation 5. Meanwhile, Insomniac fans expect another Spider-Man game eventually, a continuation of the story as set out in 2023’s Marvel's Spider-Man 2, which launched on PC in January last year. (Last year, Yuri Lowenthal suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-3-actor-says-peter-parker-wont-be-relegated-to-the-couch">Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 will see Peter Parker doing his Spider-Man thing</a> despite what the ending of Spider-Man 2 suggests.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Spider-Man Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony’s approach contrasts with that of Microsoft, which has fully embraced multiplatform for pretty much all its first-party video games. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026"><u>When Microsoft finally announced Playground’s Forza Horizon 6</u></a> and confirmed it would launch on PlayStation 5 <em>after </em>Xbox and PC, it came as a surprise. Nowadays, Xbox Game Studios is one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Microsoft said the idea of a video game exclusive locked to a single storefront had become “antiquated for most people,”</a> but Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day-one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei). Multiplayer games, however do tend to launch on PC at the same time. Guerrilla’s recently announced co-op action game Horizon Hunters Gathering is set for PS5 and PC. Marathon’s day-one multiplatform launch is something of an outlier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

In this new sale, an unknown buyer placed the winning bid of $13 million to secure the card, with the further $3.49 million added in auction fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Why has it sold for such a huge amount? Well, at a base level, the Pikachu Illustrator is one of the rarest Pokémon cards out there, and its eyebrow-raising PSA 10 grading makes it truly unique and technically flawless. But Paul himself has done a lot to personally try and raise the card's value — and very successfully so. Minus the auction fees, Paul likely stands to make more than $7 million in profit.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/16/maxresdefault-1-1771237895791.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Logan Paul and the $16.49 million card.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch was not home to many great racing games, especially ones that didn’t feature karts and moustachioed drivers. So far, that’s continued to play out for the Switch 2, but there are some key signs of change with the arrival of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/27/grid-legends-switch-2-review/">GRID Legends</a> last month. Drafting directly behind it is Gear Club Unlimited 3, an arcade/sim-cade racer that also boasts its own storyline, licensed vehicles and updated visuals, hoping to snatch its own place on the podium. While it puts up a valiant effort, it feels like it’ll remain firmly in the middle of the pack.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gear.Club Unlimited 3 | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v6KrxPMV8Wg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As we’re seeing more and more on Switch 2, Gear.Club Unlimited 3 gives you the choice between a 30fps Graphics option and a considerably smoother Performance mode with a 60fps refresh rate. Ideally, racing games need to be 60fps – though 30fps is fine if its stable – and it’s definitely snappier and more responsive. The Graphics option here targets 30fps, but it does not manage it by quite some margin. Stutters and lag happen throughout races in this setting, so much so, that I’d say it’s currently unusable. It doesn’t really seem to make all that much difference to the visuals, either, other than the quality of tyre smoke at the start of races.</p>


<p>In the world of Gear.Club, winning is everything. The story mode sees you joining the organisation as a rookie, before trouncing one of the old pros and stealing his slot on the tour to Japan. Thankfully, everyone is thoroughly amiable, and he comes along as your mentor instead, narrowly avoiding some genuinely interesting conflict and drama. All the story dialogue is told via text boxes and static character art, which serves to emphasise the game’s budget leanings, while the suit and shirt-wearing bigwigs feel completely out of place in a tournament of underground racers. The story is, at best, a fairly forgettable frame to the racing action. At worst, it’s just explaining the next menu you’ve unlocked.</p>


<p>The cars make a better first impression. They are extremely well modelled, shining and glistening in their metallic glory, and striking a tone that will have you feeling pretty positive about Gear.Club Unlimited 3’s chances, though with a roster of 39 cars, it’s relatively slim pickings.</p>
<p>Actually racing them isn’t quite as positive. Gear.Club Unlimited 3 offers a couple of options to tailor your experience, with different levels of brake assist and anti-skid. Whichever option you go for, the cars are relatively well grounded, and pretty reliable in the way they manoeuvre, if a bit lifeless, though there’s still a nagging sense of worry and uncertainty if you go for Expert settings and turn off anti-skid. </p>
<p>Where it comes unstuck is drifting. At no point does this become natural, easy, or enjoyable, and you’ll find you can launch it round curves like a terrible NASCAR driver without losing too much time. That’s all exacerbated by the lack of analogue triggers. We can lay some of that at Nintendo’s door, but when GRID Legends gives you right analogue stick throttle control, and supports the Gamecube controller’s analogue triggers, there’s little excuse for not having it in place. </p>
<p>It all doesn’t come together very well. Rubber banding in races sees you fly past the entire pack, only to have them inexplicably reappear in your mirrors and pass you at the last moment. There’s a Kudos-like scoring system for keeping it clean, and achieving various other feats of vehicular control, but it feels pretty perfunctory and uninvolved.</p>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3 is at its best when it’s trying to emulate Tokyo Xtreme Racer. Battles and duels that take place on packed Japanese highways are the most fun events here, and nipping your way through traffic is a blast. Well, it’s a blast till you clip somebody and invariably end up facing the wrong way.</p>

<p>Upgrading your Club is a pleasant little diversion. You’ve got a massive garage to work with, filling it with technicians as well as designing areas to relax in, and stuffing them full of arcade machines. Upgrading your cars is tied to which workshops you’ve unlocked, and then adding engineers to unlock higher tiers within each one, and that’s interesting enough, giving you a reason to take part in an additional race or two, to fill things out.</p>
<p>The problem is that the engineers and upgrades dry up at points, with little to do but persevere with the ‘story’ mode, and just keep on racing across a map that you can barely tell has changed.</p>
<p>Gear.Club Unlimited 3 is a largely solo experience, with the main story mode taking you from a rookie to the leader of the Gear Club Japan arm of the racing company, while taking in time racing across the roads of France. It’s a shame that progress feels so slow, and the upgrade system so lacklustre, because there are elements of the game that work pretty well. There is a Free-Roam mode too, which I hoped might suddenly turn Unlimited 3 into an open-world racer. Unfortunately, it just lets you – or you and a friend – drive the tracks without any constraints, or you can do some two-player racing, which is a nice thing to have. Being able to explore the world might have been more impactful, if there were more sights to see, beyond the occasional train racing by.</p>

<p>The music is horrendously repetitive. I managed about an hour before I turned off in the races, and maybe a couple more before wanting to cull it in the menus too. Besides that, it hard crashed at points too, dumping you back to the Switch 2’s main menu. It’s just another thing to chip away at Gear.Club Unlimited 3’s potential.</p>

While this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-reportedly-be-multiplatform-on-launch-no-timed-playstation-exclusivity/">multiplatform pivot</a></strong> has been welcomed by Switch 2 and Xbox players, many have voiced concerns that the final part of the trilogy will have to make some compromises in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">visual quality</strong> due to the lower specifications of the Nintendo Switch and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, besides continuing to use <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/"><strong>Unreal Engine 4</strong></a>.</p>



<p>However, this will not be the case, as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong> development team's approach takes platform differences into consideration while scaling down from the lead version of the game: the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PC version</strong>.</p>



<p><em>"The quality of the trilogy will not be diminished, and that's not the kind of development structure we have in the first place,"</em> said <strong>Naoki Hamaguchi</strong> in a fresh interview with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7f-20260216-421552/">Automaton</a></strong>. <em>"I think I have no choice but to keep saying this."</em></p>



<p>Realizing that the concerns may be justified, as he never went in-depth on why <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't be dragged down</strong> by the Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S, Hamaguchi-san provided a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">thorough explanation</strong> on why this won't happen, breaking things down by component, starting with potential <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ROM limitations</strong> deriving from the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges</strong>. As the game will launch at retail on a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Game-Key Card</strong>, file size will not be an issue on the other platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-managing-ram-on-nintendo-switch-2-vs-xbox-series-s">Managing RAM on Nintendo Switch 2 vs. Xbox Series S</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-RAM.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>With proper RAM optimization, Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 will not be dragged down by the Switch 2 and Xbox Series S versions.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">RAM</strong> is among the biggest difference between modern consoles, but this too won't be a concern for Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The Nintendo Switch 2 has plenty of RAM, so it shouldn't be affected. It's true that it will struggle with the Xbox Series S, but that's been addressed by fine-tuning each platform to the utmost. So, RAM issues won't restrict other platforms,"</em> Hamaguchi-san explained.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-npc-density-will-be-critical-for-cpu-optimization">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 NPC Density Will Be Critical For CPU Optimization</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-part-3-NPCs-Density.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3's world may feel a little less lively on lower-end platforms</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The differences in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU</strong> between the systems are unlikely to be a cause for concern. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The way we currently make games is that if a game runs at 30fps on PS4, Nintendo Switch 2, or Xbox Series S, then it should be able to run at 60fps on a high-end platform. In other words, we don't design games with the assumption that it will run at 30fps on a high-end CPU and use all of its available capacity,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"For hardware with CPU power to spare, we use a method of scaling only the density of NPCs in towns, such as the number of NPCs. This means that towns may feel more lively on high-spec hardware, while the number of NPCs may be lower on other hardware."</em> As such, the director of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 believes the team is unlikely to encounter <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">CPU-related issues</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gpu-optimization-and-asset-reduction-from-leading-pc-platform">GPU Optimization and Asset Reduction From Leading PC Platform</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Part-3-PC-leading-platform.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Those with high-end PCs will be able to enjoy Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 at their best, according to Hamaguchi-san.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The final concern fans have, and the one Hamaguchi-san recognizes is the biggest, is related to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">GPU</strong>. Even in this case, however, the Final Fantasy VII Remake series director believes there won't be issues, thanks to <span>the team's development approach, which&nbsp;<strong>scales down from the leading PC version</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>focuses on&nbsp;</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">optimization</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The FFVII Remake series has been purchased by a huge number of customers on Steam and the Epic Games Store, so we are also conscious of creating assets for the wider PC market during development. That's why we create 3D asset data with the highest asset quality based on PC,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said. </p>



<p><em>"As a basic data design, we don't conform to low standards, but create assets for even higher-end use. We call this reduction, and the design involves adjusting and tuning the asset level to suit each platform. In that sense, it's a design philosophy that basically doesn't affect high-spec platforms. This isn't just something we do, but is a relatively common way of thinking in game development environments these days."</em> As such, those with high-end platforms will be able to enjoy the game at its best, while console players will still have a <strong>great experience tailored to their hardware</strong> of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-is-now-playable">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 Is "Now Playable"</h2>



<p>After the end of this exhausting explanation, Naoki Hamaguchi provided a small <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">update on the yet-to-be-revealed Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Development is proceeding almost exactly on time, according to the schedule and milestones set at the beginning of development, and the game is now playable. As a team, we are in the final push to continue developing the game, so the quality is improving day by day, and as a repeat player, the scenery changes every day, making it exciting. So, I think that in the not-too-distant future, we will have an opportunity to share some information with you all."</em> </p>



<p>Hopefully, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/">it really won't take much longer</a></strong> to finally see this highly anticipated game in action.</p>

              <p>Given the current extended wave of Pokémon card lunacy began with Logan Paul in 2020, perhaps this weekend’s sale of the YouTuber’s Illustrator Pikachu card for a completely deranged <strong>$16.49 million</strong> could be the end of it? Bookend this nonsense with the same awful man.</p> <p>Logan Paul’s Illustrator Pikachu is without doubt one of the rarest Pokémon cards in existence. The special card, created in 1997 as part of an illustration contest in Japan, has a unique image of Pikachu with a paintbrush and saw only 41 printed. Of those, only one has ever been graded by PSA (a company that grades all sorts of memorabilia by incredible high standards) to be a 10—a card in perfect condition—and this is the one Paul bought as a stunt in 2022. He paid, in total, $5.275 million, of which $4m was in cash, and the rest in the form of a PSA 9 version of the same card. He then, infamously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">wore the card around his neck for his appearance at Wrestlemania</a> in 2022.</p>

 <p>This was not the first time Logan Paul had pulled this stunt. In 2020, as the world collectively lost its mind during covid, Paul began spending millions on Pokémon packs for attention-seeking streams. At one point he bought a Gem Mint 10 1999 first edition holo Charizard (one of the most sought-after cards) for $150,000, then wore it around his neck to one of his pretend boxing matches against Floyd Mayweather, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-wore-a-pokemon-card-to-mayweather-fight-say-1847044171">claiming at the time that this act had caused it to become worth a million dollars</a>. Thankfully that wasn’t true, and despite the massive hike in prices across the rest of the hobby, you can still pick up the same card in the same quality <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-4-charizard-psa-gem-mtvzj4m">for not much more</a>.</p> <h2>Illustrator Pikachu’s peculiar path</h2> <p>Since 2022, the fate of the Illustrator Pikachu has been bizarrely mixed. In 2022 an Las Vegas Raiders linebacker sold a CGC (rival grading company to PSA) 9.5 for $672,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-pokemon-card-illustrator-blake-martinez-nfl-retire-1849803410">and celebrated by resigning from the NFL</a>. He’s likely kicking himself still, given in the same year <a href="https://kotaku.com/illustrator-pikachu-pokemon-card-most-valuable-record-s-1848598145">someone bought a poorer quality PSA 7 version for $900,000</a>, which at the time made it the most expensive Pokémon card sale ever, before Logan Paul got one later that year. However, a year later in 2023 a PSA 8 went up for auction at $480,000 and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">didn’t receive a single bid</a>. Then last year, all sense was lost as <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-psa9-auction-2000625686">a PSA 9 Illustrator Pikachu sold for a ludicrous $4,000,000</a>. Why was this card suddenly worth nearly four times more than Paul had sold his for three years earlier? Or six times more than the CGC 9.5? Because these small pieces of floppy cardboard are only ever worth what someone is willing to pay for them.</p>

 <p>But forget all of that now, because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/logan-paul-pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-auction-final-sale-price/">as&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> reported this weekend</a>, Logan Paul just sold his one-of-a-kind PSA 10 Pikachu for $16,492,000.</p> <p><a href="https://goldin.co/buy/?Auctions=202512-1918-3018-925819e2-7bfc-4e60-a624-05d1e2f2d4a3&amp;page=1&amp;sort=Featured&amp;number_of_lots=24">Auctioned by Goldin</a>, alongside Paul’s PSA 10 1999 Charizard, a matching Blastoise, and a factory sealed box of Base Set 1st Edition cards, and a whole bunch of others, they all sold for wildly inflated prices. The headline is obviously <a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjAsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">the Pikapainter which went for that $16.5 million</a>, but everything else is equally ridiculous. The Charizard, as described above usually worth $150,000, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-4-chajdvc5?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjEsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">went for $954,800</a>; the Blastoise sold <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-2-blaejo67?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjIsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">for $138,880</a> despite another identical card <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/397613597277">selling for $2000 on eBay yesterday</a>; the matching Venusaur <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-15-vegq3n7?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjMsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">fetched $75,640</a>; and that box of Base Set went for nearly half a million, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-factory-sealed-booster-box-36-packsmrlo2?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjQsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">$496,000</a>. So why did the Base Set starters fetch so much higher? Because for some reason PSA agreed to mark the labels on these gradings with “1ST ED—LOGAN PAUL BREAK,” thus in the eyes of collectors making them unique. As for the Pikachu, there’s no rational explanation.</p>

 <p>Obviously this $16.5 million sale smashes all previous records to pieces, and surely—<em>surely—</em>will never be beaten. There has to come a point where humanity recognizes that shiny cardboard is of limited value. At approximately 1.85 grams, this card is worth 55,370 times the price of gold. Which is silly. It’s all incredibly silly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The ongoing shortage of memory chips has reportedly led Sony to consider delaying the PS6’s release to 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>The shortage of memory chips is impacting the gaming industry significantly. We have already seen GPU manufacturers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raise prices</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue</a> certain products. <span>It seems <span>the impact will reach next-gen consoles as well, as first reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ram-prices-next-gen/" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>&nbsp;and now corroborated by Bloomberg: RAM price increases will delay the next-gen console of PlayStation</span>.</span></p>







<h2 id="h-ps6-could-be-pushed-to-2029-and-switch-2-price-increase-being-contemplated">PS6 Could be Pushed to 2029 and Switch 2 Price Increase Being Contemplated</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-15/rampant-ai-demand-for-memory-is-fueling-a-growing-chip-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> states that “people familiar with the company’s thinking” have revealed that Sony Group has thought of “pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029.” That’s not all; people familiar with Nintendo’s plans have also stated that the company “is also contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 in 2026. However, neither Sony nor Nintendo has officially commented on these plans. </p>



<p>When <span>discussing the impact of memory prices on current-gen consoles, Nintendo has already stated that it will “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-will-carefully-evaluate-switch-2-price-increase-as-memory-costs-rise/" target="_blank">carefully” evaluate</a>&nbsp;Switch 2’s price amid&nbsp;</span>rising memory costs. Sony, on the other hand, has stated that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-holiday-stock-wont-be-impacted-by-ram-shortages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 stocks won’t be affected</a> by memory shortages until the end of the holiday 2026 season.

The stories unfold in both the real world and the fantasy world within the game. The first title in the series, <em>.hack//Infection</em>, was released in 2002 through Bandai Namco Entertainment, and three seasons were published in total. The franchise expanded to anime, novels, manga, OVAs and more, pioneering cross-media worldbuilding by telling varying stories from the same universe.</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Executive Producer:</strong> Hiroshi Matsuyama</li><li><strong>Character Design:</strong> Seiichiro Hosokawa</li><li><strong>Creative Producer / Art Division General <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger:</strong> Akihiro Anai</li><li><strong>Creative Director:</strong> Hiroto Niizato</li><li><strong>Art Division General Manager:</strong> Takahito Washisaka</li><li><strong>Program Division General Manager:</strong> Yasuhiko Tsuneoka</li><li><strong>Game Design Division General Manager:</strong> Tomoyuki Kato</li><li><strong>Sound Division General Manager:</strong> Norikatsu Fukuda</li><li><strong>Theme Music:</strong> Taro Hakase</li><li><strong>Sound:</strong> Chikayo Fukuda</li><li><strong>Art Logo Design:</strong> Makoto Miyoshi</li><li><strong>Creative Producer Manager:</strong> Hironori Yamaoka</li><li><strong>Director Manager:</strong> Yohei Ishibashi</li><li><strong>Producer:</strong> Taichiro Miyazaki, Yuki Nishikawa</li></ul></blockquote><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66142" target="_blank">Famitsu</a>, CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama said the title <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em> reflects the messaging of “restarting <em>.hack</em> from zero,” and has no connection to the <em>.hack//ZERO</em> light novel series by Yokote Michiko.</p><p>The story, set roughly 10 years in the future, will once again center around the in-game MMORPG “The World,” but with a greater focus on real-world drama. While previous entries in the <em>.hack</em> series were limited in their depictions of the real world to emails and web browsers due to budget and publisher constraints, no such constraints will exist for <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em>.</p><p>Matsuyama said the series has always explored themes of duality between worlds, and the monochrome teaser visual is meant to reflect that contrast—such as “public persona vs. inner feelings” and the “dual nature of reality and games.”</p><p>While the genre is RPG, gameplay will incorporate both <a title="Genres > Action [3,410 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> and <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,893 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> elements. The development team is comprised of both series veterans and younger staff. The teaser trailer was produced by Kamikaze Douga and does not feature any in-game footage.</p><p>In related news, the Weekly Famitsu No. 1936, due out on February 19, will feature a 30-page special on CyberConnect2’s 30th anniversary, including an overview of <em>CECILE</em>, the second title in the company’s “<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2020/07/fuga-melodies-of-steel-news-coming-soon-tokyo-ogre-gate-and-cecile-not-yet-in-active-development">Trilogy of Vengeance</a>” series.</p><p>Watch the <em>.hack//Z.E.R.O.</em> teaser trailer below.
