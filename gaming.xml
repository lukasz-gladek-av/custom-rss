		<p>THQ Nordic have announced that their new user generated racer, Wreckreation, will be out this October, and dropped a new trailer to celebrate the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckreation | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kEMB3PehB38?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>For more on this game, got to preview Wreckreation and speak to Three Fields at Gamescom last year.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/28/wreckreation-preview-the-age-of-the-developer-is-over-the-age-of-the-player-begins-now/" aria-label="“Wreckreation Preview – “The age of the developer is over, the age of the player begins now”” (Edit)">Wreckreation Preview – “The age of the developer is over, the age of the player begins now”</a></h2>
<p>Wreckreation takes place in MixWorld, a 400km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;open world setting that combines racing with creation. The ‘live mix’ enables you to build and alter your racing track while you’re racing on it, and while there’s friends in the same space as you. And it’s not just boring old race tracks that are bound by the limits of reality and physics.&nbsp;You can drop audacious loops, ramps into the world, build up into the heavens with race track that arcs through the sky, and throw all manner of crazy props into the mix as well.</p>
<p>As a creation-based racer, Wreckreation will be building on a familiar feeling template for fans of games like ModNation Racers, Trackmania, and even Grand Theft Auto Online, but this will be custom built around the idea of creation within an online open world. It certainly looks different and the console market is screaming out for arcade racers so this should do well.</p>

<p>The game is coming from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/01/26/former-criterion-devs-three-field-entertainment-announce-dangerous-golf/">Three Fields Entertainment, the studio founded by Fiona Sperry and Alex Ward</a> after their departure from Criterion Games in 2014. The pair had led Criterion Games through the creation of their breakout hit Burnout and its sequels, as well as the shift to the Need for Speed franchise in the early 2010s, but when EA decided to downsize Criterion (<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/12/need-for-speed-ps5-xbox-series-x-criterion-ghost-games-ea-gothenburg/">a decision they eventually backtracked on</a>), Sperry and Ward went their own way and founded Three Fields Entertainment.</p>
<p>Wreckreation will be coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC on October 28th, 2025.</p>

<p>This time around, however, it's all about bug fixes (haaa...) and tweaks to Tools. Sharing the details on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">Steam</a>, the developer has detailed what these entail, with many of them focusing on enemies accidentally going out-of-bounds and certain Tools not doing the right amount of damage or not working as intended.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067upjkyr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>While fans should "Expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release", for now, it looks like this patch will be forgoing any more difficulty tweaks. That's not to say Team Cherry won't add any more later down the line, of course, but for now, things are staying as they are.</p>
<p>Currently, there's not a release date for the patch, but we imagine it'll drop in the next week or two.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">current patch notes</a>:</p>

			<p>MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics took players back in time to an era of fighting games that plenty of fans longed to see come back. At least more than a million of them, as Capcom confirms that the arcade collection has officially surpassed one million copies sold, nearly a year to the day after its launch.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It's great to see a collection that does a great job of bringing these older fighting classics back into the spotlight hit this sales milestone, especially for everyone hoping that this will be the start of Capcom releasing a new entry into the series with a proper MARVEL vs. CAPCOM 4.</p>



<p>There's been no official word as to whether it'll happen, but more than a million copies is not something to scoff at, and while it's not a MARVEL vs. CAPCOM game, Capcom has surely been paying attention to the attention that <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/">Arc System Works' Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> has been getting.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for the sake of MARVEL vs. CAPCOM fans, Capcom sees that there's room enough for both games.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-review-taking-you-for-a-ride/">Wccftech reviewed the fighting collection last year</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote, "<em>The MARVEL vs. CAPCOM Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a fantastic celebration of the series, showcasing some of the best fighting games released by the Japanese publisher in the late '90s and early 2000s. Although the lack of cross-platform play reduces the collection's appeal, the additional options and extras are welcome enhancements that make playing these timeless classics on modern hardware even more enticing, especially on consoles.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/pigface-preview-cleaning-out-house</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pigface-preview-cleaning-out-the-house.1299201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You've just woken up in a grimy, dark warehouse. There's a throbbing in your head. The voice on the radio says he just implanted a bomb in your brain. Do what you're asked, or it's lights out. Forever.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;makes a strong first impression. I came in expecting more of a horror slant, as it publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow">DreadXP's</a> specialty, but was met with something more akin to an <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/immersive-sim" rel="nofollow">immersive sim</a>&nbsp;combined with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/first-person-shooter/games" rel="nofollow">retro shooter elements</a>. This Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;offers a brief, but thrilling look at what we can expect in its full release, and now I'm chomping at the bit to see what's next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=5lgN0AH9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gunplay.jpg?itok=b1G5XmNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spray and pray.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Contract Killing in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em></h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Pigface,&nbsp;</em>you're tasked with taking on various hits. You're essentially a cleaner, a professional at killing. Boot up your old, early 2000s laptop in the rundown apartment you live in and get to work. The first job is a farmhouse; apparently, some folks called "The Smilers" need killing. While you're at it, you'll need to grab a sample of their drugs and folders with info on their other hideouts.</p>

<p>With the money that you earn on jobs, you're able to purchase new equipment. This mostly comes in the form of guns, and as you progress, players can buy even better firearms and attachments for them. There are also melee weapons, body armor, morphine, and tools like landmines. Whatever you need to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=lOgdaQLQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gameplay-farmhouse.jpg?itok=jrN5Cg5a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I can here them walkin' around up there...</figcaption></figure><p>So for this first job, you're short on cash and it's actually pretty tricky with few tools at your disposal. The farm is inhabited by over 20 armed thugs, and you're given, essentially, nothing but the most basic items. The good news is, you can approach&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>'s levels in many different ways, which makes it feel quite a bit like an immersive sim.</p>

<p>Since I was surrounded by all sides by goons armed to the teeth, sneaking around was key. I didn't hit the farmhouse first since it was chock full of The Smilers, so I went to the barn and took out some thugs in a frantic firefight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually, I make my way to the house on the property. It's a mini fortress, with sentries up high and patrols all around. Thankfully, I've got more ammo for a TEC-9 I scavenged.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=sa_efju9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-gun.jpg?itok=LISkHjZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The dreaded silenced .357.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface</em>'s Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>Scavenging seems like a key component to&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, too, since ammo is a finite resource. You're not running around, picking up floating ammo refills. You'll have to make do with the guns of your enemies once you run out of your main weapon's ammo. If all else fails, use a melee weapon like a hammer, but that makes you extremely vulnerable. Use of cover and not rushing in head-on seems crucial.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're pretty susceptible to gunfire in&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>, but enemies are equally so. Unlike, say, a boomer shooter, enemies drop down a bit quicker. A headshot is immediately lethal, but depending on the weapon, even a shot to the body may drop them for good.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=piP08M5l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-shotgun.jpg?itok=X7NhqAUm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He won't see this coming.</figcaption></figure><p>While at first you feel at a disadvantage with the number of enemies, later missions start to feel easier. Levels grow in both size and complexity, but the weapons and tools available to you level the playing field. I appreciate the flexibility players are given with their build, especially with weapon variety.</p>

<p>There are pistols, rifles, and machine guns, all of which behave different. Some of them have optional scope or silencer attachments, while others don't. Gunplay feels more realistic than your usual shooter. There isn't a reticle, so you're reliant on iron sights, though some guns don't even have that.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-sniper.jpg?itok=CWbRcN6h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-sniper.jpg?itok=Euj3Daz4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Like fish in a barrel, really.</figcaption></figure><h2>Death From Afar</h2>

<p>Some weapons could use some balancing, though, as they make&nbsp;<em>Pigface'</em>s missions far too trivial. I equipped myself with a scoped .357 magnum and sniped enemies from afar. They weren't able to tell where my bullets came from, so it was just a matter of picking everyone off one by one.</p>

<p>This was without a silencer attached to the magnum, by the way. Using a silencer would have made things even&nbsp;<em>easier</em>&nbsp;since enemies can detect noise, so my choice in not using one was to add just a little bit of a challenge. Hopefully, in later builds, highly accurate, long-range weapons have a trade-off, so it's not so easy to abuse this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I hope the core gameplay loop of&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;stays true to how it is currently. Completing objectives like eliminating certain targets or destroying drug-making materials in any manner I see fit is simple but enjoyable. The gunplay ticks all the right boxes, even if it doesn't feel like a traditional shooter, and if I can get even more fun guns to play with, all the better.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pigface-humor.jpg?itok=Y7-mRYpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pigface-humor.jpg?itok=_aAmU8Rz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm coming on Friday!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Pigface </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The aesthetic for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is not necessarily completely original, but I enjoy look it's going for. The low-poly graphics and the piss-colored filter gives off a certain dark, brooding, edgy feel. It's an uncompromising, dirty, and extremely violent shooter involving some dirty work, so it all fits thematically.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you're trudging through the sewers of a dilapidated suburb or shooting your way through a rinky-dink motel full of drugs and thugs, the Early Access for&nbsp;<em>Pigface</em>&nbsp;is a promising first look. Who knows, there might even be a few surprises waiting for players in the future. I can't wait to see for myself!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s second patch is here ahead of an impeding full release, with Team Cherry having shared the notes and initiated Steam beta testing. No balancing tweaks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-patch-makes-some-early-bosses-slightly-easier-out-now-in-steam-and-gog-beta">this time around</a>, just a bunch more handy bug fixes that're well worth being aware of.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We're getting close to finalising the second post-release patch for Hollow Knight: Silksong," the studio wrote in <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">post on Steam</a>. "Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools." They added that if you do opt to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">test it out via the beta branch</a>, you should "expect a few more additions and tweaks before full release".</p>
<p>As for the tweaks made thus far, you'll find 'em laid out below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to 'Off'.</li>
<li>Updated Herald's Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.</li>
<li>Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.</li>
<li>Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.</li>
<li>Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.</li>
<li>Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.</li>
<li>Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.</li>
<li>Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.</li>
<li>Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.</li>
<li>Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.</li>
<li>Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.</li>
<li>Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.</li>
<li>Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.</li>
<li>Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.</li>
<li>Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.</li>
<li>Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.</li>
<li>Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.</li>
<li>Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.</li>
<li>Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aside from Disgraced Chef Lugoli sometimes just deciding he's done with Hornet and nopeing out never to be seen again mid-fight, the one that's caught my eye is the death sequences messing up if you expire the moment you deal a fatal blow to a big baddie. Surely that's a) pretty tough to pull off and b) something that should offer a unique outcome. I'd say the boss' expiration going sideways in some hilarious fashion would count for the latter.</p><p>So, here's hoping Team Cherry add in a less troublesome bug to ensure anyone who pulls off the double death still get a quirky reward to ease their pain. Anyway, I'll stop waffling, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">our great Silksong walkthrough</a> Ollie's worked really hard on.</p>

              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> hasn’t been <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-team-cherry-seth-goldman-2000625769">out for even two weeks yet</a> and it’s already getting its second patch. But for anyone still struggling in some of the game’s more brutal boss fights and platforming sections: don’t expect any more relief just yet. The Metroidvania Soulslike’s new update mostly takes aim at some of the smaller bugs fans are facing.</p> <p>“We’re getting close to finalizing the second post-release patch for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>,” Team Cherry <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">announced</a> on Steam on Tuesday. “Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools.”</p> <p>While not live in the game on PC or console yet, players can test the fixes in the public beta branch on Valve’s storefront while the developers work on adding a few more fixes and improvements. Here’s the full patch notes so far for <em>Silksong</em> update 2:</p>

 <blockquote><p>– Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to ‘Off’.<br> – Updated Herald’s Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.<br> – Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.<br> – Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.<br> – Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.<br> – Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.<br> – Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.<br> – Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.<br> – Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.<br> – Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.<br> – Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.<br> – Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.<br> – Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.<br> – Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.<br> – Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.<br> – Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.<br> – Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.<br> – Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.<br> – Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.<br> – Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</p></blockquote> <p>This patch will arrive as players continue to debate <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em>‘s difficulty</a> and whether some of the more challenging sections are hard for a reason or just annoying for no reason. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-notes-moorwing-2000624424">The game’s first patch</a> took aim at some of these complaints, including making the dreaded Moorwing boss fight easier to survive. There’s also been some debate over whether<em> Silksong</em> is too stingy with Rosary Beads, its main currency for purchasing equipment, unlocking benches (save spots), and other important resources for the adventure.</p> <p>Even some super fans of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> claim to have bounced off the sequel due to the more punishing gameplay. Team Cherry hasn’t signaled yet if it plans to eventually make deeper changes to<em> Silksong</em> to address some of these concerns, or add difficulty settings to help struggling players <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-difficulty-hollow-knight-easy-mode-2000624441">experience more of its excellent world and story</a>.</p>

              <p>In 2005, a very inevitable-feeling game was released. In fact, it’s remarkable it was as late as that year that we first saw a video game based on the massive television hospital drama <em>ER.</em> The 1994 show that launched George Clooney’s career (if you don’t count <em>Roseanne</em>) had already lost the actor to Hollywood, and by 2005 was very much waning (down from a peak of 36 million viewers to 17.5m), albeit still four years from its eventual demise. Yet, honestly, there was no point in the show’s lifetime when&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> would have made a lick of sense. It remains one of the weirdest video games ever made. Let’s celebrate that.</p> <p>(To get this out of the way, when I say “20 years since,” this isn’t an exact measure. The game came out in the U.S. in May of 2005, but here in the UK it didn’t appear until September.)</p> <p><em>ER</em>, the TV show, certainly had a sense of humor, but it’s fair to say that it was very firmly a drama. These doctors were dealing with life and death, as well as lots of kissing, and there was that time Quentin Tarantino directed an episode. If you wanted silliness, you needed to change channels and watch the extraordinarily weird rival hospital drama <em>Chicago Hope.&nbsp;</em>So it remains a massive mystery how the video game incarnation of the series played like a spiritual sequel to Bullfrog’s&nbsp;<em>Theme Hospital</em>. This was a game in which you had to deal with an invasion of ninjas, and perform an operation while fairies danced around you and a football player kept appearing and disappearing at the foot of the bed.</p>

 <p>OK, let’s give this a bit of context. In 2004, EA’s&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2</em> had released, and controlling characters from an isometric view was big business.&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> very much mimicked the look of the&nbsp;<em>Sims</em> sequel, with its cut-off view of walled rooms and NPC characters roaming around the corridors. And like in <em>The Sims</em>, you had to control your character to perform a series of tasks within strict time limits while maintaining their hygiene, health, and relationships. It’s just, you had to do all this while being an intern in the Chicago hospital, surrounded by the characters from the show. And I really do mean the characters from the show. Completely improbably, frankly inexplicably, this game almost no one heard of, let alone played, starred proper members of the TV show’s cast as voice actors. Noah Wyle, Sherry Stringfield, Mekhi Phifer, and Yvette Freeman all showed up, despite surely having nothing in their contracts that would have made them do so, voicing the doctors and nurses with whom you needed to get along. Sadly Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic were no-shows, and obviously Anthony Edwards and George Clooney were long gone, but still.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626003"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626003">© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m not an expert in how real hospitals are run, but I’m reasonably sure that it’s not entirely a gift-based economy. Yet this is how <em>ER: The Game</em> pitched things, with your relationship statuses with your colleagues often decided by the presents you’d buy for them and receive from them. Even the patients would give you a present if they were happy with your performance. Along the way, you gained new skills and talents, each boosted by being in the positive company of more talented co-workers, as you treated patients for their broken bones, neurological issues, and toxicology-based troubles. It was the latter that led to the most memorable moments.</p>

 <p>It has been 20 years since I played this game, and tragically it’s no longer available to buy. (This is definitely one GOG needs to rescue.) I am delighted to say that I do, however, still have the DVD on which it was released. The only issue is I don’t own a DVD drive, and as such can only show it to my PC, which just stares nostalgically at the shiny plastic. Fortunately, I do have my memories, and a copy of the review I wrote for it back in a 2005 print edition of <em>PC Gamer</em>. Let me quote from it:</p> <blockquote><p>“It’s certainly the best rubbish game I’ve played in as long as I can remember.”</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000626004" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626004"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626004">© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s remarkable how far the incompetently-made game’s utter weirdness carried it, the sheer charm of its absurdity making it a compelling play. And never more so than in that scene when my character started seeing fairies. It was a great level! Everyone was being so nice to me, and my medical skills were hugely improved. Even Dr. Pratt (Phifer) has stopped being a complete dick—the dude had taken a real disliking to me, and wouldn’t even talk about the weather when I tried to chat. The fairies dancing around the room did make the situation somewhat suspect, and like I said, there was that footballer in his full kit who would appear and disappear. That didn’t seem <em>quite</em> right. But it was still a disappointment when I woke up in a bed with Dr. Carter (Wyle) shouting at me. At this point, back in reality, the hospital had been invaded by a ninja and I was needed to help find him on the security cameras. One shift later I was kissing Dr. Carter.</p>

 <p>It’s a shame it was so badly made. The controls were a shambles, various systems made little to no sense, and the act of having a conversation with a janitor was technically more complicated than performing surgery on a child. But 20 years later, that shit only makes me like it even more. And it certainly helped that as busted as it might have been, the game was so bonkers that literally anything could happen, including a sudden mad rush of patients in cosplay after a disaster occurred at a sci-fi convention.</p> <p>Thank goodness for YouTubers, because you can still see the first 15 minutes of the game, complete with its utter lack of NPC pathfinding:</p>

  <p>It’s sad that as an industry we appear to be long past crappy TV tie-in games. Who can forget (no matter how hard they try) Telltale’s abysmal&nbsp;<em>CSI</em> games? Or&nbsp;<em>Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm</em>? Let alone&nbsp;<em>Prison Break: The Conspiracy</em>. And no, Netflix churning out mobile games for each new commission doesn’t count. We need more terrible games based on big-name franchises, or what’s even the point?</p> <p>Meanwhile, I’m beginning my campaign for GOG to rescue&nbsp;<em>ER</em> from obscurity, so I don’t have to be the only person who even remembers it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Job sims today encompass so many different professions, from train operator to farmer to power washer and beyond. Sometimes I enjoy those kinds of games, but I expect <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3283240" rel="nofollow">The Lift</a> to be my favorite of them going forward, because it takes the job sim genre and makes it spooky and weird.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7M_OYzkiBM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h7M_OYzkiBM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Inspired by the New Weird movement, which defines things like the SCP Foundation and Pacific Drive, The Lift casts you as a handyman who fixes benches, replaces light bulbs, and reroutes electricity in a facility that quite closely resembles the setting of Control. It's for that reason I've already coined its alternate title: The Oldest House Flipper. A playtest for the game is out today on Steam, free for all players. I got to check it out last week in a hands-on demo that showed off about three hours of the game, including its earliest moments and some later stages. What I saw was a game that pulls from many of my favorites but wraps them together in a novel way.</p><p dir="ltr">The facility at the heart of The Lift, called The Institute, feels like it's pulled right out of Remedy's New Weird foray, complete with a once-orderly workspace now left mysteriously abandoned and endangered. As the "Keeper" sent in to keep things tidy, you'll need to solve BioShock-like electricity puzzles, clean up mystical black gunk coating much of the place, and explore the world in a manner inspired by immersive sims. Particularly inspirational to the game's designs is one of my favorite games ever made: 2017's Prey. Finding new crafting blueprints, then dumping resources into a giant machine where it spits out new, more valuable parts, is pulled directly out of Prey--even the room that houses this multi-machine process resembles Prey's.</p><p dir="ltr">The new team behind the game, Fantastic Signals, said the non-linear progression through The Facility is also meant to harken back to Prey and im-sims like it, where multiple solutions can be used to solve many problems, and where tools you unlock later in the game can alter how you interact with spaces you revisit. But all of that is joined by the odd wrapper of a job sim, making it appear like those other games I love in some obvious ways while still being quite unlike them at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568552" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568552"></a><figcaption>There are bad days at the office, and then there are days where you get consumed by whatever this stuff is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In The Lift, each floor you visit has what amounts to a functionality rating. It's your job to repair things until the floor is working as usual again. Virtual elbow grease is the name of the game. You'll reroute the electricity to fix vending machines that spit out working light bulbs, then replace faulty ones nearby, raising your functionality rating by small bits at a time. You'll charge a handheld vacuum-like object that removes oily coatings from benches and doorways, opening up new passageways that further aid you on your quest to fix the mysterious facility left in a state of disrepair.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lift is a game of pulling levers and fiddling with doo-dads in the way a lot of job sims already are. It's a game that loves when you ask, "What's this button do?" and doesn't punish you for pushing those buttons, even when they lead to failure. If you run out of energy for your vacuum, you can go get more at the machine that dispenses it. If you borrowed some parts from that machine to repair something else, no worries; you can just go and undo that. The levels I saw didn't clearly define which way I was meant to go, which left me with a sense of self-guided discovery. Reading displays and observing the effect I could have on each level taught me how I could have an effect on The Facility more than a simple tool tip could. The zig-zaggy way of problem-solving is pulled right out of immersive sims, and is a quality I'm always looking for in games. I just didn't know I'd want it in a job sim. But so far, The Lift works (no pun intended).</p><p dir="ltr">The storyline that unfolds focuses on slowly unraveling the mystery of what happened to The Facility before you were sent in to fix it. Soviet-style propaganda posters line many walls, notes can be found, and these and other breadcrumbs are meant to intrigue you to finish each workday and make it to the next floor. The developers played a bit coy when, during a roundtable discussion, they were asked about the presence of enemy threats--given their comparisons to Pacific Drive, I'm expecting something more like that game's anomalies than true "enemies," but the jury's still out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568553" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568553"></a><figcaption>Everything in The Lift feels meant to be flipped, pushed, toggled, or otherwise fidgeted with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's a lot I don't yet know about The Lift, and frankly, given the combination of genres and very hands-on mechanics, I even find it a bit hard to describe. Luckily, the playtest is out now, so I think the best way to speak to it is how I led with it: If you're into stuff like Control, Prey, and Pacific Drive, and you're curious how those games would look as a job sim, you're in luck: Fantastic Signals had the same question, and then they went and answered it themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lift comes to PC in 2026, with console versions coming at a later date.</p>

            <p>
A PS5 system update is due tomorrow that will finally add controller pairing across multiple devices.
</p>
<p>
It means if you're using your DualSense controller across more than one console - or for PC or mobile play, for instance - you will no longer need to pair it each time.
</p>
<p>
This update was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-system-update-will-finally-add-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices">detailed by Sony back in July</a>, but finally it will be available globally for users from tomorrow, 17th September.
</p>
<p>
The update will also add Power Saver mode, which will scale back performance to reduce power consumption. Future updates for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, Demon's Souls, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> will make use of this feature.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bokura and publisher A Plus have announced the release date for upcoming MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</em>, and it won't be long before you get to play this one on either mobile or PC.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>will be launching on October 9th, following a closed beta period during which "over 29,000 players" made their way into the game's world of Regnus.</p>

<p>The game will be available across PC, iOS, and Android, and the developers confirm that it will support cross-platform play, meaning you can pick up where you left off on PC or mobile. Bokura and A Plus have also confirmed that you'll be able to play alongside your friends on other platforms.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=Vvz_2Gj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-protocol-star-resonance-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=Iw_M4-10 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>is launching in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>isn't just a re-release of the original&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol</em>, which had its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blue-protocol-canceled-west-japan-service-ending" rel="nofollow">Western launch canceled last year</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, according to the game's <a href="https://star-resonance.com/faqs/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official FAQ</a>, it tells a "completely new story with original characters", alongside "significant changes" to the original game's maps. You can also expect all-new classes, new guild halls and activities, and new "life skills" like botany and fishing.</p>

<p>If you decide to head into this one (and it is, as you've probably guessed, entirely free to play), then you'll be able to choose whether you want to take part in epic raids, kick back with some fishing, or just chill out in one of Regnus' more populated areas.</p>

<p>Should you decide to take the fight to&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</em>'s many monsters, you'll find a flexible class system that lets you swap styles "anytime", as well as bosses that "demand teamwork".</p>




<p>If you happen to have a Crunchyroll membership, then you can link it up with&nbsp;<em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>for some extra goodies as well, including "avatar frames, mount skins, and more". We'll get more info about this feature soon, according to Bokura and A Plus.</p>

<p><em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance&nbsp;</em>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681810/Blue_Protocol_Star_Resonance/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on October 9th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> was one of the great surprises of last year (or this year <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/what-does-ps5-pro-give-you-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">if you only have a PS5</a>). It was a great romp that found its own distinctive take on the archaeological, mythological adventuring games that the films helped inspire, and playing in first person with a few moments of third person worked far better than I and many others might have expected. And now it’s time for a little bit more of that with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-coming-out-in-september/">The Order of Giants</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Launch Trailer – Indiana Jones and the Great Circle™: The Order of Giants" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XD9Q3nIpMqQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While it appears on the main menu, selecting this brings up an explanation card to state that The Order of Giants has simply been brought into the existing story with the appearance of Father Ricci off to the side of the Vatican City map. Speaking to him, he ropes you into his investigation of the legend of the Nameless Warrior, a very tall, giant warrior that took part in the Siege of Antioch, with a relic of his having been hidden away by one of those old Popes. Alas, the Blackshirts have stomped in and are blocking his return to the treasury, so it’s time for Indy to get a bit sneaky. Or not.</p>


<p>Stepping into this situation is a little bit different, depending on how far you’ve got through the main story. With the game already completed, and having thoroughly explored all of its areas, I could simply disguise myself as a Blackshirt and wander through to get to where I wanted, basically unchecked. Similarly, there’s little new here in terms of gameplay mechanics, no new gadget to use, and no real requirement to have the tools earned in Gizeh or Sukhothai from the main story, just because of when and where you’re able to access this side quest.</p>
<p>That placement, I feel, also comes to affect the story itself. I’ve no idea whether or not Locus was planned to appear in this story prior to Tony Todd’s passing, but since he was the one real tie to the secretive Nephilim Order, and we’re now investigating more tales of giants from history, it’s a tad odd that this tale is completely standalone.</p>


<p>But the mystery does deepen in a satisfying fashion as we reunite with Ricci and deduce that we need to go spelunking through the Cloaca Maxima, the giant sewer network that runs under Rome, in order to find the latest puzzling MacGuffin. Thankfully we can use a boat to get around and avoid getting into the putrid water too often –&nbsp;I hope Indy’s got some travel insurance for his inevitable hospital stay after this –&nbsp;and as we find new branches to explore and open up new areas, there’s both encounters with a red-robed Cult of Mithras and some nice brain-teasing puzzles.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the puzzle rooms here, as they just go one or two steps beyond the obvious to give satisfying conclusions. Taking pictures of a Latin inscription and then reading the translations in Indy’s journal to interpret their clues, but then having to relate these back to a blend of visual and written marks on a map was a nice one. So too was a Pipemania style puzzle, helping to navigate a ball through a maze while having to move connectors in real time. They’re not puzzles that will have you stumped for more than a few minutes, but they are enjoyable.</p>

<p>It all builds up to a big boss battle and, similar to the boss fights in the main game, I did find this a bit wearing. While the pugilism and fighting in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is often about getting in a hefty clonk to your opponent’s head, the grandest moments drag this out a bit too far for my tastes. In this instance, it got to the point for me where I felt I was probably doing the right thing to deal damage, but simply couldn’t tell in the moment –&nbsp;a quick hop across to YouTube confirmed that I was, and it proved I really was just a couple more hits away from completing the story.</p>
<p>While I do wish that The Order of Giants was more substantially linked to the main game or felt like it was pushing on with some new ideas, it also fits perfectly as another little episode in Indy’s Saturday matinee capers. It’s a shorter episode that you could almost view as a standalone adventure, and that’s great in its own way. If there were more expansions like this, I’d be all aboard, but I still hope for something a bit broader and more adventurous in the future.</p>

<p>Shared on <a href="http://reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/1nhol9e/trails_in_the_sky_sc_remake_teaser/">Reddit</a> and reported on by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-confirmed-could-release-a-lot-sooner-than-people-think">Push Square</a> (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-teaser-trailer">Gematsu</a>), the teaser is hidden within the upcoming remake of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, which launches on Switch and Switch 2 this Friday, 19th September 2025.</p>
<p>If we had to guess, the teaser probably plays you've rolled credits. And for good reason; there are some pretty big 1st Chapter spoilers there.</p>
<p>We're not going to pop the video here, and we recommend you only watch it if you've played Trails in the Sky on PSP or PC before (and/or SC) or you don't care for spoilers, but if you're curious, go check out the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reddit.com/r/Falcom/comments/1nhol9e/trails_in_the_sky_sc_remake_teaser/">Falcom subreddit</a>. Instead, have a look at last week's combat trailer to give you a little tease of the remake:</p>

<p>This shouldn't be surprising news, and we're sure Falcom will announce something once 1st Chapter releases, but Falcom president <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/09/second-trails-in-the-sky-remake-all-but-confirmed-by-falcom-boss">Toshihiro Kondo has already hinted at the sequel's existence</a> just a few weeks ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/sony/">Sony</a> game development studios have already used its Enterprise LLM AI tool to develop some of its games, but the company is set to make these tools a support for creativity rather than a substitute.</p>



<p>In its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">2025 Corporate Report</a>, the Japanese company laid out its plans for AI usage in game development, confirming it has already been used in some capacity to support the development of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 with the use of <em>"voice recognition software specialized for games to make simultaneous subtitling<br>automatic in some languages"</em>, and to test some models using Horizon series protagonist Aloy. Since 2023, over 50,000 people in 210 different teams within the company have started using the Enterprise LLM tool, which helps them use AI safely for chat or writing help and connect it with daily work tools. With a focus on potential legal, privacy, and ethics issues, Sony aims to make AI a safe support for creativity, and not a substitute for developers, to accelerate and streamline the development process, such as improving image quality with upscaling tech, which the company is already doing with the PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler.</p>



<p>The use of AI in video game development has been a hot topic of discussion for quite some time, and some developers have highlighted in the past few months how it can help a large-scale development process that is progressively becoming less and less sustainable for various reasons. Back in June, Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai highlighted how game development has to change to remain sustainable and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">AI can be used to improve efficiency</a>, which mirrors Sony’s vision of using AI to streamline the development process, as outlined in the 2025 Corporate Report</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/voyagers-of-nera-preview-low-key-tropical-survival.1299111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Quite a few survival crafting games take place in a tropical setting, and they each have their own spin on the formula — whether it's aiming for realism or leaning more toward a fantasy adventure. In this&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll go over the good (and the bad) of this latest survival crafting experience from Treehouse Games.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="733ce2a9-3d2e-4af6-88be-c6f61d51c3a1" href="https://techraptor.net/games/voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow"><em>Voyagers of Nera</em></a>&nbsp;is the first title from Treehouse Games, a remote-first game developer. Players take on the role of an "Echo," a long-dormant guardian who has awoken to a world in chaos. Now, it's up to you and your friends to rescue lost spirits and defeat monstrous creatures of all sizes across the land.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is fairly light on story, at least in its Early Access launch version. You've been hibernating for a long time, and the world has gone to hell in a handbasket in your absence; now it's up to you to rescue lost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="534397b6-4f38-40c6-ae79-440c3d125e7c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-spirits-guide-locations-and-unlocks" rel="nofollow">"Guide Spirits"</a> and set things right.</p>

<p>The first hour or so of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;is standard fare for a survival crafting game tutorial; you learn basic movement and combat as you rescue a Guide Spirit from enemies. Once that's done, you emerge from the temple to find yourself on a beach with a massive stone arm lying in the distance — welcome to The Embrace.</p>

<p>The Early Access launch version of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;has <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="695708b2-0456-4bfc-aca7-983b8bff8b6b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-map-and-locations-guide" rel="nofollow">a map</a> that is split into three distinctive regions: The Embrace, The Reef, and The Greatwood. These areas are separated by masses of rocks known as "The Deep," filled with a corrupting aura and stalked by a massive sea monster that can tear you to pieces.</p>

<p>You can travel from island to island within a region by running, swimming, or using a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02803ce6-aafd-4617-8ce2-79760299d79c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-skimmer-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">Skimmer</a>&nbsp;(which is essentially a magical surfboard), but you'll almost certainly need a proper boat to travel between the major regions.</p>

<p>Both of the available <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe7167a1-adba-4d35-bc38-08e684a14e7e" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-boat-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">boats</a> are fairly large, and it can be difficult to navigate some of the tighter waterways. It's especially challenging to use a boat as a solo player since you'll need to raise the sail to gain speed and then move to the rudder to steer it. It appears that the bigger boats are intended to be piloted by a crew of two people.</p>

<p>Fortunately, you only really <em>need</em>&nbsp;boats for traveling between regions or moving large amounts of cargo; you can get by traveling within a region using your Skimmer and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6e1baf40-feae-4feb-a2a1-0a7c3829dbba" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-get-glider-in-voyagers-of-nera" rel="nofollow">glider</a>. Still, it would have been nice to have a larger boat with some cargo space that could be piloted by a solo player more easily.</p>

<p>However you travel, your ultimate goal is to rescue the Guide Spirits of the world one by one. Each rescued Guide Spirit powers up your base just a little more, allowing you to use new crafting stations to better equip you for the more difficult zones.</p>

<p>You can explore the world to find Guide Spirits on your own. You'll get a warning message that a nearby spirit is in danger when you're close, but it can be difficult to find them sometimes. Fortunately, the Spirit Anchor can be used to point you to a Guide Spirit in the region that you have not yet rescued.</p>

<p>Regrettably, it appears that the Spirit Anchor can only point you to one unrescued Guide Spirit at a time, and that results in a somewhat predictable gameplay loop: find a Guide Spirit, rescue it, return home, and use the Spirit Anchor to find the location of the next Guide Spirit to rescue.</p>

<p>Your quest to rescue the Guide Spirits is dragged out by a lack of useful fast travel. You can build an <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="35964fa7-4053-43a1-87dc-1661b562379a" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/voyagers-of-nera-ancients-gate-guide" rel="nofollow">Ancient's Gate</a> to easily travel between two bases, but you can only have a handful of bases total. As far as I can tell, there is no item to quickly teleport you back to your base in the game yet, either.</p>

<p>There isn't much preventing you from building a boat and sailing all the way to the last region, although that's ill-advised; as you might expect, enemies get progressively tougher as you move to each subsequent region. You can't rescue most Guide Spirits if you're not equipped to kill the enemies holding them hostage.</p>

<p>You're also limited to only one base until you level up your Spirit Anchor. Currently, you're limited to a maximum of four Spirit Anchors; that's just enough for one base in each region, plus a spare. You can build wherever you like, but the functionality of a base is hamstrung without the multitude of buffs a Spirit Anchor provides.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although Voyagers of Nera's world is fairly wide, it feels seomwhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The meat of the game is rescuing Guide Spirits, leveling up your Knowledge Tree to craft more gear, and eventually progressing to more difficult regions. Each region introduces new enemies and new obstacles for you to face, so there's a serviceable amount of variety in the combat challenges you'll encounter.</p>

<p>That said, there isn't much beyond the core gameplay loop of alternating between rescuing Guide Spirits and crafting better gear. Although <i>Voyagers of Nera's</i>&nbsp;world is fairly wide, it feels somewhat shallow with a lack of side activities for you to take on.</p>

<p>I enjoyed my time exploring the world of&nbsp;<em>Voyagers of Nera</em>. I had fun exploring the islands and rescuing Guide Spirits, but the lack of things to do between those core gameplay objectives made it feel a little light on meaningful, engaging content.</p>

<p><em>Voyagers of Nera</em>&nbsp;could be a great survival game once it has matured a bit, expanded on its features, and added a little more variety in its gameplay. Unless you're dead set on playing it, it's probably best to hold off on playing this game&nbsp;until it has a couple of major content updates under its belt.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Voyagers of Nera</strong><em>&nbsp;was previewed over approximately 99 hours of gameplay on PC via&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2686630/Voyagers_of_Nera/" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>&nbsp;with a key provided by the publisher.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-playfully-revives-nintendo-rivalry-in-new-sonic-racing-crossworlds-trailer.1299105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has released a brand new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, and it contains some not-so-subtle jabs at racing rival&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, as well as Sega's general history of rivalry with Nintendo.</p>

<p>In the trailer (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/sega-references-its-past-feud-with-nintendo-in-shady-ad-comparing-sonic-racing-crossworlds-and-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>), we see a TV, on which a heavily pixelated kart racing game is being played. It's pretty obviously&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, and the camera quickly pans to a much more sophisticated TV, on which&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>appears.</p>

<p>Quickly, the&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>TV is attached to a sleek, speedy racing car, while the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>TV, as seemingly befits its low-tech status, is hitched to a juddering RV. Just in case you needed some extra help, the RV is pictured next to a tortoise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=BvrNJDPW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crossworlds-ad-rv.jpg?itok=haSK0OWi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>&nbsp;ad isn't exactly subtle.</figcaption></figure><p>The ad closes with an invitation to players to "come race on our level", and in the trailer's description, Sega recommends players "leave the open road behind", which seems to me to be a pretty obvious jab at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct" rel="nofollow">open...well, world</a>.</p>

<p>It seems that Sega is poking fun at the old rivalry between itself and Nintendo, which primarily existed throughout the fourth and fifth console generations (and, partially, the sixth, before the Dreamcast sank without a trace and the PS2 ascended into the heavens).</p>

<p>It's the beef that gave rise to the legendary "Genesis does what Nintendon't" slogan, and while there's nothing quite so direct on offer here, it's fun to see Sega back to its old prickly self, even if it is just for a few moments.</p>

<p>You can check out the playful and fun new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</em>ad right here. Just don't write any hate mail to Sega about how Nintendo is clearly better (or vice versa) once you're done, OK?</p>




<p><i>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds&nbsp;</i>is due to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2486820/Sonic_Racing_CrossWorlds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-racing-crossworlds/9NMR17QTLC33" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-racing-crossworlds-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on September 25th, and a release for Switch 2 is also planned for this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Sony’s next <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699">PlayStation showcase</a> might be sooner than some expected. A new State of Play is reportedly planned for later this month, pegged to Tokyo Game Show 2025. There’s certainly no shortage of things The PlayStation 5 maker could show off, including that rumored update on Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>.</p> <p>Podcaster and leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1967788911180263523">spilled the beans</a> on X early on Tuesday. It began the night before when people started asking him for information about when Sony’s next showcase would be. “Sony has a presentation soon,” he replied cryptically. Then earlier today he elaborated, “Next week.” NateTheHate’s had a good track record ever since he accurately reported on the Switch 2 reveal earlier this year, and a PlayStation event pegged to Tokyo Game Show would make sense.</p> <p>Sega <a href="https://tgs.sega.jp/2025/en/lineup/">recently teased</a> its TGS lineup with four secret slots for unannounced games that are “coming soon.” Capcom, Square Enix, and other Japanese publishers will have a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/square-enix-announces-tgs-2025-lineup-schedule">big presence</a> at the show as well, though fans have already begun speculating about what else could get announced during it. The reported State of Play adds some weight to the possibility of something big, like a tease for the third part of the<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy VII</em> remake series, or the rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> remaster. At the very least, we might finally get updates on <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em> and <em>Dragon Quest XII</em>.</p>

 <p>As for what Sony might bring to a State of Play, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> recently</a> reported that the next trailer for <em>Wolverine</em> is complete and all but guaranteed to appear in the next PlayStation State of Play. That would be good news for players waiting to see more of Insomniac’s next Marvel project after years of silence and ahead of a rumored launch in 2026, though a TGS-adjacent showcase also seems like a weird venue to show off new footage compared to, say, The Game Awards.</p> <p>We’re also due for an update on <em>Marathon</em>. Bungie’s extraction shooter was originally scheduled to come out this month before getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">indefinitely delayed</a> following mixed feedback on an alpha test earlier this year. The studio promised fans would get a new release date announced sometime in the fall, and Sony has still claimed the live-service game will launch before the end of March 2026.</p>

Shadows’ expansion, Claws of Awaji, is firmly the former, almost to a fault. Naoe gets some new combat tricks thanks to a whole new weapon type, and the general pace of exploration is made more hectic and tense as enemies are way more dangerous and way more motivated to bring the fight to you. But the land itself doesn’t feel much different than the rest of Japan, and the straightforward adventure is light on revelation and doesn’t make too great a case for its own existence.</p>The story that carries our heroes off of the mainland and onto the island is much like that of the main game, filled with colorful characters and a shadowy group of conspirators that need to be brought down systematically, but it’s a simple and predictable tale on the whole. It does pick up the threads of Naoe’s missing mother and the growing influence of the Templar order in Japan, but it doesn’t do much to tie those up in satisfying ways by the end. It also doesn’t make much of a case for seeing anymore of this world. For all Valhalla’s faults, each expansion felt like it was introducing a new dimension to the greater world that Eivor and friends occupied. Claws ends, and 16th century Japan doesn’t feel much bigger than it did 10 hours before it.<output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Awaji Island is just as beautiful as the rest of Japan, but it’s not so significantly different from the mainland that a person who hasn’t already spent 60+ hours playing would be able to spot the difference at first glance, unlike when Eivor went to Ireland in Valhalla, for instance. Awaji is a bit more mountainous, which is more noticeable when having to navigate up and down the length of the map because of the significant lack of fast travel points throughout. And there are some visual gems hidden away like a dark swamp with creepy foliage, or a big warship that’s under construction. But if you’ve seen a mountain caked in winter snow earlier this year, this will look exactly like that. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’ve seen a mountain caked in winter snow earlier this year, this will look exactly like that.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s more of the same kinds of side quests and activities to do on Awaji as well, which is good for gaining knowledge points to invest in the limited amount of new skills and upgrades available to Naoe and Yasuke, but still pretty optional and ignorable otherwise. Side quests seem even more tucked away than the main game – I didn’t come across any of them organically and had to put extra effort into finding people with problems I can solve.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe gets her hands on a new weapon in Claws of Awaji, the bo staff. Fashioned as a hybrid of a long-ranged crowd controller and a single-target mix-up machine, I found it to be much better at the latter than the former. This is mostly because of its novel stance-based attacks, using high jabs to interrupt enemies and low sweeps to take them off their feet and open them up to big, reliable damage. On the off chance I got into extended brawls as the Shinobi, the bo was reliably my second slot choice.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are new skills for both Yasuke and Naoe, but I didn’t find them to be particularly spicy.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are new skills for both Yasuke and Naoe as well but I didn’t find them to be particularly spicy enough to unseat my tried-and-true staples tested under dozens of hours of chopping and stabbing. Some new equipment is available to plunder from castles but as it was in the base game, these aren’t really much of a carrot worth chasing unless you really love having all of the icons on the map cleared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The island of Awaji is thick with opportunities to put all of your skills and gear to the test. It’s dense with folks who at best don’t trust you, or at worse would travel far and wide for a chance to kill you. I felt I was being hunted and conspired against much more than in the base game. Every horse trip longer than 100 meters left me exposed to road traps set by enemy ninja. City guards are much jumpier and more suspicious, and will not hesitate to start a melee in the middle of the market to take you down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The general chaos of the island cleverly married with the main quest’s objectives.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I liked how the general chaos of the island cleverly married with the main quest’s objectives to take down the three trusted taisho of the Templar leader in the region. For instance, those road side ninja? They work for Nowaki, a gun-toting hunter that is terrorizing the region for sport. Stopping to take them out instead of avoiding them gives you the chance to run their pockets for clues to where their master might be hiding. Those jumpy guards all answer to Tomeji, the beefy vanguard that enforces order with an iron fist. He’s very conspicuous in a castle surrounded by his elite guard but picking fights and causing general ruckus will compel him to send those guards out to stop you. And when they don’t return on account of you retiring them early, he’s left more and more vulnerable to your inevitable siege. Using your scouts to track down objectives will put the search zone on high alert thanks to the third big bad on the island: a shadowy spymaster of a thousand aliases.

The handful of new boss fights also do a good job of playing to the pair's individual strengths, including a very cool stealth battle that kind of evokes Metal Gear Solid and demands all of Naoe’s skills to overcome.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Randy Pitchford has continued his social media push to address complaints about the performance of the PC version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, telling some disgruntled players they can get a Steam refund if they’re unhappy with the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Borderlands 4’s huge Steam launch last week, Pitchford has issued <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/randy-pitchford-addresses-borderlands-4-console-fov-slider-complaints-theres-some-dreams-i-have-where-an-fov-setting-might-affect-fairness"><u>confusing comments on why the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a field of view (FOV) slider</u></a>, promised <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try"><u>that it would have been impossible to break the Borderlands 4 servers through sheer weight of player numbers alone</u></a>, told people to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">“code your own engine and show us how it’s done, please,”</a> and declared Borderlands 4 “a premium game made for premium gamers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s the truth of the matter? Borderlands 4 is currently on a mixed Steam review rating, with most of the negative comments revolving around performance. The tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> have said <a href="https://youtu.be/2v1ST5qMoaY?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their initial analysis of Borderlands 4 on PC</a> shows significant stutter problems, and have advised against running the game on its ‘Badass’ graphics setting, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting">which suggests there are indeed problems with the Unreal Engine 5 title</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, the outspoken Gearbox chief is showing no signs of backing down, issuing tweet after tweet in response to direct complaints about how Borderlands 4 runs. Most of the tweets offer direct advice about how to make Borderlands 4 run better - which is of course a perfectly reasonable thing to do - and call for players to put their irrational distrust of video game graphics tech such as DLSS aside and use it if available to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Pitchford, perhaps showing a touch of frustration about the discourse around Borderlands 4, has issued some spicier responses, pointing to the Steam refund system so players can get their money back, or suggesting fans wait for the game to be cheaper — or more powerful PC hardware to come out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not trying to argue either,” Pitchford said in one of his tweet responses. “I was offering to help you if you are not satisfied with your experience and want some help making trade offs. I'm trying to help users understand that the software is the software and there are options available right now for people who want to play right now to make significant and dramatic trade offs between fps, resolution, and graphics features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's for people who want to play now. People who want to play later can play later. People can even get a refund after buying and trying if they are not satisfied. Those are the options. My advice to users is to accept reality and tune, or to not play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are working more on the software, but the software will not radically change later. However, hardware will get better (just like some or all of your hardware probably didn't exist when Cyberpunk first launched). Do you feel you need help to achieve the trade-offs you're looking for? What kind of hardware are you using and what resolution are you trying to run at and what frame rate is acceptable to you?”</p><div id="borderlands-vault-hunters-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands' Vault Hunters, Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other posts worth highlighting here because they give us an insight into Pitchford’s current mindset. After one person said he was being “unbelievably insufferable,” a non-plussed sounding Pitchford replied: “I'm trying to be helpful. What do you think would be helpful? What would you have me do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It looks like some PC gamers don’t like being told to use the likes of DLSS and frame generation generally to improve the performance of Borderlands 4 — and this is something Pitchford seems particularly keen to address. In multiple tweets he suggested playing with the aid of frame generation, although clearly this advice is falling on deaf ears.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You can do whatever you want,” <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pitchford said in response to yet another complaint</a>. “The game is the game. Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/16/gettyimages-2165616825-1758023724911.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford is tweeting through Borderlands 4's PC performance backlash. Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then a typically evocative quote from the Gearbox boss: “You made an analogy to a vehicle. I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari. If you tell me about your specification, I can help you optimize your performance. I'm sorry you don't like being told to use DLSS, but that is the way. If you're not happy using the tools available to you to improve frame rate and you're not happy with the frame rate you have, you should play a different game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The game is awesome and it is designed to be just fine of an experience at 30fps and feel great at 60fps. We also have provided a lot of options for you to make different trade offs between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features than we would make and we encourage you to use those tools to optimize to your taste. Would you like help tuning your experience better to your liking?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967842598586028207" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another spicy take from the developer</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do you want any help tuning your experience? Your other option is to not play or wait for future updates or newer hardware to come along down the road. The game will probably be cheaper in a couple of years, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967830314983768368" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">And</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“UE5 is the engine for Borderlands 4. There's nothing that can change that now. Shader compiling is necessary when you make changes to your graphics settings. I wish it was faster, but it is what it is. When you're done and set up, you won't have to wait the few moments for shaders to compile any more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't believe I have denied any particular issues (except, generally, to say that the software is functioning as designed and is free from major defects that affect performance for the vast majority of configurations). What I have done and continue to do is recommend that users who want to play the game now and change the trade off between fps, resolution and graphics features take advantage of the tools provided to tune those things to your liking. Would you like help tuning your experience on your specific PC?”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And so on and so forth. Is Pitchford causing more harm to Borderlands 4 than good here? Last month, I asked Strauss Zelnick, CEO of Gearbox parent company Take-Two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-strauss-zelnick-says-borderlands-chief-randy-pitchford-can-be-controversial-at-times-sometimes-intentionally-sometimes-unintentionally-but-i-still-love-him-to-death">whether he has a mini heart attack whenever Pitchford tweets anything</a>. In his response, Zelnick admitted Pitchford can be a controversial figure, and even suggested some of his antics are deliberate, but ultimately he’s a big fan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love Randy, first of all. Let me just say that on the record,” Zelnick began. “And I love his big personality. I love his passion and he is one of the all time great game makers. He also can be controversial at times — sometimes intentionally, sometimes unintentionally. I still love him to death.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of all this is that Gearbox is continuing to improve Borderlands 4 generally and PC performance specifically (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-update-to-help-improve-stability-for-a-wide-range-of-pcs-released-but-there-are-no-patch-notes"><u>there’s an update out although no-one knows what it did</u></a>). Gearbox has posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app, although users report mixed results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has also issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile. Please keep playing for at least 15 minutes to see how your PC's performance has changed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

And now the build is spreading like wildfire, fans are convinced Gearbox will soon nerf it into the ground. So, as NickTew suggested: “abuse it while you can.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make this build work you need the Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator Augment. Land a hit with this knife and subsequent damage to the target are automatic critical hits for five seconds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the trick: add bleed stacking and each tick of the bleed effect registers as a critical hit. Yep, every one is a crit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s brilliant for every class, but it’s even better for <a href="https://maxroll.gg/borderlands-4/build-guides/vex-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vex</a> because of her Bloodletter passive. This makes your gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply bleed, which counts as gun damage and is based on the initial damage dealt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vex's Contamination passive adds to the carnage, because it causes critical hits to increase status effect application chance up to 100%, ensuring the bleed re-procs infinitely. So, throw the knife, land one big shot on the boss, and watch the numbers get bigger and bigger as the bleed ticks it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NickTew nukes a boss with a level 32 weapon on the Ultimate Vault Hunter Level 5 difficulty, just to show how effective the build really is. This difficulty means enemies have an additional 350% HP, and the boss still goes down in seconds.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem is, a knife with this augment is a rare find (hopefully you didn't sell or drop one you picked up early game!), so you’ll probably need to do some farming to get it (Splashzone seems like a good shout). Once done, though, the build is essentially complete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

It just trivialises the game to the point that the guns don’t even matter anymore. Just apply the penetrator debuff and bleed and then watch it go exponential in damage. Probably not an interaction the devs picked up on in balance testing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has a lot to contend with right now, including improving performance (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-your-own-engine-and-show-us-how-its-done-randy-pitchford-goes-on-the-offensive-as-borderlands-4-pc-performance-row-intensifies">while Randy Pitchford tweets through it</a>), adding a field of view (FOV) slider to the console version, and working on post-launch content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
