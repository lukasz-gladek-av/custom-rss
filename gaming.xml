Every now and then I abandon all of my responsibilities and go for a walk in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/book-of-travels">Book Of Travels</a>, a “tiny MMO” from Might And Delight. While a bit Orientalist in ways I’m still unravelling for myself, it’s one of the loveliest video game spaces I’ve ever inhabited: huge, picturebook horizons, molten shades of greenery, tiny wanderers keeping pace with beautifully combed clouds.</p>
<p>Might And Delight’s just-announced “cosy decoration game” Twinkleby doesn’t have quite the same magic, so far – it’s less mysterious, more wholesome. But I do enjoy its focus on antique dollhouses. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
In Twinkleby, you build cutaway houses on floating islands and decorate them with furnishings such as sofas and lamp posts. In the process, you’ll attract vagrant bobble-head people, who will arrive in astral sailboats and make requests you can fulfil for additional rewards. It reminds me of how you'd turn wild creatures into residents in Viva Pinata.</p>
<p>The campaign is a procession of these breezy pastelcore asteroid conversions, with map fragments to discover that unlock hidden islands. You can also collect shooting stars and spend them at a place called Molligan’s Antiques, which I’m hoping will turn out to be a proper vintage toy emporium born of some designer’s extra-curricular obsessions. There are, needless to say, no lose conditions and no game-overs: this is about tricking out dioramas as you please.
</p>
<p>
Every “wholesome” game needs its undercurrent of darkness, especially when the name has you picturing some kind of gerbil butler. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> has the concept of a mortgage; Twinkleby has the option of throwing everything and everybody away like a spoilt child. Just lob anything you're displeased with over the side of the island and it'll return to your inventory.</p>
<p>“Expand your collection, discover antique secrets, decorate, and when you change your mind – evict everyone and throw their furniture into space!” sings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3362960/Twinkleby/">the Steam page</a>. The jarring choice of "evict" here makes me suspect that Twinkleby is some kind of Molleindustria black op. Perhaps the bobblehead people will eventually form a co-operative and depose you.
</p>
<p>
Look out for Twinkleby sometime in 2025. The only thing I outright dislike about the game so far is the familiar choice of sound effect when you place objects – that delicate "kiss pop" which, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/islanders-new-shores-is-the-follow-up-to-2019s-gentlest-town-builder">as I noted in my write-up of Islanders: New Shores</a>, has become ubiquitous in cosy building games, and which I now find repulsive for its dopamine-milking inoffensiveness. 
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know it was possible to feel patronised by a sound effect. It reminds me of those automated doors in The Hitchhiker’s Guide that were made sentient specifically so that they could sigh in satisfaction when you walk through them. We need a next gen of “kiss pop”, cosy game developers. Musical fart noises? The clattering of actual dollhouse furnishings?

You’ll roll through 30 levels and six different worlds, each one featuring the same retro graphics as the original game.</p><p>Just like the original, there’s also a bunch of power-ups and weird characters to encounter during your journey. Despite its flaws Glover has become something of a cult classic over the years--so if you’re interested in checking out the Nintendo 64-era 3D. platformer and like to own physical games, snag a copy while you can.</p></div>                      </div><p>Limited Run has noted that Glover is not a numbered release in the Limited Run Games Collection. Instead, the company is distributing Glover for QUbyte Classics. In other words, if you’re an avid collector of Limited Run games, missing out on this won’t ruin your collection.</p><p>Another way to play Glover on a modern console is with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Piko-Collection-Atari-2600/dp/B0CTKZNC4Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blaze Evercade Piko Collection 4</a>. The collection includes 10 games (one of which is Glover) and can be played on Evercade Handheld, Evercade VS-R, Evercade EXP-R, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-alpha-bartop-arcade-review-the-best-and-most-versatile-home-arcade-machine/1100-6527595/" data-ref-id="1100-6527595">Evercade Alpha</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evercade-reveals-two-new-super-pocket-handhelds-featuring-neo-geo-and-data-east-games/1100-6530501/" data-ref-id="1100-6530501">Super Pocket</a>. Beyond Glover, the $24 cartridge includes Street Racer, Risky Woods, Skuljagger, Star X, and more.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade EXP-R</a> is frequently sold out, but it’s available for close to retail price at Amazon ($105, five bucks more than MSRP). Bundled with Tomb Raider, the handheld retro console is a great way to take classic games on the road with you. Alternatively, one of the four Super Pockets is a more affordable companion for Glover. Each one comes preloaded with its own set of games, including hits like Double Dragon, Asteroids, and River City Ransom.</p><h2>Play Glover on Evercade Hardware</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade EXP-R</a> -- $105 (Third-Party Seller)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Retro-Gaming-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VYPWLH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade VS-R</a> -- $125 (Third-Party Seller)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Capcom-Super-Pocket-Atari-2600/dp/B0CB6DTMYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom Super Pocket (12 games built-in)</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Technos-Pocket-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DBLPWDLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Technos Super Pocket (15 games built-in)</a> -- $56 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Evercade-Atari-Pocket-Sega-Dreamcast/dp/B0DBLMM94B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Super Pocket (50 games built-in)</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blaze-Taito-Super-Pocket-Atari-2600/dp/B0CB6DG8R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Taito Super Pocket (17 games built-in)</a> -- $59</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Alpha-Bartop-Arcade-Atari-7800/dp/B0D5HQZ16W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade Alpha Mega Man Bartop Arcade</a> -- $250</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Alpha-Bartop-Arcade-Atari-7800/dp/B0D5HQQ34B?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade Alpha Street Fighter Bartop Arcade</a> -- $250</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-is-first-switch-2-game-you-can-preorder-in-the-us/1100-6530662/">Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion Is First Switch 2 Game You Can Preorder In The US</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-lego-set-gets-rare-discount-snag-the-ornithopter-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6530648/">Dune Lego Set Gets Rare Discount - Snag The Ornithopter For Its Best Price Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-console-bundle-deals-still-available-at-amazon/1100-6529417/">Astro Bot PS5 Console Bundle Deals Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-movie-steelbook-and-exclusive-crafting-table-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6530625/">Minecraft Movie Steelbook And Exclusive Crafting Table Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Nintendo Switch 2 Preorders Delayed Due To Tariffs, Release Date Still June 5</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2-here-are-your-options/1100-6530578/">MicroSD Express Cards For Nintendo Switch 2 - Here Are Your Options</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-four-mario-kart-lego-sets-for-the-best-prices-yet-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Grab Four Mario Kart Lego Sets For The Best Prices Yet At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Here’s one of them.</p><p>A few minutes into the stream, Musk started to receive private messages from other players. Some were celebratory, calling him a “god gamer,” but the messages quickly veered into spammy, then abusive territory. One message asked him to “make it clap for daddy.” Another was a player claiming to be Ashley St. Clair, a former partner of Musk’s who is currently <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F2025%2F04%2F01%2Felon-musk-ashley-st-clair-paternity-dispute%2F82760786007%2F" rel="sponsored">locked in a custody battle with him</a> for their five-month-old child. While yet more seemingly cut to the heart of Musk’s destructive ego trip with the American government, “Elon, deep down you will always be cringe no matter how much money or power you have.”</p><p>Some viewers tried to be helpful, suggesting that Musk use the command to disable messages, but he took no action. In the last minutes of the stream, Musk made a hardcore difficulty character he named Kekius Maximus, a 4chan-esque meme name he’s used as his display name on X. But Kekius Maximus was not long for the world. Musk died to one of the game’s tutorial bosses due to a bad connection, which subsequently concluded the stream, ending another sad, weird data point in the Elon Musk fake gamer saga.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cant-afford-a-nintendo-switch-2-buy-a-switch-1-nintendo-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders are opening up in various regions—not you, United States—today and tomorrow, meaning that, likely, millions of people are set to make the $450+ purchase on the new console. Unfortunately, however, there are plenty of others that won’t be able to afford the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CBC</a>, which took place prior to the console’s pre-orders being delayed in the United States, Nintendo of America’s president Doug Bowser was asked about the console’s price and what players who can’t afford it should do. His response? Play the original Switch.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Addresses Nintendo Switch 2 Game Prices</a></h6>



<p>“As we look at Nintendo Switch 2 and you think about the feature sets that I talked about … we believe that the pricing is appropriate for the value of the machine and the gameplay experience overall,” Bowser said.</p>



<p>“We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford [the Switch 2’s] price point. That’s why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so [people] still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in.”</p>



<p>While it’s not as direct as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_JVVUnCWnY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Don Mattrick’s response regarding</a> the Xbox One requiring a constant internet connection in 2013, it still isn’t something that’s likely to sit well with a lot of players. </p>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is reportedly scheduled to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">this month</a>, but it shouldn't be expected to become available this week, judging from what a reliable insider said in the past few days.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, well-known insider NateTheHate reiterated that the game will be released in the second half of the month, so its launch shouldn't be expected this week. While the precise release date hasn't been confirmed, the insider suggested with another comment that the remake could be released close to April 21st, as an X user who celebrates their birthday on that day could consider the game a birthday gift.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I've already said it's in the second half of the month.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1908673744299585910?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">It'll be close enough that you could consider it a birthday gift.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1908664050545840312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, it has quickly become one of the worst-kept video game secrets of the past few years. Funnily enough, the game wasn't revealed by insiders but by Bethesda's owner, Microsoft, in an <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">FTC investigational hearing</a> held with Xbox's head, Phil Spencer. Unfortunately, every other piece of information known about the game, such as its developer, which should be known porting and support studio Virtuos, its engine, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">gameplay changes</a> it should feature, has yet to be confirmed, but if the remake is indeed releasing in the second half of the month, the wait won't be much longer not just to see it in action, but to experience it ourselves.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada have been delayed, following on from the company's decision last week to push back the pre-order window for the console in the US.</p>

<p>On Friday last week, Nintendo announced that US Switch 2 pre-orders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">would be delayed</a> in order to give the Japanese gaming giant time to assess "evolving market conditions" brought about by President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs.</p>

<p>Now, in a statement given to Canadian tech news platform <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo has confirmed that Switch 2 pre-orders in the US' neighboring Canada will also be delayed. Pre-orders in Canada were originally due to open on April 9th, but a new date hasn't been announced.</p>

<p>Just like in the US, however, Nintendo hasn't given any suggestion that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> will be delayed in Canada. It is, however, possible that the console's price will be changed, although no price change has been announced in either country.</p>

<p>This also shouldn't affect pre-orders in any other countries, although as usual, it's worth keeping an eye out for any specific announcements pertaining to your country of residence to be on the safe side.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder, Nintendo fully revealed the Switch 2 last week. Launching on June 5th, the console will cost $450 in the US and around $630 in Canada (at least, as far as we know).</p>




<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a> will include the likes of racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as tech demo-style title&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>, which, despite its title, won't be a free pack-in game.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the Switch 2 will still be launching on June 5th in Canada. Nintendo will likely announce when pre-orders will open in both the US and Canada in the coming days or weeks, so stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders in Canada were set to begin at 12:01am ET on April 9 in some stores. Unfortunately, players across the country will have to wait as Nintendo has delayed pre-orders for the console in the country at the last minute.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MobileSyrup</a>, Nintendo confirmed the decision to wait until a later date.</p>



<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in Canada will not start on April 9, 2025 in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the U.S. Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>



<p>The statement reads similar to the one provided when the company <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed pre-orders in the United States</a> last week.</p>







<p>The Nintendo Switch is currently priced at $629 CAD for the base system and $699 CAD for the Mario Kart World Bundle. It’s currently unknown if there could be any change to pricing of the system in the country or if it will just be, as the company said, to align with United States plans.</p>



<p>What do you think of Nintendo also delaying pre-orders of the Switch 2 in Canada? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1829/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>Anticipation is high for Clair Obscur Expedition Expedition 33, an upcoming turn-based RPG with real-time fighting mechanics, and players want to know if the title will be available on Game Pass.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur Expedition 33</a> is inspired by the Belle Epoque, a period in French history from 1871 to 1914. Since there was no war, the era is remembered for being peaceful, and technology flourished. For example, The Eiffel Tower and the Paris Subway system were created, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut project puts a dystopian spin on that quiet time.</p>



<p>In this universe, there is a paintress. When she paints a number on a monolith, everyone of that age turns to smoke and fades away. That number decreases every year, and one group sets out to stop her before she paints their age. </p>

<figure><figcaption>This isn’t the standard turn-based combat you are used to. Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Clair Obscur Expedition 33 is a day-one launch for <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9PPT8K6GQHRZ/0017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscribers on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>To get access to games on the day they are released, you need to be a<strong> Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, which costs $19.99 monthly</strong>. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qgOZDRDynw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reveal trailer</a> set the tone for what to expect from this unique take on a turn-based RPG. The Eiffel Tower and Arc de Triomphe are bent and distorted, and the expedition group needs to worry about more than just the paintress. </p>



<p>Strange marionettes and other large beasts have overrun France, and players have an arsenal of turn-based attacks but can also dodge, parry, and counter in real-time by timing the rhythms of attacks to take down every enemy. </p>

Now we know it's for the console's new GameChat feature. We recently had a chance to ask Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta a question about the button, and we've also learned what happens when you press it and don't have a Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p><p>Since the C button is used to connect to an online service, we asked Dohta what happens if you press the button and your console is not connected to the internet. He didn't tell us exactly what happens, but he confirmed it won't do anything... bad.</p><p>"Sorry, I can't get into the details of what exactly pops up or shows up when you press the button [when you're not online], but just rest assured nothing bad's going to happen," he said.</p><p>It's nice to know pressing the C button when you're offline won't do anything bad, but what will actually happen if you press it when you're offline? Time will tell. But we now do know what happens if you press the button and don't have a Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="251709074" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4472723-screenshot2025-04-08at11.13.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4472723" data-ratio="0.5060553633218" data-width="1156" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4472723-screenshot2025-04-08at11.13.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4472723"></a><figcaption>A look at GameChat with Mario Kart World.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4472723-screenshot2025-04-08at11.13.57am.png"></figure><p>The Switch 2 has a built-in microphone that can be used to chat with friends, while players can connect a USB-C camera to chat over video.

            <p>Nintendo is delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> pre-orders in Canada.</p>
<p>Pre-orders were set to go live in Canada tomorrow, 9th April. However, "in order to align with the timing of pre-orders to be determined in the US", this date has now been shifted to an unspecified time.</p>

<p>"Nintendo will provide updated information at a later date," the company told <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/04/08/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canada-delay/">MobileSyrup</a>, adding the scheduled Switch 2 launch date of 5th June remains "unchanged".</p>
<p>News of pre-orders getting delayed in Canada follows Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-delays-us-switch-2-pre-orders-due-to-tariffs">unprecedented decision to delay Switch 2 pre-orders in the States</a>, with the company citing the impact of Trump's tariffs as well as "evolving market conditions" as the reason. At this time, Canada was still planning to kick off Switch 2 pre-orders on 9th April.</p>
<p>As with Canada, the Switch 2 is still expected to release on 5th June in the US.</p>
<p>US president Donald Trump imposed wide-reaching trade tariffs last week, with some of the highest levies targeting countries which also happen to be critical centres of video games hardware manufacturing.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Entertainment Software Association (ESA) senior vice president Aubrey Quinn said these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-tariffs-will-have-a-real-and-detrimental-impact-on-games-industry-says-us-trade-group">tariffs will "have a real and detrimental impact" on the video games industry</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-pre-orders-will-prioritise-players-with-the-most-switch-playtime">Nintendo itself is enforcing strict criteria on pre-orders</a> from its own store in a bid to reduce scalping, while multiple online UK retailers have started pre-orders.</p>
<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-already-being-sold-on-ebay-for-more-than-the-recommended-price">Nintendo Switch 2 consoles have been popping up on auction sites such as eBay for over £600</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine the opening credits playing on a pilot episode of a television show—the scene-setting, the character introductions teasing backstories and defining traits, the tantalizing hints of the larger story ahead. That’s what one-shots do for manga: These special chapters, typically longer than the standard 20-page weekly installments, offer readers their first glimpse into a series’ expansive universe.&nbsp;</p><p>Some one-shots, like <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Look Back</em></a><em> </em>by Tatsuki Fujimoto, the creator of <em>Chainsaw Man</em>, exist as standalone masterpieces, perfectly self-contained. Others, like those for <a href="https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shonen the big three</a>—<em>One Piece, Naruto and Bleach</em>— act as the <a href="https://www.viz.com/wanted-eiichiro-oda-before-one-piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seeds from which global phenomena grew</a>. One-shots are mangaka’s hail mary—a chance to go from a complete unknown to a household name in the manga world. While the journey from one-shot to full-fledged manga series isn’t foolproof, Rafał Jaki from <em>No\Name</em> told me the story behind the grand opening and grand closing of Shueisha’s first Western-published manga series.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="No/Name Manga Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HAt2-yDEc8I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h2>No\Name in a nutshell</h2><p>When manga fans discovered that <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-anime-trigger-2077-1849530790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em></a> showrunner Rafał Jaki had taken a creative leap post-anime and won <a href="https://medibang.com/mpc/mom/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shueisha’s Shonen Jump+ Creators competition</a>, excitement reached a fever pitch. His imaginative new series, No\Name, made history as the first Western manga to be published bi-weekly alongside fan-favorite titles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dandadan</em></a>.</p><p><a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/titles/100339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">No\Name</a>, a dark mystery thriller by Jaki and artist MACHINE GAMU, is set in Northern Europe. The series poses an intriguing question: What if your name endowed you with supernatural powers tied to its meaning? Central to this world is the Nordic Naming Bureau (NNB), a government organization that issues names to newborns, effectively regulating both their powers and their societal standing.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><p>The story follows two NNA agents—Ralf, whose name translates to “wolf commander,” and Ursula, meaning “bear”—as they investigate the disappearance of a prominent public figure’s child. What unfolds is a tense and action-packed mystery, exploring the many layers of the series’ unique premise. Within a week of its one-shot chapter release in September 2023, <em>No\Name</em> captivated over one million readers, and their <a href="https://twitter.com/GwentBro/status/1818577567709827289" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enthusiastic response</a> paved the way for the series to be officially picked up for publication in July of the following year. However, after an intense 14-chapter run, the series came to an abrupt end, leaving manga readers to play armchair expert—as they’re often left to do—wondering if <em>No\Name</em> was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1RBvZ6R26g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest in a promising new shonen series cancelled</a> before things got going.&nbsp;</p><p>To clear up the confusion, I spoke with Jaki to discuss his experience publishing on Shonen Jump+ and to debunk misconceptions about what the workflow was like for a creator working with one of the world’s most renowned publishers.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>Contrary to popular belief, <em>No\Name</em> wasn’t axed</h2><p>Jaki clarified that <em>No\Name</em> was neither axed nor cancelled prematurely, despite online speculation. While Jaki acknowledged that the series' ending mirrored what typically happens when a manga is cancelled, he emphasized that the conclusion was in line with the editorial agreement Shueisha had outlined for him before the series even began its publication.</p><p>“First, they wanted to see more finished chapters to review them and see our ability to continue and execute, but also, they asked for the first arc of the story,” Jaki said. “I’m a ‘discovery’ writer, which means that I tend to do my best work while I’m writing the actual script vs having a detailed outline (so the plan of events and stakes and characters involved) as a starting point. But they needed to see an outline, which requires a pretty detailed plan (meaning scene by scene, chapter by chapter). To do that, we needed to settle on a page count that resulted in a number of volumes that Jump+ is committing to publishing physically in Japan.”&nbsp;</p><p>At first, Jaki envisioned <em>No\Name</em> as a concise series spanning four to five volumes with 30-page chapters, which he believed would “do the trick” to cover its full run. However, Shueisha had a different perspective. Considering that Jaki and GAMU were a “rookie team,” the publisher felt that Jaki’s original plan would be “too much as a binding commitment.” As a result, the strategy was adjusted — <em>No\Name</em>’s first two arcs would unfold over two volumes, culminating in “a proper, satisfying ending.”&nbsp;</p><p>“We of course asked if we could continue past two volumes, and they said that it is a possibility only if it becomes a hit. So we went to work hoping it will become one and gave our best. The reality was that it was popular in the West (but not a top hit) and doing barely ok in Japan, so they kept their word, and we ended it according to the outline we provided before we even started the serialization,” Jaki said.&nbsp;</p><p>“The really cool and surprising twist at the end was that the editorial team (on their own) put this message at the last page of the final chapter, so it gave us confidence to get to work on a new thing,” Jaki added, referencing <em>No\Name</em>’s afterword thanking readers for following the series and asking them to look forward to the creators’ next work.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>“Buffer” chapters in manga production</h2><p>While corresponding for my <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rafa-jaki-went-from-cyberpunk-edgerunners-to-shonen-jumps-first-western-manga-artist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prior feature interview with Jaki</a>, he’d mentioned he had chapters prepared weeks before their release. The practice was news to me. Years of writing articles about how mangaka like <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-yoshihiro-togashi-manga-hiatus-gon-kill-1848969729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hunter x Hunter</em>’s Yoshihiro Togashi</a> put his series on hiatus after falling ill trying to meet <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grueling production demands</a> and Fujimoto wishing he could <a href="https://kotaku.com/chainsaw-man-manga-oshi-no-ko-crunchyroll-shonen-jump-1850684535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stop drawing <em>Chainsaw Man</em> and write its story</a> to meet weekly releases made Jaki’s casual revelation sound like a no-brainer solution to cushion creative burnout plaguing the industry. Although Jaki couldn’t speak on the production schedule for other mangaka, he said that other mangaka tend to have “quite a few ‘buffer’ chapters” ready to go before they start serialization on a weekly or bi-weekly series.&nbsp;</p><p>“In print, Weekly Shonen Jump the chapters are around 20 pages usually, and that goes out every week. On the <a href="https://aftermath.site/heres-the-dumb-shit-you-have-to-put-up-with-to-read-manga-these-days" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jump+ and Manga+ app </a>&nbsp;you have also bi-weekly serialization (<em>No\Name</em> being one of them). To hit that WSJ weekly release, a mangaka will have assistants working on backgrounds, VFX, SFX etc. For example, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/chainsaw-mans-influence-can-already-be-felt-beyond-its-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fujimoto assistants</a> were in the past: Tatsuya Endo (<em>Spy X Family</em>), Oto Tōda (<em>Chihayafuru</em>), Yuji Kaku (<em>Hell’s Paradise</em>), Yukinobu Tatsu (<em>Dandadan</em>), and Tohru Kuramori (<em>Centuria</em>),” Jaki said. “So, a company of highly skilled people under one mangaka works as a team to hit that deadline. Of course, this does not mean that all mangaka that are serialized in WSJ get to have this amount of stuff to do it - but once you get the initial sales numbers, it makes sense to have that setup. However, multiple chapters are prepared in advance before a series starts.”</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><p>He continued: “It’s more common to prepare more chapters independently without any assistants for bi-weekly. We had volume 1 done for <em>No\Name</em> before we started, but we did not have any assistant working with GAMU on the art, so it would take him 3-4 weeks to complete a chapter, and that meant we had just enough time to make our deadlines for volume 2. But as life happens–someone will get sick and you lose a week or so, we had a computer die on GAMU and we lost some work and a few days to buy and set up a new one, etc.–and that buffer gets eaten up. GAMU did work each day all day to hit the deadlines we had, but if we would continue past volume two, we would have to hire an assistant to be able to deliver the chapter bi-weekly, and you need to be a hit for it to make financial sense.”</p><p>Combine that with the challenges already faced by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/being-a-manga-letterer-is-more-than-having-a-fun-job-2000549285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Western manga letterers</a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-harassment-comes-with-the-territory-of-translating-popular-manga-2000556430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">translators</a>, who often juggle multiple series just to make ends meet, <em>No\Name</em>’s continuation would’ve added another layer of complexity in its production, requiring localizers and typographers to rework the series for Japanese audiences based on Jaki and GAMU’s original efforts—all while racing to meet the demanding schedule of a bi-weekly publication. While some manga series have managed to secure continuation thanks to the<a href="https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> collective efforts of overseas fans boosting Japanese volume sales</a>, despite Jaki’s best social media efforts, <em>No\Name</em> didn’t follow the same trajectory.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>Manga volume sales (in Japan) make or break a series</h2><p>As Jaki noted in a post on his <a href="https://x.com/GwentBro/status/1844074463878369385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Twitter account</a>, <em>No\Name</em> was performing strongly when it launched on Jump+ in Japan and Manga+ in the West with around 900,000 readers in Japan and 250,000 in the West. However, the series faced a sharp decline in readers, losing more readers than other new shonen series like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-new-manga-to-read-2025-2000560252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>MAD</em></a> in Japan from chapter two onward, making a continuation unlikely unless volume one of the series sold well in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>“After we started serialization, we got numbers from the Japanese app and web views, which were on the edge. They could go either way, so the next threshold was the physical volume one sales in Japan that could change the already-established plan to finish with two volumes,” Jaki said.</p><p>Being able to see how things were going under the hood with weekly reader metrics and volume sales, Jaki and GAMU had <a href="https://twitter.com/GwentBro/status/1844074463878369385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an inclination that the series wouldn’t outlive their initial agreement</a>.</p><p>“We lived in a different head space vs our editor — he was thinking that if volume one physical Japanese sales [were] robust, we can talk about doing more than two volumes, where we were hoping that it would happen and wanted to do everything we could to help that,” Jaki said. “So our editor told us after the initial sales number of volume one came in that, as planned, the series will end with volume two.”</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><p>From a reader's perspective, <em>No\Name</em> had been steadily building momentum, expanding its overarching mystery far beyond the groundwork laid in its earlier chapters. So when it was announced that the manga’s 14th chapter would serve as its finale, fans were left reeling. Ralf and Ursula were on the brink of uncovering the mastermind behind a newly introduced government conspiracy that involved abducting unnamed children from foreign countries and only had 20 pages to wrap everything up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><p>In February 2025, the series’ final chapter took a sharp turn, culminating in a meta ending where the protagonists parted ways with the hope of reuniting in the future. This left readers wondering whether Jaki and GAMU had to adjust the trajectory of <em>No\Name </em>to tie up loose plot threads in its final chapter. Jaki confirmed that they did have to make changes and leave certain story developments on the cutting room floor during the collaboration process. However, despite these adjustments, the series concluded on the note they had initially envisioned when pitching the story prior to serialization.</p><p>“As a ‘discovery writer’ working under a strict outline (that I had to write before writing the scripts), we knew where we were heading. However, I still changed a bunch of stuff, removing possible hints and threads I knew I could not finish at this point,” Jaki said. “Still, overall, we did not change anything significant from the outline I submitted before we started serialization.”</p></div><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha</figcaption></figure><h2>No hard feelings&nbsp;</h2><p>Manga publishers like Shueisha are known for frequently greenlighting new series, but just as often, they pull the plug on others. Endings can sometimes feel abrupt, offering little insight into the directions the story might have taken. In some cases, such as Yuki Kawaguchi’s <em>The Hunter’s Guild: Red Hood</em>’s sudden end, conclusions delve into meta-textual territory, engaging readers in a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/shonen-jump-red-hood-hunters-guild-axed-meta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialogue about the reality of manga cancellations</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Reflecting on <em>No\Name</em>, Jaki remains content with how the series wrapped up. While he acknowledges there were additional avenues he would have loved to explore in terms of its world-building and characters, he’s satisfied with the outcome.</p><p>“My biggest takeaway is that even though I’ve been a manga fan for as long as I can remember, clarity of the story and art is key, and characters need to spell out their purpose in the story early and frequently,” Jaki said. “Japanese readers especially put a lot of emphasis on this vs the West, where ‘innovation’ or finding a new and fresh thing is priced at a premium.”</p><p>From his early days as a devoted manga fan, Jaki’s journey with <em>No\Name</em> spans 24 years, rooted in the formative experiences of a 13-year-old Polish kid captivated by Akira Toriyama’s <em>Dragon Ball</em>. That passion ultimately propelled him to the milestone of becoming Shonen Jump+’s first Western manga creator. As our conversation drew to a close, the lingering question I had for Jaki was whether working on his series — and getting a firsthand look at the industry’s inner workings — had ever left him feeling disillusioned.</p><figure><figcaption>© Shueisha<span></span><span>© Shueisha </span></figcaption></figure><p>“My background is the business and publishing side of the video game industry, so I was not surprised at all. In general, American comics, board games, manga, film, and TV work similarly – everyone wants to make the next big thing, and the system is tailored towards that. Because I know a lot about how things are monetized, I understood that the likelihood of us becoming the next big thing on the first try is unlikely at best,” Jaki said. “ As a creator I must believe that what we are doing is worthy of people’s time and attention – so I would struggle not to get my hopes up, but at the same time have faith in what we are doing as it would be very easy to be overwhelmed by how big of a challenge this all is.”</p><p>He continued, “At the end of the day, we did a thing, some people liked it a lot (but not the needed amount to make more), and we learned and can go and try to make a new thing with all the lessons we have in our pocket.”</p><p>As far as <a href="https://x.com/GwentBro/status/1781211288175010180?t=91XDQ9Y1u86MVQyKO5nOgA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what the future holds</a>, Jaki can’t say much about what he and GAMU are cooking, but they are currently working on two concepts together. One, he hopes, “can go further :).”</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025" target="_blank">Inside Baseball Week</a>&nbsp;is our annual week of stories about the lesser-known parts of game development, the ins and outs of games journalism, and a peek behind the curtain at Aftermath.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/08/can-drag-x-drive-be-the-arms-of-the-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s always at least one odd-ball game that Nintendo releases around the start of a new console generation, looking to take advantage of new controllers and inputs. For the Nintendo Switch 2, it’s Drag x Drive, and while it’s not filled with the same kind of ostentatious characters and flamboyant style, its all-new control scheme could make it the Switch 2’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now obviously they’re two very different games – ARMS was a third-person fighting game, while Drag x Drive is a gritty-looking take on wheelchair basketball – but they are both games that take the fact that you can very easily have two Joy-Con in hand, and then use motion controls and other sensors for inputs. They’re also a real physical workout for your upper body!</p>


<p>Drag x Drive is all about mouse mode, using the Joy-Con 2’s optical sensors in tandem with gyroscopes and accelerometers to track the physical motions needed to propel your character around the court, and shoot the ball for a score.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the inputs disguises just how difficult this can be to get your head around manoeuvring a wheelchair. Placing the two Joy-Con edge-side down on the table to engage mouse mode – your trouser legs can probably do almost as well – you can propel yourself directly ahead by pushing both controllers forward. Push fast enough and you’ll hit maximum speed with little lights gleaming at the back of your chair. When you need to come to a halt, you engage the brakes with both triggers.</p>


<p>Straight lines are easy, but turning needs a bit of thought, as you push the left wheel forward (and the right wheel backwards) to turn to the right. Getting used to this is a bit like trying to figure out if you need to invert or un-invert your axis, or paddling a boat down stream by paddling on either side. Except, of course, here there’s a lot more pressure to spin yourself around, race up and down the court, and play B-ball!</p>
<p>Once you’ve run through the tutorial, Drag x Drive is all about 3v3 matches, passing the oversized ball back and forth between you and dodging past your opponents to get a shot at the hoop. This is as simple as lifting a hand and flicking the ball to try and score, or as complicated as racing up the quarter-pipe ramp at the end of the court to let you pull an audacious spinning slam dunk – something I couldn’t get the hang of in my limited time with the game. Pull off a cool dunk and you’ll get a couple bonus decimal points to your score, which can be the difference between winning and losing.</p>

<p>In defence, positioning and tracking back will be key –&nbsp;thankfully there’s always an on-screen indicator for where the ball is, while the camera remains fixed behind you – and the key defensive move is to ram into the ball-carrier and knock the ball free.</p>
<p>There’s all the regular rules of basketball at play here, so there’s 2 points awarded for a shot inside the half circle, and 3 points from outside, and there’s a shot clock as well, so you can’t keep hold of the ball for too long. Once it times out, the ball will just ping from your lap and give the other team a chance to grab it.</p>
<p>The two issues that I feel Drag x Drive will face are that initial accessibility for new players. Motion controls are all well and good, but it’s just not as intuitive or gratifyingly snappy as Rocket League, and the skill level between a good and a not-so-good player in simply getting around the court will likely be easy to see.</p>

<p>Secondly, it’s all just a bit… drab. There’s some neon lights around the hoop’s backboard, and the scoreboard is built into the ramps on the end of the court in an attractive way, but everything’s just very, very grey. The court is grey, your wheelchair is grey, your character is wearing grey clothes and a grey helmet. Hopefully this is just down to the demo, because this game deserves and needs to have so much more character. There should be an arena set right in the middle of Rio de Janiero, a futuristic London or on Mars, your avatars should have an over-the-top hairdo and brightly coloured sports vests, and you should be able to race around to celebrate much more than just waving your arms around in real life.</p>
<p>Again, I hope we’re just seeing a tiny snippet of what this game can offer. With a bit more flair to the visuals, multiple modes, and just more built around this core concept, this could – <em>could –</em>&nbsp;be a niche hit, just like ARMS was.</p>
<p>Also, can we maybe get ARMS 2, Nintendo?</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/red-barrels-announces-the-outlast-trials-project-breach-at-pc-gaming-show/">The Outlast Trials</a> Season 2.2 update is arriving today, and it's the last major update ahead of the Season 3 launch later this month on&nbsp;<strong>April 22, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Update 2.2 of the Project Breach season will have players trying to defy Murkoff and escape his torture house of experiments that turn your guts inside out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-breach-update-for-the-outlast-trials-now-live-introducing-amelia-collier/">Amelia Collier</a> has hacked into his system, providing a small window of opportunity for the Reagents to get out of dodge while they can.</p>
<p><strong>The Escape</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Under Surveillance Part II</strong> are the two new trials added with this update. In the former, you'll work together with up to four Reagents to get to the Sleep Room, interact with the terminal and get the escape plan in order. The latter will task you with finding the escape plans scattered all across the trials, and finding Amelia's escape message before Murkoff does. You can't escape the Murkoff Institution otherwise, so you'll want to make the most out of your one chance to escape.</p>
<p>The update also adds the Amelia catalog of cosmetics, allowing you to don her look to show your support in the liberation effort. You can unlock the cosmetics by grabbing event tokens from certain tasks in the Under Surveillance trials. And of course, make sure to use them as the event tokens will be gone once the event is over, and the new Season 3 update arrives on April 22.</p>
<p>Speaking of things to do in The Outlast Trials before April 22, this update is also your last chance to experience Rebirth, before the mode is suspended with the Season 3 update, as Red Barrels takes some time to re-tool it. So, if you want to grab some of the legendary outfits that come with being reborn, you have about two weeks to do so at the time of writing.</p>
<p>There's currently no word on when it'll be back, so make sure to take advantage while you can. And while you wait for the update to download on your console or PC, you can check out the new The Outlast Trials trailer for update 2.2 below.</p>

Yet our curiosity remains, like a phantom itch we can only scratch with mind-bending television. Luckily for us, <em>Severance </em>is just the latest in a long line of cerebral dramas that’ll have you questioning what’s real about your life. </p><p>  <em>Dark Matter</em> unravels the chaos of identity across parallel lives, while <em>Mr. Robot</em> drags you down a hacker rabbit hole full of fractured minds and unreliable realities. <em>Maniac</em> is a pharmaceutical fever dream, pairing high-concept sci-fi with emotional disarray. <em>Homecoming</em> whispers paranoia through pristine therapy sessions, and <em>Westworld</em> turns loops of consciousness into a violent symphony of rebellion. If you’re ready to tumble down more reality-warping rabbit holes, here are 10 shows that twist the mind, bend the rules, and will satiate your appetite for <em>Severance-</em>style mysteries until the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-3-renew-finale-adam-scott-ben-stiller-1851771552">returns for its third season</a></span>.</p></div></div><div><p>Apple TV’s <em>Dark Matter</em> may come wrapped in glossier tech and fewer cubicles than <em>Severance</em>, but don’t be fooled—both series revel in the quiet horror of split identities and corporate puppeteering. Based on Blake Crouch’s novel, the show follows Jason Dessen (Joel Edgerton), a mild-mannered physicist who’s abducted into a parallel universe by a more ambitious version of himself, forcing him into a cat-and-mouse game across alternate realities. Where <em>Severance</em> slices the self neatly in two with surgical precision, <em>Dark Matter</em> takes a sledgehammer to the soul, splintering reality with every jump.</p><p>Jason doesn’t just wrestle with duality—he’s hunted by the man he could’ve been. Like <em>Severance</em>’s Mark S. (Adam Scott), he’s trapped between grief and a synthetic peace, except this time the office is swapped for a multiverse-hopping nightmare. Both shows deliver corporate paranoia with a side of existential dread, and both ask the same brutal question: What part of you is really you when someone else—or something else—is calling the shots?</p></div><div><p>If you think Lumon’s sterile stairwells are creepy, wait until you’ve seen two versions of J.K. Simmons stalking each other across a Berlin split not by a wall, but by dimensions. <em>Counterpart</em> is a brainy, noir-soaked spy thriller with just enough high-concept sci-fi to scratch the same itch as <em>Severance</em>. The premise? A mild-mannered UN pencil-pusher named Howard Silk (Simmons) discovers that his organization has been guarding a portal to a parallel Earth for decades—and his counterpart, a colder, deadlier version of himself, has crossed over to stop a cross-dimensional cold war from going hot. </p><p>Much like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Counterpart</em> weaponizes identity—posing unnerving questions about who we are when stripped of memory, emotion, or the comfort of a single self. And like <em>Severance</em>’s Mark S., Howard is both victim and investigator, forced to untangle not just a mystery, but his own fractured reflection. Throw in double-crosses, bureaucratic overlords, and a few ethically murky lab experiments, and you’ve got a show that doesn’t just echo <em>Severance</em>, it deepens the conversation.</p></div><div><p><em>Maniac</em> is the acid trip therapy session that breaks the whole brain in half before stitching it back together with neon thread. The Netflix limited series tracks Owen (Jonah Hill), a paranoid schizophrenic heir with a tenuous grip on reality, and Annie (Emma Stone), a pill-addicted loner haunted by the death of her sister, as they’re pulled into a clinical trial promising to “fix” them. What unfolds is a kaleidoscopic plunge into shared delusions—one minute they’re noir detectives interrogating lemurs, the next they’re elf-eared fantasy warriors—all orchestrated by a malfunctioning AI therapist named GRTA (who, like Lumon’s severed employees, has her own breakdown mid-procedure). </p><p>Like <em>Severance</em>, <em>Maniac</em> explores the allure and danger of erasing pain to become more “productive.” When Owen’s mind fractures between his real self and his fantasy personas, it mirrors Innie Mark’s slow discovery that his other life might be a lie. And just like that chilling Lumon break room scene, <em>Maniac</em> features a moment in which the characters are forced to relive their worst memories for the sake of “treatment.” Both shows sit at the crossroads of sci-fi and psychology, where identity is a glitchy loop and the cure might just be worse than the disease.</p></div><div><p>The sterile cubicles and coded memories of <em>Severance</em> find a chilling parallel in the clinical corridors of <em>Homecoming</em>, Amazon Prime’s unnerving dive into corporate memory manipulation. Instead of office workers getting their brains split in two, you’ve got Julia Roberts playing a caseworker at a facility that helps soldiers “adjust” back to civilian life. The plot twist is that the place is secretly drugging them to erase their memories so they can be redeployed without all that pesky PTSD. It’s super subtle at first, but you start picking up on the weirdness in certain moments—like when Walter (Stephan James), one of the soldiers, realizes his memories don’t quite add up anymore. </p><p>This will unquestionably give you <em>Severance</em> vibes, especially given how the characters slowly start questioning the system around them. And just like Lumon in <em>Severance</em>, the Geist Group hides all this shady stuff behind clean visuals and corporate lingo. <em>Homecoming</em> doesn’t have memory-splitting elevators, but the way it messes with identity and free will? Same energy. It begs the question: How much of yourself can you lose before you stop being you? That is <em>very</em> much in that Severance wheelhouse.</p></div><div><p>HBO’s <em>Westworld</em> is like <em>Severance</em>’s older, more violent predecessor—the one who swapped office cubicles for saloons but still spends way too much time pondering the nature of identity. At its core, <em>Westworld</em> is less about cowboys and more about control: synthetic humans waking up every day with no memory, forced into loops by a corporation that literally scripts their lives. That’s basically Innie Helly (Britt Lower) all over again, just with gunfights and philosophical monologues. </p><p>When Bernard (Jeffrey Wright) finds out he’s a host and that his memories were implanted to make him more manageable, it hits the same nerve as Mark S. slowly realizing the extent of Lumon’s manipulation. Both shows ask what makes you <em>you</em>—is it your memories, your choices, or the illusion of freedom in a system designed to break you? Swap the maze tattooed under a host’s scalp for the Severed Floor’s labyrinth of halls, and you’re staring at two sides of the same dystopian coin.</p></div><div><p> The surreal British drama series kicks off with a British spy, known only as Number Six (Patrick McGoohan), resigning from his job and immediately getting kidnapped and dumped in a surreal seaside “village” where everyone’s polite but nothing is real. It’s kind of like Lumon’s Severed Floor with beach views—he can’t leave, he doesn’t know who’s watching him, and every cheerful smile is just another layer of the trap.</p><p>In one episode he thinks he’s finally escaped, only to realize the whole escape was staged, just another manipulation, much like when Mark in <em>Severance </em>thinks he’s getting answers but it turns out to be just another corporate trick. Both shows are obsessed with the idea of autonomy. In <em>Severance</em>, they split your mind in two; in <em>The Prisoner</em>, they just scramble it.</p></div><div><p><em>Max Headroom</em> is like <em>Severance</em> if you cranked the TV static to eleven and sprinkled in some 80s corporate paranoia. The show kicks off with Edison Carter (Matt Frewer), a journalist in a dystopian future where TV networks literally kill to keep ratings up. After he uncovers something shady, he crashes his bike and ends up in a coma—so the network copies his brain and accidentally creates Max (Frewer), this glitched-out digital version of himself who starts causing chaos on-air. It’s kind of like if Lumon took Mark’s consciousness and uploaded it into a sarcastic TV personality just to see what happens. Actually, Apple might need to greenlight that show.</p><p>There’s a remarkable scene in which Edison watches Max mock the very system that created him, and it feels a lot like Innie Helly trying to protest her own existence on the Severed Floor. Both shows are obsessed with identity being co-opted by corporations—Max is literally a personality split from his original self, used for corporate gain, just like the Innies. The vibe’s different—neon-soaked and jittery instead of sterile and quiet—but the core idea remains: when a company takes control of your identity, whatever’s left is just a fragment shaped to serve their needs.</p></div><div><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/with-a-near-classic-episode-the-new-twilight-zone-gets-1833985507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/with-a-near-classic-episode-the-new-twilight-zone-gets-1833985507"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a></span> walked so <em>Severance</em> could spiral—it’s the OG of taking familiar experiences and shifting them ever-so-slightly to explore the dread and existential horror under the surface of everyday life. It’s an anthology series, yeah, but so many episodes tap into the unsettling experience of characters realizing their lives are being scripted by someone else. In the episode “Five Characters in Search of an Exit,” a group of strangers wakes up in a strange cylinder with no memory, trying to make sense of where they are or who they were—basically the severed floor with circus music. </p><p>They fight to escape, only to learn they’re just toys in a donation bin, a revelation which hits with the same gut-punch as Innie Helly discovering her Outie sees her as a thing, not a person. And then there’s “The Obsolete Man,” in which a librarian is put on trial in a society that’s erased books and individuality—the same sterile dread as <em>Severance</em>, the same confrontation with systems erasing people’s worth. <em>Severance</em> might wear a sleeker suit, but it’s still circling the idea that when someone else controls your story, your identity becomes just another tool shaped to serve their design.</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Severance, </em>Netflix’s popular sci-fi anthology series <em>Black Mirror </em>lives in that sweet spot where tech meets trauma, asking what happens when the systems we build to “optimize” life end up hollowing us out. Take “White Christmas,” in which people’s consciousnesses get trapped in tiny smart home devices—basically Innie Mark, but inside a glorified Alexa, forced to make toast for an eternity. Or “USS Callister,” in which people are copied into a game and stripped of their autonomy—just like the Innies, they remember pain and crave freedom, but are locked inside a reality someone else designed. </p><p>Even “Nosedive” hits that <em>Severance</em> nerve, showing how curated personas can choke out real identity. Both shows are haunted by this question: when your thoughts, your choices, your self are filtered through a corporate or digital lens, what part of you is still truly yours? <em>Severance</em> may focus on fluorescent lights and break room therapy, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><em>Black Mirror</em></a></span> already warned us—what we give up for comfort, productivity, or control might be the very thing that makes us human. </p></div><div><p>Innie and Outie Mark S’s little VHS kerfuffle at the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-finale-gemma-mark-helly-choice-ship-1851771965"><em>Severance</em> Season 2</a></span> is child’s play compared to the mutli-season blood feud between hacker supreme Elliott Alderson (Rami Malek) and his alter ego, Mr. Robot. The award-winning USA Network drama follows Elliott and his developmentally stunted and perpetually traumatized gang of digital anarchists, known as F Society, as they try to free humanity from the shackles of evil corporation E Corp (Get it?) while also avenging the deaths of a few of their parents at the greedy hands of its senior executives. Not only does <em>Mr. Robot </em>feature the best performance in Malek’s sensational career; it’s also one of the only shows from the last decade to match <em>Severance</em>’s<em>&nbsp;</em>unique blend of psychological thriller and sci-fi. While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/all-the-scales-drop-as-mr-robot-delivers-one-of-its-fi-1839908814&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/all-the-scales-drop-as-mr-robot-delivers-one-of-its-fi-1839908814"><em>Mr. Robot</em></a></span> leans more into cybersecurity while <em>Severance</em>’s focus is on sci-fi consciousness splitting, the show does a brilliant (and at times better) job of illustrating the internal struggles between two diametrically opposed halves of the same person.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Robot shoots and almost kills Elliott, takes over his consciousness without his consent to plan a deadly attack, and uses his childhood trauma to manipulate him. That alone is enough to draw parallels between <em>Mr. Robot</em> and <em>Severance. </em>There’s also the mysterious and diabolical corporate overlords of both shows, the computer work leading to real-world consequences, and the, at times, claustrophobic cinematography that really makes these two shows cousins from the same dystopian family tree.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
