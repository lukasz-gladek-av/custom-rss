            <p>
Just days after barreling through the 1m sales barrier, Peak - the daft co-op climbing game from developer Landcrab - has reached another impressive milestone. It's now sold over 2m copies, and Landcrab is celebrating the occasion by talking a little about its plans for future updates.
</p>
<p>
Peak, if you've not yet had the pleasure, sees up to four friends attempting to scale an ever-changing mountain. You've got ropes, climbing spikes, and other useful tools to aid in your upward adventure, but key to your slapstick survival is communication and coordination. Poorly orchestrated ascents have a tendency to end in hilarious chaos - the kind of Tok Tok and YouTube friendly calamity that's helped catapult Peak up the charts.
</p>
<p>
It took <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charming-co-op-climbing-game-peak-takes-steam-by-storm-selling-one-million-copies-in-six-days-and-mounting-the-top-sellers-page">just six days for Peak to cross the 1m sales threshold</a> following its launch, and it's now shifted another 1m copies three days after that. "We seriously cannot thank you enough for all the love and support we've had on this game," Landcrab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/498325386812195119?l=english">wrote on Steam</a>. "There's an abundance of ways we would like to say thank you, but I think the best way we could do that is by sharing with you all what's next: Yes, we are now looking into possible updates."

<p>
Landcrab says its update plans are in the "very early stages", but it's collating player feedback and is considering everything from "quality of life features to new content and all the funny additions that we wished to make real from the start." There are some caveats, however; firstly, it will continue to prioritise bug fixes and stability before anything else, so "don't expect a huge content update right away."
</p>
<p>
Secondly, Landcrab's somewhat unusual set-up - it's actually two studios, Landfall Games and Aggro Crab, working in collaboration - means there's a degree of uncertainty about what it'll actually be able achieve: "We don't know how many major updates we're planning... Since we're two studios who have other projects to work on, and neither of us being live service studios... The last thing we want to do is promise any features that we can't make a reality."
</p>
<p>
As for those bug fixes, Landcrab says it's continuing to investigate some of Peak's most widely reported issues, including those relating to disconnection and reconnection, performance and optimisation, crashes, and mic/audio problems. "We are still a small team," it adds, "so we really appreciate all the patience with us tackling bug reports. We're reminding ourselves to take breaks, fix bugs and also appreciate the success of the project."
</p>
<p>
Peak (which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for Landfall, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/content-warning-dev-investigating-server-issues-as-steam-smash-hits-62m-downloads">Content Warning</a> and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds) is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">available now on Steam for a mere £6.39</a>. Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">earlier this week</a>, writing, "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."

Films like the <em>Mortal Kombat </em>series, <em>Dead or Alive</em>, and the 1994 <em>Street Fighter </em>all possess a kind of so-bad-they’re-good ridiculousness that has made them cult classic guilty pleasures. Part of that is because, in narrative terms, the source material they’re drawing from is barely strung together to begin with, since in most fighting games the plot is there just to bring a series of memorable weirdos together to beat each other up. Those characters are the most interesting part, so casting actors who can bring all their bizarre sensibilities to life is key. That’s probably why the cast for the upcoming <em>Street Fighter </em>reboot reads like a randomly generated ensemble made up of some truly surprising picks.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,197586,196406" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-curtis-50-cent-jackson-1236299350/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>, rapper, actor, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-this-50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-started-out-as-a-t-1847655379&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-this-50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-started-out-as-a-t-1847655379">occasional video game star</a></span> 50 Cent is joining the cast as Balrog, the boxer who made his debut in <em>Street Fighter II</em> back in 1991. 50 Cent isn’t the only musician-turned-actor set to star in the film next year.

Other actors include Mr. Minecraft himself, Jason Momoa, as the eccentric creature Blanka, WWE star Roman Reigns as Akuma, Callina Lianga as Chun-Li, and <em>Reacher </em>star Alan Ritchson as Guile. Andrew Koji and Noah Centineo are also on board to play the leading rivals Ryu and Ken.</p><p>What a strange group. I’m a <em>Street Fighter </em>fan, so I was probably going to see this movie whether it was good or bad, but this line-up makes me all the more interested to see what kind of monstrosity Legendary Entertainment could be creating in its lab. If it’s good, great! If it’s bad, it will have to live up to the disastrous delight that is the 1994 film. I need the first trailer to drop as soon as possible. I sense the makings of a new Bad Movie Night staple.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-cast-actors-50-cent-jason-momoa-1851785178]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-the-board-game-review.1229484/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bottling the kinetic energy of a first person shooter video game and successfully transferring it to the tabletop is a herculean task. Publisher Glass Cannon Unplugged is up to the challenge, presenting Apex Legends: The Board Game in the form of an overstuffed box that spills cardboard and plastic onto the table like a body lit up by a VK-47 Flatline. This analog translation defies the odds, legitimately capturing some of the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> the video game is a hero shooter battle royale. It has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/Characters_(Legends)">full lineup of protagonists</a> with their own suite of abilities and playstyles. This identity is likewise the heart of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game adaptation</a>, forming the basis for its team-based skirmish action. Characters such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bangalore">Bangalore</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/mirage">Mirage</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/apex-legends/bloodhound">Bloodhound</a> all make an appearance, with each of their roles expertly captured and adapted to the turn-based setting. Everything is powerful and awe inspiring, and it feels extraordinarily faithful to the property.</p><div catalogid="59f120e6-93ee-456b-ada0-ea76f3f22000" id="223645"><div id="223645" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apex Legends: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard format is either two-versus-two, or three-versus-three, with each player fielding a single character. While there are a bevy of miniatures skirmish games on the market, including popular titles such as Kill Team, Infinity, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-shatterpoint-board-game-review"><u>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</u></a>, none offer this particular style of team-based small-unit approach. Distinctly, this is not a game of armies or squads – it’s one of personalities and legends. The result is an altogether different tone, one charged with dynamic abilities that form the centerpiece of a violent gunfight on a fully rendered board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The board is quite the looker. Verticality is a core tenet of gameplay, as players are able to scale and fight from 3D cardstock buildings. Other elements pop off the map, including cardboard trees and boulders, loot containers, and even fully operational ziplines. The environment is active and responsive. It feels every bit a playground, albeit one with shrapnel and taunts whizzing by your dome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This dedication to elevation fuels the aggressive FPS-style play, but it also is the root of Apex Legends: The Board Game’s primary challenge. I’ve mentioned the game’s bloated componentry, which contributes to a lengthy setup time, but all of these options and details add up to a relatively complex system. The central turn-to-turn action sequence is surprisingly simple and direct. One team activates all of their characters with each committing to two actions. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This board game defies the odds, capturing the visceral action of its namesake with unique and clever design work.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But that streamlined activity fragments into many intricate pieces. Line of sight is a strong example. Measuring from center square to center square and assessing any blockages is standard for this style of game. But when you consider elevation, all of a sudden there are three pages of lengthy examples displaying potential situations. Thankfully, the rulebook's diagrams do a good job of illustrating what you need to consider, but the downside is that line of sight can be difficult to assess on the fly and it can slow down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also tough to remember the difference between some of the keywords, such as "adjacent" versus "neighboring." Terrain items and cards use a similar library of tags that must be referenced. There are specific timing windows for reactions and a sub-system for handling abilities and cooldowns. None of these are overly burdensome on their own, but taken together they can become tricky to navigate. It’s important to understand that this is not a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game for beginners</a>. Instead of going for wide appeal with a similar approach to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect: The Board Game</u></a>, Apex Legends aims to satisfy hobbyist gamers familiar with sophisticated systems. If a 40-page rulebook scares you, then you’re not going to hack it on this battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting element of Apex Legends: The Board Game is also the most convoluted. Instead of a sophisticated physics engine handling the shooting mechanism, this game opts to zoom in on the firefight and simulate multiple factors, including recoil, stability, and rate of fire. Most games opt for a handful of dice and some quick arithmetic, but Apex Legends uses a sideboard and a dedicated set of cards to resolve gunshots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s actually a pretty stellar system. Different guns have various rates of fire. They list a number of cards that are drawn from the shooting deck and placed alongside a track. Each card is placed in a slot representing an individual shot. Cards drawn later in the sequence have more recoil affecting their ballistics, which results in an escalation of penalties. The penalty is applied to the strength of the randomly drawn card, and then compared to the necessary hit value on the weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the quick and dirty explanation. In reality, it’s more nuanced as each drawn card also has a possible icon which can inflict headshots, bonus hits, or cause an automatic miss if the target is behind cover. Weapons that hit exceedingly hard with slower rates of fire – such as a shotgun or sniper rifle – may draw multiple cards to a single shot slot, thus avoiding the recoil penalties the system tries to emulate. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This can be a wonky process to resolve – it’s certainly slow going with new players. Until you get used to it, this is another part of the game that stunts the tempo of action. Obviously this is a cost of modeling the video game with a high level of detail, but it can be an outright turnoff as it highlights the shortcomings of board games and their inability to obfuscate and resolve math.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this level of detail isn't all bad. What you sacrifice in momentum, you gain in realism. This system acutely captures the unique qualities of various firearms. Sub-machine guns spray several weak shots. Battle rifles fire tighter groupings and hit with power. Light machine guns spray all over the place but can level a building. Weapon attachments are mixed in with the loot, allowing you to alter a firearm’s properties mid-game. This includes optics, barrels, magazines, and stocks. It’s exceedingly cool and really juices up the impact of scavenging for supplies in the battle royale mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end result is a weapon system that actually boasts gunplay. No other board or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tabletop-game-alternatives-to-warhammer-40000">miniatures game</a> I've played has so meticulously modeled this key feature of first person shooters. It’s a fantastic accomplishment and absolutely the standout feature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond this wonderful feat, Apex Legends: The Board Game offers several other killer features. Characters are expertly modeled. They have asymmetric tactical abilities and ultimates that affect the battlefield in various ways. You can pop smoke, call in airstrikes, and deploy drones. Each character is also paired with a unique deck of cards that can be played to tweak actions and react to opponents’ maneuvers. This creates a nifty fog of war, although again, at the cost of possibly slowing down the pace of play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another crowd pleaser is the variety of modes on offer. The battle royale option is the key offering, including a distillation of the final moments of the video game’s finale. This includes a barrier that closes on the battlefield, forcing combatants into tighter and tighter area. But there are also deathmatch, VIP, and capture the flag options. Each of these is fully realized and not at all an afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those sickos who can’t get enough, this game also will be arriving with expansion products for additional characters as well as a new board and environment. Most notably, there is a sophisticated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solitaire</a> / <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">co-op</a> addition that adds AI behavior trees to each of the core game’s protagonists. This mode works fairly well, producing mostly logical enemy actions that sometimes surprise and dazzle. Again, much like the rich base game ruleset, it can be a sluggish pace to familiarize yourself with this additional layer of rules, but it certainly settles down once you’ve become comfortable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a first-person shooter airdropping to your tabletop, Apex Legends: The Board Game is a solid effort and certainly a success. There are challenges involved and the tempo can really drag as players learn the systems and assess the wide swath of options on their turn. Once familiarity sets in and the game starts collapsing towards that 60-90 minute estimated playtime, the bliss of gunplay coupled with dynamic action and a multi-faceted loot system truly shine. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXVy?object_uuid=1a4cdcfc-6638-451d-b767-27674f9d015b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 26, 2025 7:34 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Apex Legends: The Board game is a huge, intricately designed game that can be both overwhelming and thrilling. All of the moving parts make for occasionally clunky and slow gameplay, but it’s reliably a fierce one full of individuality. There’s nothing quite like this on the market, and that makes up for any shortcomings.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In all my 28 years on this spinning rock, I’ve read my fair share of manga—some absolute classics, some guilty pleasures, and plenty that were straight up trash. But no series has tested my patience quite like <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>. Somehow, against all odds, it’s become the most bizarrely pivotal manga out right now—perched at the edge of being either a brilliant subversion of the genre or a drawn-out cliche that’ll embolden red-pilled manosphere incels for generations. And honestly? I’m too drained to care anymore.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, by Reiji Miyajima, is a rom-com series I can best describe as <em>Scott Pilgrim,</em> but worse. It follows Kazuya Kinoshita, a perpetually down-bad college student who, off the heels of a brutal breakup, impulsively hires a rental girlfriend named Chizuru Mizuhara to fill the hole in his sadboy heart. I genuinely can’t stress this enough: Kazuya is a weirdo to the nth degree at the start of the series. He blows through tissues and can’t be bothered to clean them up. Early Kazuya lashes out at Chizuru for “faking it” on their rental date, despite her doing her job. He embodies every red flag rolled into one desperate, entitled fuckboy. And this is before the trashy harem manga/anime hijinks ensue.</p><p>Kazuya and Chizuru’s grandmothers, conveniently bosom buddies at the same nursing home, spot them together, roping them into continuing a charade of “fake dating” after getting spotted together and keeping up appearances in front of Kazuya’s friends, which inevitably spirals out of control. Things get even messier when the series leans hard into full-blown harem chaos. Enter: a girl whose heart condition means her kokoro only goes doki doki for Kazuya; another painfully shy rental girlfriend but still Team Kazuya because he shows normal human decency to her; a loli sidekick who exists purely to cheer on the will-they-won’t-they with her finger firmly tipping the scale toward the former; and an ex who, ironically is the only one calling out the madness—yet gets vilified by readers who just see her as a bitch.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Best Waifu of 2020" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwnK8DRINbY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>By now, you’re probably wondering why I even bothered diving into this series. Trust me, I ask myself that same thing every week when I clock in to read a new chapter and massage my brow. My morbid curiosity had me first watching the entirety of its first season in a day and then catching up to its available manga chapters to the point where it was, for a time, like rubbernecking a beautiful car crash.&nbsp;</p><p>Secretly, though, I hoped for a pivot—for Chizuru to wise up and leave Kazuya in an emotional landfill where he belonged. Despite their improbable chemistry hinting at genuine affection, it was a later arc of hers that caught me off guard—a storyline where she pursues acting and reveals that her rental gig was a means to support that dream. That made me feel things.&nbsp;</p><p>Kazuya, by that point, had taken enough Ls to start resembling a functioning adult instead of a 2D wish-fulfilment entity for anime and manga’s most tragic fanbase. But of course, there’s a catch: the series<em> </em>drags. It <em>drags</em>. And Kazuya somehow becomes even more of a spectacle. Case in point is an infamous waterpark meltdown, complete with tears, jealousy, and a boner where the man is crashing out at the thought (which readers see in excruciating detail) of Chizuru bumping uglies with a male friend of hers. Peak narrative despair so cringe I’m surprised I didn’t Thanos snap into oblivion having read it.</p><p>What followed, surprisingly, was a glimmer of actual progress—their lie exposed by Kazuya’s ex, and a dramatic, full-spread kiss spurned by Chizuru to prove they were dating that duped Kazuya’s friends, family, and readers into believing we were headed into final arc territory. Closure is possible.&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t. The series kept going. And the worst part? I kept reading.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The 🔥Roast🔥 of Rent-A-Girlfriend" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OckbgVgZj04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Fellow anime connoisseur Geoff Thew of Mother's Basement and I have exchanged war letters (via Twitter DMs) about the series. Geoff’s long since tapped out. I, on the other hand, remain entrenched in the manga, reporting back like a shell-shocked soldier. And while Geoff has summarized the pain more concisely than I can without seeing red, the core gripe remains: this manga has become an exercise in narrative purgatory.</p><p>Kazuya and Chizuru both know they have feelings for each other. Everyone knows. And yet, instead of resolution, the story stalls—like a cat toying with its food, savoring the indecision. Chizuru has had the ball in her court for what feels like geological time, and the series seems intent on suspending the inevitable “let’s date” or “let’s just be friends” moment for maximum agony. Along the way, every romcom cliche and emotionally manipulative contrivance has been hurled at them to stretch the string taut: cohabitation shenanigans, Kazuya becoming her acting manager, a chorus of women (all but his ex) lining up to cheer him on like a dating sim with no bad route story branch.&nbsp;</p><p>But then something happened. Around chapter 380, the pair is finally on their first real date. Let that sink in. In the time this saga has burned through endless trial runs of their date like it was an episode of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, entire romcoms—<em>Komi Can’t Communicate</em>, <em>My Dress-Up Darling</em>, <em>Don’t Bully Me Nagatoro</em>, and <em>Uzaki-chan Wants to Hang Out</em>—have wrapped up their burgeoning love stories with them getting together and ending the series. <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>, meanwhile, is shaping up to be the <em>One Piece</em> of emotionally constipated romcoms.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s especially wild, and why I lead with the manga suddenly being critical in the manga reading community, is that the series is at a strange narrative crossroads: it could deliver a long-overdue moral reckoning about transactional intimacy and the entitlement that festers around men regarding women…or it could go full tilt into rewarding Kakuya, breathlessly validating the worst kinds of reader fantasies. And the manga community is embroiled in a civil war over either outcome as the series progresses toward its conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned earlier, the latest chapters finally gave us the date. I’ll spare you the minute-by-minute because, true to form, readers were subjected to every intrusive, obsessive, ogling thought Kazuya had overanalyzing Chizuru’s mannerisms from start to finish. At the end of their date, it finally happened: Chizuru accepted Kazuya’s feelings. She thanked him for loving her, and she even said she loved him too.</p><p>And then she rejected him.&nbsp;</p><p>She reasoned that her lifestyle as a rental girlfriend and, more honestly, the emotional stage she was at in her life, wouldn’t allow for a relationship. Kazuya, for once, didn’t spiral. He was hurt, sure, but he took it in stride. A vocal subset of the fandom did not.</p><p>Many <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend </em>readers interpreted Chizuru’s rejection as a surprise, maybe even a subversive move—a long-con feminist parable about how affection and support shouldn’t entitle men to a relationship. But on Musk’s town square of terminal takes, the reaction to Kazuya’s rejection was nothing short of a riot. People dogpiled what looked like a rare, poignant moment of growth for Kazuya and branded the manga “peak cuck content.” Chizuru, in particular, was called everything outside her name, with some fans highlighting that Kazuya spent 250,000 yen on their dates and funded her career as evidence that she used him for emotional and financial labor, only to turn him down. One particularly heated reader went full unhinged, posting a manga edit of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s Toji killing Chizuri.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">people going "erm... am i too woke or is this a teensy bit misogynistic... ☝️🤓" bro it's an edit of a woman being called a bitch and shot in the head for gently turning down a guy OBVIOUSLY it's misogynistic 😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/ajoUByBGWO">https://t.co/ajoUByBGWO</a></p>— danny website (@raincoatrevive) <a href="https://twitter.com/raincoatrevive/status/1934340105528856956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>While I was initially championing the story for somehow surprising me by dovetailing into an essential lesson at a time when men aren’t doing okay and their manosphere pariahs aren’t helping, the manga, to my horror, appears to be spinning the block on its emotional breakthrough. In chapter 382, the story is hinting at their romance not being over, with Kazuya carrying Chizuru piggyback to their apartment after noticing her heel was bloodied from breaking in fancy new shoes—a quiet gesture he’s taken as a signal that their night matters to her, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Odds are they’ll end up together anyway, wrapped in some breathless “it was all worth it” speech. But I won’t be sticking around to see it. I’ve watched this story loop around resolution like a broken record for years, clinging to the hope it might land somewhere bold.

Not every trashy romance can pull off a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErTEqW1_25c&amp;pp=0gcJCf0Ao7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trashy-meets-classy bonkers landing</a> like <em>Domestic Girlfriend</em>. This is me breaking the cycle. Godspeed to whoever’s still riding this sinking ship.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/this-game-sure-looks-a-lot-like-venba"><h3>This Game Sure Looks A Lot Like Venba</h3></a><p>Prolific copycat studio makes a copycat game of Venba, stripping it of any life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As anyone familiar with the Dune series knows, "<em>A beginning is the time for taking the most care that the balances are correct</em>," a mantra that's true for plenty of situations in life, and for starting a new character in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-update-1-1-0-0-adds-deep-desert-and-vehicle-changes-removes-sietch-visiting-restrictions-and-more/">Dune: Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>When you begin your adventure on Arrakis, you'll go through a character creation process that feels like it has huge importance to it - and it mostly does.</p>
<p>But at the same time, some of the choices available to you don't have as much of an impact on your journey as they might seem to, if you're someone who is very into Dune lore and the politicking that the series is known for.</p>
<p>This guide will take you through all the choices you'll face in the opening character creation process, and which ones really matter.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - The Best Character Creation Choices and Which Ones Really Matter</h2>
<h3>Which Choices Really Matter</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Starting with what means the most, the choice that actually matters, and I say choice because out of the three core choices you're given in the character creation, the only one that really matters is your <strong>mentor/class</strong>.</p>
<p>You'll be able to train in every class throughout your journey on Arrakis, so whoever you pick first is just that - the class you'll start out with. But it is the choice out of all the character creation options that has the biggest impact on your early game playtime.</p>
<p>Your caste and selecting which world you're from don't play as huge of a gameplay role, and are more there for you to role-play in the world of Dune: Awakening more than anything. You'll see the fruits of your choices play out in certain dialogue options, but overall they won't have nearly as strong of an impact on your time in Dune: Awakening, especially the early hours of your journey, as your choice of mentor/class.</p>
<h3>The Best Character Creation Choices</h3>

<figure></figure>

<h4>Class/Mentor</h4>
<p>While you can be effective with any choice for your mentor/class, there is an obvious answer for which one is the best to start with, giving you the biggest advantage in the early game.</p>
<p>Dune-heads will be unsurprised to learn that the best choice for a mentor in the game is also the most logical choice according to the lore, which is <strong>Mentat.</strong> Choosing Mentat for your starting class means you'll start with the Sentinel turret, which will be invaluable for taking out enemies at camps and testing stations in the early game.</p>
<p>Bene Gesserit is arguably the second-best choice, because of the Bindu Sprint ability you'll be able to unlock early. Before you're able to craft a vehicle, having an ability that lets you cross great distances quickly while on foot is a huge boon when trying to avoid open sand as much as possible.</p>
<p>Swordmaster falls third, though not by much, as the Bindu Sprint is what really pulls picking Bene Gesserit up the ladder. Both starting classes won't be as big of a help with early game combat as starting with Mentat will.</p>
<p>Trooper has the unique distinction of technically being a pretty good starting choice, but also more realistically the worst pick, because the first trainer you'll meet is the one who will open the Trooper skill tree for you. The Shigawire Claw, which is a very useful grapple hook, is easily one of the best abilities in the game, though you can get it so early on from the basic-level Trooper trainer, it's nearly pointless to pick Trooper as your starting class.</p>
<p>Mentat, Bene Gesserit, and Swordmaster trainers are all discovered a bit later on, so you're much better off picking any of them to open up a skill tree you'd otherwise need to play hours to access, while still being able to get the best part of the Trooper skill tree from the beginning of the game.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Class/Mentor</strong></td>
<td><strong>Skill Tree Focus</strong></td>
<td><strong>Starting Ability</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bene Gesserit</td>
<td>Physical Mastery &amp; Manipulation</td>
<td>Voice: Compel - Use The Voice to force someone towards your position from afar.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mentat</td>
<td>Recon &amp; Strategy</td>
<td>The Sentinel - Deploy a suspensor buoyed dart projector that uses motion detection to cover a field of fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Swordmaster</td>
<td>Close-quarter Aggression</td>
<td>Knee Charge - Propel yourself forward into battle with a terrific knee charge into the enemy</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Trooper</td>
<td>Offense &amp; Demolition</td>
<td>Shigawire Claw - Shoot a barb that attaches to a surface, than rapidly pulls you towards that position.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Homeworld</h4>
<p>As already stated, your choice of homeworld in Dune: Awakening isn't really all that significant, and more so depends on how you'd like to role-play within your journey on Arrakis.</p>
<p>If you needed to pick one, then you could make an argument for Giedi Prime, the Harkonnen homeworld. The dialogue trait you'll get with this is Deception, and being able to lie your way out of sticky situations when they arise is always useful on Arrakis.</p>
<p>Similarly, choosing Kaitain, the home base of the Imperium, is also not a bad choice, as you'll acquire the Political dialogue trait.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the opportunity to pick a dialogue option based on the trait you chose at the beginning of the game doesn't crop up enough, especially in the early game, for any of these choices to really stand out as 'best.' The only other element of picking a homeworld is that you get a unique emote. So, once again, basically no impact on gameplay.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Homeworld</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dialogue Trait</strong></td>
<td><strong>Unique Emote</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Caladan</td>
<td>Honorable</td>
<td>Atreides Salute</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Chusuk</td>
<td>Cultured</td>
<td>Chusuk Music</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Geidi Prime</td>
<td>Deception</td>
<td>Harkonnen Curse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kaitain</td>
<td>Political</td>
<td>Kaitain Bow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ix</td>
<td>Technologist</td>
<td>Ixian Secret</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Caste</h4>
<p>Your choice of caste does give you a separate dialogue trait, but once again it has little to no impact on your gameplay, particularly in the early hours of your journey. Just like your choice in homeworld, this is more about how you want to role-play within Dune: Awakening.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Caste</strong></td>
<td><strong>Dialogue Trait</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bondsmen</td>
<td>Bondsmen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Na-Familia</td>
<td>Nobility</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pyon</td>
<td>Pyon</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Do you… do you hear that? Can you feel it? That disgusting, gnawing feeling, a shiver down your spine because you know it's coming for you… the Steam summer sale… Friends, Romans, country(insert pronoun here), it is unfortunately that time of year again, that time where you look at all of those games in your wishlist as you try to figure out which deal is the best, and which to leave for the next inevitable sale.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Personally, there are far too many games in my wishlist that I'd like to buy now but I am also supposedly an Adult with Responsibilities, so I will try to refrain from picking anything up. Besides, that backlog isn't getting any shorter and my lifespan isn't getting any longer. Still! The mortifying concept of ego and literal death aside, I'm still going to make mention of a few notable games that have some healthy discounts, if only to make you think "oh yeah I've been meaning to play that."

<p>
For starters, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/">Death Stranding is 60% off</a> making it only £14, and considering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>'s inevitable PC release is nowhere in sight, you might as well relieve some of that FOMO. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/">Elden Ring is quite a healthy 40% off</a> at £30, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH/">so is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, making it £39</a>. Possible future GOTY and frequent discourse starter <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a smaller discount of 10% off</a>, but that still makes it £38. Last year's actual GOTY <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/">UFO 50 is also only £16.80</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you really want something cheap as chips, the groovy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/247080/Crypt_of_the_NecroDancer/">Crypt of the Necrodancer is as low as £1.27</a>. Heavily lesbian visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/836450/Heaven_Will_Be_Mine/">Heaven Will Be Mine is only £2.27 as well</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/">Robocop: Rogue City is £4.49</a>.
</p>
<p>
Point is, there's too many damn games that are really cheap right now. I'm sure you'll figure out your budget somehow.

If you're unfamiliar, the Steam Summer Sale is one of the two biggest sales available on the platform annually, with the other occurring around the holiday season in December. You can expect to save big on PC games both new and old, which makes the sale a perfect time to buy games in bulk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's Steam Summer sale is set to run through July 10. Some of the top-reviewed games of 2025 are included as part of this sale, in addition to newer PC ports from publishers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/square-enix">Square Enix</a> or PlayStation.

With the main story and side content combined, there is easily over 100 hours of content in this RPG. This game just made its way to PC in late January, and it's one of the best RPGs to release in the last five years. If you haven't yet played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a>, you can grab both games together in the Twin Pack for $59.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, you can save $10 off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. While this just released in April by surprise, you can already save 20% off and dive hundreds of hours deep into this iconic Bethesda RPG. Bethesda also has a solid deal on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and now is the best time to jump in and prepare for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-dlc-the-order-of-the-giants-finally-has-a-release-date">The Order of Giants DLC</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also save on three major 2025 indie games: R.E.P.O., Schedule I, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blue-prince-review">Blue Prince</a>. The latter sits as one of the highest rated games of the year, offering a unique house of puzzles to solve. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/schedule-1-review-early-access">Schedule 1</a> puts you in the shoes of a drug dealer, and the game is still one of the most played Steam games of 2025. Finally, R.E.P.O. is a wonderful time with friends that is sure to cause both laughs and headaches. All of these smaller games are generally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-steam-games-on-your-phone">great to stream to your phone</a> if you want a more mobile experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for deep discounts, I recommend <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review">Crash Bandicoot N.

Each of these games is 90% off, and you can pick all three for a grand total of $14. Star Wars Battlefront II is an especially good deal, as there has been a major resurgence in online players as of late.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the smaller discounts available is for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. While you'll only save $5 during the Steam Summer Sale, this is the lowest we've seen this game yet. If you've been on the fence about picking this one up, it's not likely to dip much further until late this year, especially since it is one of the highest-rated games of the year.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Amazon Prime Day Arrives at the End of the Steam Sale</h3><div catalogid="a568cc81-560f-48fe-bbf9-5308ce73a03f" id="223504"><div id="223504" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>All Early Prime Day Deals</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Steam Summer Sale is ongoing right now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-everything-we-know-so-far">Amazon Prime Day</a> is set to kick off on July 8.

Though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-time-to-buy-video-games">PC games</a> are not usually a focus of Prime Day, you can expect to have the opportunity to score a few deals on PC hardware, monitors, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-keyboard">accessories</a>, and more. If you're looking to either enter the PC market for the first time or upgrade your existing setup, keep your eye on Prime Day.

                <p>MindsEye launched earlier this month but didn't come out of the gate in a great state, with players encountering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/" data-ref-id="1100-6532343">range of problems, bugs, and other issues</a>. Actor Alex Hernandez, who plays main character Jake Diaz, has now commented on the game's buggy release, offering up his take on what might have happened.</p><p>Speaking to Check It TV, Hernandez he believes developer Build a Rocket Boy decided to launch MindsEye with issues with a plan to fix them after launch.</p><p>"It's not a lack of QA. I met the QA testers and they seemed competent at their job. But for whatever reason, the company decided to release something that has these issues and then taking care of it post-release... obviously we were not the first game to do that," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxfAyV7XBTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxfAyV7XBTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hernandez said Cyberpunk 2077 is an example of another game that launched in a rough state and was then improved over time with updates.</p><p>Hernandez went on to say that he "doesn't love" the model of a developer selling a game for full price with issues at launch and then fixing it over time.</p><p>"I don't love that model," he said. "I'm not a business person. I have no idea why that decision gets made. I will just say that from a consumer perspective, and I am sure a lot of people feel this way, I think it does more long-term harm than good to your reputation to release something that feels like it is in a state of less-than 100%, and then charge 100% of the price."</p><p>Additionally, Hernandez said he would rather see developers embrace an early-access model where the developer is up-front with players about issues so that fans know what they are signing up for.</p><p>Just ahead of the release of MindsEye, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/" data-ref-id="1100-6532123">pair of senior executives left the developer</a>, while Build a Rocket Boy is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-studio-is-laying-off-developers-following-poor-launch-reception-report/1100-6532630/" data-ref-id="1100-6532630">said to be cutting staff following the game's release.</a> The game was published by Hitman studio IO Interactive.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is headed up by Leslie Benzies, the former Rockstar Games veteran. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> scored the game a 3/10. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings. If you're looking for quality, cast your mind's eye elsewhere," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the original <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dying_light/b/xboxone/archive/2015/02/02/dying-light-game-informer-review.aspx">Dying Light</a>, developer Techland has rolled out a free graphical update to the 2015 title dubbed Dying Light: Retouched. While not billed as a full remaster or a total presentational overhaul, the city of Harran looks better than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>The Retouched update introduces upscaled textures, ultra 8K shadow quality level, and improved physics rendering on water and metallic surfaces. The game’s Level of Detail (LOD) has also been raised, meaning Techland increased the distance that detailed assets are loaded in the game. &nbsp;As Techland notes in its <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">developer blog</a>, Retouched is all about “squeezing out even more from the Dying Light you already love," although the level of improvements players will experience varies by platform. You can check out some before/after shots in the gallery below.</p><p>The soundtrack, however, has been remastered by original composer Pawel Błaszczak. The audio also features new tracks and ambient sounds along with improved hit reaction audio.</p><p>Today looks to be a good one to revisit Dying Light ahead of the launch of the latest entry, Dying Light: The Beast, which arrives on August 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. You can catch a recent trailer from Summer Game Fest earlier this month <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/dying-light-the-beast-launches-in-august-and-gets-a-new-trailer">here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/26/the-original-dying-light-gets-a-free-graphical-update-today]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft announced earlier this week that it would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">start testing its new aggregated gaming library</a> on the Xbox app for Windows, and it’s now starting to show up for testers today. This new library experience lists Steam, Battle.net, Ubisoft, Epic Games Store, and Riot Games titles that are all installed on a PC from various other launchers — much like GOG Galaxy.</p><p>I’ve been trying out the experience today and found that Microsoft automatically detects installed games and lists them in your library in the Xbox app, along with a relevant thumbnail or icon, and the name of the launcher where the game was installed from. While the thumbnails could do with some work in this beta app, you’ll get an option to play the game or see it in the relevant launcher. You can also hide games from these different PC stores if you don’t want to see them listed in the Xbox app.</p><p>This integration simply lists the games and you won’t get Xbox achievements or any additional functionality in these titles. The consolidated library is part of Microsoft’s effort to make the Xbox app on Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">the home of PC gaming</a>, and to improve the handheld experience of Windows.</p><p>Speaking of Microsoft’s work to improve the Windows handheld experience, I’ve had multiple people <a href="https://x.com/RGVetGaming/status/1937982655301292426">tip me</a> this week that the “Xbox full-screen experience” settings have randomly appeared on their existing ROG Ally devices. While the settings have appeared, the experience isn’t live yet and nothing happens if you try to enable it.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> earlier this month</a> that existing devices like the ROG Ally will get this full-screen Xbox experience at some point soon, and it looks like the company is already starting to test that on some devices. I’m confident this is a bug showing the settings, as the new ROG Xbox Ally devices aren’t due until later this year and they’ll launch with this new experience first.</p><p>If you’re interested in testing the new consolidated library you don’t need to wait until later this year. You just need to have the Xbox test app installed, which is as simple as downloading the <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9PLDPG46G47Z?hl=en-us&amp;gl=GB&amp;ocid=pdpshare">Xbox Insider Hub</a> on PC, joining the PC gaming preview in the app, and then updating the Xbox app in the Microsoft Store.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/693772/xbox-app-windows-steam-games-integration-epic-games-battle-net]]></content:encoded>

But in addition to that fix, several <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox360/comments/1ljh196/360_dashboard_updated/">users on Reddit</a>, as well as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-console-update-more-ads-20-years-old-series-x-1851785111"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, have confirmed the update also adds some sizable ads for the Xbox Series X / S consoles to the 360’s dashboard, as <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/xbox-360-update-2025">spotted by <em>TrueAchievements</em></a>.</p><p>Microsoft’s last major update to the Xbox 360’s dashboard came shortly after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208627/the-xbox-360-store-shuts-down-today">Microsoft shut down the Xbox 360 online store in July 2024</a>, when it removed menus and tiles no longer needed. That update introduced a bug causing game thumbnails and box art to appear stretched and distorted on the home screen, but the bug has now been fixed.</p><p>What’s less welcome are Microsoft’s not-so-subtle hints that it might be time for Xbox 360 owners to upgrade. The two different ads that now appear on the 360’s dashboard include one featuring an image of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles without any text, and one featuring a QR code that leads to the Xbox website with text encouraging players to “Experience next gen performance.”</p><p>Clicking either ad does nothing at all. You’ll need to pull out your smartphone or grab a tablet to visit the URL embedded in the QR code, where you’ll be further enticed to upgrade to the latest Xbox model.</p><p>The Xbox 360 remains Microsoft’s best-selling console to date, with around 84 million units sold since it launched in 2005. It remained popular long after the release of the Xbox One, and still held a sizable market share in countries like Mexico following the release of the Xbox Series X / S. Microsoft kept its online store running for an impressive 19 years, which is a good indication of how long it was actively in use.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/693631/microsoft-xbox-360-dashboard-software-update-ads]]></content:encoded>

He was one of the main game’s tougher Nightlords, so fans were worreid they were in for another brutal stomping. Instead, he’s a more powerful but not altogether different version of the base boss fight, just with a mean new AoE holy attack that’s tough to dodge. As I did with his original form, I played Guardian to soak up all his physical attacks with my shield while my teammates picked him apart. </p><p>But we made even quicker work of him this time thanks to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg9759/new_relic_is_busted/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lg9759/new_relic_is_busted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Grand Luminous Scene relic</a></span> we unlocked after beating the Gaping Jaw Everdark Sovereign. The new merchant outside the keep sells it in exchange for a few sigils and it includes the permanent attack power buff for defeating Evergaol prisoners, an extra Stonesword Key and a treasure map to boot. These perks are usually only found on separate relics, taking up multiple slots. The new relic streamlines that, letting you run the Evergaol strat while also buffing other stats and unique character abilities.</p><p>For anyone who hasn’t been running the Evergaol strat, it’s a gamechanger during <em>Nightreign</em>’s farming phase. Each Evergaol prisoner you defeat gives a 5 percent bonus to attack, up to 35 percent. The prisoner fights themselves give very generous runes, making it easy to consistently hit level 14 or 15 before night three without having to worry about things like whether Bell Bearing Hunter is at the bottom of the castle or which field bosses you get. If everyone on your team runs it, everyone’s getting the buff and everyone has extra keys to start, cutting down on the hassle of hunting for all of them out in the wild. The treasure map is just a nice bonus that gives some extra insurance against not getting the right loot during the run. </p><p>It’s probably hands-down the most busted strat in <em>Nightreign</em> at the moment. While other ones might have higher skill ceilings, the Evergaol buffs are pound-for-pound the best way to brute force your way through any fights. That’s why some players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lj5nee/imo_they_should_nerf_the_evergaol_buff_relic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lj5nee/imo_they_should_nerf_the_evergaol_buff_relic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">think they should be nerfed</a></span>. The fact that FromSoftware just streamlined it by selling the Grand Luminous Scene Relic to every player who beat the Gaping Jaw makes me wonder if it even cares. Of course, if you missed out on that fight, you’ll have to wait until you beat the new version of Darkdrift Knight to unlock it. <br></p><p>Bandai Namco previously confirmed that Everdark Sovereigns will continue rotating each week through the summer, suggesting we’ll eventually see a tougher form of all of the existing Nightlords. Given the game’s ongoing popularity, I expect we’ll eventually see some entirely new boss fights as well. Whether they’ll be free updates or paid DLC remains to be seen. But at just $40 I’ve already gotten way more than my fair share of time well spent out of <em>Nightreign</em>. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-evergaol-key-darkdrift-relic-1851785161]]></content:encoded>

The Luna Coven is the most capable of all the clans at preparing strong units for the endgame. The main mechanic for the Coven is the phases of the moon, which switches between New and Full after every turn, or by playing a card with the Phase effect. </p><p>During these different phases, you can get additional effects for both spells and units. One particularly notable one is the Shadeguard, which gains max health and attack for each combat phase that ends in New Moon.</p><p>In addition to this mechanic, there are also quite a few ways to gain Conduit, a status that makes your spells more powerful. Combined with the zero ember cost card that starts in your deck, Witchweave, boosting your magic power can be a great way to deal damage and heal your units for free.</p><h2 id="h20040"><a id=""></a>The Lazarus League are the Sultans of Sustain</h2><p>While the Luna Coven are great at building up to deal damage, the mad scientists of the Lazarus League are great at keeping units alive with various effects. Using both equipment and spells, there’s a myriad of ways to keep your team alive.</p><p>A particularly powerful one to use is Reanimate. When a unit has Reanimate, the first time it would die, it instead resurrects with 1 health. This combines especially well with units from other clans. For instance, having active stacks of Valor from the Banished in addition to Reanimate can let a unit revive with 1 health, but gain armor shortly after.</p><p>In addition to this, there’s plenty of other defensive techniques. You can get Spikes to deal damage back to the attackers who hit you, and Lifesteal to drain health from your enemies and add it to your pool. These defensive effects make the Lazarus League a particularly helpful clan as a secondary clan, as they can complement nearly every other clan in an effective way.</p><hr><p><br><em>Monster Train 2 </em>is available now on Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox Game Pass.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-train-2-best-clans-lazarus-luna-coven-1851784966]]></content:encoded>

Its run from the ‘90s to the mid-2010s was marked by the kind of dazzling creative output that makes you believe art isn’t dead and was so inspiring, it no doubt made many consider pivoting careers into animation. The decade that’s followed has been pretty uneven, and as a result, Pixar’s place at the top of the animation industry has felt tenuous as of late. Disney’s internal animation studio was picking up some real steam as Pixar was faltering and in the last decade, it’s arguably eclipsed the <em>Toy Story </em>studio in terms of cultural cachet. Disney has also buried a handful of Pixar’s releases, relegating them to Disney+ rather than giving them real theatrical releases following the covid-19 pandemic. Pixar isn’t the cultural juggernaut it once was, but looking at its body of work as a whole, it’s still got an impressive portfolio of heartfelt stories and gorgeous animation. But which movies are the best of the best? Here’s our ranking of Pixar’s feature films.</p></div><div><p>Talk about trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. <em>Cars 2 </em>is an awkward mismatch of a movie that takes an already established, marketable franchise and drops a spy film into it, a genre Pixar probably would have been better off exploring in a brand new setting. The <em>Cars </em>world, in which vehicles are living, breathing people, is already a poor foundation for a spy story, which typically benefits from nimbleness of character and narrative, but to then put Mater, played by country-boy comic Larry the Cable Guy, at the center of it all makes the whole thing feel like a single joke stretched way beyond the point it stops being funny. In theory, this could have made <em>Cars 2 </em>work as a spoof of more serious spy films, injecting its least-likely hero into a story he’s categorically unfit for, but the film just doesn’t have the juice to meld these ideas together into a cohesive vision. When <em>Cars 2 </em>gets serious, it feels comical. When it’s trying to be funny, it hydroplanes into silly. Ultimately, it feels like a movie made to sell toy cars and little else. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>The Good Dinosaur </em>is probably Pixar’s most forgettable film. It’s not the hot mess that <em>Cars 2 </em>is, but it has pretty much come and gone without leaving so much as a cultural footprint. Despite being lost in the annals of the studio’s history, <em>The Good Dinosaur </em>is mostly fine. The survival story is surprisingly brutal to its co-protagonists, Arlo and Spot, a young dinosaur and caveman who go from enemies to friends as they try to make their way home after being swept up in a violent stream and separated from their families. As the two face the harsh elements of the film’s alternate-history world in which dinosaurs never went extinct, they form a close bond, one that takes some unexpectedly dark turns for a Pixar film. It’s fine. It probably didn’t deserve to be Pixar’s first box-office bomb. But it also felt like a turning point for the studio, which had, up to this point, created mostly certified bangers. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Finding Dory </em>had to prove that Ellen DeGeneres’ Dory, who was the surprise breakout star of the original <em>Finding Nemo,</em> could hold a film on her own, lest it instead demonstrate that her ditzy amnesiac personality worked best in a supporting role. For whatever it’s worth, the sequel is pretty successful in making Dory the star of her own story, and it turns out she can still deliver an hour and a half’s worth of laugh-out-loud bits and still find a truly profound conclusion waiting for her at the end of it all. The problem with <em>Finding Dory </em>is that its final act is such a chaotic, nonsensical, obnoxious culmination of everything the movie introduces that it can barely get a handle on itself by the time it slams its foot on the brakes and just kind of…stops. Pixar also can’t quite stick the landing here as it struggles to reconcile its secretly sentient aquatic world with a human one in which somehow the presence of sea creatures causing havoc and mayhem on the surface world doesn’t make headlines, and <em>Finding Dory</em>’s third act is one of the most damning examples of the studio having more ideas than it can concisely bring together in the end. — KS</p></div><div><p>Admittedly, I’m probably more charitable to Pixar’s attempt to make a “movie within a movie” than the average viewer, but <em>Lightyear</em>’s biggest problem isn’t that it’s not an interesting thought experiment in the <em>Toy Story </em>universe; it’s that it’s dreadfully dull. I do like the beginning and end of this movie. Chris Evans puts on his best not-Captain-America voice to give us a pretty great portrayal of a duty-bound space ranger who is so fixated on protecting people in the abstract that he forgets to care for flesh and blood people in his life. <em>Lightyear </em>begins with its titular hero repeatedly subjecting himself to a time-dilating space trip in an effort to help save a marooned space colony. He literally blinks his life away trying to fix one fuck up, and then faces a living manifestation of his obsession in the closing act. The beginning and end of <em>Lightyear </em>form a really tight full-circle moment that I found truly satisfying, and if all the stuff in the middle were half as compelling as the film’s foundations, it<em> </em>could have been one of the studio’s greats. Unfortunately, it’s not. <em>Lightyear </em>is surprisingly dreary, even when it has characters as likable as Keke Palmer’s spritely space ranger Izzy and the merchandise-ready robot cat Sox. As interesting as it is to see Pixar lean into a more serious tone with high stakes, <em>Lightyear </em>is almost entirely devoid of joy. — KS</p></div><div><p>Damn, we waited 14 years for that, huh? <em>Incredibles 2 </em>manages to recapture the original superhero film’s family dynamic to a T, and that’s an impressive feat after over a decade away. The trouble is the sequel’s story is nowhere near as strong as the original’s. <em>Incredibles 2</em>’s brainwashing villain, the Screenslaver, is the personification of a boomer telling you that “it’s ‘cause you always be on that damn phone” without a drop of irony. Yes, there’s some actual depth under the facade, but to come off a truly stellar modern classic in the superhero genre, one with complex familial relationships, nuanced political commentary, and some of the studio’s best character work, and release something that felt like so paint-by-numbers and curmudgeonly is one of Pixar’s most tragic falls from grace. — KS</p></div><div><p>When <em>Brave </em>premiered in 2012, it should have been a huge deal for Pixar. It was the first movie the studio released with a woman protagonist, and Princess Merida was the first (and thus far, only) time Pixar got to create an official Disney Princess. A big part of her premise was that she would be a subversion of the exaggerated perception that Disney Princesses were meek damsels waiting for a soldier to come save them. She didn’t need no man, could save herself, and wasn’t going to listen to her mother’s demands for her to fall in line and marry some halfwit dweeb whom she could easily outshoot…then she goes on a transformative adventure with her mother, and they find common ground. But not the kind that lets Merida continue to carve her own path. Instead, she concedes to her mother’s desires and agrees to follow a traditional path. What a waste. — KS</p></div><div><p>The third <em>Cars </em>movie feels like a more honest sequel to the original than the second one did. It gets back to the NASCAR-inspired roots that were the heart and soul of the first film, and instead of just cashing in on the love people have for Owen Wilson’s Lightning McQueen, it actually reckons with the often tragic end stages of being a professional athlete. Lightning is getting older, and at a certain point, you have to let go of your position at the top to make space for those you helped pave the way for. It’s still a pretty mid Pixar movie, as I don’t think even the best of these films manages to reach the highs of the team’s best work. But at least it had ideas beyond just riffing on the franchise’s bizarre premise of living cars. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Soul </em>is a tough movie to sum up and rank because, on paper, it’s great. In its story of protagonist Joe Gardner nearly dying and having to reckon with his belief in determinism, it has a lovely premise. Joe spent his whole life believing that he was meant to be a jazz musician, and was so steadfast in the notion that it was the reason he was put on the earth that he forgot to stop and smell the roses. It has things to say and is rooted in its protagonist’s life as a Black man, but trips up in its handling of some of these ideas. It falls into the unfortunate trend in animated movies of not letting people of color be the star without <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mic.com/p/why-do-animators-keep-turning-people-of-color-into-animals-65481570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mic.com/p/why-do-animators-keep-turning-people-of-color-into-animals-65481570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transforming them into some kind of animal or creature</a></span>, and then for swaths of the film when we finally do see Joe on screen as himself instead of as a disembodied soul, his body has been overtaken by Tina Fey’s 22, so a white woman’s voice is coming out of his mouth. <em>Soul </em>stumbles on its way to saying something meaningful, and the victim is the same Black protagonist Pixar took decades to finally put in the lead. — KS</p></div><div><p>I don’t think <em>Cars </em>is a good movie. It’s more like a clever bit that Pixar stretched out into a two-hour feature film. <em>Cars </em>is mostly a long worldbuilding gag that dares to ask the question, “What would the world look like if vehicles were at the top of the food chain and were somehow able to create an entire civilization with infrastructure despite lacking opposable thumbs?” The strength of <em>Cars</em> is that it’s so earnestly committed to its wild premise that you eventually buy into its world of sentient cars without the movie having to look at the camera and explain to you how this is logistically possible. But is that a good film? Is there really much to this story of a cocky racecar getting citizen-arrested by a bunch of podunk hillbillies because he accidentally caused some property damage? It’s fine. The movie’s fine. Certainly wasn’t good enough to merit the multimedia franchise it became, but those toy cars aren’t going to sell themselves. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Elemental </em>is a classic example of Pixar having a strong core thesis that is too smothered by its overly clever setting to shine as brightly as it could. The film’s world of people made up of earth, wind, fire, and water is gorgeous to look at, clearly has a lot of thought put into the logistics of its pretty much segregated setting, and facilitates a pretty touching story of two people finding their way back to each other after societal pressures nearly tore them apart. Its leads, the fiery second-gen immigrant Ember and sentimental rich boy Wade, are star-crossed lovers whose struggles give rise to some pretty meaningful commentary on the xenophobic nature of our world, but <em>Elemental </em>spends so much time indulging in visual spectacle and world-building that it loses the plot. It’s an enjoyable film whose tale is sometimes frustratingly told, but I suppose that can sometimes happen when you dress up real-world issues in a world that is so detached from our own it requires several asides to explain how its society works. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Onward </em>is a mostly fine movie saved by a really excellent ending. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland playing the elven brother duo of Barley and Ian is the most 2020-ass casting Pixar could’ve concocted. They basically play themselves as they go on a magical road trip to try and complete a spell that will let them spend a day with their deceased father. Like many of Pixar’s movies, <em>Onward </em>spends a lot of time showcasing its original setting, but it’s a fun enough romp until its incredibly affecting ending in which Holland’s character realizes that he hasn’t been lacking a father figure because his big brother stepped the fuck up. It ends with a poignant moment in which Pratt’s character gets to speak briefly with his revived father before the spell wears off, but the audience is kept at a distance, unable to hear the words exchanged. That moment is for Barley, and Ian is our protagonist, so we’re stuck in his perspective. <em>Onward </em>denies the audience catharsis when it counts and for that, it gets a sizable bump on this list. — KS</p></div><div><p>If you made a list of “movies that don’t need to exist,” <em>Toy Story 4 </em>would belong near the top. But is it bad? Nah, it’s pretty good, to be honest. The most unnecessary film in Pixar’s catalog answers the question of why Annie Potts’ Bo Peep was missing from the stellar third film, and it allows Tom Hanks’s Woody to reflect a little more on what he wants out of life beyond his job of being a toy. This comes at the expense of pretty much every other old character in the film, but as a love story between two toys who were nearly separated by fate and a lack of work/life balance? It could have been worse. And it was a major box office success, so we’ll get a fifth one and continue to trample on <em>Toy Story 3</em>’s ending. Hurray. — KS</p></div><div><p>Pixar’s latest film is for the weird kids who hyperfixate. <em>Elio</em>’s story of an outcast child who has lost everyone who’s important to him and is seeking anyone, anywhere who might accept him, is the science fiction isekai every little kid wishing for friends imagines growing up. The titular orphan dreams of leaving Earth for the stars to find friends and family beyond this floating rock. Through a series of happy coincidences he manages to make his way to a galactic community that loves him, albeit under a guise of being Earth’s leader and representative, and his attempts to maintain the facade lead to some life-threatening antics. But as he finds his people in space, he grows to appreciate what he’s left behind. It’s a heartwarming story about a character who’s making the best of what he’s got, even as a child who has endured more than he should have had to at such a young age. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Monsters University </em>doesn’t hit as hard as the original, but it’s one of Pixar’s best straight-up comedies. The prequel landed while I was in college, and the barrage of nonstop hilarious university gags hit hard. That universal experience every college student has when they go to a school with big dreams makes the movie surprisingly timeless. Yeah, it’ll entertain kids, but the target audience feels like it’s actually college graduates who are distanced enough from the hazing and hokey school spirit to be able to laugh at it. It’s one of the most fun romps Pixar’s put on the big screen and is surprisingly underrated. — KS</p></div><div><p>Almost nothing in <em>Inside Out 2 </em>is as memorable as the best moments of the original. However, the franchise’s core concept of personifying every complex thought pattern the human brain experiences is still one of Pixar’s most interesting premises. Hence, it still had the juice for a sequel. Riley’s emotions are going into overdrive as she enters adolescence. Thus, her entire mindspace is changing with new characters, new personifications of thought, and ultimately an incredibly powerful representation of an anxiety attack within the visual language of these films. Like <em>Toy Story 4</em>, we probably didn’t need it, but it does well enough as a continuation of the original’s excellent concept. — KS</p></div><div><p>Pixar’s second film is often forgotten because its release was sandwiched between those of the first two <em>Toy Story </em>movies, but <em>A Bug’s Life </em>remains remarkably prescient nearly 30 years later. The film is a story of class issues, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLbWnJGlyMU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speech from villain Hopper (who’s unfortunately voiced by Kevin Spacey) </a></span>about how the ants may be weak on their own, but when united, they would easily overthrow the grasshopper gang is still a remarkably succinct reminder that while the ruling class may hold power, the working class could rise up and seize it for themselves. <em>A Bug’s Life </em>was pretty beloved at the time, but it feels even more important now. While it’s not considered Pixar’s most foundational work, it’s easily one of its most profound. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Toy Story 2 </em>had quite the legacy to live up to after the original film launched to universal praise, but the sequel delivered, riffing on the initial premise of “what if toys were sentient” by exploring new dreams, horrors, and heartbreak for the toys that we love as children but leave behind as we grow up. It’s particularly impressive how well <em>Toy Story 2 </em>ended up coming together considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thenextweb.com/news/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thenextweb.com/news/how-pixars-toy-story-2-was-deleted-twice-once-by-technology-and-again-for-its-own-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its reported development woes</a></span>, but Pixar managed to pull it off. — KS</p></div><div><p>I think the best Pixar movies are the ones that take a simple concept and dig in to create something both unique and memorable. <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> is a great example of this type of Pixar flick. Most kids have experienced the terror of thinking, no, <em>believing</em>, that a monster is hiding in their closet or living under their bed. <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> goes, “Yeah, there were monsters in your closet, and they live in their own world and use closet doors as magical portals to show up, scare you, and suck a bit of your energy away in the process to keep their TVs and cars running.” It’s such a great idea that it would have worked with any actors voicing the main characters of Mike and Sully. But Pixar brought in the always great John Goodman and equally talented Billy Crystal to bring these two monster pals to life in what is both a workplace comedy and a weird sci-fi comedy romp. It really only misses the top 10 because Pixar has made so many great films that really good movies can still land in the middle of the pack. - Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Toy Story </em>isn’t just important and foundational within Pixar’s catalog; it’s one of the most important movies in animation history. Looking back on it after 30 years, the film is surprisingly dark. The life and times of a toy on the verge of being forgotten are kind of harrowing when you think about it. <em>Toy Story </em>manages to expertly blend genres of comedy, horror, and drama, all within a premise that was incredibly novel in 1995. It was such a successful execution that it informed decades of Pixar’s output. The lessons the studio learned here haven’t worked out every time, but <em>Toy Story </em>paved the way for the next three decades of animation both in and out of Pixar, and even if it doesn’t look as mind-blowing as it once did, it still holds up pretty damn well. — KS</p></div><div><p><em>Turning Red </em>feels like Pixar’s second shot at exploring themes it first broached with <em>Brave</em>, but<em> </em>without the same stumbles that made the 2012 film fall short. The movie stars a teenage Chinese-Canadian girl named Mei who discovers that once they reach puberty, members of her family are cursed to turn into giant, mystical red pandas when they have giant bursts of emotion. When your relationship with your mother is already tense enough for all the normal reasons teenagers go through, adding something as disruptive as an uncontrollable transformation into a giant fluffball is only going to make things more challenging. <em>Turning Red </em>succeeds in exploring these tumultous child/parent relationships because its underlying message isn’t “do what your parents tell you”; rather, it explores the fact that even the most perfectionist of parents are still growing and trying to figure things out themselves. Mei’s mother is dealing with her own traumas while trying her best to help her daughter not make the same mistakes she did, and the film wisely recognizes that no parent or child is beyond learning something new from the other. — KS</p></div><div><p>If <em>Luca </em>had been released theatrically rather than shoved onto Disney+ during the height of the covid-19 pandemic, I still don’t think it would have been the cultural event some of Pixar’s best films have been. It’s an understated story of friendship and being true to yourself whose main characters happen to be sea monsters who just want to be like everyone else. Even with that sea monster element, <em>Luca </em>is one of the most human stories Pixar’s written. It isn’t so fixated on the elaborate worldbuilding that often bogs down the studio’s stories, and instead its more focused fantasy elements are an extension of its characters’ humanity, rather than a constant distraction that pulls us away from the story it wants to tell. <em>Luca</em> represents one of Pixar’s most effective uses of an otherworldly element to talk about the real world. Sure, it’s no <em>Incredibles</em>-level epic or <em>Coco</em>-level tearjerker, but it is one of Pixar’s most consistently heartwarming works. It’s also pretty cool that Pixar artist Kenna Jean Harris <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/sourgrapelaffytaffy/738540103751892992/luca-alberto-fanart-from-co-director-kenna-jean&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tumblr.com/sourgrapelaffytaffy/738540103751892992/luca-alberto-fanart-from-co-director-kenna-jean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gave us unsanctioned fan art</a></span> confirming we weren’t all crazy for believing Luca and Alberto would grow up to be more than friends. — KS</p></div><div><p>A rat that controls a person by hiding under their chef’s hat and pulling their hair. That’s a weird concept for a film. Even weirder, the rat is smart and loves cooking, despite his fellow brethren being trash-eating animals. And even weirder, this all comes together to deliver one of Pixar’s best original films. The idea that anyone can cook, that anyone can do more than they think, is a nice message that is threaded throughout the film. If you love food and cooking, you need to find some time to watch <em>Ratatouille</em>. If you like movies that deal with critics, yeah, watch this flick. And if you like Patton Oswalt, who voices the main rat Remy, you should watch this movie, too. Really, everyone should watch <em>Ratatouille</em>. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>If we were just ranking openings, <em>Up </em>would not only be at the top of this list, it would probably rank pretty high in a list of best film openings of the 21st century. <em>Up </em>is a kind of messy film to try and sum up because it has so many disparate elements that, out of context, sound like they’re coming from multiple unrelated films rather than a singular cohesive work. But its opening, in which we watch married couple Carl and Ellie grow old together, could be a short film on its own. Ellie’s passing is the spark that ignites her husband’s grief-driven adventure to move their marital home, by way of thousands of balloons, to the remote Paradise Falls waterfall in South America, and the screenplay provides a masterclass in what it means for a character to “haunt the narrative.” The minutiae of how Carl treks toward his destination are entertaining and gave us some of the most memorable characters in Pixar history, like the speaking golden retriever Dug, so we can forgive it being a bit messy en route to its powerful finale in which Carl, with Ellie’s posthumous blessing, is able to move forward and past their old dreams. Ah, fuck, I got choked up thinking about it. Anyway, <em>Up </em>good. — KS</p></div><div><p>When you open a movie with a fish losing all but one child to a barracuda attack, you immediately set the stakes for that baby fish’s safety. And when Nemo, the sole survivor of the attack, is captured by scuba divers, his father Marlin ends up going on an ocean-spanning journey to find his son and bring him home. <em>Finding Nemo </em>manages to weave Marlin’s trauma into a story that somehow manages to be an absolute hoot while never diminishing what the guy has been through. Marlin plays the straight man to some of Pixar’s most iconic characters, many of whom have had a long-lasting impact, such as the amnesiac Dory, who would go on to get her own movie 13 years later, Bruce the pacifist(?) shark, and Crush, the surfer dude turtle who helps them along the way. Meanwhile, Nemo is taken under the fin by several other captive fish in a dentist’s office, and they’re all tied up in their own trauma after being captured themselves. <em>Finding Nemo </em>is a story of fish people trying to make the most of the life they’ve been given while also being desperate to hold onto it by any means necessary. But as Marlin comes to learn, if you love something, you let it go. It will come back if you stop holding on so hard. — KS</p></div><div><p>You can’t say “Take her to the moon for me” to most Pixar fans without them either falling to their knees and sobbing or shoving you away and telling you to shut the fuck up. <em>Inside Out</em>’s emotionally devastating moments are among the most memorable in Pixar’s portfolio, but the film also arguably marks Pixar’s most clever and effective use of the “secret life of X” formula that it’s been utilizing since the original <em>Toy Story</em>. The 2015 film follows a cast of “emotions” inside a young girl’s head who are doing the best they can to help her navigate this beautiful, sometimes miserable thing we call life. If you were to cut out all of the segments following the emotions, you’d still get an emotionally earnest story of a child struggling with the world around her. But what makes <em>Inside Out </em>so good is how it has a visual concept for just about every dumb thought and struggle we have in our heads. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQZ8svdqp0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpQZ8svdqp0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagination Land</a></span> is a dumping ground for every creative or silly daydream you’ve ever had, your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPoKJ3ni4Ew&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPoKJ3ni4Ew" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">train of thought</a></span> is a literal locomotive, and when you forget something, it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZNHcCfwWw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3ZNHcCfwWw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">disappears into a void</a></span>, never to be seen again. <em>Inside Out </em>is full of so many brilliant nods like this that it somehow manages to build an incredible sense of place inside the human brain. — KS</p></div><div><p>The higher we get on this list, the more I realize that the best movies in Pixar’s line-up have some major tearjerker moments. There probably isn’t one quite as well-known as <em>Toy Story 3</em>’s finale, but even if we didn’t all collectively lose it watching Woody, Buzz, and the rest of their toy pals nearly accept their death as they went down an incinerator, <em>Toy Story 3 </em>is still an incredible film that tugs at the heartstrings of all the kids who grew up alongside Andy and his toys. Pushing aside <em>Toy Story 4</em>’s existence with all our might, <em>Toy Story 3</em> was a perfect closer to the story Pixar began in the ‘90s. Andy has grown up, and all his childhood toys are locked up in storage. Everyone who has ever formed an overly sentimental attachment to a toy knows what it’s like to finally get rid of them or store them somewhere out of sight. Yeah, you feel like you’re too grown up for them, but those are your childhood memories given tangible form. To store them means that the carefree era in your life is over, and maybe another kid could love those toys the way you did. Letting go of that childlike bliss is never easy, and when <em>Toy Story 3 </em>premiered in 2010, a lot of long-time fans who’d grown up with the films were now old enough to be dealing with this same inner struggle. For those of us in that group, it was gut-wrenching to watch, and for that same reason, it was a perfect ending. If only it actually had been the conclusion. — KS</p></div><div><p>It’s been 17 years since Pixar released its post-apocalyptic romance film, and <em>WALL-E</em> feels more apt than ever. The movie’s titular little robot hero starts the movie wandering a desecrated Earth and trying to clean up the mess humanity left behind. Humans have completely abandoned the planet as it became uninhabitable for all the reasons environmentalists are still warning us about today. Corporate interests are prioritized over the health of the planet, and eventually, that will catch up to all of us who aren’t even benefiting from it in the short term. <em>WALL-E</em>’s spacefaring robot romance is full of adorable moments and humorous takes on the apocalypse and is still gorgeous to look at nearly 20 years later, but perhaps what keeps it resonating after all this time is the knowledge that we are still barreling toward its dystopian future. But at the center of its story is a hope that not all is lost, and that is a message that carries just as much weight. — KS</p></div><div><p>When I saw <em>Coco </em>in a theater, at the very end, I looked around and saw everyone tearing up and crying. Kids, adults, elderly people, that weirdo with two sodas for himself. Everyone was crying at a quiet moment between a young boy and his grandma. A moment where, thanks to music and surviving an otherworldly adventure through the afterlife, that boy is able to connect to his grandma one more time and make her smile. He sings her a song that was always meant for her, from someone she loved a lot. It proves that Pixar, more than most other studios, understands that a good family movie doesn’t have to be fart jokes and pop songs. Instead, you can tell a truly heartwarming story about a young Mexican boy trying to find his place in the world and landing back at home happier than ever, with a family who now understands him better. And if you do it well enough, people will cry while two totally CG characters interact. — ZZ</p></div><div><p>In 2025, Marvel is finally making an MCU <em>Fantastic Four </em>film. It looks cool. But nothing will beat the best <em>Fantastic Four</em> movie ever made: <em>The Incredbiles</em>. In fact, this 2004 animated adventure about a family of superheroes hiding their powers and then working together to save the day might just be one of the best comic book movies ever made. And ironically, it’s not based on an actual comic book.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons<em> The Incredibles </em>works so well. It has a unique art style that blends the vibes of golden age superheroes with a retro-futuristic world. It tells a story that, for all its twists and turns, is incredibly (see what I did there…) relatable. Bob Parr, the movie’s knock-off Superman, is struggling with his age and feeling like he’s stuck in a rut. Meanwhile, his children are struggling with their powers while also dealing with all the problems that come with growing up. And finally, Helen Parr—who has the ability to stretch—is trying to keep everything together while wondering if Bob has found someone new and more exciting.</p><p>Keep in mind, this is a movie primarily designed for kids and families about colorful superheroes. So Pixar and director Brad Bird have to <em>very </em>carefully balance how much they lean into these themes while still keeping things mostly lighthearted and fun. Somehow, they pulled it off. The end result? <em>The Incredibles</em> is not only Pixar’s best movie, but one of the best Disney movies ever made, and arguably a true classic that will be talked about and watched decades from now. Oh, and Disney: Please don’t do a live-action remake. Please. — ZZ</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148]]></content:encoded>

Some of the phrases being thrown around include “blink or you’ll miss it,” “instant,” and “the fastest load times I’ve ever seen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima’s secret to the unbelievable load times in Death Stranding 2 has yet to be revealed, but one popular X/Twitter post has a theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Okay but actually how the f**k,” user <a href="https://x.com/RealBugAubrey/status/1937501463661437029" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealBugAubrey</a> said. “Either everyone else is not so secretly terrible at their job or Kojima Productions is making deals with spirits and demons.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1937298687602172194?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It’s been mentioned already but the load times in Death Stranding 2 are unbelievably fast, like the fastest I’ve ever seen in any game ever.</p><p>Genuinely how did they do this?? <a href="https://t.co/GmxbaF3ijH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GmxbaF3ijH</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1938203860490981644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The essentially non-existent Death Stranding 2 load times are only impressive because so many other games on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S still feature loading screens that can last for up 30 seconds or even minutes long. Even without sitting down for a side-by-side comparison, many believe Death Stranding 2 might feature the most impressive load times for a game of this caliber ever. However, there are a few other shining examples that players believe might give Sam Porter Bridges a run for his money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac Games’ 2023 title, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a>, famously features similarly fast loading times on PS5, with players able to teleport to any location in New York City. All it takes is holding a button, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-dev-insomniac-confirms-fast-travel-hold-to-confirm-prompt-does-not-hide-a-load"><u>the developer has clarified doesn’t hide its own secret loading function</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the Xbox side of things is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which many fans have noted features a main menu screen that is the actual game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Right on par with Indiana Jones new game - both seem to load the actual save file in the background as it boots up, so selecting to continue just essentially reveals the game in progress," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1lji189/comment/mzkydml/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user</a> said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="es" dir="ltr">Indiana Jones: <a href="https://t.co/DOBj7maJk4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/DOBj7maJk4</a> <a href="https://t.co/LSSQ269mI2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LSSQ269mI2</a></p>— Luiz (@diasluizzz) <a href="https://twitter.com/diasluizzz/status/1937547426757525565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s sparked some debate among those seeking to defend their favorite video game, but one thing is clear: many major games are starting to ditch loading screens altogether. We’ll have to wait and see just how long it takes before loading screens vanish from most games entirely.
